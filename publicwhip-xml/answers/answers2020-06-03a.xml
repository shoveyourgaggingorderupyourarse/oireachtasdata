    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-06-03a.13.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1619" speakername="Paul Kehoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020060300105#WRB01000"><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the United Nations Secretary General,  as part of the UN&rsquo;s response to the global Covid pandemic, directed on 5 April last, the suspension of all rotations and leave for military personnel serving in UN missions until 30 June, effective immediately. </p>  <p>  The UN directed that only in certain very limited and extenuating circumstances would any exemption be allowed and has recently agreed to an exemption of the suspension for Ireland which will allow Ireland to rotate its full contingent to UNIFIL during the UN moratorium.  The first rotation has now been confirmed by the UN for 21 June and the second for 29 June.</p>  <p>  The confirmed dates have been communicated by the military authorities to Defence Forces personnel coming home and those going out to Lebanon to commence their deployment. As the dates for the rotations have now been confirmed, I hope that this will now ease the impact of the delayed rotations on families.    </p>  <p>  At a general level, unlike some other national armed forces, the Defence Forces have no restrictions with regard to the assignment of men or women to the full range of operational and administrative duties. Both men and women, therefore, play a full and meaningful role in all aspects of Defence Forces operations at home and overseas on peacekeeping missions.</p>  <p>  In normal circumstances and prior to the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, a number of family friendly overseas appointments for commissioned and enlisted personnel were introduced, where the normal 6-month tour of duty could  be &lsquo;shared&rsquo; with another member of the Defence Forces resulting in a 3-month deployment. </p>  <p>  The impact of Covid 19 on future rotations planned for UNIFIL, has being examined by my Department and the Defence Forces. While every effort will be made to ensure that personnel in such family-friendly appointments will rotate home following their tour of duty, this cannot be guaranteed. Depending on the circumstances presented at the time, a possibility exists that such personnel may be required to serve a full tour of duty with the remainder of their unit. </p>  <p>  I am advised by the Military Authorities that personnel, due to deploy in such appointments with the 116 Inf Bn, were notified of this condition during pre-deployment training, and were afforded the opportunity to withdraw from the tour. </p>  <p>  I will be keeping the matter under review in light of the evolving administrative and operational challenges presented by the pandemic.</p></reply>

The General Secretary, ICTU, wrote to me on 20 September 2019, advising that ICTU had agreed in principle to PDFORRAs application for associate membership, subject to the conclusions of ongoing discussions with the Department of Defence on the matter.</p>  <p>  The Department of Defence wrote to PDFORRA on 11 December 2019, setting out possible conditions of affiliation and possible assurances required.  Pursuant to this letter, a subsequent meeting was held with PDFORRA and ICTU on 10 January 2020.  </p>  <p>  At that meeting  PDFORRA undertook, with the assistance of ICTU, to provide a response in writing to the matters discussed at that meeting, which will assist me in considering the matter. I am awaiting a reply in order to progress this matter.</p></reply>

The terms and conditions, for this scheme are available on the Defence Forces website, military.ie. </p>  <p>   The scheme will allow for initial re-enlistment for a minimum of six months and up to 3 years. The duration of the re-enlistment offered will be dependent on the vacancies that exist. I can confirm that this scheme currently remains open for application.  </p>  <p>  The re-enlistment of former personnel with the relevant skills and experience was one of the many actions being pursued to address the skill shortages in the PDF. It is a medium to long term initiative which pre-dates the COVID crisis, but which also facilitates the COVID response.</p>  <p>  Under the terms and conditions, individuals who wish to re-enlist will serve for a specific period and for a specific purpose which will involve the use of a particular skill or area of expertise which cannot currently be met through the use of existing military resources. In addition, those who re-enlist will do so at the rank and salary point on which they left and will be required to meet a range of general eligibility criteria, including medical and physical fitness to ensure they are capable of performing normal military duties. </p>  <p>  Since the announcement of the Scheme, I am delighted to report that over 600 applications have been received, with some 500 having gone forward for further assessment by the Chief of Staff. The military authorities are assessing the applications and interviews are underway. I understand that the Chief of Staff will shortly be submitting for my approval, initial recommendations on those who should be re-enlisted.</p></reply>

Within the European Union, our citizens can often access supports which are similar to those provided in Ireland.

Any financial assistance available generally depends on a number of factors, including whether the citizen is resident and employed in the country. </p>  <p>  Welfare supports available to Irish citizens abroad outside the EU can be significantly lower, and these vary greatly from country to country. </p>  <p>  In the context of COVID-19, my Department has responded to an unprecedented demand for assistance from our citizens overseas.

This has led to a large decrease in the number of passport applications received by the Passport Service, including a decrease in applications received from applicants.</p>  <p>  In response to this situation, the Passport Service is operating an essential, emergency service at this time. This has allowed us to both reassign staff to our consular services assisting our citizens abroad and redeploy staff to critical areas including contact tracing for the HSE and COVID-19 payments for Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, all critical services at this time.</p>  <p>  The Passport Service continues to process emergency passports for our citizens at home and abroad. Almost 350 passports have issued to our citizens both at home and abroad in response to urgent requests. Our webchat service and a dedicated travel emergency mailbox continue to operate through which we can be contacted in such circumstances. In addition, our phones lines have answered over 16,000 calls from Irish citizens overseas as part of the Department&rsquo;s response to the COVID-19 crisis.</p>  <p>  The Passport Service staff cannot work remotely, they must be on site in order to process passport applications. This is to protect the personal data of the applicant and the integrity of the Irish Passport System.</p>  <p>  The Global Irish Services Division of the Department is now focused on returning to a point when we can provide a full passport service. We will endeavour to do so as quickly as possible, while providing our staff with a safe working environment and in line with the Government&rsquo;s Roadmap to reopen Ireland&rsquo;s economy and society. The protection of staff is our first priority but we also recognise that providing passports is an essential public service. I encourage Deputies to stay in contact with my office for updates in relation to the Passport Service.</p></reply>

This includes in relation to freedom of expression and assembly, arbitrary arrest, and torture in detention. Human rights issues therefore continue to constitute an important part of Ireland's engagement and dialogue with Iran.</p>  <p>  I am aware of the two cases raised, and note with concern that there are reports that the persons in question have been tortured. Ireland urges all States to safeguard the human rights of prisoners and detainees as set out in the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, also known as the Mandela rules.</p>  <p>  Respect for human rights is an integral part of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy, and we consistently seek to raise our concerns on human rights issues through the most appropriate and effective channels. Our active participation at the UN Human Rights Council is very important in that regard, and Ireland has regularly raised the case of human rights in Iran at that forum.</p>  <p>  At the most recent Universal Periodic Review of Iran&rsquo;s human rights record at the Human Rights Council in November 2019, Ireland raised concern about the continued harassment, arrest, and arbitrary detention of human rights defenders in Iran, and called on the Iranian Government to release all detainees, who have been imprisoned solely for exercising their rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly as guaranteed under the ICCPR. </p>  <p>  Human rights concerns are also discussed in Ireland&rsquo;s bilateral engagement with Iran, and I have raised the need to have an open dialogue on the subject with the Iranian Ambassador. Senior officials in my Department raised our concerns about Iran&rsquo;s human rights violations directly with their counterparts in Tehran in February 2020, urging Iran to allow the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Iran to visit the country.</p>  <p>  The EU consistently pursues human rights issues with Iran, including the right to due process for all, as part of our overall engagement with Iran.  Since 2011, the EU has also had in place restrictive measures related to violations of human rights, which both list individuals and entities responsible for grave human rights violations, including many responsible for violations of rights of detainees; and ban the export to Iran of equipment which might be used for internal repression and of equipment for monitoring telecommunications.</p>  <p>  Ireland and the EU will continue to monitor developments in Iran, and to call on the Iranian Government to make progress in relation to human rights, both in direct contacts with Iranian officials, and at international level, including at the Human Rights Council, whenever opportunities arise.</p></reply>

This has led to a large decrease in the number of passport applications received by the Passport Service, including a decrease in applications received from applicants.</p>  <p>  In response to this situation, the Passport Service is operating an essential, emergency service at this time. This has allowed us to both reassign staff to our consular services assisting our citizens abroad and redeploy staff to critical areas including contact tracing for the HSE and COVID-19 payments for Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, all critical services at this time.</p>  <p>  The Passport Service continues to process emergency passports for our citizens at home and abroad. Almost 350 passports have issued to our citizens both at home and abroad in response to urgent requests. Our webchat service and a dedicated travel emergency mailbox continue to operate through which we can be contacted in such circumstances. In addition, our phones lines have answered over 16,000 calls from Irish citizens overseas as part of the Department&rsquo;s response to the COVID-19 crisis.</p>  <p>  The Passport Service staff cannot work remotely, they must be on site in order to process passport applications. This is to protect the personal data of the applicant and the integrity of the Irish Passport System.</p>  <p>  The Global Irish Services Division of the Department is now focused on returning to a point when we can provide a full passport service. We will endeavour to do so as quickly as possible, while providing our staff with a safe working environment and in line with the Government&rsquo;s Roadmap to reopen Ireland&rsquo;s economy and society. The protection of staff is our first priority but we also recognise that providing passports is an essential public service. I encourage Deputies to stay in contact with my office for updates in relation to the Passport Service.</p>  <p>  An officer from the Passport Service has spoken directly to the person in question regarding their application.</p></reply>

The Taoiseach, my cabinet colleagues and I take every opportunity to engage with our EU partners to advance Ireland&rsquo;s priorities in matters arising from the UK's withdrawal from the EU, including the EU-UK future partnership negotiations, implementation of the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland, and preparations for the end of the transition period.</p>  <p>  My engagement with key interlocutors on Brexit issues has continued in recent months, including recent contacts with EU Chief Negotiator Michel Barnier,  and with a range of EU Foreign Ministers.  I have also spoken with Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Michael Gove, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, and Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Brandon Lewis. This is in addition to the regular contact maintained between the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance, and the Minister of State for European Affairs, with their counterparts across the EU and in the UK.</p>  <p>  Officials from across Government are also continuing their work to make sure that Ireland&rsquo;s voice is heard at the Future Partnership negotiations in line with the EU&rsquo;s negotiating mandate and that work to implement the Protocol on Ireland / Northern Ireland is taken forward.  Ireland has also participated, as part of the EU delegation, in the EU-UK Joint Committee and in Specialised Committees established under the Withdrawal Agreement, notably the Specialised Committee on the Implementation of the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  Protecting Ireland&rsquo;s interests during this phase will require a continued whole of Government effort underpinned by the same coherent, cohesive approach that has characterised our Brexit strategy from the start. We continue to work with the Taskforce and the Commission, our EU partners, and stakeholders across this island, to this end.</p></reply>

They engage with US officials on immigration issues on an ongoing basis, including with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Our Mission network also works closely with the Coalition of Irish Immigration Centres in the US, which, together with its member organisations, provides support and information to vulnerable Irish and the undocumented.</p>  <p>  The Coalition and its member organisations receive significant annual funding through the Government&rsquo;s Emigrant Support Programme for their work. In 2019 alone, over &euro;3m ($3.7m) was allocated to 76 organisations across the US, including those that provide frontline welfare assistance to Irish citizens. Furthermore, in response to the pandemic, a dedicated COVID-19 Response Fund for Irish Communities Abroad has been set up within my Department to help these organisations meet the needs of those who have recently been made particularly vulnerable. Earlier this month I met virtually with several organisations in New York who, with the assistance of this fund, are providing much needed emergency support to Irish communities.</p>  <p>  This Government has also focused on securing future pathways for immigration, primarily through the E3 Visa Bill, which has been passed in the House of Representatives and is currently before the Senate. If passed, this could open up approx. 4,000 US visas per year to Irish graduates. This approach complements Government support to the undocumented Irish living in the US.</p></reply>

The most recent statement, made on 29 May, expresses our grave concern at the decision and its conformity with the Sino-British Joint Declaration of 1984 and the Hong Kong Basic Law.

As of 29 May 2020, over 57,400 employers have registered with Revenue for the TWSS, over 501,500 employees have received at least one payment under the scheme and the cumulative value of payments made to employers is &euro;1.29 billion.</p>  <p>  Last Friday I announced an important change to the TWSS to deal with the issue of those returning from maternity or adoptive leave which was raised by various parties and interest groups.</p>  <p>  Officials had been looking at how it might be possible to address the issue in a way that ensures consistent treatment with other employees who were on the payroll in January and February, whose salaries were taken into account in determining TWSS payments for employers.</p>  <p>  Following Government approval, a change to the TWSS will be made as an exceptional measure to accommodate the salaries of those who have returned to work after a period of maternity or adoptive leave who consequentially were not on the payroll during the relevant period.</p>  <p>  The amendment will be legislated for later in the year as part of the usual Finance Bill 2020 process but in the interim, Revenue has agreed that this provision will be implemented from 26 March, where applicable.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that this change addresses the matter raised and ensures appropriate operation of the TWSS in recognition of the unique circumstances applying to those returning to work after a period of maternity or adoptive leave by allowing for commensurate treatment with other employees who were on the payroll on 29 February.</p>  <p>  Further details of how the measure will operate will be published by Revenue shortly, but I would highlight that the manual process being adopted will require input from employers so I would encourage them to contact Revenue when it is launched to allow for payments to be processed as quickly as possible.</p></reply>

I have considerable sympathy for such policyholders, however the Deputy should note that neither I, nor the Central Bank, have any influence over the pricing of insurance products, nor can we compel any insurer operating in the Irish market to provide cover, as this is a commercial matter for insurers.  This position is reinforced by the EU Single Market framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive) which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules, which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.</p><p>Notwithstanding the above, my officials and I have had extensive engagement with the insurance industry over insurance cover and reliefs for businesses during the COVID-19 emergency. The outcome of this engagement is an agreement that I announced on 10 April whereby most of the key insurers in the Irish market - namely Allianz, AIG, AXA, FBD, Liberty Insurance, RSA, Travelers Insurance and Zurich - will ensure that a number of common forbearance measures are available to their business customers. It should be noted that this is a voluntary agreement, but my views are that the other major insurers in the Irish market should also sign up to this commitment.</p><p>The common measures included in the agreement are outlined below:</p><p><b>Forbearance </b></p><p>- Insurers will reduce premiums for business customers to reflect reduced level of exposure as a result of COVID-19 restrictions for Employer Liability/ Public Liability and Commercial Motor.</p><p>-  Insurers will allow up to 28 days after renewal for payment.</p><p><b>Business Premises</b></p><p>- Insurers will maintain cover for unoccupied commercial buildings/ premises not in use due to COVID-19 restriction (for a maximum of 90 days). Appropriate supervision and security of the premises is required.  </p><p>- Insurers will support requests for a change of property use during the crisis.</p><p>While I believe that the above agreement should assist many businesses in relation to their insurance, this will only happen if insurers deliver upon their commitments. Therefore, I asked Insurance Ireland to put in place a mechanism which provides proof of delivery.  My Department received the first &ldquo;Activity Report&rdquo; on this issue from Insurance Ireland on 25 May. This Report shows that in the period 23 March to 4 May, Insurance Ireland members processed 4,093 forbearance requests for business customers worth a total of &euro;5,242,349. I have asked my officials to seek more detailed information from Insurance Ireland on the nature of the forbearance being offered. It should also be noted that my Department is in regular touch with the Alliance for Insurance Reform on these and other insurance matters.</p><p>The Deputy should be aware that the Central Bank has written to insurance firms setting out their expectations that insurance firms should take account of the difficult and challenging situation in which many customers find themselves. The Bank has also stated that, as a matter of urgency, firms should develop consumer-centric solutions to the handling of insurance payment breaks and policy rebates in light of the COVID-19 emergency.</p><p>I have set out already to the House that I strongly believe that insurers should treat their customers honestly, fairly and professionally and in line with the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code.  However, neither the Central Bank nor I have any role in adjudicating on matters such as price increases nor other issues such as complaints. I encourage consumers to engage directly with their broker or insurer regarding forbearance measures and other reliefs.  If there continues to be a disagreement between an insurer and a policyholder, then the appropriate channels for resolving them must be followed i.e. through use of a firm&rsquo;s internal complaint process or recourse to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman or litigation.</p><p>Finally, I would like to assure the Deputy that my Department will continue to be as pro-active as it can be on these issues and will continue to liaise with the Central Bank and Insurance Ireland on an ongoing basis. </p></reply>

This scheme provides an exemption from benefit-in-kind where an employer purchases a bicycle and associated safety equipment up to a maximum of &euro;1,000 for an employee to use, in whole or in part, to travel to work. Safety equipment includes helmets, lights, bells, mirrors and locks but does not include child seats or trailers.</p><p>The scheme applies to pedal cycles and pedelecs. A &ldquo;pedal cycle&rdquo; means a bicycle or tricycle which is intended or adapted for propulsion solely by the physical exertions of a person seated thereon. A &ldquo;pedelec&rdquo; means a bicycle or tricycle which is equipped with an electric motor (with a maximum continuous rated power of 0.25 kilowatts) which cuts out when a speed of 25 kilometres per hour is reached, or sooner if the cyclist stops pedalling the bicycle or tricycle.  </p><p>It is assumed that the reference to &ldquo;cargo bikes&rdquo; by the Deputy means a bicycle specifically designed to carry a load. Such a bicycle would qualify under the cycle to work scheme, assuming all of the required conditions are satisfied.</p><p>Benefit-in-kind is a charge to tax that applies where an employer provides an employee with a benefit such as a bicycle, car or accommodation. As stated above, an exemption from benefit-in-kind applies in relation to the cycle to work scheme, provided the required conditions are met. However, where an employment does not exist, for example, in the case of students, individuals in receipt of social welfare payments or unpaid volunteers, such individuals can&rsquo;t qualify for the scheme.</p><p>Further information on the cycle to work scheme can be found on Revenue&rsquo;s website, available at <i></i>.</p><p>In relation to the amount of applications received, the scheme operates on a self-administration basis, and relief is automatically available provided the employer is satisfied that the conditions of their particular scheme meet the requirements of the legislation.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-06-03a.141.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020060300106#WRC06500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 47 and 62 together.</p>  <p>  The Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) is provided for in section 28 of the recently enacted Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020.  In the context of the compelling need for immediate implementation of the TWSS, the scheme necessarily had to build on data returned to Revenue through its real-time PAYE system.  </p>  <p>  The key prescribed conditions of the scheme are that &ndash; </p>  <p>  - the business is suffering significant negative  economic impact due to the pandemic and is unable to pay normal wages to employees, but wishes to continue to employ the employees and is making best efforts to continue to pay some wages to the employees, </p>  <p>  - the employees were on the payroll at 29 February 2020, and </p>  <p>  - the employer had fulfilled its PAYE reporting obligations for February 2020 before, in general, 15 March 2020, but recently extended to before the 1 April 2020.</p>  <p>  The latter two conditions were particularly designed with a view to preventing abuse of the scheme.  </p>  <p>  The amount of the temporary wage subsidy payable in relation to eligible employees is based on the average net weekly pay reported for January and February 2020 for each employee.  </p>  <p>  I clarified in my letter of 16 April 2020 to Revenue, which set out my determinations of the amounts of wage subsidy to be payable in relation to different classes of employees, that for the purposes of the operation of the TWSS, the Average Revenue Net Weekly Pay is the employee&rsquo;s average net weekly pay for January and February 2020 based on the payroll submissions made by the employer concerned to Revenue.  It is a matter for each employer concerned to decide what amount of normal wages should be paid to employees in addition to the wage subsidy amounts, and whether to try match the employees&rsquo; previous gross or net pay.  Ultimately, what employees are most concerned about is how near the aggregate of the wage subsidy amount plus whatever amount of normal wages is being paid net to them by employers is to their normal take home pay.</p>  <p>  Revenue has confirmed that it has now implemented the revised rates of wage subsidy as determined by me on 16 April 2020, with the remainder to be implemented shortly. The revised rates apply as respects payroll notifications received by Revenue on or after 4 May 2020 in respect of payroll runs to be made on or after that date. The revised rate now implemented include:</p>  <p>  the 85% subsidy rate for employees whose average net weekly pay does not exceed &euro;412,</p>  <p>  - non-tapering of the 85% subsidy where an employer contribution of more than 15% of the employees net weekly pay results in a salary payment of up to &euro;350 per week,</p>  <p>  - the flat rate subsidy of up to &euro;350 for employees whose average net weekly pay is more than &euro;412 but less than &euro;500,</p>  <p>  - the 70% subsidy rate for employees whose average net weekly pay is more than &euro;500 but less than &euro;586, with a maximum subsidy of &euro;410 applying,</p>  <p>  - a maximum payment of &euro;350 per week for employees whose average net weekly pay is greater than &euro;586 per week but not more than &euro;960 per week, subject to specific tapering reductions based on the employer contribution to the net weekly earnings. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the TWSS is operated in real-time by employers through the normal payroll process. To ensure that subsidy amounts are paid to employees on a timely basis as part of the relevant payroll run, it is necessary to calculate the amount of the subsidy due to an employee based on the employee&rsquo;s gross pay. This is necessary as an employee&rsquo;s net pay cannot be fully determined before the actual payroll is run. Revenue is aware that, in effect, this means that for some employees where the employer pays between (net weekly) &euro;586 and &euro;960, the full amount of the subsidy due to an employee may not be paid through the payroll run concerned.  However, Revenue has confirmed it will be implementing a system development to ensure that any subsidy amounts that remain due to such employees will be calculated, by Revenue, following the submission of the actual payroll or payrolls. Arrangements will then be made by Revenue to pay any outstanding subsidy amount directly to the employees concerned. The necessary system development to achieve this will be implemented shortly and will be applied retrospectively from 4 May 2020 to any impacted weekly, fortnightly or monthly paid employees. </p>  <p>  Finally, I am advised by the Minster for Employment Affairs and Social Protection that workers who are in receipt of the one parent family payment or the working family payment will continue to receive these payments during their temporary layoff as a result of the Covid-19 related closures provided they continue to meet the eligibility conditions for these schemes.  In relation to Working Family Payment, it continues to be paid to persons who have experienced a temporary loss of employment, or a reduction in their working hours as a result of COVID-19. It is open to any person who considers that their circumstances have changed to request a review of their claim. If this results in an increased rate of payment, this increase will be backdated accordingly.  A reduction in a rate of payment is normally only applied from a current date, unless there is evidence that a person knowingly misled the Department or failed to report a change in their circumstances.</p></reply>

I have considerable sympathy for such policyholders, however the Deputy should note that I have no legal authority to compel an insurer to pay a claim as this forms part of a contract between the insurer and the policyholder. However, as a general rule, I believe that insurers should not attempt to reject claims on the basis of interpreting policies to their own advantage.  Insurers should engage with those businesses honestly, fairly and professionally to honour those elements of the policies covered, in line with the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code. The Deputies should note however that neither I, as Minister for Finance, nor the Central Bank have any role in adjudicating on such matters.  If there continues to be a disagreement between an insurer and a policyholder, then the appropriate channels for resolving them must be followed i.e. use of the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman or litigation.</p><p>Having said that, my officials and I have been engaging with the sector in an effort to get some much needed certainty for business policyholders. On business interruption claims, I wrote to Insurance Ireland on 27 March and indicated amongst other things that</p><p>(i) insurers should not attempt to reject claims on the basis of interpreting policies to their own advantage; and,</p><p>(ii) that where a claim can be made because a business has closed as a result of a Government direction due to contagious or infectious disease, that the recent Government advice to close a business in the context of COVID-19 should be treated as a direction.</p><p>Insurance Ireland, on behalf of its membership, responded on 3 April and stated that it accepted both of my points. It did however indicate that each insurance policy is different and there may well be other factors which lead to the adjudication of whether a business interruption claim is valid or not, other than Government advice to close.  Following on from this correspondence, I held a teleconference with Insurance Ireland, on 17 April, where I reiterated that some insurers, by adopting a &ldquo;blanket&rdquo; rejection of all business interruption claims, were doing the industry significant reputational damage and were not treating customers fairly. </p><p>In addition, the Deputies should note that the Central Bank wrote to the CEOs of major insurers outlining its expectations of them in this crisis from a consumer protection perspective. This included the Bank&rsquo;s belief that while most insurance policies are clear, if there is a doubt about the meaning of a term, the interpretation most favourable to the consumer should prevail. The Central Bank is continuing to engage with the non-life insurance industry on these matters and will continue to closely monitor the situation to ensure that firms are meeting the expectations as previously set out.</p><p>I would also like to set out my views on forbearance. I believe that insurers have a role to play in supporting their customers in these difficult times. My officials and I have had extensive engagement with the insurance industry over reliefs for businesses during the COVID-19 emergency. The outcome of this engagement is an agreement that I announced on 10 April whereby most of the key insurers in the Irish market - namely Allianz, AIG, AXA, FBD, Liberty Insurance, RSA, Travelers Insurance and Zurich - will ensure that a number of common forbearance measures are available to their business customers. It should be noted that this is a voluntary agreement, but my views are that the other major insurers in the Irish market should also sign up to this commitment.</p><p>The common measures included in the agreement are as follows:</p><p><b>(i) Forbearance commitments</b>- insurers will reduce premiums for business customers to reflect reduced level of exposure as a result of COVID-19 restrictions for Employer Liability/ Public Liability and Commercial Motor.<b></b>Insurers will also allow up to 28 days after renewal for payment.</p><p><b>(ii) Approach to business premises - </b>insurers will maintain cover for unoccupied commercial buildings/ premises not in use due to COVID-19 restriction (for a maximum of 90 days). Appropriate supervision and security of the premises is required.  Insurers will also support requests for a change of property use during the crisis.</p><p>While I believe that the above agreement should assist many businesses in relation to their insurance, this will only happen if insurers deliver upon their commitments. Therefore, I asked Insurance Ireland to put in place a mechanism, which provides proof of delivery.  My Department received the first &ldquo;Activity Report&rdquo; on this issue from Insurance Ireland on 25 May. This Report shows that in the period 23 March to 4 May, Insurance Ireland members processed 4,093 forbearance requests for business customers worth a total of &euro;5,242,349. I have asked my officials to seek more detailed information from Insurance Ireland on the nature of the forbearance being offered. It should also be noted that my Department is in regular touch with the Alliance for Insurance Reform on these matters.</p><p>In conclusion, I would like to assure the Deputies that my Department will continue to be as pro-active as it can be on these insurance issues and will continue to liaise with the Central Bank and Insurance Ireland on an ongoing basis.</p></reply>

As an individual&rsquo;s income increases they move up through the various rates and bands and, as a result, while the levels of take home pay increase overall, the amount of tax paid also increases. Total income tax receipts account for around 40% of Ireland&rsquo;s annual tax receipts, thereby making a significant contribution towards the cost of the various Exchequer funded State services, many of which are experiencing additional pressures at this time on account of the crisis we are facing as a result of the necessary response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  The Government greatly appreciates the additional efforts of essential workers, front line staff and all those working during this difficult time. They are making a key contribution to the State-wide response to the COVID-19 crisis.  Rather than waiving tax payments or introducing a tax relief for those who are working at this time, resources are being focused on new initiatives to support those who are no longer in employment or who will have reduced income in the coming weeks and months, as well as measures seeking to support employers in retaining staff and restarting businesses as we gradually reopen our economy in line with the Government roadmap.</p></reply>

In addition, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 imposes &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer and Suitability&rsquo; requirements on lenders.  Under these requirements, lenders are required to assess affordability of credit and the suitability of a product or service based on the individual circumstances of each borrower.  </p><p>Within the parameters of this regulatory framework, the decision to grant or refuse an individual application for mortgage credit is a commercial decision to be made by the regulated entity.

It builds on data returned to Revenue through the PAYE system and as such is a fully automated solution. The automated solution, which was developed in a very short timeframe in response to the pandemic, is designed around the dates specified in the legislation. The timelines require that employees were on the employer payroll at 29 February 2020 and that the business had fulfilled its PAYE reporting obligations for February 2020 before 15 March 2020. </p>  <p>  Revenue recently revised the eligibility conditions for the scheme under its care and management provisions, which extended the 15 March 2020 deadline to &lsquo;before&rsquo; 1 April 2020. However, these concessionary arrangements can only operate for future payrolls and are not available on a retrospective basis for previous payrolls. </p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that the business in question could not previously access the TWSS because it did not complete its payroll submission for February 2020 until after the revised &lsquo;before&rsquo; 1 April 2020 deadline. However, having reviewed the exceptional circumstances that resulted in the late filing of the February 2020 payroll submission, Revenue is arranging access to the TWSS for the company. Revenue has also confirmed that it has made direct contact with the company to clarify certain matters.</p></reply>

The TWSS is built upon historic PAYE returns made to Revenue &ndash; this is fundamental to the operational of the scheme which has given support to nearly 500,000 employees.  </p></reply>

In the first instance, the forecasts in Budget 2020 were carried out on the assumption of a 'disorderly Brexit'. As this assumption became outdated, my Department published a high-level technical update as part of the Medium Term Fiscal Strategy published in January. From this technical update, the initial monthly profiles for tax receipts were derived. </p><p>Following this, due to the unprecedented Covid-19 situation, it was necessary to substantially update the monthly profile of expected tax receipts for 2020, which was carried out on the basis of the forecasts published in the Stability Programme Update 2020. These profiles take into account the actual Exchequer tax outturn until end-April and attempt to reflect the potential impact of the pandemic on receipts.</p><p>As such, there are no revised monthly taxation profiles for the months January to April. Furthermore, unallocated receipts are not profiled. These receipts are allocated to the appropriate tax headings by the Revenue Commissioners over the course of the year. The May Exchequer returns, and all subsequent publications, will include a comparison of the tax outturn to the revised profiles.</p><p>Table 1 displays tax receipts to end-April.

In general, the VAT Directive provides that all goods and services are liable to VAT at the standard rate, currently 23% in Ireland, unless they fall within categories of goods and services specified in the Directive, in respect of which Member States may apply a lower rate or exemption from VAT.  In addition, the Directive allows for historic VAT treatment to be maintained under certain conditions and Ireland has retained the application of VAT exemption to the transport of passengers and their accompanying baggage. This means that the supplier does not register for VAT, does not charge VAT on the supply of their services and has no VAT recovery entitlement on costs where such costs are used for the exempt supply of passenger transport.</p>  <p>  Ireland may continue to apply the VAT exemption on the supply of domestic passenger transport as governed by Article 371 of the VAT Directive; however, it cannot change the conditions under which the exemption was granted. In accordance with the Directive, a reduced rate of VAT (Ireland currently has two reduced VAT rates, 9% and 13.5%) could be introduced to the supply of passenger transport in place of the exemption that currently applies; this would give the transport operator deductibility in relation to VAT on their business inputs but would involve charging passengers VAT on their fares. Under the Directive it is not possible to apply the zero rate in Ireland to these services, as their supply was never zero rated in the past.</p>  <p>  In the UK, where these services were previously zero rated, the zero rate of VAT continues to apply to the supply of passenger transport, except for a taxi service which is standard rated, and suppliers established in the UK have an entitlement to deductibility on the costs relating to the supply of these services where the place of supply is the UK.</p>  <p>  I would point out that there are reliefs from VAT available to passenger transport operators, whose businesses are established in this State, as follows:</p>  <p>  - the Value Added Tax (Refund of Tax) (Touring Coaches) Order of 2012 provides for a refund of VAT on the cost of acquiring &ldquo;qualifying vehicles&rdquo; used for the carriage of tourists under contracts for group transport; and </p>  <p>  - provisions within Section 59 of the VAT Consolidation Act 2010, which allow a person established in this State to claim deductibility in respect of input costs incurred in relation to the transport of passengers outside this State.</p></reply>

The public consultations and calls for evidence are generally open for submissions on any issue related to the impact of the macroprudential framework or specific policies. This includes submissions related to discrimination, equality and human rights. The Macroprudential Measures Committee or the Central Bank Commission (depending on the policy instrument being considered) is presented with the outcomes of public consultation and any implications for policy development. </p>  <p>  The Central Bank is committed to being a socially responsible and sustainable organisation in how it delivers on its mandate and mission. As a public service organisation, the Central Bank&rsquo;s obligation to meet its public sector duty is a key part of this wider commitment. In preparing the Central Bank&rsquo;s Strategic Plan, an assessment of the human rights and equality issues, relevant to the functions of the Central Bank, was carried out. </p>  <p>  The Strategic Plan sets out that the Central Bank will ensure: </p>  <p>  - The implementation of its People Strategy promotes and supports the equality and human rights of staff.</p>  <p>  - Engagement with the public through communications and outreach strategies as part of its commitment to corporate and social responsibility.</p>  <p>  - All members of the public who receive services from the Central Bank are provided a professional, efficient and courteous service as set out in the Customer Charter.</p>  <p>  - The public is consulted on Central Bank policy developments and the obligations under the 2014 Act will be considered by the Central Bank, where relevant, in the development of such policies. </p>  <p>  The Central Bank also plays a role in promoting sound governance and culture across its regulated entities through the publication of reports on key Diversity and Inclusion data.</p>  <p>  While it is not my intention to request a report as suggested by the Deputy, he will be aware, within the remit of the Central Bank&rsquo;s responsibilities for safeguarding stability and protecting consumers, its approach to mortgage arrears resolution is focused on ensuring the fair treatment of all borrowers through a strong consumer protection framework and ensuring that regulated entities have appropriate arrears resolution strategies and operations in place.  </p>  <p>  The Central Bank first introduced the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) in 2009 in the midst of an economic and employment crisis to provide statutory safeguards for vulnerable, financially-distressed borrowers in arrears or at risk of falling into arrears on a primary residence. Further strengthened in subsequent years, the CCMA, and within it, the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP), is just one part of the national policy framework of supports and protections to assist people with mortgage arrears difficulties.</p>  <p>  The CCMA is a statutory Code put in place to ensure that regulated entities have fair and transparent processes in place for dealing with borrowers in or facing mortgage arrears.  Within this process, due regard must be given to the fact that each case is unique and needs to be considered on its own merits. All cases must be handled sympathetically and positively by the regulated entity, with the objective at all times of assisting the borrower to meet his or her mortgage obligations. Regulated entities must comply with the CCMA as a matter of law.</p>  <p>  Under the CCMA, a regulated entity may only commence legal proceedings for repossession where it has made every reasonable effort to agree an alternative repayment arrangement (ARA) with the borrower and other clear requirements are met or the borrower has been classified as not co-operating. This framework requires a regulated entity to exhaust the options available from its suite of ARAs before taking action which may result in the borrower losing his/her home (whether by voluntary sale or repossession). During the legal process, the borrower has the opportunity to re-engage with the regulated entity to find a solution.  In some circumstances, however, loss of ownership may be unavoidable.  </p>  <p>  I would also like to draw the Deputy's attention to the Abhaile scheme, the aim of which is to ensure that people who are at risk of losing their homes get assistance to address their mortgage arrears and to help them wherever possible, to remain in their homes. The Insolvency Service of Ireland have stated that if a debtor can, at least, service the current market value of their home, irrespective of the mortgage balance, a Personal Insolvency Practitioner will be able to secure a permanent solution that returns the debtor to solvency and allow them remain in their family home. In over 90% of Personal Insolvency Arrangements, the debtor has remained in their home notwithstanding the fact that the majority of such cases were in long term arrears. </p>  <p>  Finally, the Government is committed to assisting all its citizens who are in mortgage difficulties and even more so at this difficult time. The Banking and Payments Federation Ireland announced last week that it's members had 78,000 mortgage payment breaks in place for customers who are affected by the Covid-19 crisis.  I would urge all those in difficulty to engage with their financial institution and with the Abhaile and Money Advice and Budgeting Services (MABS). </p></reply>

That is why a key focus of Government has been to improve the supports provided for businesses since the start of this crisis.  These supports are kept under review and we will continue to offer support as SMEs work through the challenges facing them. </p><p>The supports provided to businesses are reflected in our expectation that there will be a general government deficit this year in the range of &euro;23 to &euro;30 billion, as I informed the House on 20 May. Our level of public debt will increase significantly, temporarily reversing the downward trend in our debt-to-GDP ratio.</p><p>As I have said previously, this is entirely appropriate, and is in line with the experience of our European colleagues, but it is essential that Ireland&rsquo;s budgetary position does not become an outlier in the future.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-06-03a.252.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020060300108#WRE03800"><p>The legislation governing the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) is set out in section 28 of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020. The administration of the TWSS is under the care and management of Revenue. </p>  <p>  The burden of compliance in relation to the TWSS rests solely with the employer rather than the employee.   </p>  <p>  Any amount due to be refunded to Revenue under the TWSS, where the employer was not entitled to receive the wage subsidy in respect of the employee, is treated as if it were tax due and payable by the employer from the date the wage subsidy amount in question had been paid by Revenue and is payable by the employer. </p>  <p>  Additionally, I am advised by Revenue as follows.</p>  <p>  Of necessity, Revenue&rsquo;s primary focus in operating the TWSS so far has been on providing a timely and efficient customer support service to ensure that much needed financial assistance is paid to employers and employees as quickly as possible.  In due course, Revenue will be undertaking a comprehensive programme of compliance checks and interventions in relation to employer eligibility for the scheme.  While the scheme operates at employer level on largely self-assessment principles, Revenue will expect businesses to be able to produce relevant supporting documentation when requested to do so and to fully engage with Revenue on any follow up discussions or checks.  Eligibility for the TWSS is initially determined largely on the basis of the self-assessment and declaration by the employer concerned, combined with a risk focused follow up verification by Revenue involving an examination of relevant business records where that is considered necessary.</p>  <p>  Revenue further advises that where an employer has been paid a wage subsidy in respect of an employee and it transpires that the employer has not passed on the wage subsidy to the employee, or that the employer was not entitled to receive the wage subsidy in respect of the employee, the relevant law requires that the employer must refund the wage subsidy amount to Revenue. Any amount due to be so refunded to Revenue is treated as if it were tax due and payable by the employer from the date the wage subsidy amount in question had been paid by Revenue and is automatically so due and payable by the employer without the making of an assessment.  However, where necessary, Revenue may make an assessment to recover the amounts in question and the provisions of tax law governing assessments to income tax, appeals against such assessments and the collection of and recovery of income tax apply in relation to the assessment, collection and recovery of wage subsidy amounts from employers. In other words, the full suite of tax collection and enforcement powers, including the charging of interest on amounts due to be refunded by employers, is available to Revenue to recover wage subsidy amounts due to be refunded by employers. </p>  <p>  Section 28 of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 also provides for penalties for abuses of the scheme but only in certain prescribed circumstances. Thus, an employer is liable to a penalty of &euro;4,000, where the employer fails to include in, and separately identify in, the wage slips legally required to be given to employees under the Payment of Wages Act 1991 the amount of the wage subsidy. Where the employer who fails to comply is a body of persons, the secretary of that body is liable to a separate penalty of &euro;3,000. These penalties are designed to ensure transparency around the wage subsidy and to protect employees who are entitled to know what wage subsidy the employer has received in respect of them. </p>  <p>  There are more severe criminal penalties where an employer knowingly or wilfully delivers an incorrect return or statement, or knowingly or wilfully furnishes any incorrect information, in connection with the temporary wage subsidy scheme or where a person knowingly assists another person to furnish incorrect information in relation to the scheme. The penalties can be a fine of up to &euro;5,000 and/or imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year in the case of a summary conviction and a fine of up to &euro;126,970 and/or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years in the case of a conviction on indictment.  The penalties in question are severe because they are designed to protect against deliberate fraud by unscrupulous employers seeking to abuse a generous and expensive State support. However, given the way the TWSS is structured, in that the employer must have been compliant with its PAYE/PRSI/USC reporting obligations and the employee must have been on the employer&rsquo;s payroll at 29 February 2020, the opportunity for deliberate fraud is limited.</p>  <p>  Finally, I would add that if employees have concerns about their employers incorrectly operating or availing of the TWSS, it is open to them to contact Revenue about their concerns.</p></reply>

The Regulations require that investments by credit unions in Tier 3 AHBs must be made through a regulated investment vehicle. The maximum permitted investment amount per credit union is 50% of a credit union's regulatory reserves where a credit union has total assets of at least &euro;100 million and 25% of a credit unions regulatory reserves for all other credit unions. These limits may facilitate a combined sector investment in Tier 3 AHBs of close to &euro;700 million. </p>  <p>  As such the Government and the Central Bank have fulfilled their role and it is now up to both the credit union and social housing sectors themselves to progress and develop any specific funding mechanisms. Notwithstanding the above, my Department will continue to engage with the credit union movement on appropriate mechanisms for them to establish a vehicle to invest in approved housing bodies.</p>  <p>  I am also advised by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government that the Irish Council for Social Housing (ICSH), along with six Tier 3 AHBs, have worked with specialist financial advisors to establish a funding mechanism or special purpose vehicle which would source suitable sources of non-State finance to fund the delivery of social housing by AHBs, based on best value for money. Market testing undertaken revealed good interest in lending to the AHB sector from various lenders, including the credit union sector. So far, one AHB has set up an SPV and several AHBs have sourced finance from private institutions. The work of the ICSH was supported by grant funding from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.</p></reply>

Equally, Irish traders selling goods to private customers in other EU Member States may apply Irish VAT unless they exceed the distance selling threshold for that Member State. Subject to certain exclusions, goods purchased online and imported from non-EU countries are subject to Customs duty and VAT at the point of importation. The rate of VAT is the same as if that good had been supplied in the State.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, an exemption from VAT already exists for small business who sell goods. Where their turnover does not exceed or is unlikely to exceed &euro;75,000 in any continuous 12-month period, they are not required to register for VAT or charge VAT on their supplies.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that any reduction in VAT rates incurs a cost to the exchequer, which would necessitate recovery elsewhere.</p></reply>

The Directive provides that VAT registration thresholds may only be raised by Member States to maintain their value in real terms, that is, they may only be increased in line with inflation. Our VAT thresholds were increased to their current values, &euro;37,500 for services and &euro;75,000 for goods, on 1 May 2008 and as the Central Statistics Office figures show the consumer price index is below the level it reached in 2008, it is not possible to increase these thresholds.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s VAT registration thresholds for small enterprises and the self-employed are among the highest in the EU. In addition, SMEs benefit from a range of VAT simplification measures including simplified and electronic invoicing, special schemes for retailers and pharmacists, the facility to make VAT returns on a bi-annual or annual basis, the cash receipts basis of accounting where the trader is not required to pay VAT until payment for the supply is received, the facility for small businesses to submit an annual VIES return rather than monthly and the Mini One Stop Shop which allows business to register, file and pay VAT due in all Member States through the Irish MOSS system.</p></reply>

The issue of the validity of an insurance quotation is one that comes under the consumer protection code and therefore the remit of the Central Bank. However, in order to be as helpful to the Deputy as possible, my officials sought information from the Central Bank  on this matter.</p>  <p>  In response, the Central bank indicated that its Consumer Protection Code (the &ldquo;Code&rdquo;) requires certain information to be included in an insurance quotation. Assuming that all details provided by the consumer are correct and do not change, the quotation must include the monetary amount of the quotation, the length of time for which the quotation is valid and the full legal name of the relevant underwriter. The Code does not refer to how long an insurance quotation should be valid for, only that the regulated entity must provide this information in the quote provided. </p>  <p>  There are certain types of insurance like car and home insurance that have to be renewed each year. Under the Non-Life Insurance (Provision of Information) Regulations 2007, general insurance companies must send out a renewal notice at least 20 days before the renewal date to allow consumers to shop around for the best policy. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that Central Bank has no remit over the pricing of insurance policies or over the makeup and content of products. These are commercial decisions for the various insurers themselves.</p>  <p>  In addition, on their website, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission recommends that consumers ask insurers how long their quotes are valid for when shopping around for insurance.</p></reply>

The core principles of the scheme are that the business is suffering significant negative economic impact due to the Covid-19 pandemic, that the employees were on the payroll at 29 February 2020 and that the employer had fulfilled its PAYE reporting obligations for February 2020 before 1 April 2020.  The scheme is predicated on the employer wanting to keep the employees on the payroll and to retain them until business picks up. The employer is expected to make best efforts to maintain the employee&rsquo;s net income as close as possible to normal net income for the duration of the Subsidy period. There is, however, no minimum amount that the employer must pay as an additional payment in order to be eligible for the scheme, but for Revenue operational systems reasons the employer will need to enter at least &euro;0.01 in Gross Pay when running its payroll. </p></reply>

The rates of wage subsidy payable are based, largely, on the emoluments of employees for January and February 2020 as reported to Revenue in employers&rsquo; payrolls.  The rates are determined in accordance with the underlying law and the determinations of subsidy amounts for particular classes of employees made by me, as Minister for Finance, on 16 April 2020.  Those determinations provide as follows:</p>  <p>  For employees with previous net emoluments of less than &euro;586 per week, the wage subsidy shall not exceed &euro;410 per week in accordance with the following principles:</p>  <p>  - an 85% subsidy is payable in the case of employees whose average net weekly emoluments does not exceed &euro;412;</p>  <p>  - a flat-rate subsidy of up to &euro;350 is payable in the case of employees whose average net weekly emoluments is more than &euro;412 but not more than &euro;500.</p>  <p>  - a 70% subsidy is payable in the case of employees whose average net week emoluments is more than &euro;500 but not more than &euro;586, with a maximum cap of &euro;410 applying.</p>  <p>  In addition, where an employer wishes to pay a greater level of top-up of wages, in respect of employees with net emoluments of less than &euro;412 per week, in order to bring the employee&rsquo;s pay to &euro;350 per week, then tapering will not be applied to the subsidy.</p>  <p>  For employees with previous net emoluments in excess of &euro;586 per week, including those whose previous net emoluments exceeded &euro;960 per week, a tiered approach will apply. The maximum subsidy payable is &euro;350 per week, with a tiered approach operating to take into account both the amount paid by the employer and the level of reduction in pay borne by the employee. In essence: </p>  <p>  - a subsidy of &euro;350 is payable to employees with average net weekly emoluments greater than &euro;586, where the employer pays sufficient gross salary which equates to an amount up to 60% of the employee&rsquo;s net weekly earnings. </p>  <p>  - a subsidy of &euro;205 is payable to employees with average net weekly emoluments greater than &euro;586, where the employer pays sufficient gross salary which equates to an amount that is more than 60%, but not more than 80%, of the employee&rsquo;s net weekly emoluments.  </p>  <p>  - no subsidy is payable to employees with average net weekly emoluments greater than &euro;586, where the employer pays sufficient gross salary which equates to an amount that is more than 80% of the employee&rsquo;s net weekly earnings. </p>  <p>  Finally, for employees whose current net emoluments exceeds &euro;960 per week, no subsidy applies regardless of the level of any reduction in pay.   To calculate the level of subsidy payable, current pay is compared with previous average net weekly pay for January/February.  This subsidy will be tapered to ensure that the total weekly income consisting of the employer contribution plus the wage subsidy amount does not exceed &euro;960 per week in any individual case.</p>  <p>  The Deputy has raised the specific issue of taking into account income from occupational pensions when calculating the amounts of wage subsidy.  I am advised by Revenue that the TWSS provides that wage subsidy amounts and limits in relation to individual employees are calculated by reference to the total emoluments of the employee concerned. For this purpose, there is no distinction made between the emoluments from an occupational pension and the emoluments from an employment.  Where an individual has two or more sources of emoluments, be they employments or an employment and an occupational pension, all sources are looked at when considering the amounts of wage subsidy available in relation to the employee.  It would be inequitable to exclude occupational pension amounts, which can be significant in many cases, when calculating wage subsidy amounts available in relation to individual employees. </p>  <p>  I have also been advised by Revenue that during the transitional phase of the TWSS, up to 3 May 2020, if an employee had multiple employments, each employer individually operated the scheme based on 70% of each employee&rsquo;s average net weekly pay with that employer.  During the operational phase of the TWSS from 4 May 2020, earnings from all active employments and occupational pension sources are combined.  Thus, the average net weekly pay from each such source is aggregated to calculate the employee&rsquo;s overall average net weekly pay. This is then used to calculate an employee&rsquo;s maximum wage subsidy and the wage subsidy entitlement is split across each of the emolument sources based on the percentage of the employee&rsquo;s average net weekly pay from each such source, with each employer provided with an employer &ldquo;maximum weekly wage subsidy&rdquo; and the &ldquo;maximum weekly employer pay before tapering&rdquo; to apply to the employee&rsquo;s payroll.  This personalised information will ensure that the employee&rsquo;s overall position is taken into consideration when calculating the employee&rsquo;s subsidy entitlements. This is to allow the concentration of resources to protect incomes, in a proportionate way having regard to available resources and employer contributions by way of wage top ups. </p>  <p>  It follows that if one of the sources of the employee&rsquo;s emoluments, such as, in this instance, the occupational pension provider, is not operating the TWSS, the employee will only get the benefit of the wage subsidy in relation to the employment that is operating the TWSS.  In the specific case that is the subject of this question, the employee&rsquo;s total average net weekly pay across his employment and occupational pension is greater than &euro;586. Consequently,  the maximum wage subsidy the employee is entitled to would be &euro;350 or &euro;205, depending on the amount of wage top up provided by the employer, and not as has been suggested by the employee concerned a subsidy amount based on 85% of his average net weekly pay from his employment on the grounds that that weekly pay from that employment is &euro;586 or less.     </p>  <p>  In relation to the administrative process for availing of the TWSS, Revenue advises me that it has repeatedly advised employers that for a claim for the subsidy in relation to an employee to be identified and processed correctly, the employer must use the PRSI rate of J9 for that employee in its payroll submission to Revenue.  Where a payroll submission is made to Revenue with a J9 PRSI class, it is extremely important to ensure that the payroll submission is not subsequently deleted or amended.  As Revenue&rsquo;s systems were developed quickly to cater for the TWSS, attempts to delete or amend previous refund-related payroll submissions are necessarily flagged for attention by Revenue and may cause further difficulties for the employer and disrupt the refund process.  </p>  <p>  Finally, where an employer wishes to engage with Revenue on general issues relating to the scheme, the employer should contact Revenue&rsquo;s National Employer Helpdesk via the myEnquiries system, providing details of the query and relevant contact information.  I have been assured by Revenue that in the case that is the subject of this question the employer concerned received timely communication in relation to each query raised.</p></reply>

Furthermore, the Minister for Agriculture, Food &amp;amp; the Marine, Michael Creed TD, has engaged the banks on the specific liquidity and financing needs of farmers, fishers and agrifood businesses.</p>  <p>  I would urge anyone who may be worried about the impact of COVID-19 on their ability to repay their loans to make contact with their bank and discuss their options. Each of the banks have a wide range of supports available for customers impacted by COVID-19. </p>  <p>  I welcome the ongoing work of the banks in helping business customers including farmers impacted by COVID-19, which included the initial three month payment-breaks that allowed their customers to defer some of their most significant outgoings. In April the members of the Banking and Payments Federation Ireland (BPFI) announced their intention to extend these payment breaks to six months for customers that require it. </p>  <p>  The European Central Bank and the European Banking Authority have made a number of announcements recently, which set out regulatory flexibility to ensure that the banking sector can support their customers who experience repayment difficulty due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. In particular, the EBA has clarified that payment moratoria, such as the one adopted by the banking sector in Ireland, should not automatically result in the reclassification of borrowers who avail of the payment break. It is important to note that these payment breaks must be applied for by 30th June 2020 as this is the deadline set out by the European Banking Authority. </p>  <p>  The Central Bank is focused on ensuring that extensions to COVID-19 related payment breaks operate in borrowers&rsquo; best interests and in line with regulatory requirements. The Central Bank has clearly communicated and agreed with the BPFI that it expects that at the end of the agreed payment break that borrowers who can return to full repayments be given, at the minimum, the option to either repay the loan within the remaining term or extend the term of the loan, without penalties noting that borrower circumstances and the appropriateness of each option may differ. These options may result in an increase in monthly repayments due to the overall increase in the cost of credit and this should be fully explained to the borrower. Borrowers can find more information on payment breaks at the Central Bank&rsquo;s COVID&ndash;19 Hub.</p></reply>

Insurers also price in accordance with their own past claims experience, and do not all use the same combination of rating factors, so as a result prices vary across the market.  In addition to the above, I am not in a position to compel insurers to disclose information such as actuarial data covering the geographic basis of claims history and how it affects the pricing of premiums. </p><p>In my view, it is important for consumers to shop around on their insurance policies. The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC), on its website, recommends that consumers get quotes from a number of insurance companies, including their current one. Their website also includes a car insurance shopping around checklist and other tips on cutting car insurance costs which may prove useful to consumers. </p><p>I would also note that if a consumer has a complaint with the service of their insurance provider, it is advisable that they make a complaint to the firm's internal complaint resolution process.  The Consumer Protection Code requires that if after 40 days the complaint has not been resolved to the customer&rsquo;s satisfaction, the regulated entity must inform the consumer that they may refer their complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO).  The FSPO is a statutory official who acts as an independent arbiter of disputes which consumers may have with their insurance company or other financial service provider. The FSPO can be contacted either by email at or by telephone at 01-5677000.</p><p>Finally, Insurance Ireland, the representative body for insurance providers in this country, operates an Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to obtaining insurance, which can be accessed at: .</p></reply>

Parts or accessories are also liable to VAT at the standard rate. There is no provision under existing VAT law that would make it possible to apply a reduced rate or zero rate to the supply of such products. Under the EU VAT Directive, Member States may retain the zero rate on goods and services which were in place on 1 January 1991, but cannot extend the zero rate to new goods and services. As such a zero rate cannot be applied to defibrillators. Any changes to VAT rates outside of what is currently permitted by the EU VAT Directive must be negotiated at EU technical working groups and ultimately agreed by the EU Council of Finance Ministers.</p>  <p>  The EU Commission published a proposal on the reform of VAT rates in January 2018 which would allow Member States more flexibility in how they apply VAT rates.  In negotiations leading up to this proposal Ireland specifically recommended to the Commission to include defibrillators and other emergency-medical and rescue equipment. Discussions on the proposal are ongoing, having last been discussed in March 2020.</p>  <p>  In advance of any change that might be made at EU level to the VAT rating of defibrillators and other products that pose difficulty for community groups, I am happy to draw your attention to the VAT compensation refund scheme, which compensates charities for the VAT they occur on their inputs, in recognition of the work undertaken by the charities sector.  The scheme took effect from 1 January 2018 but is paid one year in arrears. It is now open for charities to make a claim in 2020 for VAT costs arising in 2019. Charities will be entitled to a proportion of VAT based on the level of non-public funding they receive. A capped fund of &euro;5 million will be available to the scheme.</p>  <p>  The Government is very committed to supporting community groups and we will continue to press for a reduction in the VAT rate on defibrillators at EU level. In the meantime, Irish VAT law must comply with the current VAT Directive and therefore defibrillators remain liable to VAT at the standard rate, currently 23%.</p></reply>

I brought forward legislation in Finance Act 2018 to extend the SSDT scope to also include certain plant protein drinks and drinks containing milk fats with added sugar. From 1 January 2019, SSDT applies to certain categories of plant protein drinks and drinks containing milk fats that do not have a calcium content level of at least 119 milligrams per 100 millilitres. SSDT applies to both ready to consume and concentrated forms of drinks.</p>  <p>  There are two rates of SSDT.

These rates are dependent on the total sugar content of the ready to consume form of the sugar sweetened drink.</p>  <p>  SSDT liability arises on first supply, in the State, of ready to consume or concentrated sugar sweetened drinks. Suppliers must register for SSDT with Revenue and make bi-monthly returns and payments via ROS. I am advised by Revenue that suppliers must declare, on the SSDT return, the volume in hectolitres of ready to consume and concentrated sugar sweetened drinks, with a sugar content greater than 5 grams but less than 8 grams per 100 millilitres, supplied in an accounting period. They must also declare the volume of ready to consume and concentrated sugar sweetened drinks, with a sugar content greater than 8 grams per 100 millilitres, supplied. The return must also include volumes of any goods returned during the SSDT accounting period for which a repayment is claimed, again broken down by tax band.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-06-03a.308.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020060300109#WRF02900"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 108 to 111, inclusive, and 113 to 115, inclusive, together.</p><p>I am advised that each year since 2009, Revenue, in conjunction with the HSE&rsquo;s National Tobacco Control Office, has commissioned Ipsos MRBI to conduct independent market research among smokers about the source of their cigarettes. The purpose of this research is to estimate the volume of non-Irish duty paid cigarettes being consumed in Ireland. Since 2013, this has been complemented by an additional survey on roll your own tobacco.  The results of the 2018 survey was published by Revenue in May 2019 and can be viewed on the Revenue website at</p><p><i>.</i></p><p>The key findings of the 2018 survey were that:</p><p>- 13% of the cigarette packs held by smokers surveyed were classified as illegal.</p><p>- a further 9% of the packs are found to be legal Non-Irish Duty Paid.</p><p>- 21% of pouches of fine cut tobacco for the rolling of cigarettes (roll-your-own) consumed were illicit.  </p><p>Of the 13% of cigarette packs found by the survey to be illegal: </p><p>- 78% were classified as contraband (i.e., normal commercial brands of cigarettes bought duty paid or duty free outside the country and smuggled here).</p><p>- 21% are classified as &ldquo;illicit whites&rdquo; (cigarettes manufactured for the sole purpose of being smuggled into and sold illegally in another market).</p><p>- 1% are classified as counterfeit packs (cigarettes manufactured without authorisation of the rightful owners, with intent to deceive consumers and to avoid paying duty). </p><p>The survey included an estimated potential loss in 2018 to the Exchequer from illegal cigarettes of &euro;211 million in Excise and VAT.However, this was viewed as a notional loss in Exchequer tax revenue as it assumed that the illegal cigarettes consumed would displace the equivalent full tax paid quantity of cigarettes, which is unlikely to be the case.</p><p>In relation to prosecutions, I am informed by Revenue that in 2019 33 prosecutions were brought for cigarette or tobacco smuggling and seven convictions secured, one on indictment and six on summary conviction, resulting in fines totalling &euro;15,000 being imposed. </p><p>In addition, 62 prosecutions were initiated for other cigarette and tobacco-related offences in 2019. 55 convictions were secured, three on indictment and 52 on summary conviction, resulting in fines totalling &euro;94,000 and two prison sentences &ndash; one consisting of 18 months imprisonment and the other consisting of 24 months imprisonment with 14 months suspended. </p><p>To date in 2020, 14 prosecutions have been brought for cigarette or tobacco smuggling and four convictions secured, three on indictment and one on summary conviction, resulting in fines totalling &euro;2,500 being imposed. </p><p>In addition, 19 prosecutions have been brought to date in 2020 for other cigarette and tobacco-related offences. 15 convictions have been secured to date, one on indictment and 14 on summary conviction, resulting in fines totalling &euro;26,000 and 240 hours community service. </p><p>I am advised by Revenue that it uses a range of measures designed to identify and target those involved in the smuggling, supply or sale of illicit tobacco products, with a view to disrupting the supply chain, seizing the products and, where possible, prosecuting the persons involved.  Revenue&rsquo;s strategy involves developing and sharing intelligence on a national, EU and international basis, the use of analytics and detection technologies and ensuring the optimum deployment of resources on a risk-focused basis. </p><p>Revenue and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na work together on an ongoing basis in acting against tobacco crime, and both organisations cooperate closely with their Northern Ireland counterparts, in the framework of the North-South Joint Agency Task Force, to target the organised crime groups that are responsible for a large proportion of this form of criminality. In addition, Revenue works closely with the relevant authorities in other jurisdictions, the European Anti-Fraud office, Europol and other international organisations, including the World Customs Organisation, in the ongoing programmes of action at international level to combat tobacco crime. </p><p>Key actions undertaken by Revenue in this area include:</p><p>- Using risk analysis and profiling to screen cargo, vehicles, baggage and postal packages.</p><p>- Post-importation intelligence-based operations and random checks at retail outlets, markets and private and commercial premises.</p><p>- Investing in new resources, such as a new mobile x-ray scanner which uses imaging technology to analyse vehicles as well as shipping containers. This enables Revenue to identify suspicious consignments quickly and efficiently, with minimum impact on legitimate trade.</p><p>- the setting up of the National Profiling Centre, the development of the National Intelligence Management System and the setting up of specific senior management groups at Principal Officer and Assistant Principal levels to give a clearer strategic and operational focus to Revenue&rsquo;s work in the enforcement area, including tobacco fraud.</p><p>Revenue is a fully integrated tax and customs administration and so it is not possible to disaggregate resources deployed exclusively at any given time on tobacco related enforcement work. Revenue currently has approximately 2,000 staff engaged on activities that are dedicated to targeting and confronting non-compliance. These front-line activities include anti-smuggling and anti-evasion, investigation and prosecution, audit, assurance checks, anti-avoidance, returns compliance and debt collection.  Resources are allocated to these different aspects of enforcement and compliance work are continuously adjusted in response to changes in the level of risk in different sectors.</p><p>The Government has also ensured through the Finance Acts over recent years that Revenue has the necessary statutory powers to tackle the illicit tobacco trade and I am open to considering any proposals for further legislative changes as needed.  Legislative reforms  made over recent years in this area include: </p><p>- The Finance Act 2012 clarified the legal basis for Revenue officers to open and examine the contents of postal and courier packets that are reasonably believed to contain untaxed excise products.</p><p>- The Finance Act 2013 introduced new offence and forfeiture measures relating to the illicit production of tobacco and strengthened the offence provisions relating to the sale or delivery of unstamped tobacco products.</p><p>- The Finance (No. 2) Act 2013 provided that a person suspected of an offence of dealing in, or with, unstamped tobacco products must provide information to a Revenue Officer or a Garda and may be required to present any tobacco product concerned for examination, and makes provision for search by a Revenue Officer or Garda of any bag or other receptacle that he or she reasonably believes to contain tobacco products that are concerned in the offence.</p><p>I am advised by Revenue that if tax on roll-your-own tobacco was increased using an annual tax escalator of 5% it would take approximately seven years for the tax rate on roll-your-own tobacco to reach equivalence with manufactured cigarettes. That is providing that there were no further increases in tax on manufactured cigarettes.</p><p>The Ready Reckoner published on the Revenue website at shows on page 24 the potential yield from increased taxes on packets of cigarettes. I am advised by Revenue that if tax on a pack of 20 cigarettes was increased using an annual tax escalator of 5% and the rate of inflation of -0.1% (April 2020), the most popular price category of cigarettes priced at &euro;13.50 would increase by &euro;0.52.</p><p>Overall responsibility for the WHO Protocol to Eliminate Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products rests with my colleague, the Minister for Health.  However, I am in a position to advise the Deputy on the traceability and security feature systems intended to secure the supply chain of tobacco products, which is one of the key elements of the Protocol.  The EU Tobacco Products Directive (2014/40/EU), which gives effect to elements of the Protocol provides for the introduction of a mandatory &lsquo;traceability&rsquo; system alongside a &lsquo;security feature&rsquo; system for tobacco products supplied on EU markets.  The traceability and security features systems required by the Directive were implemented by Revenue in 2019 in respect of cigarettes and Roll-Your-Own tobacco.These systems are to be extended to all other tobacco products in May 2024.  The &lsquo;traceability&rsquo; system requires that all cigarettes and Roll-Your-Own tobacco products manufactured in, or imported into, the EU must be marked with what is referred to as a &lsquo;unique identifier&rsquo;.  The unique identifier is scanned at each stage in the legitimate tobacco supply chain by the importer, wholesaler or distributor concerned using specialised equipment.  The Deputy will appreciate that tracking the distribution of legitimate, tax paid tobacco products through the domestic supply chain will not assist in tackling our illicit tobacco problem.  Tax paid tobacco is not the problem and there is no incentive to divert Irish tax paid tobacco onto other markets or to misreport its distribution for the purpose of such diversion. </p><p>The EU Commission has noted that the data collated from the traceability system will give an EU-wide picture of the quantity of tobacco products supplied to each member state market, up to the last point before retail sale.  All cigarettes and Roll-Your-Own tobacco products are also, under the Directive, required to carry a security feature which verifies the authenticity of the product concerned.  The tobacco tax stamp is used as the security feature in Ireland and several other EU states.  Revenue has also granted approval for an alternative security feature to be applied to Irish duty-free tobacco products.</p></reply>

Taking a break from work from a health and well-being perspective is a chance to recover from the demands of work. The benefits of taking annual leave are not limited to going on holiday; it can also be the taking time away from work to spend on personal interests. Even without COVID-19, time away from work is directly correlated with reducing stress. Regular breaks from work have been shown to reduce ill health and overall absenteeism. Managers should ensure that their team members are availing of annual leave in a way that supports well-being, and also ensures that their team is supported to take their statutory minimum entitlement. </p>  <p>  Employers should facilitate requests for annual leave where possible so that once the crisis passes, organisations can meet increased demand without having to cater to a large volume of annual leave requests. Section 20 (1) of the Organisation of Working Time Act provides that the times at which annual leave is granted are determined by the employer. In that regard, the employer should have regard to the opportunities for rest and recreation available to the employee but also the need for the employee to reconcile work and any family responsibilities. </p>  <p>  Due to the outbreak of COVID-19 and the various challenges facing Departments and Offices, a special once off arrangement was put in place on 13 March 2020 to allow civil service employees additional time to avail of their annual leave during the 2020/21 annual leave year which runs from April 2020 until March 2021. In addition, an IT system change in recent days has retrospectively reverted some employees to their previous cycle year, to ensure that they have the benefit of extra time to use their annual leave entitlement. </p>  <p>  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade currently advises against all non-essential travel overseas. The Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business notes that people are currently to remain within 5km of home, expanding to remain within 20km of home up until phase 4 on 20 July. Further guidance on annual leave may be issued when guidance on domestic and international travel is updated. </p></reply>

The Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation recently amended these regulations to extend the validity of Safe Pass cards with an expiration date after the 1st March 2020 until SOLAS Safe Pass training has restarted. </p>  <p>  SOLAS has examined the potential for online delivery as a means of continuing national construction health and safety courses while adhering to public health measures.  I am advised that no immediate solution has been identified that is equitable with the existing Safe Pass course delivery model, in being accessible to all eligible workers, provides real time course participants supports (literacy and numeracy) and interpreter services, as well as ensuring assessment integrity. As the training authority, SOLAS does not have the authority to issue temporary Safe Pass cards in the absence of associated education and training.</p>  <p>  In terms of the delivery of face to face training, planning is well advanced to support delivery of Safe Pass training within health and social distancing guidelines once public health considerations provide for the return to training for this cohort of learners.  The inclusion of the resumption of Safe Pass training in Phase 2 of the Government&rsquo;s Roadmap is under consideration at the current time, particularly in the context of the adverse effect of non-availability of the training on safe access to construction sites for workers and on employment opportunities in the sector.</p></reply>

Since the outbreak of Covid-19, officials from my Department have had engagement with teacher representatives where they have outlined their concerns and issues.  </p>  <p>  The English Language Education Working Group for this sector has been established with a remit to address the issues arising from the Covid-19 pandemic with a priority and focus placed in the first instance on issues affecting students as well as other issues arising e.g. how stakeholders can work together to promote the sector as international markets move into recovery. The working group is comprised of key sectorial stakeholders including officials from my Department, Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI), the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Enterprise Ireland, as well as lead sectorial representative bodies of providers and learner advocates.</p>  <p>  The coordination of the response of the wider education system to the Covid-19 outbreak is a substantial challenge. In this context, the Department has found the current structure of the working group to be effective in delivering on its remit and, while the Department remains open to views, there are no current plans to expand membership.  To date, the Group has facilitated an appropriate level of engagement with stakeholders alongside the ability to identify and help resolve issues as they arise.  The Department and the members of the Working Group will continue to engage with external parties, to seek to exchange information where relevant and address queries where possible.</p>  <p>  In compliance with the Government Decision taken in March 2020, all providers in this sector closed their premises in accordance with public health advice as part of efforts to combat the spread of the Covid-19 outbreak. Following the closure, these providers have introduced new ways of providing services to their students including facilitating the provision of online classes. This reflects a similar approach that has been adopted by providers across the wider education system. If a student is having issues with the programme on offer or in accessing a provider&rsquo;s services, they can engage with their provider to address these issues. It is not within the remit of my Department to pursue providers for refunds arising from fees paid by students. This is a matter between the student and their provider.  </p>  <p>  However, as part of the conditions for a provider to have its programmes included on the Interim List for Eligible Programmes (ILEP) and therefore be eligible to recruit International Students, it must have established policies and procedures for the refund of fees to students in addition to a complaints procedure in the event of student complaints. These should be communicated to the student at time of enrolment.  If the student exhausts the internal complaints procedure of the provider and is still unhappy about the outcome, they can make a complaint to the Immigration Delivery Service of the Department of Justice and Equality.  However, in the case of a complaint regarding refunds, this can only relate to whether a provider has followed their internal refunds policy. If the provider&rsquo;s refund policy was followed, there can be no further intervention into a private agreement between a provider and their student.</p></reply>

In this regard, the nature of distance learning has required schools to take on a range of approaches to support their students and schools and teachers have demonstrated great innovation in adapting to the new situation. My Department has issued extensive guidance material for schools/teachers to use in engaging with pupils to ensure there is continuity of learning for all learners. This guidance documentation is available on my Departments website at</p><p>Guidance has also issued to parents/guardians of primary school children and is available at this same link in 12 languages.</p><p>The guidance was informed by extensive engagement with stakeholder sand feedback from a range of school surveys. The guidance documentation included the topic of staying safe in the distance learning environment and reminded schools of the continued need to implement and monitor their school policies particularly in areas such as Child Protection, Data Protection, Student/Pupil/Teacher Wellbeing and policies relating to the safe and ethical use of digital technologies.  Links to the range of curricular and other supports that continued to be available to schools for that purpose were also provided.  Schools and parents were also reminded of the extensive resources available through the Webwise programme to ensure the safe and ethical use of the internet during distance learning.  This website promotes the autonomous, effective and safe use of the internet by young people through a sustained information and awareness strategy targeting school leaders, teachers, parents and children themselves with consistent and relevant messages. The website includes a dedicated School/Teacher Hub; A Parents Hub; and a Youth Hub.</p><p>Because learning is now conducted in the home environment, the Parents Hub is of particular importance during this time and this resource continues to be highlighted. This Hub provides practical advice and information to help parents safeguard their children as they use the internet and helps forge the link between home and school.  The Parents Hub features expert advice from professionals and offers useful conversation starters and tips on managing internet safety in the home.  It includes information on privacy and parental control, managing screen time, posting and sharing online, cyberbullying, popular apps and more. </p><p>The Webwise programme, which is managed by the PDST, is an internet safety initiative funded by my Department and the EU Safer Internet Project. The PDST and its Webwise team work closely with European and National stakeholders (including other government Departments) in the development of its resources and has important connections with other agencies including the National Parents Council. Webwise is also represented on the National Advisory Council for Online Safety (NACOS) which was established by Government in 2018 and where much of the national conversation with regards to online safety is conducted. The membership of the Council is drawn from children's and parents' organisations, major online platforms, and experts on online safety issues and part of the Council&rsquo;s role is to conduct research and to provide advice to Government on online safety issues.  </p><p>The data protection website offers specific guidance to schools in the area of data protection legislation and provides examples, model policies, codes of practice and useful links to other resources including the national Data Commission website .</p><p>On a more general note, the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) and other Department funded teacher support services continues to offer online professional learning opportunities to teachers and school leaders in a range of pedagogical, curricular and educational areas including CPD on the effective use of digital technologies in</p><p>teaching, learning and assessment. The PDST has developed a new dedicated webpage of curated content to support schools and teachers engaged in distance learning in order to provide continuity to pupils/students. The page can be accessed at</p></reply>

It will be a matter for each Higher Education Institution (HEI) to examine the available options in terms of rescheduling Gaeltacht placements for students. My Department will continue to liaise with the HEIs on this matter to ensure that clarity if provided for students.</p></reply>

But some students may find it difficult to manage full-time placement in mainstream and so placement in a Special Class or Special School setting may be deemed appropriate where placement in mainstream class is not in the best interests of the child.  Special Schools funded by my Department are established as special primary schools and cater for children and young persons with complex special educational needs from the age of 4 years until the end of the school year in which they reach their 18th year.  Provision in our 124 special schools has also increased from 6,848 placements in 2011 to 7,872 this year.  Nationally, 167 new special classes opened this school year, which means there are 1,618 special classes in place, compared to 548 in 2011.</p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide; has well established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents; and seeks to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special class placements.</p>  <p>  It is open to any school to make an application to the NCSE for the establishment of specialised provision and where sanctioned, a range of supports, including capital funding, is made available to the school. My Department works closely with the NCSE in this regard. In considering these applications, however, the NSCE, in conjunction with the school buildings unit of my Department, will be required to take into account the capacity of a school to establish such a class, including the provision of sufficient accommodation space within the school.</p>  <p>  The NCSE is planning a further expansion of special class and special school places nationally to meet identified need for next year. This process is ongoing.</p>  <p>  Normally, special class and special school places are established with the full cooperation of the schools in areas where they are required.  However there are some parts of the country where the NCSE has faced challenges in getting schools and their patrons to voluntarily agree to provide special class or special school places.</p>  <p>  I know that this can cause much anguish for parents and families involved.  As Minister I have a power under Section 37A of the Education Act 1998 to direct a school to provide additional provision where all reasonable efforts have failed.  I would prefer to see schools volunteer to provide more places rather than places being secured on the back of an order or a direction from me. It is the right thing for the children in a community.  The legislation was used for the first time in April 2019, in respect of the Dublin 15 area.     Significant progress was made in a relatively short period with the establishment of Danu Special School as well as six schools offering to open special classes.  The experience of Dublin 15 shows that real and practical challenges can be addressed by working together to provide additional special class and special school places.</p>  <p>  The legislation was activated for a second time on the 29th October, 2019 following a report by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) which identified 82 children in South Dublin needing special education school places in the current school year and a further potential 68 children needing special education school places in 2020/21.  Since then, as required under the Act, the NCSE in consultation with the relevant education stakeholders, has been testing the capacity among schools in the South Dublin area.  On 21 April 2020 I received a report from the NCSE, pursuant to Section 37A(2) of the Education Act 1998 (as inserted by section 8 of the Education (Admissions to Schools) Act 2018) in respect of South Dublin, as the NCSE Council remains of the opinion that there is an insufficient number of special class and special school places within the South Dublin area for September 2020.  Before reaching this opinion, the NCSE has undertaken substantial work reviewing provision and accommodation in the 231 mainstream primary and 23 special schools in South Dublin.</p>  <p>  Following engagement between NCSE local personnel and school management and Patrons, very good progress has been achieved. 78 ASD primary school special class placements and 12 ASD early intervention special class places have been created in 14 schools in South Dublin, with 13 new ASD special classes and 2 new ASD early intervention special classes to open for September 2020.  However, the NCSE has reported that to date, an insufficient number of schools have indicated a willingness to open additional special classes.  The NCSE is of the opinion that should this continue, there remains a need for an additional 43 ASD primary special class places and 36 special school places in South Dublin.  The report also outlines the schools that should be requested to make additional provision.  This report will now be considered and if I agree with the position as set out by NCSE, next steps in the process will be considered which may include serving a statutory notice on schools identified if required.</p>  <p>  At each stage of the process, schools are given the opportunity to make representations and there is also an option for arbitration.  Statutory notices issued under the Act together with the representations received from the schools are published on the Department&rsquo;s website.  The necessary steps in the Admissions Act process, will continue to be expedited to ensure that every child has a suitable school placement, which is the key objective of my Department.</p></reply>

All webinars are recorded and subsequently made available on their website. JCT has continued to provide on-going sustained support to schools via phone and email. </p>  <p>  My Department set up Junior Cycle for Teachers (JCT) as the dedicated support service to support schools in implementing all elements of the Framework for Junior Cycle.

My Department will be flexible in accepting estimated marks and rankings from other schools or colleges, and will look at this issue on a case-by-case basis. All reasonable efforts should be made to obtain a satisfactory evidence base. This includes situations where students are studying subjects outside of school, including the non-curricular languages.</p>  <p>  In the case of students taking a subject outside school, the detailed guidance for schools published on 21 May provides details of how schools should proceed if school management authorities are confident that there is sufficient evidence of the student&rsquo;s achievement to make an objective judgement.</p>  <p>  For students in receipt of home tuition with an association to the school, the guidance published on 21 May provides information for school authorities to engage with the home tutor in arriving at a decision.</p>  <p>  If the student is not being taught by a registered teacher, the principal will need to consider whether there is sufficient evidence on which to base an estimate. If there is not sufficient evidence, then it is highly unlikely that the Department will be able to generate a calculated grade for that subject. </p>  <p>  In general, provided an estimated mark and ranking can be generated from a teacher in a way that is fair to all candidates, my Department will seek to provide a calculated grade. Students will be able to use this calculated grade in the same way as a Leaving Certificate grade to satisfy minimum entry requirements.</p>  <p>  Where it is not possible to provide a calculated grade students will have the opportunity to sit the 2020 Leaving Certificate examination at a later date when it is safe to do so. </p></reply>

Since the outbreak of Covid-19, officials from my Department have had engagement with teacher representatives where they have outlined their concerns .  </p><p>The English Language Education Working Group for this sector has been established with a remit to address the issues arising from the Covid-19 pandemic with a priority and focus placed in the first instance on issues affecting students as well as other issues arising e.g. how stakeholders can work together to promote the sector as international markets move into recovery. The working group is comprised of key sectorial stakeholders including officials from my Department, Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI), the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Enterprise Ireland, as well as lead sectorial representative bodies of providers and learner advocates.</p><p>The coordination of the response of the wider education system to the Covid-19 outbreak is a substantial challenge. In this context, the Department has found the current structure of the working group to be effective in delivering on its remit and, while the Department remains open to views, there are no current plans to expand membership.

It is to be expected that ensuring the health and safety of staff and students will be central to the provider's plans and that necessary consultations will be undertaken as part of their development. It is anticipated that the &quot;Return to Work Safely Protocol&quot; recently published jointly by the Department of Health and the Department of Enterprise, Business &amp;amp; Innovation, and designed to support measures being put in place that will prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the workplace will be used to inform these plans.

This means that no school will receive an allocation less than that which they have on the date of issue of this Circular and existing SNAs currently in standard SNA posts can continue in these posts for the next school year in the normal way.  </p><p>- Schools may apply to the NCSE for additionality where they can demonstrate that the current allocation does not meet additional care needs within the mainstream classes in the school. Applications for additionality arising from significant new or emerging additional care needs, which cannot be catered within existing allocations, will be dealt with by way of an exceptional review process. </p><p>- A diagnosis of a disability, or a psychological or other professional report, will not be necessary for this process.  </p><p>- The role of the SNA to support the care needs of students in mainstream classes, as set out in Circular 0030/2014, remains unchanged.  </p><p>It is expected that schools will review and reprioritise the deployment of SNAs within mainstream settings and allocate resources to ensure those with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support. Providing access to SNA support continues to be based on primary care needs as outlined in DES Circular 0030/2014.</p><p>Detailed information on the NCSE exceptional review process is published on the NCSE website <i>www.ncse.ie</i>. </p><p>The NCSE will endeavour to respond to all applications for exceptional review received prior to 22nd May 2020 by 30th June 2020 and in that regard, it will prioritise applications from schools with no current SNA allocation and developing schools. </p><p>Applications for an Exceptional Review received after 22 May 2020 will continue to be processed once all other applications have been completed. </p><p>The exceptional review process for mainstream allocations will be available to schools throughout the 2020/21 school year. </p><p>As this question relates to a particular school and pupil, I have referred the question to the NCSE for their direct reply. I do not have a role in making determinations in individual cases.</p><p>A new frontloading model for allocating Special Needs Assistants to primary and post primary schools for students in mainstream classes only was to be introduced in the 2020/21 school year as part of the phased roll out of the School Inclusion Model (SIM). Due to the disruption caused by the Covid-19 public health crisis, the introduction of the model has been deferred for one year.</p></reply>

Since the outbreak of Covid-19, officials from my Department have had engagement with teacher representatives where they have outlined their concerns .  </p>  <p>  The English Language Education Working Group for this sector has been established with a remit to address the issues arising from the Covid-19 pandemic with a priority and focus placed in the first instance on issues affecting students as well as other issues arising e.g. how stakeholders can work together to promote the sector as international markets move into recovery. The working group is comprised of key sectorial stakeholders including officials from my Department, Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI), the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Enterprise Ireland, as well as lead sectorial representative bodies of providers and learner advocates. </p>  <p>  The coordination of the response of the wider education system to the Covid-19 outbreak is a substantial challenge. In this context, the Department has found the current structure of the working group to be effective in delivering on its remit and, while the Department remains open to views, there are no current plans to expand membership.  To date, the Group has facilitated an appropriate level of engagement with stakeholders alongside the ability to identify and help resolve issues as they arise.  The Department and the members of the Working Group will continue to engage with external parties, to seek to exchange information where relevant and address queries where possible. </p>  <p>In respect of the safe re-opening of English language education providers, the timeline and arrangements for this will be guided by public health advice applicable at a given time. On May 1st  , the Taoiseach announced the roadmap for the gradual lifting of the current Covid-19 restrictions. This roadmap sets out a number of phases with the re-opening of the wider education system contained in the later phases to coincide broadly with the beginning of the new academic year.</p>  <p>  My Department will engage with provider representatives within the English language education sector as they develop more detailed plans for the re-opening of their premises on this basis. It is to be expected that ensuring the health and safety of staff and students will be central to the provider's plans and that necessary consultations will be undertaken as part of their development. It is anticipated that the "Return to Work Safely Protocol" recently published jointly by the Department of Health and the Department of Enterprise, Business &amp;amp; Innovation, and designed to support measures being put in place that will prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the workplace will be used to inform these plans.  Experience of the re-opening of educational facilities in other areas and jurisdictions will also be relevant.</p></reply>

It has established standards for post-qualification professional practice, as set out in Droichead, the integrated professional induction framework for newly qualified primary and post-primary teachers.</p>  <p>  Due to Covid-19 and the unprecedented situation of school closures, on May 22nd last the Teaching Council announced revised arrangements which provide additional flexibility to support newly qualified teachers (NQTs) engaging in Droichead in 2019/2020 to complete the process. These arrangements balance the core principles of the policy which is the school based supportive process coupled with engagement in additional professional learning activities.</p>  <p>  The Council has made a significant concession for NQTs who had not completed the full Droichead process within the minimum period of time by 12 March. This includes the recognition of all elements of Droichead which have been completed up to that date i.e. additional professional learning activities, observations, professional conversations, cluster meetings, Taisce (the professional learning portfolio) and days/hours taught. In normal circumstances this would not be the position.</p>  <p>  Droichead as a process is not simply about teaching time. From a professional standards point of view, it requires the agreement of the NQT and the Professional Support Team in the school that a quality induction process has occurred over the minimum period of time specified.</p>  <p>  I am, however, also aware of concerns raised regarding a smaller group of NQTs who had not met the minimum time requirement by 12 March. I understand the Teaching Council intends to further review their situation i.e. how the Professional Support Teams and any NQTs who may be potentially affected can verify that a quality induction process has occurred throughout the period since 12 March in the context of remote teaching and learning.</p>  <p>  The Teaching Council will communicate the outcome of this review to all concerned within the next two weeks.</p></reply>

Following the outbreak of Covid-19, officials from my Department have had engagement with teacher representatives where they outlined a number their concerns.  </p>  <p>  The working group for this sector has been established with a remit to address the issues arising from the Covid-19 pandemic with a priority and focus placed on those issues affecting students. The working group is comprised of key sectorial stakeholders including officials from my Department, Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI), the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Enterprise Ireland, the lead sectorial representative bodies of providers and learner advocates. The coordination of the response of the wider education system to the Covid-19 outbreak is a substantial challenge. In this context, the Department has found the current structure of the working group to be effective on delivering on its remit. To date, it has facilitated an appropriate level of engagement with stakeholders alongside the ability to focus on specific issues and ensure delivery as needed. </p>  <p>  While the Department remains open to views, there are no current plans to expand membership.  To date, the Group has facilitated an appropriate level of engagement with stakeholders alongside the ability to identify and help resolve issues as they arise.  The Department and the members of the working group will continue to engage with external parties, to seek to exchange information where relevant and address queries where possible.</p></reply>

The act requires schools to be fair and transparent in deciding how to prioritise children for admission to the school. </p><p>On 14th January 2020 a number of sections of the act were commenced introducing new laws around admission to schools which became operational on 1 February 2020. These provisions apply to admission processes for the 2021/2022 school year onwards.</p><p>The most recently commenced sections of the act include a provision for waiting lists in existence on 1 February 2020 to be phased out five years from that date. The rationale behind this is that the use of waiting lists can give rise to discrimination, in particular in relation to people who have newly moved into an area, people who are renting, and those that have returned home from overseas. Schools planning to use historical waiting lists to fill their all of their school places must set this out in their annual admission notice which will notify parents that there are no available places for that school year.</p><p>My Department has provided a FAQ document with information for schools and parents on this and other related matters. This document and other relevant information on school admissions is available on my Departments website at the following link:</p><p><i></i></p></reply>

For example, a teacher could seek a temporary re-assignment between:</p><p>- an urban school and a rural school or vice versa</p><p>- a large school with a single class per teacher and a smaller school with multi-grade classes</p><p>- a junior school, that is infants to second class and a senior school where they would teach third to sixth class</p><p>- a single gender school and a mixed gender school</p><p>- a mainstream school and a special school </p><p>- a DEIS school and a non-DEIS school</p><p>- a multi-medium school and a Gaelscoil/school in a Gaeltacht area or vice versa&rdquo; </p><p>In accordance with the terms of the scheme, the minimum period for which a re-assignment may be facilitated is one school year and the maximum is three school years.

This means that no school will receive an allocation less than that which they have on the date of issue of this Circular and existing SNAs currently in standard SNA posts can continue in these posts for the next school year in the normal way.  </p><p>- Schools may apply to the NCSE for additionality where they can demonstrate that the current allocation does not meet additional care needs within the mainstream classes in the school. Applications for additionality arising from significant new or emerging additional care needs, which cannot be catered within existing allocations, will be dealt with by way of an exceptional review process. </p><p>- A diagnosis of a disability, or a psychological or other professional report, will not be necessary for this process.  </p><p>- The role of the SNA to support the care needs of students in mainstream classes, as set out in Circular 0030/2014, remains unchanged.  </p><p>It is expected that schools will review and reprioritise the deployment of SNAs within mainstream settings and allocate resources to ensure those with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support.

The working group is comprised of key sectorial stakeholders including officials from my Department, Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI), the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Enterprise Ireland, as well as lead sectorial representative bodies of providers and learner advocates.</p>  <p>  The coordination of the response of the wider education system to the Covid-19 outbreak is a substantial challenge. In this context, the Department has found the current structure of the working group to be effective in delivering on its remit and, while the Department remains open to views, there are no current plans to expand membership.  To date, the Group has facilitated an appropriate level of engagement with stakeholders alongside the ability to identify and help resolve issues as they arise.  The Department and the members of the working group will continue to engage with external parties, to seek to exchange information where relevant and address queries where possible.</p>  <p>  In respect of the safe re-opening of English language education providers, the timeline and arrangements for this will be guided by public health advice applicable at a given time. On May 1st, the Taoiseach announced the roadmap for the gradual lifting of the current Covid-19 restrictions. This roadmap sets out a number of phases with the re-opening of the wider education system contained in the later phases to coincide broadly with the beginning of the new academic year.</p>  <p>  My Department will engage with provider representatives within the English language education sector as they develop more detailed plans for the re-opening of their premises on this basis. It is to be expected that ensuring the health and safety of staff and students will be central to the provider's plans and that necessary consultations will be undertaken as part of their development. It is anticipated that the "Return to Work Safely Protocol" recently published jointly by the Department of Health and the Department of Enterprise, Business &amp;amp; Innovation, and designed to support measures being put in place that will prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the workplace will be used to inform these plans.  Experience of the re-opening of educational facilities in other areas and jurisdictions will also be relevant.</p></reply>

As part of this engagement, each of the education partners were given the opportunity to outline the key issues that they would like to have considered in the context of re-opening schools.  </p><p>The issues raised by the education partners will now be worked through in detail as part of the development of the roadmap for reopening schools.</p><p>A core objective will be to ensure that schools and other education settings can re-open and operate in a safe manner that is consistent with public health advice. </p><p>My Department is aware of concerns that the closure of schools has impacted hardest upon families who have children with complex needs whose well-being and engagement with learning depend very much on the routine of school and their relationships with other students, teachers and Special Needs Assistants.  </p><p>They have also lost out on specialist supports during this closure period.</p><p>My Department has taken a number of initiatives to support children and young people who are at risk of educational disadvantage during the period of school closures.</p><p>These include &ndash;</p><p>-Guidance issued to all schools to support the ongoing learning of children with special educational needs and children who are at risk of disadvantage;</p><p>- Guidance and resources developed by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) on supporting children with special educational needs</p><p>- &euro;10m in ICT grant funding to schools towards the purchase of technology and devices to support students at risk of educational disadvantage.</p><p>- Continued funding of Home Tuition or, where this is not possible, flexibility to bank hours for use at a later time in the year</p><p>- Resources to support good mental health and well-being amongst students produced by the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) </p><p>- To help schools plan for the new academic year, schools have been informed that their SNA allocation is being frozen at this year&rsquo;s level and there is provision for additionality where this might be required. No school will therefore have a lower allocation for the next school year.</p><p>- The Middletown Centre for Autism has developed a range of online resources for children and young people with Autism and their parents on education provision in the Home.</p><p>Unfortunately, due to the Covid-19 health crisis, it is not possible to deliver the normal July Provision programme in the same way and at the same time as in other years.  </p><p>However my Department is planning for a summer provision type programme for children with complex needs this year as soon as it is safe to do so and in accordance with public health advice. </p><p>The primary aim of the proposed programme would be to limit potential regression in learning thereby ensuring in so far as possible that these children can reintegrate and transition into their planned education setting for next year with their peers.  </p><p>This may be done through a targeted level of supports to address regression of social skills and re-establish tolerance of routines paving the way for reintegrating full time into education when schools reopen in the autumn.  </p><p>Planning is underway and consultations with stakeholders have commenced. The willingness of schools, teachers and SNAs to participate are key to the provision of a summer education programme. </p><p>An announcement will be made as soon as possible.</p></reply>

This group is comprised of representatives of relevant Government Departments and representatives of both students and English language education providers. </p>  <p>  As part of the wider Covid-19 response, the Government has introduced a number of measures to support businesses at this time. These measures include a temporary wages subsidy scheme to facilitate employers to keep employees on the payroll throughout the Covid-19 pandemic in order to retain this link for when business increases after the crisis. This scheme is administered by the Revenue Commissioners and is available to providers in the English language education sector. Additionally for those staff in this sector who have lost their jobs because of the pandemic, they are eligible to apply for the Government&rsquo;s Covid-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment. </p>  <p>  In addition to the above, providers in this sector will be eligible to apply, where appropriate, for further Covid-19 business supports made available by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation via Enterprise Ireland and through its network of Local Enterprise Offices.    </p>  <p>  In respect of the safe re-opening of English language education providers, the timeline and arrangements for this will be guided by public health advice applicable at a given time. On May 1st, the Taoiseach announced the roadmap for the gradual lifting of the current Covid-19 restrictions. This roadmap sets out a number of phases with the re-opening of the wider education system contained in the later phases to coincide broadly with the beginning of the new academic year.</p>  <p>  My Department will engage with provider representatives within the English language education sector as they develop more detailed plans for the re-opening of their premises on this basis. It is to be expected that ensuring the health and safety of staff and students will be central to the provider's plans and that necessary consultations will be undertaken as part of their development. It is anticipated that the "Return to Work Safely Protocol" recently published jointly by the Department of Health and the Department of Enterprise, Business &amp;amp; Innovation, and designed to support measures being put in place that will prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the workplace will be used to inform these plans.  Experience of the re-opening of educational facilities in other areas and jurisdictions will also be relevant.</p></reply>

Schools were asked to be conscious of pupils who may not have access to online facilities and to adapt approaches so that these pupils continued to have the opportunity to participate in learning. </p>  <p>  The aim of these distant learning approaches, the guidance which issued to all schools and the regular engagement with students, was to ensure that students stayed connected with and progressed their learning.  These actions will, therefore, have helped to minimise the impact of school closure.  </p>  <p>  In the context of planning for a return to school which is underway, my Department is, inter alia, considering the curriculum, i.e. what needs to be put in place to support ongoing progression for learners and addressing any shortfall that may result from school closures.  Those going into sixth year in post primary schools are a group that will receive a particular focus in the context of preparations for the Leaving Certificate examinations in 2021.</p>  <p>  My Department is acutely aware of the challenges faced by students at this difficult time, and how the current circumstances  will continue to present challenges into the future.

Kilkenny.</p><p>The NCSE is planning a further expansion of special class and school places nationally to meet identified need for next year. This process is ongoing, </p><p>It is open to any school to make an application to the NCSE for the establishment of a specialised provision and where sanctioned, a range of supports, including capital funding, is made available to the school. The Department of Education and Skills works closely with the NCSE in this regard.</p><p>Normally, special class and school places are established with the full cooperation of the schools in areas where they are required.  However there are some parts of the country where the NCSE has faced challenges in getting schools and their patrons to voluntarily agree to provide special class or school places. I know that this can cause much anguish for parents and families involved.</p><p>As Minister for Education and Skills, I have power under Section 37A of the Education Act 1998 to direct a school to provide additional provision where all reasonable efforts have failed. This legislation has been used to good effect in the recent past.</p><p>The enrolment of a child to a school is a matter in the first instance for the parents/ guardians of the child and the Board of Management of a school.  My Department has no role in relation to processing applications for enrolment to schools. </p><p>The NCSE team of locally based Special Education Needs Organisers (SENOs) are available to assist parents/guardians to identify appropriate educational placements for children with special educational needs and to discuss their child's special educational needs. Parents may contact SENOs directly using the contact details available at:</p><p><i>https://ncse.ie/regional-services-contact-list </i></p><p>The NCSE works in collaboration with the Educational Welfare Services (EWS) of the Child and Family Agency which is the statutory agency that can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child or can offer assistance where a child is out of school. The local service is delivered through the national network of Educational Welfare Officers (EWO). Contact details are available at</p><p><i></i>. </p><p>It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of all schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act, 1998.  The selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. Under section 15 (2) (d) of the Education Act 1998, each school is legally obliged to publish its enrolment policy.</p><p>It should be noted that where a parent/guardian seeks to enrol a child in a school and that school refuses to enrol the child, the school is obliged to inform the parents/guardians of their right under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of my Department.  Only where an appeal under Section 29 is upheld, may the Secretary General of my Department direct a school to enrol a pupil.</p></reply>

We are currently undertaking a number of actions to ensure this.</p>  <p>  A range of guidance has already been published to assist schools and teachers to ensure continuity of learning to support students while out of school. This guidance has issued to schools to support the continuity of teaching and learning, to support those with special educational needs, to support those at risk of educational disadvantage and to support the well-being of students. Further guidance is being developed to support primary schools.  This guidance has been developed in consultation with all th management bodies and unions.</p>  <p>  Schools have adopted various ways to engage with their students and these will vary in accordance with the technology and broadband resources available in school and at the home. Schools are engaging with students and parents using various means such as by post, e-mails, communication apps or the school website. Where technology permits, students may have regular engagement with their teacher/s on platforms such as Google Classroom, Microsoft Office 365 and Edmodo or participate in live meetings through the use of tools such as Google Meet, Microsoft Teams and Webex.  Schools have been asked to be conscious of pupils who may not have access to online facilities and to adapt approaches so that these pupils continue to have the opportunity to participate in learning. The aim of these distant learning approaches is to ensure that children stay connected with learning to facilitate progression to the next level of their education.</p>  <p>  Schools are best placed to make decisions with regards to the learning of their pupils including language.    Resources are available on websites such as COGG.ie, PDST.ie and gaeloideachas.ie to assist schools at this time.  Parents of children in Irish-medium schools are encouraged to provide opportunities for their children to hear and engage with the Irish language, using Irish language television programmes and resources provided from their schools and from the websites mentioned above.</p>  <p>  In order to complement the efforts of teachers and parents/guardians to support continuity of learning, TG4 is broadcasting C&uacute;la4 ar Scoil, a half-hour Irish-language programme broadcast daily by Fib&iacute;n Teo (10.00 am-10.30am) incorporating a range of Irish-language dialects.  Lessons can also be viewed on TG4 Player. C&uacute;la4 ar Scoil includes learning experiences drawn from core curriculum subjects including Irish, Mathematics, History, Geography with an emphasis on creativity, the arts (Music, Visual Arts and Drama), oral traditions, SPHE/PE (health and well-being). In order to further engage children immediately before and after the C&uacute;la4 ar Scoil, programme (9.30am to 11am), TG4 has added additional features to other programmes including Bia Linn, &Aacute;r Sc&eacute;al, Timmy ag Foghlaim, Is Eola&iacute; M&eacute; agus WAC.</p>  <p>  This programme, which commenced on 20 April, is presented by two practising primary school teachers with a high levels of proficiency in Irish, with contributions from teachers and facilitators from other communities and Gaeltacht regions.  The timetable for lessons is posted online in advance of the series of lessons covered the following week to inform teachers, parents and children.  </p>  <p>  C&uacute;la4 ar Scoil will run until the end of June 2020 and it is planned that it will resume in September 2020.</p>  <p>  A 5-week thematic Summer Camp-type Programme will be broadcast on TG4 from 29 June 2020 through to the beginning of August 2020.</p></reply>

As part of this engagement, each of the education partners were given the opportunity to outline the key issues that they would like to have considered in the context of re-opening schools.  </p><p>The issues raised by the education partners will now be worked through in detail as part of the development of the roadmap for reopening schools.</p><p>A core objective will be to ensure that schools and other education settings can re-open and operate in a safe manner that is consistent with public health advice. </p><p>In the interim, my Department has provided a range of support and guidance for schools on how to provide for the continuing education for pupils over the current school closure period. </p><p>Supports are provided to schools and teachers engaged in distance learning and these are available at <i></i></p><p>In addition to the general guidance that has been provided for schools, additional support material has also been provided specifically on how schools should provide for the continuity of education for children with special educational needs. This guidance is available at:</p><p><i> </i></p><p><i></i></p><p>The guidance notes that there is a particular need for pupils with special educational needs (SEN) to have regular, ongoing schooling. While all pupils need to be supported to maintain their engagement in learning, those with SEN are among those who need most support at this time. Examples of strategies and measures to ensure that the needs of pupils with SEN are catered for, are provided in the guidance documents and a range of resources are also identified for parents.</p><p>It sets out the role of schools and teachers in engaging with pupils with SEN and the role of teachers and school leaders to support such pupils. It advises schools as to how best to keep in touch with parents and guardians and how to keep pupils with SEN safe and engaged in the distance learning environment.</p><p>The guidance sets out the role of the special education teacher to support children with special educational needs at this time. It notes that the special education teacher&rsquo;s knowledge of their pupils&rsquo; priority learning needs and agreed targets, as outlined in the pupil support file, will enable them to work with parents and guardians to choose appropriate supports in a remote learning environment. </p><p>Special Education Teachers (SETs) are asked to carefully examine how progress on the existing learning targets in student support plans can be reasonably extended by home learning. They are asked to use this knowledge to communicate with the pupils and their parents and guardians and to establish what methods will work best to achieve continuity of learning for the pupils.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is also providing a range of online resources for parents and teachers to support home learning for children with special educational needs during the Covid 19 restrictions.</p><p>In addition to the normal supports, the NCSE is providing online resources for children with Special Educational Needs who are at home as a result of the schools&rsquo; closure. </p><p>Supports provided include those relating to general learning and difficulties for pupils with SEN, Curriculum support, speech language and communication, occupational therapy support, guidance around behaviour, and learning and resources on &lsquo;Visiting Teachers Support&rsquo; for a teacher who teaches children with sensory impairment</p><p>Details of the full range of supports that the NCSE provides for teachers and parents is available at: </p><p><i>https://ncse.ie/online-resources  </i></p><p>The Department of Education and Skills&rsquo; NEPS psychologists have also developed advice and resources for young people to manage and stay well when schools are closed.

This matter, and matters in relation to social distancing, or additional supports that may be required, will be kept under review in the context of public health advice regarding schools re-opening and the ongoing advice of the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET).</p><p>While recognising the difficulty that school closure has had for parents and pupils, particularly in relation to pupils with special educational needs, my Department will continue to support and encourage schools to provide as much continuity of education as possible for such pupils, while continuing to engage with public health officials and stakeholders in relation to when schools may re-open and operate in a safe manner that is consistent with public health advice.</p></reply>

The programme is a key support for schools under the DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) programme. </p>  <p>  The SCP is under the remit of Department of Children and Youth Affairs (DCYA) who have advised that there are currently no changes planned to the SCP in the immediate short term.  DCYA is currently developing a Policy Blueprint on the future of all Education Support Services provided by Tusla. As part of the implementation of the actions contained in this blueprint, DCYA have advised that a new SCP scheme will be scoped out and developed to ensure that its reach, resources and impact are maximised in supporting young people and work on this will begin once the blueprint is published.</p></reply>

While all pupils need to be supported to maintain their engagement in learning, those with SEN are among those who need most support at this time. Examples of strategies and measures to ensure that the needs of pupils with SEN are catered for, are provided in the guidance documents and a range of resources are also identified for parents.</p><p>It sets out the role of schools and teachers in engaging with pupils with SEN and the role of teachers and school leaders to support such pupils. It advises schools as to how best to keep in touch with parents and guardians and how to keep pupils with SEN safe and engaged in the distance learning environment.</p><p>The guidance sets out the role of the special education teacher to support children with special educational needs at this time. It notes that the special education teacher&rsquo;s knowledge of their pupils&rsquo; priority learning needs and agreed targets, as outlined in the pupil support file, will enable them to work with parents and guardians to choose appropriate supports in a remote learning environment. </p><p>Special Education Teachers (SETs) are asked to carefully examine how progress on the existing learning targets in student support plans can be reasonably extended by home learning.

It will also review the performance of this year&rsquo;s group of students against their overall performance at Junior Cycle.</p>  <p>  The information about each individual and their peers is combined with the information about the school&rsquo;s previous results and previous groups to allow checks that the marks and rankings for each subject in a school and all other schools are reasonable. This means that all candidates across the country are treated fairly. The statistical process being applied will not impose any predetermined score on any individual in a class or school. </p></reply>

Schools were asked to be conscious of pupils who may not have access to online facilities and to adapt approaches so that these pupils continued to have the opportunity to participate in learning. </p>  <p>  The aim of these distant learning approaches, the guidance which issued to all schools and the regular engagement with students, was to ensure that students stayed connected with and progressed their learning.  These actions will, therefore, have helped to minimise the impact of school closure.  </p>  <p>  In the context of planning for a return to school which is underway, my Department is, inter alia, considering the curriculum, i.e. what needs to be put in place to support ongoing progression for learners and addressing any shortfall that may result from school closures.  Those going into sixth year in post primary schools are a group that will receive a particular focus in the context of preparations for the Leaving Certificate examinations in 2021.</p>  <p>  My Department is acutely aware of the challenges faced by students at this difficult time, and how the current circumstances  will continue to present challenges into the future.

This means that no school will receive an allocation less than that which they have on the date of issue of this Circular and existing SNAs currently in standard SNA posts can continue in these posts for the next school year in the normal way. </p>  <p>  - Schools may apply to the NCSE for additionality where they can demonstrate that the current allocation does not meet additional care needs within the mainstream classes in the school. Applications for additionality arising from significant new or emerging additional care needs, which cannot be catered within existing allocations, will be dealt with by way of an exceptional review process. </p>  <p>  - A diagnosis of a disability, or a psychological or other professional report, will not be necessary for this process.  </p>  <p>  - The role of the SNA to support the care needs of students in mainstream classes, as set out in Circular 0030/2014, remains unchanged.  </p>  <p>  It is expected that schools will review and reprioritise the deployment of SNAs within mainstream settings and allocate resources to ensure those with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support. Providing access to SNA support continues to be based on primary care needs as outlined in DES Circular 0030/2014.</p>  <p>  Detailed information on the NCSE exceptional review process is published on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie. </p>  <p>  The NCSE will endeavour to respond to all applications for exceptional review received prior to 22nd May 2020 by 30th June 2020 and in that regard, it will prioritise applications from schools with no current SNA allocation and developing schools. </p>  <p>  Applications for an Exceptional Review received after 22 May 2020 will continue to be processed once all other applications have been completed. </p>  <p>  The exceptional review process for mainstream allocations will be available to schools throughout the 2020/21 school year. </p>  <p>  A new frontloading model for allocating Special Needs Assistants to primary and post primary schools for students in mainstream classes only was to be introduced in the 2020/21 school year as part of the phased roll out of the School Inclusion Model (SIM). Due to the disruption caused by the Covid-19 public health crisis, the introduction of the model has been deferred for one year. </p></reply>

While I have not met with QQI or CORU directly on this issue, my Department is keeping abreast of developments in this regard. </p>  <p>  Since the onset of the Covid-19 outbreak, significant work has been undertaken by a stakeholder group chaired by the Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) and including the representative bodies of education providers to address issues relating to the maintenance of the quality and standards of teaching and learning, assessment and qualifications. This group has focused on the implementation of alternative arrangements, where appropriate and necessary, to meet both these standards and, where applicable, the educational accreditation criteria established by Professional Recognition Bodies (PRBs).</p>  <p>  In the case of Social Care, the awards standards established by QQI including placement requirements reflect the accreditation criteria that have been set out by CORU, Ireland's multi-profession Health and Social Care Regulator and consequently the relevant PRB for this profession. Engagement is ongoing between members of the stakeholders group, QQI and CORU in addition to direct engagement between CORU and individual education providers. These engagements are to ensure that necessary arrangements are put in place to maintain standards of education and training in this area so that students can progress e.g. from second year into third year or, where relevant, graduate with the relevant professional competencies that have been set out by CORU and which are reflected in QQI&rsquo;s award standards.  </p>  <p>  Students should engage directly with their provider for further information on the arrangements being implemented for their particular year and course.</p></reply>

This means that no school will receive an allocation less than that which they have on the date of issue of this Circular and existing SNAs currently in standard SNA posts can continue in these posts for the next school year in the normal way.  </p><p>- Schools may apply to the NCSE for additionality where they can demonstrate that the current allocation does not meet additional care needs within the mainstream classes in the school. Applications for additionality arising from significant new or emerging additional care needs, which cannot be catered within existing allocations, will be dealt with by way of an exceptional review process. </p><p>- A diagnosis of a disability, or a psychological or other professional report, will not be necessary for this process.  </p><p>- The role of the SNA to support the care needs of students in mainstream classes, as set out in Circular 0030/2014, remains unchanged.  </p><p>It is expected that schools will review and reprioritise the deployment of SNAs within mainstream settings and allocate resources to ensure those with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support. Providing access to SNA support continues to be based on primary care needs as outlined in DES Circular 0030/2014.</p><p>Detailed information on the NCSE exceptional review process is published on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie. </p><p>The NCSE will endeavour to respond to all applications for exceptional review received prior to 22nd May 2020 by 30th June 2020 and in that regard, it will prioritise applications from schools with no current SNA allocation and developing schools. </p><p>Applications for an Exceptional Review received after 22 May 2020 will continue to be processed once all other applications have been completed. </p><p>The exceptional review process for mainstream allocations will be available to schools throughout the 2020/21 school year. </p><p>A new frontloading model for allocating Special Needs Assistants to primary and post primary schools for students in mainstream classes only was to be introduced in the 2020/21 school year as part of the phased roll out of the School Inclusion Model (SIM). Due to the disruption caused by the Covid-19 public health crisis, the introduction of the model has been deferred for one year. </p><p>The National Council for Special Education published the allocations for the coming school year on 28<sup>th</sup>May last and they are available on their website, www.ncse.ie.</p></reply>

While all pupils need to be supported to maintain their engagement in learning, those with SEN are among those who need most support at this time. Examples of strategies and measures to ensure that the needs of pupils with SEN are catered for, are provided in the guidance documents and a range of resources are also identified for parents.</p><p>It sets out the role of schools and teachers in engaging with pupils with SEN and the role of teachers and school leaders to support such pupils.

Under this scheme, the Department provided funding of &euro;16.9 million in 2019 to all of these schools.  </p>  <p>  I also announced additional funding of &euro;1million which is being allocated to 102 Primary DEIS schools for a new pilot programme for the 2020/21 school year.   The aim of this pilot is to provide free school books for students in the schools involved, and to support these schools in eliminating the cost of school books for parents. Under Circular 46/2013, DEIS schools receive a book grant of &euro;21 per student.  This pilot will provide an additional &euro;64 per student to increase the overall book grant rate to &euro;85 per student enrolled in the school.  This additional funding issued to schools in May 2020.  </p>  <p>  The decision to use e-books and secure information technology tools is a matter for the Board of Management of a school.  Where the introduction of new technology is planned, consultation with members of the school community including parents is advised.  The cost and other implications must be fully considered by the Boards of Management before a decision is made.  </p>  <p>  An advice sheet on the adoption of tablets in schools is available on the PDST-Technology in Education (PDST-TIE) website, detailing what tablets can offer a school, educational considerations, purchasing considerations and software.</p>  <p>  Schools who pay the ICLA license fee are covered by license for reproducing material for educational purposes, either online or in print. Most publishers issue eBooks for free with the purchase of their text books, but this is at the publisher&rsquo;s discretion.  It is up to the school to negotiate the package with the various companies should they feel that the product will be useful in their delivery of the curriculum.</p></reply>

The National Co-ordination group for tertiary education is meeting on a regular basis, and is closely monitoring the impact that Covid-19 is having on third level institutions and their current and prospective students.</p>  <p>  In light of the current public health circumstances, it is difficult to predict the expected international student numbers for next academic year. Much depends on unfolding events such as all available national and international public health advice, particularly in respect of international travel for programmes where a physical presence in Ireland is needed. </p>  <p>  Higher education institutions are autonomous with regard to management of their academic affairs including admissions procedures. The CAO processes applications for undergraduate, and some postgraduate, courses on behalf of the HEIs.  Decisions on admissions are made by the HEIs which then instruct the CAO to make offers to successful candidates. This remains the case this year, including in the case of any drop in domestic or international enrolments. </p></reply>

Schools were asked to be conscious of pupils who may not have access to online facilities and to adapt approaches so that these pupils continued to have the opportunity to participate in learning. </p>  <p>  The aim of these distant learning approaches, the guidance which issued to all schools and the regular engagement with students, was to ensure that students stayed connected with and progressed their learning.  These actions will, therefore, have helped to minimise the impact of school closure.  </p>  <p>  In the context of planning for a return to school which is underway, my Department is, inter alia, considering the curriculum, i.e. what needs to be put in place to support ongoing progression for learners and addressing any shortfall that may result from school closures.  Those going into sixth year in post primary schools are a group that will receive a particular focus in the context of preparations for the Leaving Certificate examinations in 2021.</p>  <p>  My Department is acutely aware of the challenges faced by students at this difficult time, and how the current circumstances  will continue to present challenges into the future.

The working group is comprised of key sectorial stakeholders including officials from my Department, Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI), the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Enterprise Ireland and the lead sectorial representative bodies of providers.

In this context, the Department has found that the current structure of the working group to be effective on delivering on its remit. To date, it has facilitated an appropriate level of engagement with stakeholders alongside the ability to focus on specific issues and ensure delivery as needed. </p>  <p>  My Department recognises the important role that teachers play in this sector and the support they have and continue to provide for students at this time. Since the outbreak of Covid-19, officials from my Department have had engagement with teacher representatives where they have outlined their concerns.  </p>  <p>  While it will be kept under review, the membership of the Working Group will not be expanded at the present time to include any further participants. However, the Department and the members of the Working Group will continue engage with external parties, seek to exchange information where relevant and address queries where possible.</p></reply>

The mother can take maternity leave from casual or part-time employment. She can take up to 26 weeks of paid maternity leave, and up to a further 16 weeks of unpaid leave. Two weeks must be taken before the baby is due, and at least four weeks must be taken after the birth. As Minister of State for Justice and Equality, the legislation that governs the provision of maternity leave is my responsibility and any such amendment would likely require primary legislation. The provision of maternity benefit is under the remit of the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection. These matters are currently being examined by Government. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware on 29 May the Minister for Finance announced changes to the Wage Subsidy Scheme to accommodate the salaries of parents returning from maternity or adoptive leave. The changes are aimed at individuals who may not have been on the payroll of their employer on 29 February, or been paid in either January or February 2020 and will allow for consistent treatment with other employees. </p>  <p>  Minister Donohoe has advised that the amendment will be legislated for later in the year as part of the usual Finance Bill 2020 process, but that in the interim Revenue has agreed that the provision will be implemented from 26 March where applicable. Input from employers is required and relevant employers are therefore encouraged to contact Revenue when the system update is launched so that the process of including the salaries of affected employees may begin as quickly as possible. It is expected the update will be launched on 12 June. </p>  <p>  I am conscious of demands on parents at this time and hope that the additional measures to support working parents that I have introduced in recent years, including the new parent&rsquo;s leave scheme and an extension of parental leave, are helping to ease some of these demands. In addition to maternity leave, each parent may also avail of two weeks of parent&rsquo;s leave during the first year of a child&rsquo;s life and may qualify for parent&rsquo;s benefit during this period.  Parental leave is also available which entitles parents to take unpaid leave from work to spend time looking after their children. Parents can take up to 22 weeks of parental leave for each eligible child before their 12th birthday.</p></reply>

The Department of Justice and Equality is in the process of preparing legislation to address this issue and amend adoptive leave entitlement for all new fathers. </p>  <p>  This approach means that considerable amendment is required in the Adoptive Leave Act and to other legislation. The changes will allow all couples to choose who takes adoptive leave. The Department of Justice and Equality and the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel are presently working on this. The Government's approach is that all adopting couples should have the option of selecting the qualifying adopter.</p></reply>

This requires that competitions run within the Civil Service are fair, transparent and merit-based selection process, in line with its principles and standards. </p>  <p>  In January 2020 an internal competition for promotion to Higher Executive Officer was launched by my Department. Candidates were informed in advance that shortlisting would be required to provide a manageable number of candidates for final stage interview and on this occasion computer-based testing was utilised in order to shortlist. Such shortlisting and testing is a common feature of competitions run by the Public Appointments Service and across the Civil Service.</p>  <p>  While a supervised recheck of computer-based results is a feature of some competitions, it is not necessarily used in all cases. </p>  <p>  There is an expectation that officers of the Department act with utmost integrity at all times. Candidates agreed to complete the assessments themselves without any external assistance, and to participate in the assessment process honestly and fairly. They did so knowing that misrepresenting themselves or their skills could result in disqualification from the process and would be a serious disciplinary matter. Candidates would also have been aware that they may be subject to retesting under supervised conditions at a later stage in the process. </p>  <p>  It is open to candidates dissatisfied with any element of a competition to ask for a review under the CPSA Code of Practice, within set timelines. The review process is clearly laid out in both the Code of Practice and in the Competition Booklet issued to candidates.</p></reply>

I have also been regularly briefed by the Commissioner and senior Garda&iacute; on progress made in relation to various investigations being handled by the Division; and I have met directly with members of the communities served by DMR North.</p>  <p>  Garda&iacute; are undertaking significant activity to counter drug crime at the local level, supporting communities through various preventative and detection initiatives. This includes engagement with Local and Regional Drug and Alcohol Task Forces; the Garda Youth Diversion Programme and Projects; the Garda Schools Programme; the Joint Policing Committees and Community Policing Fora.  Debt and debt intimidation are also getting focused attention: the Drug Related Intimidation Reporting Programme, developed by Garda&iacute; and the National Family Support Network, has been in place since 2013 to respond to the needs of drug users and family members experiencing drug related intimidation. </p>  <p>  In addition Garda resources in the Division have been increased significantly.  I understand from the Garda authorities that there are 804 Garda&iacute; assigned to the DMR North at the end of April 2020, representing a 20% increase compared to the end of 2015.  Of these, there are 247 Garda&iacute; assigned to the Coolock District representing a 25% increase compared to the end of 2015.  Members in DMR include those assigned to Divisional specialist units such as Drugs and Community Policing. There are now also 62 Garda staff, an increase of 63% in the same time period. Taken together, this increase in the Garda workforce represents a very significant increase in operational policing hours in the DMR North. These Garda members and staff are of course supported and supplemented by personnel from the national and regional units, when required. </p>  <p>  In relation to specific issues being experienced by some communities in the Division, l understand that liaison is ongoing with relevant stakeholders, including the Local Authorities, Tusla and the HSE.</p>  <p>  Further, as the Deputy may be aware, Dublin City Council has tasked a former Garda Assistant Commissioner with examining and reporting on the needs of the area referred to.  I understand that this work is ongoing. </p>  <p>  Finally, I note that a key principle arising from the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing is that policing is not the responsibility of the police alone, but also involves other agencies of Government, such as health or social services, as well as other sectors of society.  This principle is at the centre of a new policy on community safety which is being developed in my Department.  The policy, which will be given a statutory basis in the new Policing and Community Safety Bill, proposes to establish and support a system of community safety at local level across the country.  Through cross-sectoral collaboration, and by drawing on the available services, these systems will be best placed to identify, support and implement, community safety according to the needs of the local community.  </p></reply>

I am regularly briefed by the Commissioner on the matter. </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that Garda&iacute; are dedicated to tackling gang-related violence in Drogheda and ensuring the safety of all citizens in the community and the wider area.   There is a dedicated policing operation in place, Operation Stratus, which specifically targets the ongoing feud.  This includes high visibility patrols and checkpoints, days of action and covert policing initiatives targeting specific individuals.  </p>  <p>  In addition, Garda resources in the region have been increased significantly.  I understand from the Garda authorities that there are 158 Garda&iacute; assigned to the Drogheda District at the end of April 2020, representing a 49% increase compared to the end of 2015. There are now also 19 Garda staff, an increase of 73% in the same time period.

This level of funding is enabling sustained, ongoing recruitment of Garda members and staff and as a result, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is a growing organisation.  We now have over 14,700 Garda members nationwide, supported by over 3,000 Garda staff and these numbers continue to grow. </p><p>Extensive information is available on my Department&rsquo;s website in relation to the numbers of Garda members and their assignment nationwide at the following link This information is updated every month with the latest data provided by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Details in relation to the number of Garda staff nationwide are also available on my Department's website at the following link: </p><p>There has been a significant increase in Garda resources in Meath in recent years.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that as of the end of April 2020, a total of 346 Garda members were assigned to the Meath Division, in addition to 43 Garda staff. By contrast, in December 2015 there were a total of 277 Garda members and 26 Garda staff in the Division.</p><p>The Deputy may also be interested to know that the rollout by the Garda Commissioner of the new Garda Operating Model meets a key commitment in A Policing Service for the Future, the four-year implementation plan giving effect to the recommendations of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  This model has been long recommended by independent policing specialists, including the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate and while new to Ireland, it is the standard in other countries. The new Operating Model is designed to provide a more responsive, localised policing service to communities and it streamlines Garda administration and re-organises resources in order to do so.</p><p>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the Meath Division is one of Divisions piloting the new Operating Model.  I am confident that adoption by the Commissioner of this new structure will lead to an improved policing service in Meath as well as in other communities nationwide.</p></reply>

In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s specific question, I can confirm that it is intended that the review will seek to include the views of those who are engaged in prostitution and those who have been victims of human trafficking as well as, inter alia, seeking to assess the impact of the Act&rsquo;s operation on the safety and well-being of persons who engage in sexual activity for payment.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the goal of the legislation is to protect vulnerable persons.  In this context the review will include consideration of whether further measures are needed to strengthen protection for persons who engage in sexual activity for payment.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy  will appreciate,  the approach to be adopted for the review, including the means for consultation with stakeholders, will need to take account of the current context of the Covid-19 pandemic. The details and logistics of the approach to be adopted are being finalised and will be announced as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  Finally, I can confirm that the report will be published by my Department when complete.</p></reply>

Garda action in this regard is underpinned by primary and secondary legislation introduced by the Minister for Health and in particular the additional temporary powers provided for under section 31A of the Health Act 1947 and brought into effect by the Health Act 1947- Section 31A- Temporary Restrictions (COVID 19) Regulations 2020.</p><p>The Garda Commissioner and his senior team have implemented a carefully graduated policing response, based on its strong tradition of policing by consent.  Garda members engage, explain and encourage members of the public to comply and, only as a last resort, make use of their enforcement powers under these regulations.</p><p>As Minister, I have taken a number of specific actions in the interest of transparency and in order to maintain public trust and confidence in the manner in which these powers are being exercised: I requested the Garda Commissioner to compile and publish a record of any use of these temporary powers, and he is going so on a weekly basis. I also requested the Policing Authority to engage with the Commissioner to independently assess and report regularly on the use of these regulations. The Authority is providing me with reports of this kind on a fortnightly basis.</p><p>The Deputy may wish to note that the latest figures published by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na show that from 8 April, when the regulations came into effect, until<b></b>30 May 2020 inclusive, Garda&iacute; have invoked the regulations 289 times. This includes both arrests and incidents without arrest where names and addresses were taken for consultation with the DPP on the decision to issue charges.</p><p>This and more information is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: </p><p>The Deputy will appreciate that this data shows that it is only in a very small minority of cases, despite receiving a number of warnings, that some individuals have not been willing to comply with the public health guidelines and the powers provided for in the Health Act and the Health Act 1947- Section 31A- Temporary Restrictions (Covid 19) Regulations 2020 were used.</p><p>The area referred to by the Deputy is policed by Garda&iacute; attached to Store Street Garda Station. I am informed by the Garda authorities that the area referred to by the Deputy is subject to specific operational policing in response to Covid-19, including proactive policing.  Any potential breaches of the regulations are dealt with in keeping with the graduated policing approach set out above. </p></reply>

However, we continue to accept and to process certain priority or emergency cases, including: </p><p>-emergency visas (for healthcare professionals, health researchers, and elderly care professionals, for example);</p><p>- immediate family members of Irish citizens, who are returning to their normal place of residence in Ireland;</p><p>- persons legally resident in the State; and</p><p>- persons entitled to avail of the provision of the EU Free Movement Directive.</p><p>In this way, visas for frontline healthcare professionals and other urgent applications are receiving priority attention.  A family member of a Critical Skills Employment Permit holder does not fall within the categories set out above. </p><p>The central concern in deciding on visa applications remains, as with all visa services worldwide, in trying to strike an appropriate balance between protecting the country's vital national interests by maintaining an effective immigration regime while at the same time facilitating travel for those essential workers who meet the criteria.  Each visa application is therefore decided on its own merits taking all factors into account.</p><p>I can also inform the Deputy that visa applications are generally processed in chronological order from the date received by the processing centre.  I am advised that the application in question was received in the Dublin Visa Office on 5 February 2020.  At the time of the announcement on the 20 March, applications of this type received in the Dublin Visa Office before 9 December 2019 were being processed.</p><p>Unfortunately, the ability of the Immigration Service Delivery function of my Department to process visa applications, such as the one being referred to here, has been severely curtailed as a result of travel and social distancing restrictions both here and in the applicant's home country. However, my Department intends to resume accepting and processing all visa applications again as soon as safety concerns abate.</p><p>The Immigration Service has provided a Frequently Asked Questions document on the impact of COVID-19 on immigration and international protection on its website (<i>www.inis.gov.ie</i>). This document is regularly updated. </p><p>Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

However, the Intoxicating Liquor (Breweries and Distilleries) Act 2018 contains statutory provisions which allow craft breweries and distilleries to obtain a producer&rsquo;s retail licence from the Revenue Commissioners which enables then to sell intoxicating liquor manufactured on the premises to persons visiting the premises subject to specified conditions. </p>  <p>  Section 1(6) of the Act provides that a licence issued or renewed under the Act shall operate to authorise the sale on the premises to which the licence is attached of intoxicating liquor manufactured on the premises:</p>  <p>  a. between the hours of 10.00 a.m. and 7.00 p.m. each day (other than Christmas Day) for consumption on or off the premises, to persons who have completed a guided tour of the premises, where the licence has been issued on foot of a Circuit Court certificate,</p>  <p>  b. between the hours of 10.00 a.m. and 7.00 p.m. each day (other than Christmas Day) for consumption off the premises, to persons who have completed a guided tour of the premises, where the licence has been issued on foot of a District Court certificate, or</p>  <p>  c. between the hours of -</p>  <p>  (i) 10.00 a.m. and 7.00 p.m. each day (other than Christmas Day) or a day to which subparagraph (ii) applies, and</p>  <p>  (ii) 12. 30 p.m. and 7. 00 p.m. on a Sunday, other than a Christmas Day which falls on a Sunday, and St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day, for consumption off the premises, to persons who have not completed a guided tour of the premises, irrespective of whether the licence has been issued on foot of a Circuit Court or a District Court certificate.</p>  <p>  It can be seen, therefore, that off-sales to persons who have not completed a guided tour of the premises are permitted subject to conditions under the 2018 Act, in particular the continued availability of facilities for guided tours of the premises.</p>  <p>  This information may be of some assistance to craft brewers and distilleries throughout the country who, like many enterprises, are finding it very difficult to keep their businesses going during this public health emergency.</p></reply>

Such matters are subject to the normal inspection regimes by the respective authorities, such as the fire authority and the health and safety authority. The respective authorities determine when these inspections are to be carried out. </p><p>In addition, I can inform the Deputy that all accommodation centres under contract to my Department are subject to three unannounced inspections per annum: twice by officials of the Immigration Service of my Department and once by an independent company (QTS Limited).  </p><p>These inspections cover a wide range of issues such as fire safety issues, food hygiene, food quality, information provision, general security and emergency details, child protection issues, provision of TV and Wi-Fi services, staff rosters and the upkeep of all communal areas and bedrooms. </p><p>Any issue identified is communicated in writing to the contractor and the contractor is required to address any issue identified immediately.  Officials from the Immigration Service follow up to ensure that relevant issues have been addressed. </p><p>As a result of the current health and safety restrictions with respect to the COVID-19 crisis, it has not been possible for our inspections to be carried out at this time.Additionally, all centres are currently closed to any visitors to protect residents and staff.  As soon as the HSE advises that it is appropriate to commence these inspections again, the relevant officials in the Immigration Service will resume the inspection process. </p><p>During this time, while we are unable to continue inspections, we are in daily contact with our centres through a dedicated communications team from the International Protection Accommodation Service (IPAS). This team undertakes daily calls with all centre managers across our network of permanent and temporary centres. Feedback from these conversations is reflected in the newsletters circulated to all centre managers to promote shared learning and best practice, which are available to view on our website . The daily calls also ensure that any issues or concerns can be raised without delay for appropriate resolution for the benefit of residents and staff.</p><p>Should residents have any issues or concerns that they wish to raise directly with my Department, they can do so via an email address which is made known to all residents.  Residents can also raise concerns with the Office of the Ombudsman and the Ombudsman for Children and contacts details for these offices are also provided. Officials of my Department have begun holding virtual clinics with residents and a telephone support service run by the Jesuit Refugee Service (JRS) has also been established as an additional support for residents.</p><p>All accommodation centres are carefully following the guidelines for our centres that have been published by the HSE&rsquo;s Health Protection Surveillance Centre, which can be found on its website . That guidance exists precisely because it is recognised that congregated settings such as Direct Provision centres present specific challenges in this pandemic.</p><p>During this time, centre managers have also been advised to increase the standard and frequency of cleaning throughout the centres, paying particular attention to communal areas. A regular supply of hand sanitiser for centres is in place and this is distributed to centres as required. Other PPE is distributed, as needed, and in line with the HPSC guidelines for its appropriate use in residential settings.</p><p>In partnership with the HSE and Safetynet, my Department has put in place a national clinical telephone service to provide public health advice to support centre staff. It is also being used to advise, support and work with locations where vulnerable groups are present relating to the implementation of COVID-19 guidelines and measures.</p><p>While inspections of accommodation centres cannot take place at this time, officials of my Department are continuing to work closely with the HSE and centre management during this time to ensure that any issues arising are addressed promptly.  They are also engaging directly with residents, whose health and wellbeing continues to be the priority, to hear and address their concerns.</p></reply>

Both the HSE and my Department are committed to protecting the medical confidentiality of our residents. </p>  <p>  In line with our agreed policy with the HSE, any centre resident with a positive COVID-19 result has been transferred to an offsite self-isolation facility where they are cared for until such time as the HSE considers that they can safely return to their centre. The offsite facilities are supported by a non-profit (Section 39) organisation and healthcare staff. </p>  <p>  Residents who are COVID-19 detected will be contacted and informed directly by the HSE. Residents who are COVID-19 non-detected will receive a letter or text message from the HSE informing them of this outcome. </p>  <p>  There are numerous pathways of referral for a COVID-19 test. For a suspected case where a resident is feeling unwell, the HSE protocol is to contact a GP so he/she can order a COVID-19 test for the symptomatic person. A resident may also be considered a suspect case by virtue of the fact they have been deemed a close contact of someone who has received a result of COVID-19 detected. In such circumstances, the relevant Public Health official can order a COVID-19 test for the person or persons categorised as a close contact.</p>  <p>  My Department and I will continue to work hard with local management, health agencies, and NGOs to provide every support possible to the residents and staff in our accommodation centres at this difficult time.</p></reply>

Roscommon is one of five County towns where the Courts Service intends to refurbish or replace the County Courthouse. The precise allocation and timing of additional funding over the entire ten year period of the National Development Plan  remains to be fully determined. In late 2017, Courts Service acquired full ownership of the historic courthouse building from Roscommon County Council.</p>  <p>  In recent months, some issues have arisen with the historic building which make it necessary to move court sittings to an alternative venue pending refurbishment works. The intention is to keep court sittings in Roscommon Town and the Courts Service is in negotiations regarding the lease and fit out of a temporary venue in the town.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that as such negotiations are commercially sensitive, it would not be appropriate to set out time lines at this juncture.</p></reply>

The continued disruption of the supply of all illicit drugs remains a priority for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the other state agencies tasked with responsibilities in this regard.</p><p>Since its establishment in 2015, the National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau, which manages national and international drug trafficking and organised crime investigations, has continued to make significant seizures of controlled drugs and make related arrests.  Divisional Drug Units also continue to have a significant impact.</p><p>It is important to say that the Commissioner is by law responsible for the administration and business of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and for direction of operational matters.</p><p>The following table, furnished to me by the Garda authorities, sets out the number of drug seizures and their estimated value, in respect of Tipperary Division for the period January to May 2020. <table>    <tr>       <th>-</th>       <th>January 2020</th>       <th>February 2020</th>       <th>March 2020</th>       <th>April 2020 </th>       <th>May 2020</th>       <th>Total </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Drug Seizures Tipperary</td>       <td>44</td>       <td>56</td>       <td>60</td>       <td>71</td>       <td>84</td>       <td><div>315</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Estimated value </td>       <td>&euro;19,691</td>       <td>&euro;42,636</td>       <td>&euro;71,093</td>       <td>&euro;127,141</td>       <td>&euro;106,983</td>       <td><div>&euro;367,544</div></td>    </tr> </table> The Deputy may also be interested to note that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na indicates that, since January 2020, the number of personnel attached to the Divisional Drugs Unit in Tipperary Division has increased from one Sergeant and five Garda members to two Sergeants and fourteen Garda members.  Overall and benefiting from record financial provision of &euro;.88 billion this year, the Garda workforce is now at its highest ever, consisting of over 14,700 Garda&iacute; nationwide, supported by over 3,000 Garda staff.  </p><p>As the Deputy will appreciate, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continue to work to protect and support communities by preventing and detecting crime, while taking extensive action in support of public health restrictions in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic. The latest report from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na indicates that incidents detected during policing operations to support public health guidelines since 8 April 2020 have resulted in pre-existing enforcement powers being used by Garda&iacute; in over 1,800 incidents nationwide. During this period An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have made significant seizures of drugs and firearms, arrests for thefts of vehicles and burglaries, and enforcement of road traffic offences including drink and drug driving.</p></reply>

I understand that this new Framework takes into account the recommendations of the Report on the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, and is focused on multi-agency cooperation and community partnerships in delivering a more localised and responsive policing service.</p><p>As the Deputy will appreciate, the Garda Commissioner is by law responsible for the control and direction of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and I as Minister have no direct role in these matters. I am informed by the Garda authorities that online public consultation is not envisaged as part of a planned review of the piloted Community Policing Framework. However, I understand that the initial review will encompass public consultation with local stakeholders in each of the pilot Divisions and that those findings will be reviewed prior to roll-out of the Framework nationwide. </p><p>Further and as the Deputy will be aware, implementation of this Community Policing Framework takes place in the wider context of implementation of <i>A Policing Service for the Future</i>, the four year implementation plan giving effect to the recommendations of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland. In its report published in September 2018, the Commission outlined a vision and roadmap for strengthening An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the broader national framework for policing, security and community safety. The report followed extensive consultations with communities and a wide range of stakeholders over fifteen months. </p><p>It is important to note that the Community Policing Framework is being piloted in tandem with the roll-out of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s new Operational Model, which meets a key commitment in <i>A Policing Service for the Future.</i>The Garda Operating Model reorganises resources around the delivery of frontline policing, placing and increased emphasis on engaging with communities and supporting victims of crime. I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that in each Division, there will be a dedicated Superintendent leading a community engagement team. I am confident that this reorganisation will further strengthen community policing and engagement, and provide a more localised, responsive policing service for each Division nationwide.</p><p>In a broader sense, the Deputy might also wish to note that implementation of <i>A Policing Service for the Future </i>will see the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 repealed and replaced by a Policing and Community Safety Act. My Department is progressing work on the preparation of Policing and Community Safety Bill as a matter of priority. </p><p>In addition to setting out a new governance and oversight framework for policing, it will redefine the functions of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to include prevention of harm to those who are vulnerable, place an obligation on relevant state agencies to cooperate with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to the broader issue of community safety and refine local structures supporting local accountability for policing.  In that context, my Department is currently in the process of finalising the most appropriate model to achieve this. All existing structures and approaches to community safety have been considered as part of this work and in line with the goal of the Commission on the Future of Policing that community policing and community engagement should be at the heart of new structures and policing arrangements.</p><p>Work is well advanced on the preparation of the General Scheme of the Bill. Once it is finalised it will be brought to Government for approval and publication in the normal manner. </p></reply>

It is expected that as the programme grows and becomes more established this is likely to change.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, Community Sponsorship Ireland is a new community based sponsorship programme which invites members of the public to play a key role in the integration of refugees into Irish society. This new initiative was developed by my Department in collaboration with civil society organisations and formally launch in November last year, when I also held a briefing session for Oireachtas Members.  Following this, in January,  I also wrote to all Oireachtas Members providing information on the Programme and asking members to consider lending their support to the establishment of a Community Sponsorship Group in their locality.</p>  <p>  Community Sponsorship provides a new mechanism to enhance existing rights-based support.  Under the programme, private citizens and community based organisations will provide direct support and assistance to refugees settling in their locality through a structured programme of supports.  Involved communities will be empowered to promote, support and facilitate access to services and supports tailored to transition vulnerable families into Irish society and towards independent living through inclusion into the wider community. </p>  <p>  Last December, Minister Flanagan and I unveiled plans to welcome up to 2,900 more refugees between 2020 and 2023 through a combination of resettlement and the new community sponsorship initiative. </p>  <p>  Ireland remains committed to accepting a minimum of 100 individuals for resettlement under the community sponsorship model for 2020.

I can also confirm that anyone who is in offsite self-isolation or is cocooning on age or medical grounds have their own room. </p>  <p>  This has been achieved through the additional 850 new temporary beds added to our accommodation portfolio in response to the pandemic and the new dedicated centres opened since the start of the year in Tullamore, Cahersiveen and Rosslare Harbour. </p>  <p>  This was seen as a very ambitious target in the short timeframe available to us before the pandemic worsened.

While we are examining their application, all applicants are offered accommodation and other supports such as healthcare, education for children and a weekly payment for personal expenditure. The provision of accommodation is demand-led, based on the number of applicants arriving to claim international protection and requiring accommodation. </p>  <p>  As demand requires, my Department issues public calls for expressions of interest in putting forward suitable premises and supplying the capacity and supports to run accommodation centres to meet international standards. These calls are not confined to the private sector. It is open to all to engage with us. Equally, any Tenders issued for the same services are open to all. Any proposal will be assessed according to the published criteria. </p>  <p>  Both Minister Flanagan and I have at all times made it clear that I would welcome proposals from NGOs or not for profit entities.  </p>  <p>  Minister Flanagan and I have established an Expert Group on the Provision of Support, including Accommodation, to persons in the International Protection Process, which is led by Dr. Catherine Day, former Secretary General of the European Commission.</p>  <p>  This Expert Group has the following role:</p>  <p>  - To advise on the development of a long-term approach to the provision of supports including accommodation to persons in the international protection process;</p>  <p>  - To identify good practice in European countries in the provision of supports to persons within the international protection process, particularly dealing with variations in demand; and</p>  <p>  - To set out a process for achieving the long term approach to support persons in the international protection process. </p>  <p>  It builds on the work of the Working Group chaired by Judge Bryan McMahon. Their Report, published in June 2015, made substantive recommendations on improvements necessary within the international protection process and the Direct Provision reception system.</p>  <p>  Since then, significant improvements have been made to the system in recent years including access to the services of the Ombudsman and the Ombudsman for Children; agreed National Standards for accommodation providers; the introduction of labour market access; and the continued roll-out of self-catering facilities for residents, which are now available to more than half of all residents.</p>  <p>  Dr. Day and her Expert Group are expected to report before the end of the year. </p>  <p>  An Interdepartmental Group, chaired by my own Department, was also established to ensure that all Government Departments are proactively delivering on their responsibilities to international protection applicants, and the short-to-medium term options which could be implemented to improve the system. Its Report is ready for submission to the incoming Government. </p>  <p>  I look forward to the outcomes of work of these two Groups, which will allow for consideration of the next steps required in the ongoing reform process.</p></reply>

All applicants who are identified as being possible Dublin III cases at the International Protection Office (IPO) are put into the process and Ireland is still requesting other responsible EU Member States to 'take charge' of any identified applicant.  Other Member States who identify that Ireland is responsible for an applicant have, throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, also been applying the Dublin process to Ireland. </p>  <p>  The interviewing of applicants in accordance with Article 5 of the Regulation has been suspended since March 2020. Due to the restrictions arising from measures to limit the spread of the virus, the IPO has not been in a position to issue any recommendations to date because of the impact on applicants, their legal representatives, the International Protection Appeals Tribunal and other areas of my Department. This, in turn, would go against the necessary national measures to help limit the spread of COVID-19. </p>  <p>  I would also like to inform the Deputy that the enforcement of Dublin transfer orders is an operational matter for the Garda National Immigration Bureau. Due to the current Covid-19 pandemic, Dublin transfers are subject to operational constraints and, as such, all cases are considered on a case by case basis. </p>  <p>  Finally, I can assure the Deputy that the Immigration Service Delivery of my Department continues to provide its services in line with national efforts to deal with the current COVID-19 situation.

This team undertakes daily calls with all centre managers across our network of permanent and temporary centres. Feedback from these conversations is reflected in the newsletters circulated to all centre managers to promote shared learning and best practice, which are available to view on our website <i>www.accommodationcentres.ie</i>. The daily calls also ensure that any issues or concerns can be raised without delay for appropriate resolution for the benefit of residents and staff.</p><p>Should residents have any issues or concerns that they wish to raise directly with my Department, they can do so via an email address which is made known to all residents.  Residents can also raise concerns with the Office of the Ombudsman and the Ombudsman for Children and contacts details for these offices are also provided. Officials of my Department have begun holding virtual clinics with residents and a telephone support service run by the Jesuit Refugee Service (JRS) has also been established as an additional support for residents.  </p><p>All accommodation centres are carefully following the guidelines for our centres that have been published by the HSE&rsquo;s Health Protection Surveillance Centre, which can be found on its website <i>www.hpsc.ie</i>. That guidance exists precisely because it is recognised that congregated settings such as Direct Provision centres present specific challenges in this pandemic.  </p><p>During this time, centre managers have also been advised to increase the standard and frequency of cleaning throughout the centres, paying particular attention to communal areas. A regular supply of hand sanitiser for centres is in place and this is distributed to centres as required. Other PPE is distributed, as needed, and in line with the HPSC guidelines for its appropriate use in residential settings.  </p><p>In partnership with the HSE and Safetynet, my Department has put in place a national clinical telephone service to provide public health advice to support centre staff. It is also being used to advise, support and work with locations where vulnerable groups are present relating to the implementation of COVID-19 guidelines and measures. </p><p>While inspections of accommodation centres cannot take place at this time, officials are continuing to work closely with the HSE and centre management during this time to ensure that any issues arising are addressed promptly, and are also engaging directly with residents to hear and address their concerns. Their health and wellbeing continues to be the priority.</p></reply>

The Act, which amended the earlier Offences Against the State Acts, contains provisions which change the rules of evidence in relation to the offences of membership of an unlawful organisation, create certain new/substantive offences and extend the maximum period of detention under the Act. The Act further provides that relevant offences created under the Act are scheduled offences and therefore are to be tried in the Special Criminal Court. Section 18 provides that the relevant sections of the Act (sections 2 to 4, 6 to 12, 14 and 17 ) shall cease to be in operation unless their continuance in force is approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas. </p>  <p>  The Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 provides certain legislative measures to tackle organised crime.  Among those measures is section 8, which provides that certain organised crime offences are to be tried in the Special Criminal Court. Section 8(4) provides that the provision will cease to be in operation unless a resolution is passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  </p>  <p>  Section 18(3) of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 Act and Section 8(6) of the and the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 provide that, before a resolution for continuance is passed, the Minister for Justice and Equality shall prepare reports, which shall be laid before both Houses, on the operation of the relevant provisions in the period since the previous report. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that there remains a real and persistent threat from terrorist activity and organised crime as evidenced by the seizures of firearms, explosives and ammunition by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the most serious of cases brought before the Special Criminal Court. It is important that these provisions are renewed and it is my intention to seek their renewal and table the required motions before the Oireachtas before the end of this month.</p></reply>

While we are examining their application, all applicants are offered accommodation and other supports such as healthcare, education for children and a weekly payment for personal expenditure. </p><p>My Department does not select a particular area or location for accommodation centres. Premises are sourced either through a full tender process which is administered through the Government&rsquo;s Procurement Portal<i>www.etenders.gov.ie</i>or through responses to calls for expressions of interest, which are advertised in the national media. My Department is assisted with these tender projects by the Office of Government Procurement.</p><p>The tender process which commenced in late 2018, saw regional tender competitions being advertised, assessed and awarded. The competitions were held for the South East, Midlands, Mid-West, South-West, Mid-East, West, Dublin and the Border Regions. </p><p>The specifications for each tender process are comprehensive and are developed from the findings of the 2015 McMahon Report and best practice in the sector. All successful bidders must provide independent living with cooking facilities for residents, as set out in the McMahon Report, and they have a 16-week mobilisation period to complete the works to provide this.</p><p>As the Deputy will appreciate, the provision of accommodation is demand-led, based on the number of applicants arriving to claim international protection and requiring accommodation. Where the State&rsquo;s accommodation portfolio is not sufficient to meet demand and the tendering process is not identifying and bringing on stream the required accommodation as quickly as is needed, the State advertises in the national media for calls for expressions of interest for the supply of accommodation. The contracts on offer under this process are shorter than those available under the tender process. </p><p>Offers made under the Expressions of Interest process are assessed under the following criteria: </p><p>- A good physical environment,</p><p>- Facilities that provide for family life,</p><p>- Cooking facilities for residents, where possible,</p><p>- Location of property and access to public transport,</p><p>- Provision of suitable security arrangements,</p><p>- An open and understanding management structure, and </p><p>- The ability to develop links with the local community to enhance the experience for residents.</p><p>The International Protection Procurement Service (IPPS) in my Department assesses offers of accommodation against these criteria and identifies those properties most suitable.</p></reply>

The criteria for assessment is based on quality of premises, general conformity with the recommendations of the 2015 McMahon Report, and the availability of services such as schools, general practitioners, post office etc. Once a premises is deemed suitable by the IPPPS, negotiations will begin with the proposed service provider.</p>  <p>  During the assessment and prior to the conclusion of the negotiations, the relevant Local Authority is consulted to see if there are any legal or compliance issues in relation to the property. </p>  <p>  Following the conclusion of negotiations and the signing of the contract between the service provider and my Department, engagement begins with local representatives and other key stakeholders. This includes the other Government Departments and organisations that provide key services and supports to residents, like the Departments of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Education and Skills, Health, the HSE and Tusla.  </p>  <p>  While I can fully appreciate that community engagement as early as possible in the process is preferable, the Deputy will appreciate that this type of engagement is not possible prior to the commercially sensitive negotiations being concluded and the contract being signed with my Department. Until then, there is no guarantee that the negotiations will be successful or that a centre will actually open. </p>  <p>  With recent new centres that we have opened like Ennis, Tullamore and Rosslare Harbour, my Department has prepared and circulated information to the local community, which includes information on the capacity of the centre, its facilities, the composition of residents (single, couples, small families etc.) and contact information for the centre.  Where possible, prior to the arrival of residents, local representatives and members of the community are invited to visit so that they can see the centre's facilities for themselves. We also encourage the establishment of a Friends of the Centre group to promote integration opportunities between centre residents, the local community and voluntary groups. </p>  <p>  The issue of how we can best engage with local communities prior to centres opening is also being examined by the Expert Group, led by Dr. Catherine Day, former Secretary General of the European Commission. This Expert Group was established by Minister Flanagan and I to examine best practice in other European States in the provision of services, including accommodation to international protection applicants. It is looking at longer term trends and solutions for the system. This work is advancing at pace and I look forward to its outcomes.</p></reply>

I requested that, where sectors are developing such protocols or guides, they should work together to align this work. For example, barbers' representative bodies should collaborate with hairdressers representative bodies on a single aligned protocol for their sector. I am keen to support sectors on their safe reopening on this aligned and collaborative basis and should the hairdressing sector wish to send me details of their sectoral protocol, I will be happy to convey these to the Minister for Health.</p><p>The Government&rsquo;s Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business sets out five stages for unlocking the restrictions put in place to contain the Coronavirus, at three week intervals. The Roadmap sets out how we can keep the level of transmission of COVID-19 as low as possible while balancing continuing restrictions in proportion with the positive social and economic benefits which will be brought about by businesses reopening.  </p><p>On 15 May the Government announced that we would move to Phase 1 of the Roadmap from 18 May. This decision was taken having regard to the advice received from the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) at the time. The categories of workers, list of retailers and other facilities that can reopen under Phase 1 are available on the Government&rsquo;s website gov.ie. </p><p>Businesses should review the Roadmap carefully and carry out a detailed assessment of their activities with regard to the continuing public health measures.  Businesses should, based on their assessment, identify which category in which phase of reopening they will be in a position to reopen safely and in line with the continued public health measures.  It is not necessary for businesses to seek official authorisation to reopen.</p><p>The National Return to Work Safely Protocol is a useful guide for businesses in making their assessments and adapting their workplace procedures and practices to comply fully with the COVID-19 related public health protection measures. It sets out in very clear terms for employers and employees the steps that they must take firstly before a workplace reopens, and then while it continues to operate. The Protocol is available at </p><p>The Health and Safety Authority, which is an agency of my Department, is the lead agency in overseeing compliance with the National Return to Work Safely Protocol in the workplace.  If employers or employees need further guidance on the Protocol, the HSA Helpline can be contacted at 1890 289 389 or wcu@hsa.ie. </p><p>In order to assist businesses to address the challenges posed by COVID-19, the Government has put in place a comprehensive suite of supports for firms of all sizes, which includes the wage subsidy scheme, grants, low-cost loans, write-off of commercial rates and deferred tax liabilities. These supports are designed to build confidence, to further assist businesses in terms of the management of their companies and to allow them to begin looking to the future and start charting a path forward for weeks and months ahead. For a full list of supports for business please see . </p><p>I recognise the impact that this pandemic is having on businesses right across the country. I know that employers and employees want to get back to work and I support them in that ambition, but it must be safe to do so.  My Department contributed to the considerations around the phased re-opening of sectors and I will work within Government to secure further details and clarity for businesses as we progress through the phases outlined in the Roadmap. </p><p>It is important to note that all decisions taken by Government on the timing of any lifting of restrictions as envisaged in Phases 2 to 5 of the Roadmap will be informed by the public health advice at the time. </p></reply>

Some of those measures within my Department&rsquo;s remit will require changes to legislation to come into effect or to allow the expansion of existing schemes to meet the increased demand as a result of Covid-19.  These will require amendments to 3 existing Acts: </p>  <p> 1. The Microfinance Loan Fund Act 2012;</p>  <p> 2. The European Investment Fund Agreement Act 2018; and</p>  <p> 3. The Credit Guarantee Act 2012 (as amended).</p>  <p>  The Government approved the necessary amendments to all 3 Acts on 1st May 2020, and officials in my Department have been working urgently with the Office of Parliamentary Counsel on priority drafting of these amendments since then.</p>  <p>  Amendments are needed to the Microenterprise Loan Fund Act 2012 to facilitate Microfinance Ireland (MFI) to be able to borrow moneys from bodies other than its parent body, the Social Finance Foundation, and to raise the ceiling on the amount of Exchequer grant that can be provided to Microfinance Ireland.  This is intended to allow MFI to have access to greater sources of funding, to enhance its ability to provide more microenterprise loans to those qualifying enterprises in need of additional finance options.</p>  <p>  I am working with the EIB Group on a  &euro;500 million expansion to the Future Growth Loan Scheme to support businesses recover from COVID-19 impacts. The FGLS is underpinned by a 64% counter-guarantee from the European Investment Fund. This counter-guarantee provides significant risk protection to the Exchequer against potential losses from the loan guarantee scheme.  The FGLS was established using the European Investment Fund Agreement Act 2018. This Act allows for the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to enter into agreements with the European Investment Fund (EIF) to facilitate access to finance for qualifying enterprises. The amendment to the  European Investment Fund Agreement Act 2018 is needed in order to finalise these negotitations with the EIB Group.</p>  <p>  The Microenterprise Loan Fund (Amendment) Bill 2020, which will amend the Microenterprise Loan Fund Act 2012 (as amended) and the European Investment Fund Act 2018, was approved for publication at Cabinet on Friday 29 May last.</p>  <p>  Separately, the implementation of the new Covid-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme requires amendments to the Credit Guarantee Act 2012 (as amended).  Since the Government approved the scheme, officials in my Department have been working urgently alongside the Office of Parliamentary Counsel on the priority drafting of the necessary legislation and are also continuing to work with the steering group to design and operationalise the scheme as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  My priority is to ensure that this legislation can be progressed through the Oireachtas as a matter of urgency following the formation of a new Government.  I am very aware of the pressure for enterprise to access these supports in order to be able to resume economic activity and hope that all Parliamentarians will facilitate its urgent commencement.</p></reply>

The online Application Form and Frequently Asked Questions went live from Friday 22 May 2020.</p><p>Eligible businesses who have stayed open throughout the crisis, as well as those who are reopening under Phase 1 (from 18 May) and Phase 2 (8 June) of the Government&rsquo;s Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business, are encouraged to apply first for the Restart Grant. These applications will be prioritised for payment by the local authorities.</p><p>To avail of the Restart Grant, applicants must be a commercial business, be in the Local Authorities Commercial Rates Payment System, and:</p><p>1. have an annual turnover of less than &euro;5m and employ 50 people or less;</p><p>2. have suffered a projected 25%+ loss in turnover between 1 April and end June 2020;</p><p>3. commit to remain open or to reopen if it was closed; and,</p><p>4. declare the intention to retain employees that are on The Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme.</p><p>The grant will be the amount of the rates demand in respect of calendar year 2019 only, subject to a minimum of &euro;2,000 and a maximum of &euro;10,000.</p><p>The Restart Grant support is just one part of the wider &euro;12bn package of supports for firms of all sizes, which includes the wage subsidy scheme, grants, low-cost loans, write-off of commercial rates and deferred tax liabilities, all of which will help to improve cashflow amongst SMEs. </p><p>This package is a significant step-up in the supports available for all businesses in all sectors at this very difficult time. The measures have been developed to meet the varying needs of Irish enterprise and they are very specifically targeted by size, sector and need and are targeted at vulnerable but viable companies.</p><p>The unprecedented circumstances of the COVID19 global pandemic has resulted in a swiftly evolving landscape for enterprises. The Government will continue to use all available tools at its disposal to support businesses and ensure their survival. In that context, I will keep the supports provided under review and continue to support enterprises as they work through the challenges facing them.</p></reply>

The Protocol should be used by all workplaces to adapt their workplace procedures and practices to comply fully with the COVID-19 related public health protection measures identified as necessary by the HSE and the Department of Health.  It is operating in parallel with existing workplace health and safety statutory requirements.</p>  <p>  I would emphasise that, in the first instance, employers and workers have a responsibility to actively and jointly take responsibility for applying, and adhering to, the procedures and practices set out in the Protocol designed to protect the health and safety of all concerned. </p>  <p>  The Health and Safety Authority is the lead Agency in relation to oversight and compliance with the Return to Work Safely Protocol. Under the Health, Safety and Welfare at Work Act, 2005, the Health and Safety Authority has full powers to oversee compliance with the health, safety and wellbeing of workers in their place of work, which includes the closure of a workplace.  While COVID-19 is a public health issue, the infectious nature of the virus and the way in which it is easily transmitted through humancontact, makes it a workplace health and safety issue as well as a general health matter.  Neither health, safety nor welfare are narrowly defined in the 2005 Act, so the HSA has all of the powers that it needs at this time.  </p>  <p>  Since 18 May 2020, in line with Phase 1 of the Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business, the Health and Safety Authority launched a national programme of inspections to check compliance with the Return to Work Safely Protocol. The majority of HSA inspections are unannounced however due to the fact that workplaces may have different working arrangements in place to protect against COVID-19, the Health and Safety Authority may need in a number of cases to arrange a suitable time to visit to ensure the availability of key personnel. Once on site, the inspector will check for compliance against the Protocol and where there is a breach of a statutory obligation, the inspector based on the evidence and their expert opinion will determine what enforcement action may be needed. Where relevant, the public health authorities will be involved. </p></reply>

An inter-departmental discussion has taken place and there has been further engagement with a range of stakeholders, including groups representing businesses and landlords, to gain additional insights and gather intelligence to inform any further discussions. I have also asked my officials to look into the different responses from other countries and to identify possible options to address the issues involved. </p><p>While different options are being explored, I would point out that any support to business in respect of rents alone would ultimately end up as a support to the landlord. Not only would it be difficult to estimate the costs involved for such a scheme, but the offering of support, or even the perception that such supports will be forthcoming, may affect the market and lessen the impetus for landlords to renegotiate with tenants.</p><p>Engagement between the landlords and tenants should be the first route taken. Tenants and landlords are encouraged to engage with each other on this matter and come to some arrangement, as it is in everybody&rsquo;s interest that terms are amicably agreed. Mixed reports from stakeholders have been received on the extent to which commercial tenants have been able to negotiate with landlords. Many landlords are being constructive at the moment with informal, temporary arrangements being agreed with tenants. There is, understandably, some reluctance by landlords to disclose such arrangements due to commercial sensitivities. However, it appears that other landlords have been less flexible.</p><p>I have also raised the matter of legal protections for businesses who are unable to pay their commercial rents with the Attorney General. Specifically, I asked about the potential for legislation to prevent the eviction of commercial tenants who have failed to pay rent as a result of the pandemic and the possibility of legislating to place a moratorium on businesses having to pay rent for premises they cannot used due to the restrictions imposed.</p><p>The Attorney General had advised that there are significant legal difficulties in respect to both of the questions posed. The difficulties stem from a variety of legal bases including statutory, constitutional, contract and common law. I have asked my officials to consider the advice.</p><p>The Government is committed to ensuring as many businesses as possible survive this challenging period, and it will continue to look at how we can support businesses that have been impacted by the COVID-19 crisis. The Government recognises the issue of &lsquo;out of pocket&rsquo; costs for businesses which have to pay ongoing fixed costs such as rents, despite not being able to trade. We have introduced a suite of supports to assist businesses which includes the wage subsidy scheme, grants, low costs loans, deferred tax liabilities and the waiver of commercial rates. Full details on all supports are available at: <i></i></p><p>The issue of supporting fixed costs, including commercial rents, was very much to the fore of our minds when the Government recently introduced the Restart Grant which will give direct grant aid to micro and small businesses to help them with the costs associated with re-opening following COVID-19 closures. The grants will be equivalent to the rates bill of the business in 2019, with a minimum payment of &euro;2,000 and a maximum payment of &euro;10,000.</p></reply>

A business offering such a service must not however mislead consumers about its identity, services, charges or other relevant matters. </p>  <p>  Section 55(1)(a) of the Consumer Protection Act 2007 provides that it is a prohibited commercial practice for a trader to make a representation that the trader has an approval, authorisation or endorsement that the trader does not have. Section 43(1) of the Act provides that a commercial practice is misleading if it involves the provision of false information in relation to a number of specified matters, including the nature, attributes, identity and status of the trader, and that information would be likely to cause the average consumer to make a purchasing decision which that consumer would not otherwise make. Section 43(2) provides that a commercial practice is misleading if it would be likely to cause the average consumer to be deceived or misled in relation to a number of specified matters, including the nature, attributes, identity and status of the trader, and to make a purchasing decision which that consumer would not otherwise make.  A trader who engages in a misleading commercial practice under sections 43(1), and 43(2) of the Act, or a prohibited commercial practice under section 55(1) of the Act, commits an offence. Section 46(1) of the Act provides that a commercial practice is misleading if the trader omits or conceals material information that the average consumer would need to make an informed purchasing decision and that practice would be likely to cause the average consumer to make a purchasing decision which that consumer would not otherwise make.  Section 46(2) provides that a commercial practice is misleading if the trader provides material information in a manner that is unclear, unintelligible, ambiguous or untimely or fails to identify the commercial intent of the practice and that practice would be likely to cause the average consumer to make a purchasing decision which that consumer would not otherwise make.  </p>  <p>  These provisions of the Consumer Protection Act 2007 are clearly applicable to so-called copycat websites which may be designed to look like the websites of official Government bodies and which do not make it clear that they are not official websites and that those who use their services may be paying for a service which they could obtain from an official body for free or for a lower charge.  Enforcement of the Act is the responsibility of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission which is statutorily independent in the exercise of its enforcement functions.  </p>  <p>  In many cases, consumers who use the services of private businesses that provide access to official documents do so after being routed to such businesses following a search on an internet search engine.  Directive (EU) 2019/2161 on the better enforcement and modernisation of European Union consumer protection rules which Member States must adopt by 28 November 2021 and apply from 28 May 2022 includes a number of provisions aimed at ensuring greater transparency in respect of online search results.  The Directive provides among other things that it will be a prohibited commercial practice for a trader to provide search results in response to a consumer&rsquo;s online search query without clearly disclosing any paid advertisement or payment specifically for achieving higher ranking of products within the search results.</p></reply>

Administered by the Local Enterprise Offices on behalf of the Department of Communication, Climate Action and the Environment, the TOVs is an initiative under the Government&rsquo;s National Digital Strategy, which helps small businesses trade more online, to boost their sales and reach new markets.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment, Richard Bruton, and I recently agreed to expand the scope of the TOVs scheme to offer financial assistance of up to &euro;2,500 with reduced co-funding of 10% from the business, along with training and advice, to all micro companies with a turnover of less than &euro;2M who want to establish an online presence for the first time, or who wish to expand a basic existing website to incorporate a more substantive online trading capacity. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, businesses that have previously received and implemented a Trading Online Voucher can now apply for a second voucher, where upgrades are required.  Funding can be used towards adding payment facilities or booking systems to your website or developing new apps for your customers. The voucher can now also be used towards subscriptions to low cost online retail platform solutions, to help companies quickly establish a retailing presence online. </p>  <p>  In addition to the above, it should be noted that while retail services are not eligible for LEO Measure 1 (Feasibility, Priming and Business Expansion grants) support, Start-up businesses (less than 18 months old) may be eligible for Feasibility and Priming Grant support.  If there is an innovative business model associated with an online e-commerce business, it will be considered for Measure 1 support by a LEO. Considerations include:</p>  <p>  - Any potential it could cause for displacement in the local economy. </p>  <p>  - A plan to deliver export sales. </p>  <p>  - Its innovative potential in terms of offering the market a substantially improved service. </p>  <p>  - The business providing new employment in the state.</p>  <p>  For larger enterprises, with over 10 employees, Enterprise Ireland can offer The Covid-19 Online Retail Scheme, The objective of this scheme is to support companies in the indigenous retail sector which have started an online journey, which will have the most immediate impact enabling them to respond to both the domestic and international consumer demand with a competitive online offer. </p>  <p>  My Department proposed this Scheme in response to the COVID-19 crisis and the urgent need for retail companies to achieve a step change in online capability. Applicant companies must employ 10 or more people, have an existing online presence (e.g. website or social media), and have a retail outlet through which they derive the majority of their revenue. Successful applicants will be awarded funding to support a maximum of 80% of the project costs. Grants ranging from &euro;10,000 to &euro;40,000 will be awarded under the competitive scheme.  </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that there are sufficient supports in place for start-up online e-commerce businesses.</p></reply>

The WRC&rsquo;s core services include the inspection of employment rights compliance, the provision of information, adjudicating on complaints under employment protection, equality and industrial relations legislation and the provision of mediation, conciliation, facilitation and advisory services.</p><p>The Inspectorate Division of the WRC carries out inspections of employer records with a view to determining compliance with employment rights legislations. These inspections arise: </p><p>- In response to complaints received of alleged non-compliance with relevant employment rights legislation; </p><p>- As part of compliance campaigns which focus on compliance in specific sectors or specific pieces of legislation; or </p><p>- From routine inspections (announced and unannounced) which act as an overall control measure.</p><p>The WRC Inspectorate is staffed by civil servants of my department. As at 26 May 2020, there are a total of 51 WRC Labour Inspectors. Table 1 attached provides details of the grade, number and regional location of the inspectors. My department is currently running an internal competition for appointment to the post of Executive Officer (EO) Inspector and Higher Executive Officer (HEO) Inspector Team Manager. It is also actively engaging with the Public Appointments Service (PAS) in relation to the filling of EO Inspector posts and HEO Inspector Team Manager posts.</p><p>The aim of the WRC Inspectorate is to achieve voluntary compliance with employment law through the provision of education and awareness, inspection of employers&rsquo; employment records and enforcement where necessary.  While every effort is made to secure compliance, some employers either refuse or fail to rectify the breaches identified and/or pay money due to their employees.  These cases are referred for prosecution. </p><p>In line with HSE and Government advice regarding non-essential services, on-site inspection activity by WRC inspectors was suspended with effect from 13 March 2020. In this regard, the majority of businesses and sectors within which much WRC risk-based inspection activity takes place closed at this time, and, in the main, remain closed until 8 June 2020. Notwithstanding, inspections have continued, and some have been finalised, remotely by way of desk top enquiries, interviews with employers and employees over the telephone and through the examination of company records (such as payroll and hours worked) following their secure upload to the WRC inspection platform.</p><p>Currently, the WRC Inspectorate has 1,335 open inspections being processed by 51 Inspectors. To date this year, 1,640 inspections have been finalised, and c.&euro;1,084,162 in unpaid wages recovered. In addition, the WRC Infoline (1890 80 80 90) has been operating remotely throughout the pandemic and is handling over 1,100 callers per week from both employees and employers, providing information on employment law obligations and employee entitlements.  </p><p>The WRC is in the process of finalising procedures for the recommencement of on-site visits and inspections and it is anticipated that a number of appropriate such engagements will have taken place before the commencement of the next phase of the Roadmap on 8 June at which stage the number of workplaces open and available for risk-based inspection will have increased. In this regard, the WRC has engaged also with the key stakeholders on the employer and employee representative sides.</p><p>Workplace inspections regarding compliance with the Return to Work Safely Protocol are the remit of the HSA and the WRC is actively engaging with that body to identify how best the WRC can assist the HSA in terms of its role.</p><p>Number of WRC Inspectors as at 26 May 2020: <table>    <tr>       <th>Region</th>       <th>Number of HEO Inspectors</th>       <th>Number of EO Inspectors</th>       <th>Total Number of Inspectors</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>12</td>       <td>14</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Ennis </td>       <td>1</td>       <td>8</td>       <td>9</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>5</td>       <td>5</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Carlow</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>14</td>       <td>16</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Sligo</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>6</td>       <td>7</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Overall Total</td>       <td>6</td>       <td>45</td>       <td>51</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

The Protocol should be used by all workplaces to adapt their workplace procedures and practices to comply fully with the COVID-19 related public health protection measures identified as necessary by the HSE and the Department of Health.  It is operating in parallel with existing workplace health and safety statutory requirements.</p><p>The Health and Safety Authority is the lead Agency in relation to oversight and compliance with the Protocol. In line with Phase 1 of the Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business, the Health and Safety Authority launched a national programme of inspections to check compliance with the Return to Work Safely Protocol. Authority inspectors were on the ground from that date enforcing compliance with the Protocol.As of close of business on the 29th of May at the end of week 2 of phase 1 of the Roadmap, and since 18 May 2020 when the economy began to slowly reopen, approximately 1000 inspections were completed across a range of industries. The Authority, based on its initial analysis of the inspections, found that compliance with the Return to Work Safely Protocol is high and employers are generally taking a responsible and proactive approach.</p><p>The HSA, along with its usual workload, is deploying all of its available field inspectors across businesses that are currently open to check compliance with the Protocol. Given the scale of the challenge as the economy re-opens, the Government is ensuring that the HSA inspectorate will be supplemented significantly by deploying, under the authority of the HSA, other inspectors from across the system who already have an environmental health, agriculture or other workplace/business inspection responsibilities. </p><p>Details of these additional resource are nearing finalisation, and the numbers working with the HSA will be in the hundreds, from across the system.  These will be specialist officials who already have sectoral business inspection responsibilities. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine has given a commitment that inspectors from his Department will work with the HSA to ensure the implementation of the Protocol in workplaces. It will start shortly with around 200 officials from the Environmental Health Service, and this number will increase steadily as officials from other parts of the system, with varying sectoral inspection and oversight responsibilities are brought on board, in line with the Government Roadmap.  This will include inspectors from the WRC</p></reply>

A quota of 1,500 permits for Meat Processing Operatives was also extended on 1 January 2020 by a further 1000 permits, this followed a review completed at the end of 2019.  In addition, from July 2019, a further quota of 300 permits for Meat Deboners was made available.</p>  <p>  The quota for horticulture workers has now expired, with all 500 permits issued.  An evidence-based case from the horticulture sector has been received requesting that the quota be extended, and this is under consideration by my officials and by officials of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, which is the lead policy Department for the sector.</p>  <p>  The Department of Agriculture, Food &amp;amp; the Marine, Teagasc and sector representatives have also been working closely with the Department of Employment Affairs &amp;amp; Social Protection on a recruitment campaign to support enlisting a large number of temporary workers from the live register to work in the Horticulture sector.

Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s position is based on the fact that products containing any trace of THC are considered as a controlled drug in Ireland under the Misuse of Drugs Orders. </p>  <p>  Currently, there is no lower limit of THC permissible under national legislation. Therefore, products which can contain even minimal levels of THC pose a reputational risk to Enterprise Ireland as the agency is not in a position to verify which companies, products and extraction methods meet the legal requirement in Ireland to contain 0.00% levels of THC, at least until there are further legislative or regulatory developments which may mitigate the reputational risks in future.</p>  <p>  My colleague, Minister Simon Harris T.D., Minister for Health, who has responsibility for the designation of substances under S.I. No. 69 of 1998 - Misuse of Drugs (Designation) Order, 1998, may be able to provide more specific material in response, including as regards the matter of appropriate meetings with representative bodies of the sector.</p></reply>

I understand that preparatory work is being undertaken by the hairdressing sector and others in developing guidelines and safety protocols, with reference to the Government&rsquo;s Return to Work Safely Protocol. I requested that, where sectors are developing protocols or guides, they should work together to align this work. For example, barbers' representative bodies should collaborate with hairdressers representative bodies on a single aligned protocol for their sector.</p><p>I am keen to support sectors on their safe reopening on this aligned and collaborative basis and should the hairdressing sector wish to send me details of their sectoral protocol, I will be happy to convey these to the Minister for Health.</p><p>The Government&rsquo;s Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business sets out five stages for unlocking the restrictions put in place to contain the Coronavirus, at three week intervals. The Roadmap sets out how we can keep the level of transmission of COVID-19 as low as possible while balancing continuing restrictions in proportion with the positive social and economic benefits which will be brought about by businesses reopening.  </p><p>On 15 May the Government announced that we would move to Phase 1 of the Roadmap from 18 May. This decision was taken having regard to the advice received from the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) at the time. The categories of workers, list of retailers and other facilities that can reopen under Phase 1 are available on the Government&rsquo;s website gov.ie. </p><p>Businesses should review the Roadmap carefully and carry out a detailed assessment of their activities with regard to the continuing public health measures.  Businesses should, based on their assessment, identify which category in which phase of reopening they will be in a position to reopen safely and in line with the continued public health measures.  It is not necessary for businesses to seek official authorisation to reopen.</p><p>The National Return to Work Safely Protocol is a useful guide for businesses in making their assessments and adapting their workplace procedures and practices to comply fully with the COVID-19 related public health protection measures. It sets out in very clear terms for employers and workers the steps that they must take firstly before a workplace reopens, and then while it continues to operate. The Protocol is available at <i></i>.</p><p>The Health and Safety Authority, which is an agency of my Department, is the lead agency in overseeing compliance with the Protocol in the workplace.  If employers or employees need further guidance on the Protocol, the HSA Helpline can be contacted at 1890 289 389 or .</p><p>In order to assist businesses to address the challenges posed by COVID-19, the Government has put in place a comprehensive suite of supports for firms of all sizes, which includes the wage subsidy scheme, grants, low-cost loans, write-off of commercial rates and deferred tax liabilities. These supports are designed to build confidence, to further assist businesses in terms of the management of their companies and to allow them to begin looking to the future and start charting a path forward for weeks and months ahead. For a full list of supports for business please see <i></i>.  </p><p>I recognise the impact that this pandemic is having on businesses right across the country. I know that employers and employees want to get back to work and I support them in that ambition, but it must be safe to do so.  My Department contributed to the considerations around the phased re-opening of sectors under Phase 1 and I will work within Government to secure further details and clarity for businesses as we progress through the phases outlined in the Roadmap.</p><p>It is important to note that all decisions taken by Government on the timing of any lifting of restrictions as envisaged in Phases 2 to 5 of the Roadmap will be guided by the public health advice at the time.</p></reply>

During Phase 1, it is intended that customers should restrict visits to such stores for essential supplies. All retailers are encouraged to continue to provide on-line services where that is possible and appropriate to minimise footfall. All of these retail outlets must implement physical distancing measures and measures set out in the National Return to Work Safely Protocol.</p><p>Government continues to monitor progress on Phase 1 and will assess progress this week.

Such solutions allow for tangible benefits for employees including improving their work/life balance. Flexible working also assists in the development of an inclusive society. By removing some of the barriers to work for people with caring responsibilities, and providing a framework for flexible retirement, increasing flexible working could improve labour market participation, particularly amongst people with caring responsibilities, older people and people with disabilities. </p>  <p>  While my Department has not conducted research on the impact of moving to a four-day week, there is a large volume of work underway on the topic of flexible working across Government departments. This was reflected in Pillar 4 of Future Jobs Ireland, which included a number of key deliverables with the objective of fostering participation in the labour force through flexible working solutions. </p>  <p>  This includes the completion of research on remote working which my Department completed in 2019. The objective of this research was to understand the prevalence and types of remote working arrangements within the Irish workforce and the attitudes towards such arrangements. The research also identified the influencing factors for both employers and employees partaking in remote working. Following its publication, my Department committed to the formation of an Interdepartmental Working Group on the production of guidance on remote work for employers. This work is now underway and is expected to be completed in 2020.</p>  <p>  Alongside the work that my Department is leading on in relation to remote working, the Department of Justice and Equality is also leading on a number of further deliverables relevant to flexible working. This includes the development of guidance for employers on family-friendly working options, the extension of unpaid Parental Leave, and a national consultation on a variety of flexible working options which will inform the development of a national flexible working policy in 2020.</p></reply>

These supports include those businesses facing challenges operating in the supply chains.</p><p>In order to assist businesses to address the challenges posed by COVID-19, the Government has put in place a comprehensive suite of supports for firms of all sizes, which includes the wage subsidy scheme, grants, low-cost loans, write-off of commercial rates and deferred tax liabilities. These supports are designed to build confidence, to further assist businesses in terms of the management of their companies and to allow them to begin looking to the future and start charting a path forward for weeks and months ahead<i>.</i>For a full list of supports for business please see</p><p><i></i><i>.</i></p><p>The full range of Enterprise Ireland, IDA, Local Enterprise Office (LEO) and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta grant and advisory supports continue to be available to eligible firms to help with strategies to access finance, commence or ramp-up online trading activity, reconfigure business models, cut costs, innovate, diversify markets and supply chains and to improve competitiveness. In that regard, Government will continue to explore funding potential for all enterprises including micro-enterprises as they work through the challenges facing them, including through any mechanisms allowable through the EU&rsquo;s state aid framework.</p><p>The Covid-19 Working Capital Scheme is offered in cooperation with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and is supported by the InnovFin SME Guarantee facility. The scheme is operated by the SBCI. </p><p>It currently makes available a fund of up to &euro;200m to eligible businesses that have been negatively affected by impacts arising from the outbreak of Covid-19 to enable those businesses to innovate, change or adapt in response to the current business environment. Following a further announcement this Scheme is now being expanded to make available an additional &euro;250 million in lending, which will bring the total amount of lending available under this scheme to &euro;450 million.</p><p>The scheme is open to eligible SMEs and small mid-caps (businesses of up to 499 employees) negatively impacted by Covid-19. Loans under the scheme range from &euro;25,000 to &euro;1.5m and are for periods of up to three years. The maximum interest rate under the scheme is 4% and loans of up to &euro;500,000 are available unsecured. </p><p>The Future Growth Loan Scheme currently makes up to &euro;300 million of loans available with a term of 8-10 years and is operated by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) though participating lenders. We have seen strong demand for the scheme since its launch in April 2019, resulting in a rapid take up of the scheme. Funding made available by the scheme facilitates long-term, strategic investment.</p><p>The scheme is open to eligible SMEs and small mid-caps (businesses of up to 499 employees), including those in the primary agriculture and seafood sectors. Loans under the scheme range from &euro;100,000 (&euro;50,000 for farmers) to &euro;3m per eligible business, with loans of up to &euro;500,000 available unsecured. The initial maximum interest rate is capped at 4.5% for loans up to &euro;249,999 and 3.5% for loans more than or equal to &euro;250,000 for the first six months. These rates represent a significant saving compared with the prevailing rates that are otherwise being offered for similar loans on the market.</p><p>This scheme has been expanded by a further &euro;200m to facilitate longer-term lending to Covid-19-impacted businesses and my Department is working through the details of this expansion and will bring this funding to market as soon as possible.</p><p>The Covid-19 Loan, available from Microfinance Ireland (MFI), was introduced as a support to microenterprises to help them access funding arising from the Covid-19 crisis.</p><p>These loans are available for eligible microenterprises responding to Covid-19-related difficulties, the negative impact of which must be a minimum of 15% of actual or projected income or profit.  Loans up to &euro;50,000 are available with terms that include a six months interest free and repayment free moratorium, with the loan to then be repaid over the remaining 30 months of the 36-month loan period.</p><p>An interest rate to 4.5% applies on the Covid-19 loans provided by MFI.  This reduced rate is available to all micro-enterprises where the application is made through the Local Enterprise Network or referred by a bank or Local Development Committees. The new rate for direct applications to MFI is reduced to 5.5%.  As these loans are available interest free for the first six months, the net effect is to further reduce the net interest rate payable over the period of the loan. </p><p>Government has agreed a new &euro;2 billion COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme as a further development of the existing Credit Guarantee Scheme already available.  This Scheme forms a major component of the government&rsquo;s strategy to aid SMEs in these difficult times by providing critical support to ensure businesses are facilitated in having access to credit facilities to assist a return to a more regular trading environment.  It will provide an 80% guarantee on lending to SMEs until the end of this year, for terms between 3 months and 6 years.  The guarantee will be able to be used for a wide range of lending products between &euro;10,000 and &euro;1 million that have a maximum term of 6 years or less.</p><p>The Scheme will be available to all SME sectors, including primary producers.  It will also have interest rates below current market rates.  The implementation of this Scheme will require primary legislation, the drafting of which has commenced.</p><p>There are a number of liquidity supports for COVID 19 impacted businesses available now, including the existing Credit Guarantee Scheme which was implemented in 2012, supporting loans up to &euro;1 million for periods of up to 7 years.  The scheme is designed to support a range of debt products appropriate to the borrowing needs of SMEs.An application to access the Credit Guarantee Scheme can be made through one of the participating lenders which are currently Allied Irish Banks, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank Ireland.</p><p>The &euro;2,500 Trading Online Voucher Scheme for microenterprises is being expanded - an additional &euro;3.3m is being provided to the scheme bringing the total available to &euro;5.6m. The scheme is also being made more flexible - allowing businesses to apply for a second voucher of up to &euro;2,500 where they have successfully utilised their first one; and allowing subscriptions to low-cost online retailing platform solutions to quickly establish a retailing presence online.</p><p>As the reopening of the economy proceeds, more and more businesses are transitioning from the planning to the implementation phase as we progress through the 5 stages of the Government Roadmap.  It is in this context that the Business Continuity Voucher is being phased out and since 15 May is closed to new applicants. The LEOs will continue to work with existing applicants and recipients of BCV vouchers and their subsequent business continuity plans. The awarding of vouchers under the BCV scheme will naturally taper off in the coming weeks as the Local Enterprise Offices process the outstanding applications. In recognition of this new stage the new &euro;250m Restart Grant was introduced to assist micro and small businesses to help them with the costs associated with reopening and reemploying workers following COVID-19 closures.</p><p>Enterprise Ireland, on behalf of the Department of Business Enterprise and Innovation has launched a new suite of COVID-19 supports including the following.</p><p>Sustaining Enterprise Fund:  This &euro;180 million fund will provide support to eligible manufacturing and internationally traded services companies employing 10 or more employees who have been impacted by a 15 per cent or more reduction in actual or projected turnover or profit, and/or have a significant increase in costs as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. The objectives of the scheme are to:</p><p>- Ensure eligible companies have access to the necessary liquidity; and</p><p>- Sustain business so that companies can return to viability and contribute to the recovery of the Irish economy. </p><p>The Fund will provide financial assistance in the form of repayable advances of up to a maximum of &euro;800,000 per company.</p><p>Sustaining Enterprise Fund &ndash; Small Enterprise: This fund will provide a &euro;25,000 to &euro;50,000 short term working capital injection to eligible smaller companies to support business continuity and strengthen their ability to return to growth and be trading strongly in 3 years-time.</p><p>COVID 19 &ndash; HPSU Fund (SEF &ndash; HPSU): This fund is aimed at EI High Potential Start-Up companies who, due to the Covid-19 pandemic are facing delays to projected sales growth and whose fundraising plans are significantly impacted or stalled. Under this fund, HPSUs can apply for co-investment of &euro;50,000 per undertaking in the form of equity or convertible debt instruments.</p><p>In addition to this fund Enterprise Ireland has launched the following supports:</p><p>Covid-19 Business Financial Planning Grant: A &euro;5,000 grant for eligible companies to work with third party consultants to prepare a detailed financial plan with forecasts and assumptions. </p><p>Lean Business Continuity Voucher: A &euro;2,500 voucher for eligible companies to access training or advisory services support related to the continued operation of their business during the current pandemic. 156 applications have been received for the LEAN Business Continuity Voucher.</p><p>Covid-19 Online Retail Scheme is a grant for retail companies with greater than 10 employees to develop a more competitive online offer.  This competitive call has a budget of &euro;2 million. Successful applicants will receive funding support of up to 80% of project costs, with a maximum grant of &euro;40,000.</p><p>Restart Grant is a new &euro;250m Restart Grant providing direct grant aid to micro and small businesses, application forms are now available online on all local authority websites.  The grant is a contribution towards the cost of re-opening or keeping a business operational and re-connecting with employees and customers.</p><p>To qualify for the Restart Grant, a business must: </p><p>- have a turnover of less than &euro;5m and have 50 or less employees;</p><p>- have suffered a projected 25%+ loss in revenue from 1 April 2020 to 30 June 2020; </p><p>- commit to remain open or to reopen if it was closed. The business must also declare the intention to retain employees that are benefitting from the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS).</p><p>In addition to these new supports, there are a range of other supports to assist companies to start to scale, innovate, remain competitive, diversify into new markets and respond to Covid-19; these are:</p><p>- Strategic Consultancy Grant;</p><p>- Act On supports;</p><p>- Key Manager Grant; and,</p><p>- Business Process Improvement Grant;</p><p>- eiLearn Online Learning Platform; and,</p><p>- EI Virtual Mentoring Support.</p><p>Enterprise Ireland provides support for new start-ups and existing business through a wide range of initiatives and supports.

The national Return to Work Safely Protocol is designed to translate these measures into a clear compliance framework designed for places of work.  This is to help businesses to reopen so that workers can feel safe returning to work. The Health and Safety Authority will ensure compliance with the Protocol through a range of measures including advice, guidance, inspection and enforcement action as appropriate under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005.</p><p>The National Return to Work Safely Protocol is a useful guide for businesses in making their assessments and adapting their workplace procedures and practices to comply fully with the COVID-19 related public health protection measures.

Dublin City Council (DCC) and the NTA have already published a framework of proposals to address the new and urgent needs relating to commercial activity and mobility in Dublin City Centre.

Loan approval is subject to a full disclosure upfront and normal credit underwriting criteria.  As with all loan applications to MFI, the application does not guarantee loan approval.</p>  <p>  The MFI Covid-19 Loan was introduced as a support to microenterprises to help them access funding arising from the Covid-19 crisis.   </p>  <p>  These loans are available for eligible microenterprises responding to Covid-19-related difficulties, the negative impact of which must be a minimum of 15% of actual or projected income or profit.  Loans up to &euro;50,000 are available with terms that include a six months interest free and repayment free moratorium, with the loan to then be repaid over the remaining 30 months of the 36-month loan period. </p>  <p>  MFI provides vital support to microenterprises by filling the lending gap in the market by lending to business that cannot obtain loans from other commercial lenders.  It lends to business that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by commercial lenders and applies interest rate charges for its lending which are not reflective of its credit risk.  </p>  <p>  Standard loans from Microfinance Ireland have interest rates of between 6.8% and 7.8%. Given the cost burden to businesses even with these subsidised rates of interest I decided to apply a substantial reduction in the interest rate to 4.5% on the Covid-19 loans provided by MFI.  This reduced rate is available to all micro-enterprises where the application is made through the Local Enterprise Network or referred by a bank or Local Development Committees. </p>  <p>  As these loans are available interest free for the first six months, the net effect is to further reduce the net interest rate payable over the period of the loan.   </p>  <p>  The types of businesses normally supported, if they could obtain unsecured bank funding, would normally attract a significantly higher rate of interest due to the unsecured nature of this lending and the inherent risk.  Microfinance Ireland is a not-for-profit lender and is loss making due to the nature of the risk it is mandated to take.</p></reply>

Schemes and/or individual aid measures notified under this framework will be processed by the Commission very quickly, usually over the period of a week.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s inputs into the development of the Temporary State Aid Framework and subsequent amendments was coordinated by the State Aid Unit in my Department. This included engagement with the Commission on the two subsequent amendments to the Temporary Framework, the first of which was adopted on 3 April 2020 and the second was adopted on 8 May 2020. These amendments have provided Member States with additional options to tackle the economic impact of the Covid-19 crisis.</p>  <p>  During the consultation process for the development of Temporary Framework, the State Aid team in my Department requested, along with other Member States, that the de minimis threshold be raised from &euro;200,000 to &euro;500,000.  However, the Commission advised that any change to the regulation would take a longer period of time, and therefore be ineffective in dealing with the crisis. However, on the basis of these consultations with MS, the threshold in the Temporary Framework was increased from &euro;500,000 to &euro;800,000.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the Framework is to provide temporary, targeted amounts of aid to undertakings that find themselves facing a sudden shortage or even unavailability of liquidity.  Aid provided under the Temporary Framework can be cumulated with de minimis aid and other existing state aid measures, provided the provisions of these measures are respected.</p>  <p>  The flexibility provided by the Temporary Framework allows aid to be provided to undertakings, including SMEs, who are facing difficulties due to the current crisis without impacting on their individual de minimis thresholds. Undertakings that have reached the de minimis threshold of &euro;200,000 over the past three years will be able to access aid from schemes that operate under the Temporary Framework.</p>  <p>  I am conscious that the de minimis threshold for SMEs must be managed and our approach has always been to look at other state aid measures first when developing schemes. It is for this very reason that the &euro;200m Sustaining Enterprise Fund, which is operated by Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland and provides repayable advances of up to &euro;800,000 to eligible firms was notified by my Department and approved by the Commission under the Temporary Framework.</p>  <p>  Two further supports that have been announced which will operate under the Temporary Framework are the Restart Fund and the COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme. These will operate under the Temporary Framework rather than under the de minimis regulation so as to ensure that those companies who have come close to the &euro;200,000 threshold can still access these supports.</p>  <p>  The Restart Fund which is open for applications has been notified by my Department to the Commission on 28 May. The expanded COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme, announced on 2 May, will operate under the Temporary Framework and as such aid granted under these schemes, will not impact on the de minimis thresholds of beneficiaries.  This is due to be formally notified to the Commission shortly.</p>  <p>  For enterprises that have not yet reached their de minimis aid threshold some of the supports available under the de minimis Regulation are:</p>  <p>  - Covid-19 loans of up to &euro;50,000 from Microfinance Ireland for micro enterprises. Loans are available at an interest rate of between 4.5% and 5.5%, with the first six months interest and repayment free.  Businesses can apply through their nearest LEO or directly at microfinanceireland.ie;</p>  <p>  - The SBCI Covid-19 Working Capital Schemes opened for eligibility applications on 23 March. The maximum loan size under the scheme is &euro;1.5m (first &euro;500,000 unsecured) and the maximum interest rate is set at 4%. Eligibility criteria apply.  Applications can be made through the SBCI website at sbci.gov.ie;</p>  <p>  - The current Credit Guarantee Scheme supports loans of up to &euro;1m for periods of up to seven years. Applications can be made to AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank.</p>  <p>  In addition to the new package of liquidity measures announced by the Minister last week, including for micro-enterprises, the full range of Enterprise Ireland, Local Enterprise Office (LEO) and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta grant and advisory supports continue to be available to eligible firms to help with strategies to access finance, commence or ramp-up online trading activity, reconfigure business models, cut costs, innovate, diversify markets and supply chains and to improve competitiveness. Government will continue to explore funding potential at EU level, as necessary, for all enterprises including micro-enterprises, through funding mechanisms such as the European Regional Development Fund and through the EU&rsquo;s temporary state aid framework.</p>  <p>  My officials will continue to work with the Commission and with our Enterprise Agencies to ensure that enterprises are supported during these extraordinary and difficult times.</p></reply>

The Protocol should be used by all workplaces to adapt their workplace procedures and practices to comply fully with the COVID-19 related public health protection measures identified as necessary by the HSE and the Department of Health.  It is operating in parallel with existing workplace health and safety statutory requirements.</p>  <p>  The Health and Safety Authority is the lead Agency in relation to oversight and compliance with the Protocol. In line with Phase 1 of the Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business, the Health and Safety Authority launched a national programme of inspections to check compliance with the Return to Work Safely Protocol. Authority inspectors were on the ground from that date enforcing compliance with the Protocol. As of close of business on the 29th of May at the end of week 2 of phase 1 of the Roadmap, and since 18 May 2020 when the economy began to slowly reopen, approximately 1000 inspections were completed across a range of industries. The Authority, based on its initial analysis of the inspections, found that compliance with the Return to Work Safely Protocol is high and employers are generally taking a responsible and proactive approach.</p>  <p>  In addition to inspections the Health and Safety Authority continues to provide advice and support to employers and employees on how they are implementing the COVID-19 measures in the workplace as set out in the Protocol through its helpline, website and during site inspections. The Authority has also developed a range of checklists and templates which are available on its website for use by employers, workers and worker representatives, and further material is being developed.  The Authority&rsquo;s Inspectors have always and will continue to primarily use the model of advice, information and support when carrying out inspections.</p></reply>

These rates represent a significant saving compared with the prevailing rates that are otherwise being offered for similar loans on the market.</p><p>This scheme has been expanded by a further &euro;200m to facilitate longer-term lending to Covid-19-impacted businesses and my Department is working through the details of this expansion and will bring this funding to market as soon as possible.</p><p>The Covid-19 Loan, available from Microfinance Ireland (MFI), was introduced as a support to microenterprises to help them access funding arising from the Covid-19 crisis.</p><p>These loans are available for eligible microenterprises responding to Covid-19-related difficulties, the negative impact of which must be a minimum of 15% of actual or projected income or profit.  Loans up to &euro;50,000 are available with terms that include a six months interest free and repayment free moratorium, with the loan to then be repaid over the remaining 30 months of the 36-month loan period. </p><p>An interest rate to 4.5% applies on the Covid-19 loans provided by MFI.  This reduced rate is available to all micro-enterprises where the application is made through the Local Enterprise Network or referred by a bank or Local Development Committees. The new rate for direct applications to MFI is reduced to 5.5%.As these loans are available interest free for the first six months, the net effect is to further reduce the net interest rate payable over the period of the loan.  </p><p>Government has agreed a new &euro;2 billion COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme as a further development of the existing Credit Guarantee Scheme already available.  This Scheme forms a major component of the government&rsquo;s strategy to aid SMEs in these difficult times by providing critical support to ensure businesses are facilitated in having access to credit facilities to assist a return to a more regular trading environment.  It will provide an 80% guarantee on lending to SMEs until the end of this year, for terms between 3 months and 6 years.  The guarantee will be able to be used for a wide range of lending products between &euro;10,000 and &euro;1 million that have a maximum term of 6 years or less.</p><p>The Scheme will be available to all SME sectors, including primary producers.  It will also have interest rates below current market rates.  The implementation of this Scheme will require primary legislation, the drafting of which has commenced.  </p><p>There are a number of liquidity supports for COVID 19 impacted businesses available now, including the existing Credit Guarantee Scheme which was implemented in 2012, supporting loans up to &euro;1 million for periods of up to 7 years.  The scheme is designed to support a range of debt products appropriate to the borrowing needs of SMEs.An application to access the Credit Guarantee Scheme can be made through one of the participating lenders which are currently Allied Irish Banks, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank Ireland.  </p><p>The &euro;2,500 Trading Online Voucher Scheme for microenterprises is being expanded - an additional &euro;3.3m is being provided to the scheme bringing the total available to &euro;5.6m. The scheme is also being made more flexible - allowing businesses to apply for a second voucher of up to &euro;2,500 where they have successfully utilised their first one; and allowing subscriptions to low-cost online retailing platform solutions to quickly establish a retailing presence online.</p><p>As the reopening of the economy proceeds, more and more businesses are transitioning from the planning to the implementation phase as we progress through the 5 stages of the Government Roadmap.  It is in this context that the Business Continuity Voucher is being phased out and since 15 May, is closed to new applicants. The LEOs will continue to work with existing applicants and recipients of BCV vouchers and their subsequent business continuity plans. The awarding of vouchers under the BCV scheme will naturally taper off in the coming weeks as the Local Enterprise Offices process the outstanding applications. In recognition of this new stage the new &euro;250m Restart Grant was introduced to assist micro and small businesses to help them with the costs associated with reopening and reemploying workers following COVID-19 closures.</p><p>Enterprise Ireland, on behalf of the Department of Business Enterprise and Innovation has launched a new suite of COVID-19 supports, including the following.  </p><p>Sustaining Enterprise Fund: This &euro;180 million fund will provide support to eligible manufacturing and internationally traded services companies employing 10 or more employees who have been impacted by a 15 per cent or more reduction in actual or projected turnover or profit, and/or have a significant increase in costs as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. The objectives of the scheme are to:</p><p>- Ensure eligible companies have access to the necessary liquidity; and</p><p>- Sustain business so that companies can return to viability and contribute to the recovery of the Irish economy.</p><p>The Fund will provide financial assistance in the form of repayable advances of up to a maximum of &euro;800,000 per company.</p><p>Sustaining Enterprise Fund &ndash; Small Enterprise: This fund will provide a &euro;25,000 to &euro;50,000 short term working capital injection to eligible smaller companies to support business continuity and strengthen their ability to return to growth and be trading strongly in 3 years-time. </p><p>COVID 19 &ndash; HPSU Fund (SEF &ndash; HPSU): This fund is aimed at EI High Potential Start-Up companies who, due to the Covid-19 pandemic are facing delays to projected sales growth and whose fundraising plans are significantly impacted or stalled. Under this fund, HPSUs can apply for co-investment of &euro;50,000per undertaking in the form of equity or convertible debt instruments.</p><p>In addition to this fund Enterprise Ireland has launched the following supports:</p><p>Covid-19 Business Financial Planning Grant: A &euro;5,000 grant for eligible companies to work with third party consultants to prepare a detailed financial plan with forecasts and assumptions. 337 applications have been received for Covid-19 Business Financial Planning Grant.</p><p>Lean Business Continuity Voucher: A &euro;2,500 voucher for eligible companies to access training or advisory services support related to the continued operation of their business during the current pandemic. 156 applications have been received for the LEAN Business Continuity Voucher.</p><p>Covid-19 Online Retail Scheme is a grant for retail companies with greater than 10 employees to develop a more competitive online offer.  This competitive call has a budget of &euro;2 million. Successful applicants will receive funding support of up to 80% of project costs, with a maximum grant of &euro;40,000.</p><p>Restart Grant is a new&euro;250m Restart Grant providing direct grant aid to micro and small businesses, application forms are now available online on all local authority websites.  The grant is a contribution towards the cost of re-opening or keeping a business operational and re-connecting with employees and customers.</p><p>To qualify for the Restart Grant, a business must </p><p>- have a turnover of less than &euro;5m and have 50 or less employees.</p><p>- have suffered a projected 25%+ loss in revenue from 1 April 2020 to 30 June 2020. </p><p>- commit to remain open or to reopen if it was closed. The business must also declare the intention to retain employees that are benefitting from the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS).</p><p>In addition to these new supports, there are a range of other supports to assist companies to start to scale, innovate, remain competitive, diversify into new markets and respond to Covid-19; these are:</p><p>- Strategic Consultancy Grant</p><p>- Act On supports</p><p>- Key Manager Grant</p><p>- Business Process Improvement Grant</p><p>- eiLearn Online Learning Platform</p><p>- EI Virtual Mentoring Support.</p><p>Enterprise Ireland provides support for new start-ups and existing business through a wide range of initiatives and supports. The awarding of funding by the agency is based on eligibility, evaluation criteria and assessed company need. </p><p>InterTradeIreland </p><p>ITI has launched two new business supports, these are currently being targeted at companies who are already on one of their programmes. </p><p>E-merge: this will enable companies to engage consultancy support &amp;amp; advice (to the value of &pound;2500/&euro;2800) to help them develop online sales &amp;amp; ecommerce solutions </p><p>Emergency Business Solutions: Fully funded consultancy support &amp;amp; advice (to the value of &pound;2000/&euro;2250) to address key business challenges in areas such as emergency cashflow, loan applications and HR/People.</p><p>Together with the suite of Covid-19 supports The Return to Work Safely Protocol has been designed to support employers and workers to put measures in place that will prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the workplace, as the economy begins to slowly open up, following the temporary closure of most businesses during the worst phase of the current pandemic. The national Return to Work Safely Protocol is designed to translate these measures into a clear compliance framework designed for places of work.  This is to help businesses to reopen so that workers can feel safe returning to work. The Health and Safety Authority will ensure compliance with the Protocol through a range of measures including advice, guidance, inspection and enforcement action as appropriate under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005.</p><p>The National Return to Work Safely Protocol is a useful guide for businesses in making their assessments and adapting their workplace procedures and practices to comply fully with the COVID-19 related public health protection measures. It sets out in very clear terms for employers and workers the steps that they must take firstly before a workplace reopens, and then while it continues to operate.</p><p>The Protocol is available on www.gov.ie</p><p>The HSA will be the lead agency in overseeing compliance with the Protocol in the workplace.  If employers or employees need further guidance on the Protocol, the HSA Helpline can be contacted at 1890 289 389 or wcu@hsa.ie. </p><p>The National Standards Authority of Ireland&rsquo;s (NSAI) recently published COVID-19 Workplace Protection and Improvement Guide and the Covid-19 Retail Protection and Improvement Guide contain useful information that can be applied across many businesses.  </p><p>It is important to check <i></i>for the latest information, public health advice and guidelines from Government in relation to Covid-19. </p><p>Information and guidance for taxpayers and agents on the Temporary Wage Scheme can be found on the Revenue website at:</p><p><i></i><i>.</i></p><p>The Government will continue to monitor the need for sectoral guides, and should a need arise, I will work with my Department and Agencies to consider how we would best support or publish such a guide. I can assure the Deputy that I continue to work with my colleagues across Government to examine further appropriate supports to assist businesses impacted by Covid-19.</p></reply>

In addition, the agency is currently reviewing applications for funding under the &euro;15 million Border Enterprise Development Fund to further support activity in this area. </p><p>Enterprise Ireland funded centres are located in areas of both sectoral opportunity and economic challenge.

This challenge has the aim to support 10,000 co-working and incubation spaces regional. This initiative will assist enterprise centres in attracting employment opportunities to rural areas and also help to reduce travel for the workforce. The breakdown of this target by region is presented as follows.</p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th>Region</th>       <th>Support for co-working and incubator spaces</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Midlands</td>       <td>600</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mid-East</td>       <td>1,300</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin</td>       <td>2,800</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mid-West</td>       <td>900</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>South</td>       <td>1,400</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>South-East</td>       <td>900</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>West</td>       <td>1,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>North-East</td>       <td>600</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>North-West</td>       <td>500</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>With cities becoming increasingly crowded leading to scarce accommodation and increased commutes, remote work is an intervention with the potential to lessen accommodation pressures and support the transition to a greener economy. Remote work also has the potential to stimulate regional growth and to widen the talent pool in Ireland. </p><p>This is reflected in the Remote Work in Ireland report, which my Department published in December 2019. The objective of this research was to understand the prevalence and types of remote working arrangements within the Irish workforce, the attitudes towards such arrangements, and the influencing factors for both employers and employees partaking in remote working.</p><p>This research was informed by a large volume of desk research; engagement with key stakeholders; the outputs arising from a ministerial Remote Working Consultation Forum which was held in the Cavan Digital Hub in July 2019; and the dissemination of an online Remote Work Employee Survey. </p><p>The Remote Work Employee Survey reflected a significant demand for remote working options amongst existing employees. Of respondents who did not work remotely, 82.7% indicated that they would like to. A reduced commute was identified as a key motivator for those who wanted to work remotely, accounting for 39.9% of responses. This was most common amongst those living in the Mid-East (63.2%), West (43.3%) and Midlands (43.1%).</p><p>The report identified three key areas to be addressed to ensure that Ireland could reap the benefits of remote working: </p><p>- Data: The report found that there was a lack of current data available on employees, employers and the hub infrastructure. It was suggested that to aid informed policy in the area that more data should be collected.</p><p>- Collaboration: The report found that whilst some collaboration had taken place between bodies working on the remote work agenda that this could be strengthened. It was suggested that an Interdepartmental Group comprising of relevant departments and state agencies should be formed to align national policies and strategies.</p><p>- Guidance: The report found that there was a lack of an official framework on remote working and that employers were not always aware of the options available to support them. The report recognised that this presented a barrier to the increased adoption of remote working solutions. It identified the need for guidance for employers in the following five areas:</p><p>- Equality </p><p>- Health and Safety </p><p>- Employment Conditions and the Right to Disconnect </p><p>- Data Protection </p><p>- Training </p><p>To build on this work, my Department has committed to the establishment of an Interdepartmental Group comprising of all relevant Departments and Agencies to align approaches and develop clear guidance on remote work for employers and employees. This Group has now been formed and will be steering the development of guidance on this topic.</p><p>The development of guidance will take into account the main findings of the Remote Work in Ireland report as well as engaging in wide consultation with key social partners and stakeholders. This research will seek to identify any gaps and inconsistencies in the current guidance on remote working available and identify any news areas where guidance may be required. This work expected to be completed by the end of 2020.</p><p>Regional development is a key priority of mine and I am focused on maintaining existing jobs while also increasing the level of employment and investment in rural areas. Innovation is a critical element of regional economic sustainability and in order to grow, regional firms must be enabled to achieve sales outside their region.</p></reply>

The Safe Pass construction safety awareness scheme is developed, managed and maintained by SOLAS, the Further Education and Training Authority, which operates under the aegis of the Department of Education and Skills.</p>  <p>  The Department of Education and Skills and SOLAS took the decision to suspend the provision of Safe Pass training around 20 March due to COVID-19 public health concerns.  At the request of the Department of Education and Skills, and SOLAS, my Department amended the Construction Regulations so as to extend the period of validity of all existing SOLAS Safe Pass cards issued from 1st March 2016 beyond their current expiry date until such a time as Safe Pass training is available from SOLAS again.  The date of 1 March 2016 was used as the Safe Pass card is valid for a four-year period, so the people most immediately affected by the suspension of training by SOLAS are those whose &ldquo;four year card&rdquo; was due to expire from 1   March 2020 onwards.  </p>  <p>  With the re-opening of the Construction Sector in Phase one of the Government&rsquo;s Roadmap a lot of queries have arisen as to when SOLAS will resume the provision of Safe Pass training especially from people who did not renew their cards prior to 1 March, but also including new entrances to the sector and companies seeking oversea contractors to work on specialist projects to install plant.   </p>  <p>  Only SOLAS, in conjunction with their parent Department, the Department of Education and Skills, can decide on the resumption of Safe Pass training which will facilitate the people whose card expired prior to 1 March 2020.  I understand that the matter is under active consideration in the Department of Education and Skills.</p></reply>

The Roadmap sets out how we can keep the level of transmission of COVID-19 as low as possible while balancing continuing restrictions in proportion with the positive social and economic benefits which will be brought about by businesses reopening.  It is important to note that all decisions taken by Government on the timing of any lifting of restrictions as envisaged in Phases 2 to 5 of the Roadmap will be guided by the public health advice at the time.</p>  <p>   The efforts by all countries to reduce the rates of transmission is impacting the travel and tourism-related industries most acutely. I know this is a challenging and uncertain time for all the workers in the airline industry who have lost their jobs. I fully appreciate how difficult the situation is for those involved and their families. </p>  <p>  That is why my colleagues the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport Shane Ross and Minister of State for Tourism and Sport, Brendan Griffin TD, announced on 20th May the formation of a special Tourism Recovery Taskforce dedicated to spearheading economic recovery for the tourism sector, with an independent chairperson, Ruth Andrews, Chair of Irish Tourism Industry Confederation. I note also that the membership of the Taskforce includes Stephen Kavanagh, Board member and former CEO of Aer Lingus, together with the CEOs of F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland. The Taskforce is charged with preparing a Tourism Recovery Plan for submission to the Minister which will include a set of recommendations on how best the Irish tourism sector can adapt and recover in the changed tourism environment as a result of the COVID-19 crisis. The plan will identify priority aims, key enablers and market opportunities for the sector for the period 2020-2023. The Taskforce may consult with stakeholders to inform its deliberations and report back to the Minister in Q3 of this year.</p>  <p>  Full details of all Government supports for workers at this time are available at www.gov.ie, including details on the COVID-19 Income Support Scheme. My Department has agreed a Job Loss Response Protocol with the Department of Employment and Social Protection and the Department of Education and Skills. In this situation of job losses and redundancies, my colleague the Minister Regina Doherty and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection is the lead Minister and Department. The protocol puts in place all the efforts to assist the workers who are going to lose their jobs. It includes welfare entitlements, job-search assistance and upskilling needs/opportunities. </p>  <p>  This also includes managing relationships with staff unions. The principal actors are the local DEASP officers and local Education and Training Boards. Local staff from Enterprise Ireland, IDA and Local Enterprise Offices have a role in providing intelligence about which local firms are looking for particular skills.</p>  <p>  My colleague, Minister Shane Ross, Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport may be able to provide a more specific response to your query as the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport have primary responsibility for the aviation sector.</p></reply>

The categories of workers, list of retailers and other facilities that can reopen under Phase 1 are available on the Government&rsquo;s website gov.ie. </p><p>Government advice to businesses is that they should review the Roadmap carefully and carry out a detailed assessment of their activities with regard to the continuing public health measures.  Businesses should, based on their assessment, identify which category in which phase of reopening they will be in a position to reopen safely and in line with the continued public health measures.  It is not necessary for businesses to seek official authorisation to reopen.</p><p>The National Return to Work Safely Protocol provides a useful guide for businesses in making their assessments and adapting their workplace procedures and practices to comply fully with the COVID-19 related public health protection measures.

It is a particularly difficult time for retailers who have had to close their doors in the interest of public health and adherence to the public health guidelines</p><p>In order to assist businesses to address the challenges posed by COVID-19, the Government has put in place a comprehensive suite of supports for firms of all sizes, which includes the wage subsidy scheme, grants, low-cost loans, write-off of commercial rates and deferred tax liabilities. </p><p>These supports are designed to build confidence, to further assist businesses in terms of the management of their companies and to allow them to begin looking to the future and start charting a path forward for weeks and months ahead. For a full list of supports for business please see</p><p><i></i>. </p><p>For small shop owners, the Covid-19 Loan, available from Microfinance Ireland (MFI), which was introduced as a support to microenterprises to help them access funding arising from the Covid-19 crisis, is of particular help. The MFI loans are available for eligible microenterprises responding to Covid-19-related difficulties, the negative impact of which must be a minimum of 15% of actual or projected income or profit.  Loans up to &euro;50,000 are available with terms that include a six months interest free and repayment free moratorium, with the loan to then be repaid over the remaining 30 months of the 36-month loan period. </p><p>An interest rate to 4.5% applies on the Covid-19 loans provided by MFI.  This reduced rate is available to all micro-enterprises where the application is made through the Local Enterprise Network or referred by a bank or Local Development Committees. The new rate for direct applications to MFI is reduced to 5.5%.As these loans are available interest free for the first six months, the net effect is to further reduce the net interest rate payable over the period of the loan.  </p><p>Government has agreed a new &euro;2 billion COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme is a further development of the existing Credit Guarantee Scheme already available.  This Scheme forms a major component of the government&rsquo;s strategy to aid SMEs in these difficult times by providing critical support to ensure businesses are facilitated in having access to credit facilities to assist a return to a more regular trading environment.  It will provide an 80% guarantee on lending to SMEs until the end of this year, for terms between 3 months and 6 years.  The guarantee will be able to be used for a wide range of lending products between &euro;10,000 and &euro;1 million that have a maximum term of 6 years or less.</p><p>The Scheme will be available to all SME sectors, including primary producers.  It will also have interest rates below current market rates.  The implementation of this Scheme will require primary legislation, the drafting of which has commenced.</p><p>There are a number of liquidity supports for COVID 19 impacted businesses available now, including the existing Credit Guarantee Scheme which was implemented in 2012, supporting loans up to &euro;1 million for periods of up to 7 years.  The scheme is designed to support a range of debt products appropriate to the borrowing needs of SMEs.An application to access the Credit Guarantee Scheme can be made through one of the participating lenders which are currently Allied Irish Banks, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank Ireland.</p><p>The Government agreed details of a further support which will give direct grant aid to micro and small businesses to help them with the costs associated with reopening and reemploying workers following COVID-19 closures. The Restart Grant will be available to businesses with a turnover of less than &euro;5m and employing 50 people or less, which were closed or impacted by at least a 25% reduction in turnover out to 30 June 2020. It is a contribution towards the cost of re-opening or keeping a business operational and re-connecting with employees and customers. The grants will be equivalent to the rates bill of the business in 2019, with a minimum payment of &euro;2,000 and a maximum payment of &euro;10,000.  </p><p>If a company is currently in a rateable premise but was not rate-assessed in 2019 it is still eligible to apply. The local authority can pay the grant based on an estimate of what the rates demand for 2019 would have been. Applications for the Restart Grant can be made online directly to local authorities and further information is available on the application form.  If there are queries that are not on the application form, businesses can contact the Business Support Unit in each local authority.</p><p>All information including the application form will be available on the local authority website, the details of which are at the following link: <i></i>. </p><p>The growth in demand for shopping online domestically and globally is driving the retail sector more broadly to develop its online capability in order to enhance its competitiveness. Trading online is a very important route for retail businesses to grow and improve their business in the current crisis and will be an important element in their recovery over the longer term. In April of this year support was increased for two online trading initiatives to a total of &euro;7.6m: Trading Online Vouchers for micro enterprises in partnership with the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment, Richard Bruton TD; and a special Covid-19 Online Retail Scheme for indigenous retailers with 10 or more employees administered by Enterprise Ireland.</p><p>Firstly, in conjunction with Minister Bruton's Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment, I have increased support for the Trading Online Voucher Scheme which is available to all micro enterprises with up to 10 employees, including those in the retail sector through the Local Enterprise Office network nationwide. The &euro;2,500 Trading Online Vouchers are a key government support to help small and micro enterprises, with very limited or no e-commerce presence, to get online, boost their sales and reach new markets &ndash; particularly during this difficult period, when so many small businesses are closed to the public. Flexibilities to the Trading Online Voucher scheme are now in place allowing businesses apply for a second voucher where they have successfully utilised their first one, which brings the overall total voucher amount available up to &euro;5,000 for each eligible business.  Further details about the expanding Trading Online Voucher Scheme are available at</p><p><i></i></p><p>The Covid-19 Online Retail Scheme, which closed for applications on 27 May 2020, is complementary to the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) Trading Online Voucher Scheme. The objective of the Scheme, administered by Enterprise Ireland, is to support companies in the indigenous retail sector which have started an online journey, which will have the most immediate impact enabling them to respond to both domestic and international consumer demand with a competitive online offer. </p><p>My Department has introduced this Scheme in response to the COVID-19 crisis and the urgent need for retail companies to achieve a step change in online capability. Applicant companies must employ 10 or more people, have an existing online presence (e.g. website or social media), and have a retail outlet through which they derive the majority of their revenue. Successful applicants will be awarded funding to support a maximum of 80% of the project costs. Grants ranging from &euro;10,000 to &euro;40,000 will be awarded under the competitive scheme. </p><p>This Scheme is not about taking the first steps; it is about raising the bar, in an informed, planned and strategic way.  The total fund size will be up to &euro;2 million under this call. Further details on this Scheme available at</p><p><i></i></p><p>I am committed to supporting the needs of the retail sector at this time and in developing their online capability and enhancing their competitiveness.</p><p>The Temporary Wage Support Scheme (TWSS) is provided for in section 28 of the recently enacted Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020.  Deputies will be aware that the TWSS is an emergency measure to deal with the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the economy and in particular to support employment relationships which were already in place before the commencement of the scheme.  </p><p>The underlying legislation and the scheme itself were developed quickly, having regard to the urgent Government objective of getting much needed assistance to employers and employees, where businesses have been seriously affected by the pandemic and the necessary restrictions introduced as a result of the Public Health Emergency.</p><p>The TWSS can only operate in respect of an employee, whether full-time or part-time, who was on the payroll of the employer as at 29 February 2020.  The TWSS builds on data returned to Revenue through its real-time PAYE system. The core principles of the scheme are that:</p><p>- the business is suffering significant negative economic impact due to the pandemic,</p><p>- the employees in respect of whom the wage subsidy is claimed were included on the employer&rsquo;s payroll on 29 February 2020, and</p><p>- the February 2020 payroll submissions were submitted to Revenue before, in general, 15 March 2020 but recently extended, by concession, to 1 April 2020.</p><p>The latter two conditions were particularly designed with a view to preventing abuse of the scheme.</p><p>While the issue of Commercial Rates is a policy matter for the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, I can inform you that, on 2 May, the Government announced that commercial rates are being waived for a three-month period beginning on 27 March for businesses that have been forced to close due to public health requirements.</p><p>The Government will continue to actively engage with business owners and representative bodies. Local Authorities, who have longstanding experience in dealing with ratepayers and showing an understanding of their financial situations, are assessing the impact of COVID-19 by engaging directly with individual ratepayers, recognising that there may be impacts on sectors outside of those initially identified as being most under threat. </p><p>Furthermore, my Department will continue to monitor the issue and engage with other Departments, in particular the Department of Housing Planning and Local Government, to ensure there is continued support to business in this regard. The position will remain under review as part of a wider review of options to support enterprises and employment, and associated local authority funding implications, once the unwinding of public health restrictions has advanced.</p><p>Issues relating to taxation are a matter for my colleague the Minister for Finance who has announced that &lsquo;deferred&rsquo; tax liabilities will be warehoused for a period of 12 months from the time when restrictions are eased for the sector the business operates in. Interest will not accrue during this 12-month period. This represents a very significant boost of liquidity for businesses of all sizes across the country.  It is estimated that by the end of April approximately &euro;800m in payments relating to the first quarter had been deferred.</p><p>I am also informed that Revenue also announced a suspension of interest and late payment charges on tax debts for SMEs automatically and for larger businesses by arrangement. Tax clearance status will be maintained for businesses entering into these arrangements. Furthermore, all enforcement action has been ceased until further notice.</p><p>After the twelve-month period, the interest will be charged at the very much reduced rate of 3% and the timeframe to pay off this debt will be flexible and will be determined by the ability of the business to pay both COVID-19 related debts as well as meet its ongoing liabilities as they arise. Information and guidance for taxpayers and agents on VAT, can be found on the Revenue website at: <i></i></p><p>Finally, it is important that all businesses check <i></i>for the latest information, public health advice and guidelines from Government in relation to Covid-19. </p><p>I can assure the Deputy that I continue to work with my colleagues across Government to examine further appropriate supports to assist businesses impacted by Covid-19.</p></reply>

The voucher can now also be used towards subscriptions to low cost online retail platform solutions, to help companies quickly establish a retailing presence online.  </p><p>My Department proposed these changes to the voucher in response to the COVID-19 crisis and the urgent need for companies to achieve a step change in online capability.  </p><p>The eligibility criteria which applies to businesses seeking to avail of this includes:</p><p>- proof of trading for more than 6 months </p><p>- Have no more than 10 employees;</p><p>- Have less than &euro;2m in turnover;</p><p>- be located in the region of the local enterprise office to whom they are applying.</p><p>There has been a tremendous demand for the scheme from enterprises across the country since its expansion and as of the 26th May, there have been over 3,500 applications, the approximate equivalent of 3 years demand in a little over two months.

The Roadmap sets out how we can keep the level of transmission of COVID-19 as low as possible while balancing continuing restrictions in proportion with the positive social and economic benefits which will be brought about by businesses reopening. </p><p>The National Return to Work Safely Protocol is a useful guide for businesses in making their assessments and adapting their workplace procedures and practices to comply fully with the COVID-19 related public health protection measures as they prepare to re-open in accordance with the Roadmap. The Protocol sets out in very clear terms for employers and workers the steps that they must take firstly before a workplace reopens, and then while it continues to operate. It is available at</p><p><i></i>. </p><p>The Health and Safety Authority, which is an agency of my Department, is the lead agency in overseeing compliance with the Protocol in the workplace.  If employers or employees need further guidance on the Protocol, the HSA Helpline can be contacted at 1890 289 389 or<i>wcu@hsa.ie</i>. </p><p>I met recently with members of the hairdressing and beauty industry via teleconference and understand that preparatory work is being undertaken by the hairdressing sector and others in developing guidelines and safety protocols, with reference to the Government&rsquo;s Return to Work Safely Protocol. I requested that, where sectors are developing protocols or guides, they should  work together to align this work. For example, barbers' representative bodies should collaborate with hairdressers representative bodies on a single aligned protocol for their sector. I am keen to support sectors on their safe reopening on this aligned and collaborative basis and should the hairdressing sector and the beauty sector wish to send me details of their sectoral protocol, I will be happy to convey these to the Minister for Health.</p><p>With regard to the pub sector, I met with representatives of the Vitners&rsquo; Federation of Ireland and the Licensed Vitners Association last week by video conference. The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the re-opening of the pub sector within the context of the Roadmap. Both bodies provided feedback on the Government supports that are currently available and outlined their proposals for additional supports. I agreed to consider these proposals in consultation with my Government colleagues as we seek to unlock the restrictions that are currently in place and re-open our economy.</p><p>The Department of Transport Tourism and Sport continues to liaise with other Government Departments and industry representative bodies, to align the economy wide COVID-19 supports and initiatives with tourism and hospitality needs. A Tourism Recovery Taskforce has been established to produce a Recovery Plan containing actions which will help the sector to get back on its feet and begin to recapture the ground lost due to the pandemic. The Taskforce has an independent Chair and comprises representatives from Government, the tourism agencies and the industry. </p><p>Pending further announcements on the sectors that can re-open under Phases 2 to 5 of the Roadmap, businesses are being advised to read the National Return to Work Safely Protocol as they prepare to re-open.</p><p>It is also important to highlight the comprehensive suite of supports for firms of all sizes which have been put in place by Government in order to assist businesses to address the challenges posed by COVID-19. These supports include the wage subsidy scheme, grants, low-cost loans, write-off of commercial rates and deferred tax liabilities, all of which are designed to build confidence, to further assist businesses in terms of the management of their companies and to allow them to begin looking to the future and start charting a path forward for weeks and months ahead.

I know that employers and employees want to get back to work and I support them in that ambition, but it must be safe to do so.  My Department contributed to the considerations around the phased re-opening of sectors under Phase 1 of the Roadmap and I will work within Government to secure further details and clarity for businesses, including those in the sectors referred to, as we progress through the phases outlined in the Roadmap. </p><p>It is important to note that all decisions taken by Government on the timing of any lifting of restrictions as envisaged in Phases 2 to 5 of the Roadmap will be guided by the public health advice at the time.</p></reply>

Section 31A(7) provides that a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who suspects, with reasonable cause, that a person is contravening (or has contravened) a provision of a regulation made under section 31A that is specified to be a penal provision may, for the purposes of ensuring compliance with the regulation, direct the person to take such steps as are necessary to comply with the provision (it is an offence not to do so without lawful authority or reasonable excuse and the member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may arrest that person without warrant). Provision is also made for the taking of the name and address of any person believed to be contravening such regulations (with similar penalties arising for not doing so).</p>  <p>  The Health Act 1947 (Section 31A -Temporary Restrictions) (Covid-19) Regulations 2020 (S.I. No 121 of 2020), as amended, provide that the requirement to remain at home without reasonable excuse is a penal provision.  Under section 31A, this means that breaching it is an offence, punishable by a fine of up to &euro;2,500 of imprisonment of up to 6 months, or both.  A Garda who, with reasonable cause, suspects that a person is breaching this requirement may direct the person to take steps to come into compliance, in effect to go home.   A person who, without lawful authority or reasonable excuse, fails to comply with such a direction is guilty of a separate offence, again punishable by a fine of up to &euro;2,500 or imprisonment of up to 6 months, or both. The Garda may also arrest such a person without warrant. The Garda may also require the person to give his or her name and address, and again it is an offence, with the same punishment, to refuse or to give an address that is false or misleading. The Regulations also impose restrictions upon events, which is also a penal provision to which similar penalties apply.</p>  <p>  Any amendment to the existing Regulations, including any requirement for penal provisions, must give due cognisance to the on-going threat that the disease represents and is predicated upon carefully considered public health advice, provided by the Chief Medical Officer and the National Public Health Emergency Team. To date, any unwinding of Regulatory measures has carefully adhered to these requirements, taking care to ensure that any proposed loosening of restrictions is made on the basis of the best available medical guidance and advice.</p>  <p>  Both the provisions of section 31A and Regulations made thereunder are time-bound, being subject to sunset clauses to ensure that they are applicable for no longer than is necessary. Any extension of the date of operation (currently until 8 June 2020) or content of the Regulations is subject to consultation with relevant Ministers as well as relevant public health advice. </p>  <p>  In the case of section 31A and associated amendments to the Health Act 1947 inserted by the provisions of the 2020 Act, any extension of the relevant provisions of the Act beyond 9 November 2020 is subject to a resolution passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas. </p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s Roadmap for Reopening Society &amp;amp; Business, published on 1 May 2020, sets out an indicative path to the easing of COVID 19 restrictions and other actions in order to facilitate the reopening of Ireland&rsquo;s society and economy in a phased manner. It is anticipated that these changes will also be reflected through the evolution of the regulatory regime in place, so as to maintain alignment with the revisions being made to the public health approach.</p></reply>

The Roadmap specifies that decisions in relation to which actions will be taken and which public health measures might be lifted will be made in accordance with the Framework for Future Decision-Making which is as follows:</p><p>1. Before each Government consideration of the easing of restrictions, the Department of Health will provide a report to the Government regarding the following on/off trigger criteria:  </p><p>a. The latest data regarding the progression of the disease,  </p><p>b. The capacity and resilience of the health service in terms of hospital and ICU occupancy,</p><p>c. the capacity of the programme of sampling, testing and contact tracing, </p><p>d. The ability to shield and care for at risk groups, </p><p>e. An assessment of the risk of secondary morbidity and mortality as a consequence of the restrictions. </p><p>2.  It will also provide risk-based public health advice on what measures could be modified in the next period. </p><p>3.  The Government would then consider what restrictions could be lifted, having regard to the advice of the Department of Health as well as other social and economic considerations, e.g. the potential for increased employment, relative benefits for citizens and businesses, improving national morale and wellbeing etc. </p><p>4. It is acknowledged that there is also an ongoing possibility that restrictions could be re-imposed and this process will be carried out on an ongoing basis once every 3 weeks.</p><p>As is clear from the framework, it is the Government rather than I or my Department that will decide on any modifications to the current public health measures in place and those decisions will be informed by the status of the on/off trigger criteria and the public health advice received at the time that a decision is being made. </p><p>Guidance in relation to specific sectors of the economy should in the first instance be sought from the Government Department with responsibility for that sector.</p></reply>

This policy, which has been adopted by the HSE, sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists.</p>  <p>  In response to the Covid-19 pandemic the HSE had to take measures to defer all non-urgent elective scheduled care activity, including outpatient clinics. This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the World Health Organisation, and the National Action Plan published on 16 March. The trajectory of the disease means there is now an opportunity for increasing the provision of non-covid care including more routine care. It is envisaged that the private hospitals will play an important role in this regard.</p>  <p>  My Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund are currently working together to estimate the impact of Covid 19 on Scheduled Care waiting lists, in order to be prepared to address any backlog or pent up demand. My Department continues to ensure that the resources available throughout our health system are best utilised at this unique and challenging time.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly.</p></reply>

The Roadmap specifies that decisions in relation to which actions will be taken and which public health measures might be lifted will be made in accordance with the Framework for Future Decision-Making which is as follows:</p><p>1. Before each Government consideration of the easing of restrictions, the Department of Health will provide a report to the Government regarding the following on/off trigger criteria:  </p><p>a. The latest data regarding the progression of the disease,  </p><p>b. The capacity and resilience of the health service in terms of hospital and ICU occupancy,</p><p>c. The capacity of the programme of sampling, testing and contact tracing, </p><p>d. The ability to shield and care for at risk groups, </p><p>e. An assessment of the risk of secondary morbidity and mortality as a consequence of the restrictions. </p><p>2.  It will also provide risk-based public health advice on what measures could be modified in the next period. </p><p>3.  The Government would then consider what restrictions could be lifted, having regard to the advice of the Department of Health as well as other social and economic considerations, e.g. the potential for increased employment, relative benefits for citizens and businesses, improving national morale and wellbeing etc. </p><p>4.  It is acknowledged that there is also an ongoing possibility that restrictions could be re-imposed and this process will be carried out on an ongoing basis once every 3 weeks.</p><p>As is clear from the framework, it is the Government rather than I or my Department that will decide on any modifications to the current public health measures in place and those decisions will be informed by the status of the on/off trigger criteria and the public health advice received at the time that a decision is being made. </p><p>On 9 May the &ldquo;Return to Work Safely Protocol - COVID-19 Specific National Protocol for Employers and Workers&rdquo; was published. It provides clear guidance to employers and to workers on the measures that must be taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the workplace. The Protocol was developed through the cooperation of the Health and Safety Authority, the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, the HSE and my Department. It is designed to be used by all workplaces to adapt their procedures and practices to provide protection against the threat of COVID-19.</p><p>In general, with the exception of public health advice, the responsibility for providing guidance in relation to a particular sector of our economy or on a specific activity remains with the Government Department with responsibility for that sector or activity. The Department of Justice and Equality is responsible for property services regulation.</p></reply>

On 5 May, NPHET agreed that its recommendation of 27 March, in regard to the pausing of all non-essential health services should be replaced, in relation to acute care, with a recommendation that delivery of acute care be determined by appropriate clinical and operational decision making. </p>  <p>  Guidance on patient pathways to mitigate the risks associated with the delivery of non-covid care, for patients and healthcare workers, and support safe delivery of care has been developed under the auspices of the Expert Advisory Subgroup of NPHET (EAG) and approved in principle by NPHET.   </p>  <p>  The HSE advise that preliminary figures show that as of 25th May, 7,605 patients had been discharged from private hospitals having undergone an inpatient procedure since the arrangement between the HSE and private hospitals came into force. In the same period 26,007 daycase procedures took place in private hospitals, as well as 35,073 diagnostic appointments and 20,407 outpatient appointments. </p>  <p>  Under the terms agreed with the hospitals, provision has been made to ensure continuity of care for patients who were in a private hospital or receiving a course of treatment when the arrangement was agreed. These patients will be treated as public patients and will be prioritised based on clinical needs, as with any other public patient.</p></reply>

Transport is not considered a core Health service and as such Day Service funding does not include transport. </p><p>In the Cavan/Monaghan area, the HSE have informed the department that the Community Healthcare Organisation (CHO 1) works with Local Link to provide a co-ordinated and efficient transport service, for all service users going to day services operated or funded by the HSE. The HSE pays 90% of the costs of this day service transport, with the remainder funded through passenger fares. The HSE has no remit to provide transport but recognises that service users living in rural areas would not be able to access services without transport supports. </p><p>It is important to note that at present fares (&euro;4) are collected on &quot;closed&quot; routes (i.e. not open to the general public but for HSE service users only). Service users who are using a public &quot;open&quot; Local Link bus route to get to their day service, can use their free bus pass. </p><p>The &euro;4 charge collected on these 'closed' routes contributes to overall improvements in service delivery including increased number of routes, shorter journey times and improvement in quality of vehicles used.  </p><p>The HSE service provided is;</p><p>- Safe and of the highest quality providing door to door transport for people attending HSE funded services, including assigned designated Garda vetted drivers per service so that relationships and trust are developed between passenger and driver</p><p>- fully accessible</p><p>- best value for money</p><p>- co-ordinated and managed in a professional manner by people who have expertise in transport provision</p><p>- reviewed continuously to ensure shorter passenger journey times. </p><p>This partnership with transport providers commenced in Sligo and Leitrim in 2012. At this time, day services commenced collecting transport fares within the centre. However, some centres did not collect fares and to ensure equity all passengers across CHO1 are now being requested to pay fares.</p></reply>

Full eligibility is determined primarily by reference to income limits. Determination of an individual&rsquo;s eligibility status is the responsibility of the HSE.</p>  <p>  Adults with full eligibility can access a range of services including GP services, prescribed drugs and medicines, all in-patient public hospital services in public wards, including consultants&rsquo; services, all out-patient public hospital services including consultants&rsquo; services, dental, ophthalmic and aural services and appliances and a maternity and infant care service.</p>  <p>  Persons with limited eligibility are eligible for in-patient and outpatient public hospital services including Consultant services, Emergency Department or minor injury care, are subject to certain charges. Other services such as allied healthcare professional services may also be made available to persons with limited eligibility.</p>  <p>  A General Practitioner Visit Card provides for eligible individuals to visit a participating GP service without fees and also covers visits to GP out-of-hours service.</p>  <p>  The HSE Counselling in Primary Care Service (CIPC) is for people with mild to moderate psychological difficulties. It is a short-term counselling service that provides up to eight counselling sessions with a professionally qualified and accredited Counsellor/Therapist. It is a service for medical card holders, who are 18 years of age or over, and who require help with psychological problems that are appropriate for time-limited counselling in Primary Care. It is not available to GP Card holders. </p>  <p>  The development of all aspects of mental health services remains a priority for Government. Mental health services, including those for young people, have benefited from significant additional investment over recent years. This has resulted in an overall provision of &euro;1.026 billion for the HSE Mental Health care programme in 2020, reflecting an increase of &euro;315m since 2012 and an increase of &euro;39m over 2019.</p>  <p>  Any new service proposals have to be assessed in light of various factors. These include the spectrum of other existing counselling services provided either directly or on behalf of the HSE, emerging new service priorities in the health sector, and overall resource availability taking into account competing demands for health services over 2020 or beyond. In this context, I will keep in mind the proposal raised by the Deputy.</p></reply>

The site provides a comprehensive range of information and supports related to substance use.</p>  <p>  Recently, the HSE launched Know the Score, the first national evidence-based resource on alcohol and drugs for senior cycle students. It aims to engage young people in exploring and considering a wide range of topics related to the risks associated with alcohol and drugs.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health, as part of the introduction of the Health Diversion Programme, is providing &euro;100,000 in 2020 to develop a national harm reduction campaign to raise awareness of the risks associated with drug use. This will include the use of club drugs, festival drug use and new trends. While this campaign was originally scheduled for the latter part of 2020, this timetable may need to be revised given the draw on resources in dealing with Covid 19.</p>  <p>I strongly support treating substance misuse and drug addiction as a public health issue. This does not mean we should be complacent about the risks associated with drug use, especially for young people. I believe that a multi-faceted approach, involving online resources, in-school interventions and targeted awareness campaigns, can minimise the risk of substance misuse among young people.</p></reply>

The Roadmap specifies that decisions in relation to which actions will be taken and which public health measures might be lifted will be made in accordance with the Framework for Future Decision-Making which is as follows:</p><p>1. Before each Government consideration of the easing of restrictions, the Department of Health will provide a report to the Government regarding the following on/off trigger criteria:</p><p>a. The latest data regarding the progression of the disease,</p><p>b. The capacity and resilience of the health service in terms of hospital and ICU occupancy,</p><p>c. The capacity of the programme of sampling, testing and contact tracing,</p><p>d. The ability to shield and care for at risk groups,</p><p>e. An assessment of the risk of secondary morbidity and mortality as a consequence of the restrictions.</p><p>2. It will also provide risk-based public health advice on what measures could be modified in the next period.</p><p>3. The Government would then consider what restrictions could be lifted, having regard to the advice of the Department of Health as well as other social and economic considerations, e.g. the potential for increased employment, relative benefits for citizens and businesses, improving national morale and wellbeing etc.</p><p>4. It is acknowledged that there is also an ongoing possibility that restrictions could be re-imposed and this process will be carried out on an ongoing basis once every 3 weeks.</p><p>As is clear from the framework, it is the Government rather than I or my Department that will decide on any modifications to the current public health measures in place and those decisions will be informed by the status of the on/off trigger criteria and the public health advice received at the time that a decision is being made.</p></reply>

The Act provides that persons who are unable, without due hardship, to arrange GP services for themselves and family can qualify for full eligibility (a medical card). The HSE awards medical cards in accordance with the Health Act, and assesses applicants on the overall financial situation of the applicant and his or her spouse or partner.</p>  <p>  Every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of any difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines. The HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card or GP visit card, even though an applicant exceeds the income threshold where they face difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that since July 2018, persons in receipt of either full or half rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance or Carer&rsquo;s Benefit receive automatic eligibility for a GP visit card.</p></reply>

Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy, a standardised approach to managing scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures, since January 2014, has been developed to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. This policy, which has been adopted by the HSE, sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists.</p>  <p>  In response to the Covid-19 pandemic the HSE had to take measures to defer all non-urgent elective scheduled care activity, including outpatient clinics. This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the World Health Organisation, and the National Action Plan published on 16 March. The trajectory of the disease means there is now an opportunity for increasing the provision of non-covid care including more routine care. It is envisaged that the private hospitals will play an important role in this regard.</p>  <p>  My Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund are currently working together to estimate the impact of Covid 19 on Scheduled Care waiting lists, in order to be prepared to address any backlog or pent up demand. My Department continues to ensure that the resources available throughout our health system are best utilised at this unique and challenging time.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly.</p></reply>

For more information relating to the MCAP and the clinical guidelines, please see my Department's website.  </p><p>Commercial suppliers whose cannabis products have been reviewed and are considered to have met the specified requirements set out in the legislation and are in line with the clinical guidance for the MCAP, will have their products added to Schedule 1 of the Misuse of Drugs (Prescription and Control of Supply of Cannabis for Medical Use) Regulations 2019. Once the products are listed in Schedule 1 of these Regulations the suppliers will be permitted to supply these products to the Irish market, in line with legal and regulatory requirements. Cannabis products will only be listed in Schedule 1 of the Regulations once they have been assessed as suitable for medical use under the MCAP.</p><p>To date three products have been added to Schedule 1 of the Misuse of Drugs (Prescription and Control of Supply of Cannabis for Medical Use) Regulations 2019. The three products are:</p><p>1. Aurora High CBD Oil Drops</p><p>2. CannEpil &trade;</p><p>3. Tilray Oral Solution THC10:CBD10 25ml.</p><p>The HSE has engaged in discussions with the suppliers of these products, regarding pricing and supply information. The HSE will consider such information, in line with the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013. The programme will not become fully operational until pricing and supply matters are agreed. </p><p>Once the Medical Cannabis Access Programme commences the HSE will establish and maintain a Register to facilitate the enrolment and recording of certain data including patient identifiers (in anonymised format), prescribers enrolled in the Programme, as well as prescribed/supplied medical cannabis products. I can advise that while the MCAP register is not currently operational, engagement is ongoing with the HSE in regard to progressing same.</p><p>Pending full operation of the MCAP and for medical indications not included in the MCAP, Doctors may continue to utilise the Ministerial licencing route to prescribe medical cannabis for their patients, should they wish to do so. In line with the Chief Medical Officer's advice, the granting of a licence for cannabis for medical purposes must be premised on an appropriate application being submitted to the Department of Health, which is endorsed by a consultant who is responsible for the management of the patient and who is prepared to monitor the effects of the treatment over time.</p><p>This information, including the clinical guidelines, can also be found on the Department's website at the following address: </p><p><i></i></p><p><b>It is important to note that the medical decision to prescribe or not prescribe any treatment, including cannabis treatment, for an individual patient is strictly a decision for the treating clinician, in consultation with their patient. I have no role in this clinical decision-making process.</b></p><p>Operators require a controlled drug licence or registration processed by the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA), on behalf of the Department of Health, if they wish to produce/manufacture, possess, supply, import or export any controlled drug in the schedules to the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2017.</p></reply>

The Roadmap specifies that decisions in relation to which actions will be taken and which public health measures might be lifted will be made in accordance with the Framework for Future Decision-Making which is as follows:</p><p>1. Before each Government consideration of the easing of restrictions, the Department of Health will provide a report to the Government regarding the following on/off trigger criteria:</p><p>a. The latest data regarding the progression of the disease,</p><p>b. The capacity and resilience of the health service in terms of hospital and ICU occupancy,</p><p>c. The capacity of the programme of sampling, testing and contact tracing,</p><p>d. The ability to shield and care for at risk groups,</p><p>e. An assessment of the risk of secondary morbidity and mortality as a consequence of the restrictions.</p><p>2. It will also provide risk-based public health advice on what measures could be modified in the next period.</p><p>3. The Government would then consider what restrictions could be lifted, having regard to the advice of the Department of Health as well as other social and economic considerations, e.g. the potential for increased employment, relative benefits for citizens and businesses, improving national morale and wellbeing etc.</p><p>4. It is acknowledged that there is also an ongoing possibility that restrictions could be re-imposed and this process will be carried out on an ongoing basis once every 3 weeks.</p><p>As is clear from the framework, it is the Government rather than I or my Department that will decide on any modifications to the current public health measures in place and those decisions will be informed by the status of the on/off trigger criteria and the public health advice received at the time that a decision is being made.</p></reply>

The Roadmap specifies that decisions in relation to which actions will be taken and which public health measures might be lifted will be made in accordance with the Framework for Future Decision-Making which is as follows:</p><p>1. Before each Government consideration of the easing of restrictions, the Department of Health will provide a report to the Government regarding the following on/off trigger criteria:</p><p>a. The latest data regarding the progression of the disease,</p><p>b. The capacity and resilience of the health service in terms of hospital and ICU occupancy,</p><p>c. The capacity of the programme of sampling, testing and contact tracing,</p><p>d. The ability to shield and care for at risk groups,</p><p>e. An assessment of the risk of secondary morbidity and mortality as a consequence of the restrictions.</p><p>2. It will also provide risk-based public health advice on what measures could be modified in the next period.</p><p>3. The Government would then consider what restrictions could be lifted, having regard to the advice of the Department of Health as well as other social and economic considerations, e.g. the potential for increased employment, relative benefits for citizens and businesses, improving national morale and wellbeing etc.</p><p>4. It is acknowledged that there is also an ongoing possibility that restrictions could be re-imposed and this process will be carried out on an ongoing basis once every 3 weeks.</p><p>As is clear from the framework, it is the Government rather than I or my Department that will decide on any modifications to the current public health measures in place and those decisions will be informed by the status of the on/off trigger criteria and the public health advice received at the time that a decision is being made. </p><p>On 9 May the &ldquo;Return to Work Safely Protocol - COVID-19 Specific National Protocol for Employers and Workers&rdquo; was published. It provides clear guidance to employers and to workers on the measures that must be taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the workplace. The Protocol was developed through the cooperation of the Health and Safety Authority, the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, the HSE and my Department. It is designed to be used by all workplaces to adapt their procedures and practices to provide protection against the threat of COVID-19.</p><p>In addition, the HSE&rsquo;s Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) 'Guidance on cocooning to protect people over 70 years and those extremely medically vulnerable from COVID-19', strongly advises people over 70 years of age and those with serious underlying medical conditions, which put them at very high risk of severe illness from coronavirus (COVID-19), to rigorously follow cocooning measures in order to keep themselves safe. </p><p>In general, with the exception of public health advice, the responsibility for providing guidance in relation to a particular sector of our economy or on a specific activity remains with the Government Department with responsibility for that sector or activity.</p></reply>

In order to urgently ramp up capacity for acute care facilities, an arrangement was agreed with the private hospitals to use their facilities as part of the public system on a temporary basis, to provide essential services. A Heads of Terms of an Agreement between the HSE and the Private Hospitals was agreed at the end of March 2020 and all 18 of the acute private hospitals signed up to it. Under the arrangement, all patients in the private hospitals are treated as public patients and their treatment is prioritised based on clinical need. Provision was made under the agreement to allow for continuity of care for patients who were in a private hospital or attending for treatment at the time the Heads of Terms of the Agreement were agreed, on the grounds that these patients would be treated as public patients. It is intended that each patient will remain under the care of their existing consultant, where that can be facilitated and if that is not possible, they will be transferred to the care of another consultant as a public patient. </p>  <p>  The agreement was reviewed at the end of May and the Government decided that the existing arrangement should not be extended beyond the end of June. It has however mandated the HSE to negotiate a new arrangement with private hospitals which would provide the HSE with full access to private hospital capacity in the event of a surge of Covid-19 and separately with ongoing agreed access, to enable the HSE to meet essential and elective care needs.</p>  <p>  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic the HSE had to take measures to defer all non-urgent elective scheduled care activity, including outpatient clinics. This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for COVID-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the World Health Organisation, the measures set out in the Action Plan in Response to Covid-19 and the recommendation of NPHET. The NPHET has now recommended that steps be taken to resume non-urgent scheduled care in the context of the safe care guidelines set out by its Expert Advisory Group. </p></reply>

Turnaround times have continued to improve and the HSE continues to implement measures to further reduce turnaround times so as to its target to complete the testing process from referral to the completion of contact tracing within 3 days or less in 90% cases. The HSE continues to work intensively to further develop processes and turnaround times across the testing and tracing pathway and a range of further improvements will be rolled out in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  Significant progress has been made over recent weeks to scale up Ireland's testing services. Ireland's testing strategy has evolved as testing capacity has grown. A number of changes have been made to the case definition so that anyone presenting with acute respiratory infection comprising the sudden onset of least one of the following symptoms (cough, fever, shortness of breath) can be referred for testing. Our strategy is to target testing at those groups or populations where the virus is most likely to be and where it&rsquo;ll do most harm.</p></reply>

There is extensive guidance in place for healthcare workers and this can be found on the HPSC website: https://www.hpsc.ie/a-z/respiratory/coronavirus/novelcoronavirus/guidance/guidanceforhealthcareworkers/. There is also clear guidance in place for the assessment, testing and return to work of healthcare workers. .</p><p>In addition, current guidance requires the testing of all staff and residents when a new case emerges in a long term residential care facility (including mental health facilities) that has not yet had a case. </p><p>As the deputy will be aware, a significant programme of testing across Long Term Residential Care Facilities commenced on 17 April following a NPHET recommendation. Over 100,000 tests have been complete under the residential care facilities mass testing programme. This includes the testing of all staff and residents in facilities that had an outbreak already, and the testing of staff in those facilities that didn't have an outbreak. This testing programme is now complete, and the results and findings will help inform and guide future testing strategy for these facilities. This is being given ongoing consideration by NPHET. </p><p>It is important to note that testing is only one element of a comprehensive strategic response to COVID-19. Testing for COVID-19 only provides a point-in-time result. It confers no guarantee that the individual with a 'not detected' result is not incubating the infection or the level of virus is below detectable levels at the time of the test. Therefore, testing should not be used for screening purposes and should only be undertaken based on public health risk assessment.</p><p>Targeted, risk-based testing can yield important data to inform control measures, but does not constitute a control measure in and of itself. A comprehensive response to the COVID-19 pandemic must include a strong focus on infection prevention and control and additional measures such as prompt identification and exclusion from work of symptomatic healthcare workers for example.</p></reply>

Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy, a standardised approach to managing scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures, since January 2014, has been developed to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. This policy, which has been adopted by the HSE, sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists.</p>  <p>  In response to the Covid-19 pandemic the HSE had to take measures to defer all non-urgent elective scheduled care activity, including outpatient clinics. This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the World Health Organisation, and the National Action Plan published on 16 March. The trajectory of the disease means there is now an opportunity for increasing the provision of non-covid care including more routine care. It is envisaged that the private hospitals will play an important role in this regard.</p>  <p>  My Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund are currently working together to estimate the impact of Covid 19 on Scheduled Care waiting lists, in order to be prepared to address any backlog or pent up demand. My Department continues to ensure that the resources available throughout our health system are best utilised at this unique and challenging time.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly.</p></reply>

Interviews for this position took place on 27 January 2020 and the post is now at the final stages of recruitment through the Public Appointment Services and will be filled very soon. </p>  <p>  I remain committed to the provision of a second cath lab in University Hospital Waterford.  As set out in the HSE&rsquo;s options appraisal, the preferred option is for a second cath lab and associated 12 bed day ward (delivering six additional beds) on the roof of the existing Cardiology Department, which will operate five days per week and provide diagnostic services only.  </p>  <p>  The HSE has advised that funding was allocated in the 2019 Capital Plan for the provision of second Cath Lab at University Hospital Waterford, planning permission is in place for this project, preparation of contract documentation has commenced and contractor selection is underway.  The HSE anticipates that the project will go to tender before late July and it is expected that construction will commence in October with a 10-12 month programme.  </p>  <p>  The Herity Report also recommended that the current 9 to 5 provision of emergency pPCI services should cease to allow the hospital focus on the much larger volume of planned work. I asked my Department to address the implications of this recommendation by arranging for a National Review of Specialist Cardiac Services. </p>  <p>  The National Review of Specialist Cardiac Services commenced in January 2018 under the Chairmanship of Professor Phillip Nolan and a Steering Group was formed from nominations from interested stakeholders representing medical, professional/technical staff, nursing and patient representatives.  </p>  <p>  The aim of this Review is to achieve optimal patient outcomes at population level with particular emphasis on the safety, quality and sustainability of the services that patients receive by establishing the need for an optimal configuration of a national adult cardiac service.  </p>  <p>  Site visits to the 6 Primary PCI Centre&rsquo;s along with Beaumont Hospital, Sligo University Hospital, Tallaght University Hospital and St Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital have taken place.  International site visits to the Royal Victoria Hospital Belfast and the Golden Jubilee Hospital, Glasgow have also been undertaken. HRB-CICER have also completed their Evidence Synthesis review on their four research questions and submitted their final report to the Steering Group. </p>  <p>  I am anxious for this Review to be completed in the context of the National Development Plan and Sl&aacute;intecare so that decisions can be made with regards to the continued investment and upgrading of Specialist Cardiac Services in Ireland.

The programme runs for one academic year starting in September. The  number of sponsorships advertised each year by the HSE is based on the projected vacancies arising within individual HSE Community Health Organisations ( CHOs). Successful applicants for sponsorship are required to give a written undertaking that, following successful completion of the programme, he/she will immediately register as a PHN with the Nursing &amp;amp; Midwifery Board of Ireland (NMBI) and accept an initial assignment in their sponsoring  CHO.  </p>  <p>  I have been advised by the HSE that the cost to train one PHN  is made up mainly of two elements, salary costs and course fees for the one year programme. The current annual salary cost for a Student PHN ( including employer's PRSI at 11.05%) is &euro;37,466 and course fees are &euro;8,500, giving a total cost per student of just under &euro;46,000. The cost of expanding the PHN sponsorship programme by training an additional 200 PHNs  would therefore amount to &euro;9,200,000.   </p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that the recurring annual cost of employing an additional PHN is approximately &euro;66,000 per whole time equivalent PHN. This figure is based on the 5th point of the salary scale (&euro;52,462), plus  employer's PRSI at 11.05%  and a further 15% for overhead/travel costs.</p></reply>

Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy, a standardised approach to managing scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures, since January 2014, has been developed to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. This policy, which has been adopted by the HSE, sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists.</p>  <p>  In response to the Covid-19 pandemic the HSE had to take measures to defer all non-urgent elective scheduled care activity, including outpatient clinics. This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the World Health Organisation, and the National Action Plan published on 16 March. The trajectory of the disease means there is now an opportunity for increasing the provision of non-covid care including more routine care. It is envisaged that the private hospitals will play an important role in this regard.</p>  <p>  My Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund are currently working together to estimate the impact of Covid 19 on Scheduled Care waiting lists, in order to be prepared to address any backlog or pent up demand. My Department continues to ensure that the resources available throughout our health system are best utilised at this unique and challenging time.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly.</p></reply>

It is hoped that such organisations can resume their income raising activities in the near future, in line with the Government&rsquo;s roadmap for re-opening society and businesses. </p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government has agreed to allocate substantial additional funding to the Health Vote to meet the costs associated with the implementation of the measures outlined in the National Action Plan in response to COVID-19.  The HSE Executive Management Team has agreed a structured approach to addressing the financial challenges of Section 39 Agencies due to COVID-19. The objective of this approach is to provide a structured governance process and modus operandi through which such agencies can engage through the HSE to ensure, where appropriate, continuity of provision of essential services. Furthermore, the HSE has given both Section 38 and Section 39 providers of disability services and supports assurance that budget allocations confirmed to each provider via the relevant CHO, will remain in place to year end, subject to co-operation with the HSE and compliance with the relevant Service Arrangements. </p><p>The Independent Review Group on the role of voluntary organisations in the health and social care sector contained a broad range of recommendations in its report, including a strengthening of the relationship between voluntary organisations and the State.  In this regard, I have established a dialogue forum, as recommended by the Review Group, to consider the report's recommendations. The forum, which is chaired by Peter Cassells, has met on a number of occasions to date. The most recent meetings of the Forum had to be postponed due to Covid-19, but I understand that the Chair has been in touch with Forum members in the past week in relation to continuing the good work that the Forum has started. The challenge of and the response to Covid-19 has brought into focus even more the importance of the relationship between the State and voluntary organisations and the interdependency of that relationship. I believe that there is an opportunity to build on good practices and collaborative working developed as part of the Covid-19 response and I look forward to engaging with the Forum as it continues its work. </p><p>In respect of the issue of pay restoration for Section 39 organisations, the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) agreement reached in October 2018 provided for pay restoration in relation to 50 pilot organisations in the first instance. Pay restoration for these bodies commenced in April 2019 with further payments due in October 2020 and October 2021 as appropriate. The agreement recognised that some of the remaining Section 39 organisations were also likely to have pay restoration issues and a process to address these issues commenced in recent months under the auspices of the WRC. Despite the engagement which took place, it was not possible to reach agreement. However, HSE management remains available and committed to the process and it is hoped that engagement with the WRC can re-commence when the demands of the pandemic allow.  </p></reply>

However, the Guidelines also acknowledge that a compassionate, pragmatic and proportionate approach is required in the care of those who are dying. The presence of a person close to the resident should be facilitated in so far as it is possible, and they should be aware of the potential infection risk. The language used in the Guidelines emphasises the need for compassion towards both the person who is dying and their family members. </p>  <p>  In addition, a guidance document on Infection Prevention and Control Precautions for Possible or Confirmed COVID-19 in a Pandemic Setting was published on the HSPC's website on 8 May 2020. It notes that in the context of a pandemic situation, visiting restrictions will be required.  However, local risk assessment and practical management must be considered, ensuring the response is both pragmatic and proportionate. Again, specific scenarios where a compassionate and practical approach is required include care of the dying. Both guidance documents note the need for hand and respiratory hygiene and for the wearing of PPE when required.</p></reply>

In order to urgently ramp up capacity for acute care facilities, an arrangement was agreed with the private hospitals to use their facilities as part of the public system on a temporary basis, to provide essential services. A Heads of Terms of an Agreement between the HSE and the Private Hospitals was agreed at the end of March 2020 and all 18 of the acute private hospitals signed up to it. Under the arrangement, all patients in the private hospitals are treated as public patients and their treatment is prioritised based on clinical need. Provision was made under the agreement to allow for continuity of care for patients who were in a private hospital or attending for treatment at the time the Heads of Terms of the Agreement were agreed, on the grounds that these patients would be treated as public patients.  </p>  <p>  The agreement was reviewed at the end of May and the Government decided that the existing arrangement should not be extended beyond the end of June. It has however mandated the HSE to negotiate a new arrangement with private hospitals which would provide the HSE with full access to private hospital capacity in the event of a surge of Covid-19 and separately with ongoing agreed access, to enable the HSE to meet essential and elective care needs. </p>  <p>  Guidance on patient pathways to mitigate the risks associated with the delivery of non-covid care, for patients and healthcare workers, and support safe delivery of care has been developed under the auspices of the Expert Advisory Subgroup of NPHET (EAG) and approved in principle by NPHET. It is recommended that in-patient occupancy levels are maintained at ≤ 80% to facilitate the requirement to address surge safely. Utilisation rates show a growing increase in the rate of use of inpatient beds in private hospitals. As of  28th May 2020, 54% of private inpatient beds were in use, up from 43% at the start of May.  </p>  <p>  The HSE is currently working to develop a continuity of services plan to examine how healthcare activity suspended because of Covid-19 can be resumed while maintaining acute occupancy at 80% to provide for surge capacity in the event of a further wave of Covid-19. This work should enable non-urgent elective care to resume within the necessary constraints. The latest information available with regard to the level of activity in the Bons Secours in Limerick is that it is utilising 63% of its in-patient capacity as of 28 May 2020.</p></reply>

The Roadmap specifies that decisions in relation to which actions will be taken and which public health measures might be lifted will be made in accordance with the Framework for Future Decision-Making which is as follows:</p><p>1. Before each Government consideration of the easing of restrictions, the Department of Health will provide a report to the Government regarding the following on/off trigger criteria:</p><p>a. The latest data regarding the progression of the disease,</p><p>b. The capacity and resilience of the health service in terms of hospital and ICU occupancy,</p><p>c. The capacity of the programme of sampling, testing and contact tracing,</p><p>d. The ability to shield and care for at risk groups,</p><p>e. An assessment of the risk of secondary morbidity and mortality as a consequence of the restrictions.</p><p>2. It will also provide risk-based public health advice on what measures could be modified in the next period.</p><p>3. The Government would then consider what restrictions could be lifted, having regard to the advice of the Department of Health as well as other social and economic considerations, e.g. the potential for increased employment, relative benefits for citizens and businesses, improving national morale and wellbeing etc.</p><p>4. It is acknowledged that there is also an ongoing possibility that restrictions could be re-imposed and this process will be carried out on an ongoing basis once every 3 weeks.</p><p>As is clear from the framework, it is the Government rather than I or my Department that will decide on any modifications to the current public health measures in place and those decisions will be informed by the status of the on/off trigger criteria and the public health advice received at the time that a decision is being made. </p><p>Finally, I would note that reflexology and similar complimentary therapies are not regulated professions engaged in the Public Health Service.</p></reply>

This policy, which has been adopted by the HSE, sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists.</p>  <p>  In response to the Covid-19 pandemic the HSE had to take measures to defer all non-urgent elective scheduled care activity, including outpatient clinics. This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the World Health Organisation, and the National Action Plan published on 16 March. The trajectory of the disease means there is now an opportunity for increasing the provision of non-covid care including more routine care. It is envisaged that the private hospitals will play an important role in this regard.</p>  <p>  My Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund are currently working together to estimate the impact of Covid 19 on Scheduled Care waiting lists, in order to be prepared to address any backlog or pent up demand. My Department continues to ensure that the resources available throughout our health system are best utilised at this unique and challenging time.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly.</p></reply>

The site provides a comprehensive range of information and supports related to substance use. </p>  <p>  Recently, the HSE launched Know the Score, the first national evidence-based resource on alcohol and drugs for senior cycle students. It aims to engage young people in exploring and considering a wide range of topics related to the risks associated with alcohol and drugs. </p>  <p>  The HSE monitors trends and considers the need for new material in relation to drugs based on national reports through stakeholder networks and recommendations from other countries. Emerging trend content is published through the Drugs.ie website and affiliated social media channels. </p>  <p>  The Department of Health, as part of the introduction of the Health Diversion Programme, is providing &euro;100,000 in 2020 to develop a national harm reduction campaign to raise awareness of the risks associated with drug use. This will include the use of club drugs, festival drug use and new trends. While this campaign was originally scheduled for the latter part of 2020, this timetable may need to be revised given the draw on resources in dealing with Covid 19.</p>  <p>  Nitrous oxide has been raised by the HSE as an emerging issue at different points this year. The HSE warned young people regarding the danger of using nitrous oxide (sometimes referred to as &lsquo;laughing gas&rsquo;) through a media release in January. New content was added to Drugs.ie outlining the effects and risks associated with nitrous oxide.</p>  <p>  Parents play an important role in educating young people on the risks regarding substance abuse. Evidence based content is available on Drugs.ie regarding nitrous oxide, as well as a HSE booklet providing advice for parents on how to talk to young people about the risks associated with drug and alcohol use. </p>  <p>  We must be especially vigilant in protecting young people from threats to their health and wellbeing from misuse of substances, including nitrous oxide.

Areas targeted by the programme include county Cork.</p>  <p>  Under the National Disability Inclusion Strategy 2017 - 2021, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has responsibility for the continued development of accessibility and availability of accessible public transport.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health and the HSE provide specialist disability services, including Day Services and Rehabilitative Training, to people with disabilities who require such services. Transport is not considered a core Health service and as such Day Service funding does not include transport.</p>  <p>  While there isn&rsquo;t a statutory requirement to provide patient transport services, it is acknowledged that some transport supports are provided by the HSE or funded agencies on a discretionary basis; and that without this support many people with disabilities would not be able to access services.</p>  <p>  Currently, it is only in the most complex cases that HSE Disability Service considers a contribution to the cost of transport to and from day services. Where such a need is identified it is usually negotiated with the service provider on a case by case basis. On occasion where the service provider is not able to support the provision of transport, the HSE Disability Service or the service provider would engage with Rural Link bus services to see if a service can be facilitated.</p>  <p>  The HSE has liaised with the National Transport Authority and disability service providers to explore ways in which the Authority&rsquo;s services could assist people with disabilities. The National Transport Authority has a total of 17 Transport co-ordinating units called Local Link which provide safe secure and reliable Public Transport services in local and rural areas of Ireland through a combination of scheduled Public Transport services and door to door services.</p>  <p>  In this regard and in partnership with the National Transport Authority, the HSE secured Dormant Account monies to fund a project which will map all Disability transport routes nationally, via information gathering by Disability Service providers and HSE Services who provide transport, the &ldquo;HSE Open Routes project&rdquo;. The project will identify options to integrate transport services provided by various service providers, and possibly undertake a series of pilot projects based on these options. The outputs of this in-depth study will be used as a basis for considering how to improve access to disability services and how to best make use of local resources.  A report on the project is due this year. </p>  <p>  I also note that with regard to developments to meet the day service needs of school leavers each year, all new service locations under development are located as close as possible to where people reside so as to reduce the travel time for each person and enable them to be more connected with their own local community.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy's question relates to service matters regarding the development of disability services for adults, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

Two cannabis-based products have been deemed to have met the applicable criteria set out in the legislation and have been added to Schedule 1 of the legislation.</p><p>As these products will be subject to international export licensing requirements, which are outside the control of the Department of Health, they are not expected to be available in Ireland for a further period.</p><p>Once suitable medical cannabis products are made available by suppliers, the MCAP will make it possible for a medical consultant to prescribe a listed cannabis-based treatment for a patient under his or her care for the following medical conditions, where the patient has failed to respond to standard treatments:</p><p>- spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis;</p><p>- intractable nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy;</p><p>- severe, refractory (treatment-resistant) epilepsy.</p><p>The Department of Health will make this information available on their website.</p><p>Pending full operation of the MCAP, doctors may continue to utilise the Ministerial licencing route to prescribe medical cannabis for their patients, should they wish to do so. In line with the Chief Medical Officer's advice, the granting of a licence for cannabis for medical purposes must be premised on an appropriate application being submitted to the Department of Health, which is endorsed by a consultant who is responsible for the management of the patient and who is prepared to monitor the effects of the treatment over time. </p><p>Clinicians may submit an application on behalf of their patients to the HSE for reimbursement approval if the patient has a valid medical prescription for medical cannabis for one of the above medical conditions and have sourced a cannabis-based product which has been prescribed under a Ministerial license. </p><p>The HSE has advised that in the previous situations where it considered reimbursement support appropriate, the following steps were completed:</p><p>- The patient&rsquo;s consultant is satisfied that all therapeutic options have been exhausted and is prepared to accept the responsibility for monitoring the patient&rsquo;s response to the cannabis product.</p><p>- A prescriber applies to the Minister for a Ministerial license and this is granted.</p><p>- The consultant completes an Individual Reimbursement Form, setting out the therapeutic benefit for the patient. It is important that this is completed in sufficient detail for therapeutic benefit to be demonstrated.</p><p>- The Individual Reimbursement Form is considered by the Medicines Management Programme (MMP).</p><p>- On review of the documentation, the MMP makes a recommendation for or against reimbursement support for the patient to the HSE, under the patient's eligibility, and informs the Primary Care Reimbursement Service (PCRS) of that recommendation.</p><p>If approval is given, the PCRS, when authorised to proceed, will make the necessary arrangements to cover the costs involved for the patient.</p></reply>

In order to urgently ramp up capacity for acute care facilities, an arrangement was agreed with the private hospitals to use their facilities as part of the public system on a temporary basis, to provide essential services. A Heads of Terms of an Agreement between the HSE and the Private Hospitals was agreed at the end of March 2020 and all 18 of the acute private hospitals signed up to it. Under the arrangement, all patients in the private hospitals are treated as public patients and their treatment is prioritised based on clinical need. Provision was made under the agreement to allow for continuity of care for patients who were in a private hospital or attending for treatment at the time the Heads of Terms of the Agreement were agreed, on the grounds that these patients would be treated as public patients. </p>  <p>  The agreement was reviewed at the end of May and the Government decided that the existing arrangement should not be extended beyond the end of June. It has however mandated the HSE to negotiate a new arrangement with private hospitals which would provide the HSE with full access to private hospital capacity in the event of a surge of Covid-19 and separately with ongoing agreed access, to enable the HSE to meet essential and elective care needs.</p>  <p>  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic the HSE had to take measures to defer all non-urgent elective scheduled care activity, including outpatient clinics. This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for COVID-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the World Health Organisation, the measures set out in the Action Plan in Response to Covid-19 and the recommendation of NPHET. The NPHET has now recommended that steps be taken to resume non-urgent scheduled care in the context of the safe care guidelines set out by its Expert Advisory Group.</p></reply>

Specialists in occupational health and infection prevention and control are also involved in cases involving healthcare workers and healthcare facilities. To meet the scale of contact tracing capacity required for Covid-19, the HSE established 9 contact tracing centres (CTC&rsquo;s), and trained 1,700 public servants in contact tracing. These centres are there to deal with the high volume but generally more routine cases.  </p>  <p>  The 1,700 pool of trained people can be drawn on as needed. They remain attached to their own organisation, and continue to work for that organisation when they are not contact tracing.</p>  <p>  Excellent co-operation from higher education institutions and civil and public sector bodies facilitated the quick ramping up of Contact Tracing capacity.  The resource model has the flexibility required to address fluctuations in the numbers of identified cases.</p>  <p>  The number of people needed for contact tracing varies and has reduced from an average of 200 tracers per day in mid-April to under 100 tracers per day throughout May.  This is in line with reduced number of positive cases and close contacts since mid-April, during the period of restricted public movements.</p>  <p>  The HSE is satisfied that the capacity which is currently in place is more than sufficient to meet the anticipated demand. While it is important that we have this capacity in place now, it has been stress tested and is ready for potential spikes in number of cases or changes to the case definition. Therefore, the HSE is not seeking resources from outside the public service at this point.</p></reply>

Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy, a standardised approach to managing scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures, since January 2014, has been developed to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. This policy, which has been adopted by the HSE, sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists.</p>  <p>  In response to the Covid-19 pandemic the HSE had to take measures to defer all non-urgent elective scheduled care activity, including outpatient clinics. This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the World Health Organisation, and the National Action Plan published on 16 March. The trajectory of the disease means there is now an opportunity for increasing the provision of non-covid care including more routine care. It is envisaged that the private hospitals will play an important role in this regard.</p>  <p>  My Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund are currently working together to estimate the impact of Covid 19 on Scheduled Care waiting lists, in order to be prepared to address any backlog or pent up demand. My Department continues to ensure that the resources available throughout our health system are best utilised at this unique and challenging time.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly.</p></reply>

This could not continue during the public health emergency because of the need for social distancing and prevention of person-to person spread of this infectious disease.  This temporary pause is for community testing (GPs and clinics) and not for symptomatic patients or patients already referred to or in the process of being managed within the acute system.  </p>  <p>  It is important to emphasise that people who are in-between screening appointments, or waiting for rescheduled appointments, should continue to be aware of and act on any symptoms associated with the conditions being screened for. Any individual who has symptoms should contact their GP immediately who can then refer them for further investigation.</p>  <p>  Since the COVID-19 pandemic started, the NSS has monitored the feasibility of restarting their screening programmes and assessing the associated risks.  The NSS is participating in a national process, led jointly by the Chief Clinical Officer and the Chief Operations Officer in the HSE to restore services safely across all parts of the healthcare system. The HSE are finalising a framework for the resumption of non-covid healthcare services in the current environment, the recommencement of the screening programmes will be incorporated into this framework.</p></reply>

Services are only allowed to operate if they are registered with HIQA and they are inspected regularly to ensure that they maintain a high level of care.  HIQA has significant and wide-ranging powers, up to and including, the cancellation of the registration of a nursing home, where it has significant concerns about the quality of governance and oversight in such services. </p>  <p>  My Department engages with HIQA on a regular and ongoing basis on a range of matters related to the provision of high-quality and safe care for people using our health and social care services in Ireland, including the regulatory framework.  My Department and HIQA share the view that moving the current national regulatory framework towards a &lsquo;service provider&rsquo; model of regulation is an issue which should be examined and progressed over time.  This approach is being actively planned for in the context of the forthcoming statutory homecare scheme.  </p>  <p>  In addition, my Department continues to progress work on the Patient Safety (Licensing) Bill which will, for the first time introduce a licensing requirement for all hospitals, public and private, and certain designated high-risk activities in the community. The drafting of this Bill is on the Government&rsquo;s legislative programme, the general scheme of the Bill having been approved by Government and subject to Pre-Legislative Scrutiny at the Oireachtas Joint Committee of Health. </p>  <p>  Regulation and accountability are not contingent on a commissioning model, since the latter is generally associated with a purchaser/provider split which is a feature of health reforms in some countries, but which is not universal by any means and is subject to ongoing health policy debate. </p>  <p>  On 29 and 30 of March 2020,  key officials from the Department, HIQA, HPSC and HSE met to discuss nursing homes. It was agreed that representatives from the Department, HIQA, HSE and HSPC would collaborate to prepare a paper, encompassing a framework of necessary information, for consideration by the NPHET at its meeting of 31 March on the specific issues and risks relating to COVID-19 infections in residential healthcare facilities. To inform the development of the paper, HIQA provided an information framework document to the team on March 30. A variety of potential risks were identified. These included the risk of small providers, access to infection prevention and control (IPC) advice, access to PPE and timely access to testing. Following consideration of the paper referred to at the above NPHET meeting of 31 March, NPHET requested HIQA to risk assess all nursing homes and liaise with relevant national and regional governance structures as necessary in light of mitigating actions. This was part of an overall package of public health measures recommended following this meeting.  </p>  <p>  The risk assessment, amongst other things, outlined that the private nursing home sector has no clinical governance oversight by or relationship with the Health Service Executive.  It should be noted that registered providers must provide appropriate medical and health care, including a high standard of evidence-based nursing care in accordance with professional guidelines. Furthermore, regulations provide that a nursing home must have a person in charge. In cases where the person in charge is also the registered provider, that person may be a registered medical practitioner with required experience. Where the registered provider is not the person in charge, the person in charge must be a registered nurse with the required qualifications and experience. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the fact that the primary legal responsibility lies with individual providers, as recommended by NPHET on 31 March 2020, the HSE has further strengthened its National and Regional Governance Structures to support the response of nursing homes to COVID-19. The HSE has established 23 COVID-19 response teams at CHO level, which are providing nursing homes with medical, nursing, staffing and other supports.

These have all been revised and amended since their introduction.</p>  <p>  The primary responsibility of managing the risk of infection lies with the residential care facility.   In accordance with the Health Act (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations, 2013, as amended, the registered provider must ensure that procedures, consistent with the standards for the prevention and control of healthcare associated infections published by the Authority are implemented by staff. This responsibility is referred to in the 2016 National Standards for Residential Care Settings for Older People in Ireland and the National Standards for Infection Prevention and Control in Community Services 2018.</p>  <p>  Services are only allowed to operate if they are registered with HIQA and they are inspected regularly to ensure that they maintain a high level of care. HIQA&rsquo;s programme of both scheduled and unannounced inspections helps to ensure that standards are maintained, and where issues of non-compliance arise, that these are addressed and rectified through action plans. </p>  <p>  HIQA has significant and wide-ranging powers, up to and including, the cancellation of the registration of a nursing home if a nursing home is found to be in breach of the Regulations. HIQA also has discretion in deciding whether to impose conditions of registration on nursing homes.</p></reply>

It is in place for three months up to the end of June. The arrangement with the private hospitals was reviewed at the end of May, and the Government decided that the existing arrangement should not be extended beyond the end of June. It has however mandated the HSE to negotiate a new arrangement with private hospitals which would provide the HSE with full access to private hospital capacity in the event of a surge of Covid-19 and separately with ongoing agreed access, to enable the HSE to meet essential and elective care needs.</p><p>Department officials engaged with the insurers at the outset of the private hospitals agreement. In order to assist health insurance customers impacted by the Covid-19 national response, each of the insurers have announced a range of supportive measures for their customers. </p><p>In relation to the use of private hospital capacity, as of May 28 2020,<sup></sup>8,472 patients had been discharged from private hospitals having undergone an inpatient procedure since the arrangement between the HSE and private hospitals came into force. In the same period 30,041 daycase procedures took place in private hospitals, as well as 42,305 diagnostic appointments and 25,095 outpatient appointments. </p><p>Guidance on patient pathways to mitigate the risks associated with the delivery of non-covid care, for patients and healthcare workers, and support safe delivery of care has been developed under the auspices of the Expert Advisory Subgroup of NPHET (EAG) and approved in principle by NPHET. It is recommended that in-patient occupancy levels are maintained at ≤ 80% to facilitate the requirement to address surge safely. Utilisation rates show a growing increase in the rate of use of inpatient beds in private hospitals. Preliminary figures from the HSE indicate that as of  28 May 2020, 54% of private inpatient beds were in use, up from 43% at the start of May. </p><p>In response to the Covid-19 pandemic the HSE had to take measures to defer all non-urgent elective scheduled care activity, including outpatient clinics. This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the World Health Organisation, and the National Action Plan in response to Covid-19. The trajectory of the disease means there is now an opportunity for increasing the provision of non-covid care including more routine care.</p><p>My Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund are currently working together to estimate the impact of Covid 19 on Scheduled Care waiting lists, with a view to informing activity going forward. As the system continues to deliver Covid-19 and non-Covid 19 care side-by-side over a more prolonged period, my Department and the HSE will continue to work closely together to protect essential non-Covid 19 acute care and progress the provision of more routine non Covid-19 care.</p><p>Where possible, hospitals are working to find innovative ways to enable service provision, which include virtual clinics for some out-patient department appointments. The HSE website provides details on services currently available and operational in each hospital on its website. This information is reviewed frequently and provides up-to-date announcements on services available at each site ().</p></reply>

The government must next review and approve the policy at which point the policy can then be published. This policy was developed following a process of research into international innovation and best practice in the field of mental health and an extensive national consultation of over 1,000 service users, family members, friends and carers, and other stakeholders. The revised policy contains an implementation roadmap that organises recommendations into short (0-6 months); medium (6-18 months) and long term (beyond 18 months) actions that will be costed within the various time frames allocated.  </p>  <p>  The revised policy recommends the establishment of a National Monitoring and Implementation Committee (NIMC) to oversee the implementation of the policy over the next ten years. In addition, the policy recommends that a national mental health and wellbeing strategy be developed by Healthy Ireland.  </p>  <p>  The Department of Health would consider that the process which led to the finalisation of the new policy was very comprehensive as regards research and consultation, including detailed engagement with the Oireachtas Committee on the Future of Mental Health and with many other stakeholders, and therefore a high-level taskforce is not warranted at this stage. Our focus now is on setting up a focussed comprehensive implementation process with the HSE, once the new policy is approved by Government. </p>  <p>  However, in view of the recent requests, the Department of Health proposes that such a task force could be established as a sub-committee of the NIMC and work with the members of the Healthy Ireland mental health promotion strategy group to expand provision of existing Covid-19 interventions. </p>  <p>  This approach maximises collaboration and efficiency and ensures a strong implementation focus while minimising duplication of work, given that the proposed taskforce would carry out similar work to developments already afoot. Additionally, as the same personnel who have been involved in the above developments are likely to be involved in future developments going forward, this avoids duplication and creates space for mental health plans to be created without risk of overlap. The development of such a structure would take account of priority needs identified during and following Covid-19.  </p>  <p>  With regards to the provision of mental health services during Covid-19, a planning Group (HSE, Department of Health, NGO sector) has been established to plan for additional current and/or anticipated needs as the crisis extends in duration. There are existing HSE guidelines, published in 2014, on &lsquo;Psychosocial and Mental Health Needs following Major Emergencies&rsquo;.  These guidelines recognise that prior to, during and following national emergencies there would be a need to support certain members of the population with their emotional, cognitive, social and physical needs.   </p>  <p>  The HSE is continuing to provide all community services, in so far as possible, while following Covid-19 guidelines to ensure the protection of patients and staff. At present, there is a range of existing services which offer online text and telephone supports to people seeking mental health information and advice. These include Samaritans, Pieta House, MyMind, Turn2Me; Aware, Crisis Text Ireland, Shine, BeLongTo, LGBT Ireland, Jigsaw, Bodywhys and Childline. The YourMentalHealth.ie website provides a &lsquo;one-stop-shop&rsquo; portal for people seeking information, supports and services, including information on accessing urgent help and a mental health text messaging support service is available 24 hours a day, 7 days each week to connect people with trained volunteers.  NGOs currently funded by the HSE are being supported and encouraged to develop updated responses to the Covid-19 outbreak. Details of these services are listed on the HSE website, www.yourmentalhealth.ie, and information on available services is also provided through the free mental health telephone information line, 1800 111888.  </p>  <p>  In order to respond to the anticipated additional needs of the population during this crisis, additional online services are being delivered to support the population, including online counselling, expanded crisis textline support and online life skills training, building on existing pilot schemes and developments in digital mental health in recent years.</p></reply>

In order to urgently ramp up capacity for acute care facilities, an arrangement was agreed with the private hospitals to use their facilities as part of the public system on a temporary basis, to provide essential services. A Heads of Terms of an Agreement between the HSE and the Private Hospitals was agreed at the end of March 2020 and all 18 of the acute private hospitals signed up to it. Under the arrangement, all patients in the private hospitals are treated as public patients and their treatment is prioritised based on clinical need. Provision was made under the agreement to allow for continuity of care for patients who were in a private hospital or attending for treatment at the time the Heads of Terms of the Agreement were agreed, on the grounds that these patients would be treated as public patients.  </p>  <p>  The agreement was reviewed at the end of May and the Government decided that the existing arrangement should not be extended beyond the end of June. It has however mandated the HSE to negotiate a new arrangement with private hospitals which would provide the HSE with full access to private hospital capacity in the event of a surge of Covid-19 and separately with ongoing agreed access, to enable the HSE to meet essential and elective care needs. </p>  <p>  Guidance on patient pathways to mitigate the risks associated with the delivery of non-covid care, for patients and healthcare workers, and support safe delivery of care has been developed under the auspices of the Expert Advisory Subgroup of NPHET (EAG) and approved in principle by NPHET. It is recommended that in-patient occupancy levels are maintained at ≤ 80% to facilitate the requirement to address surge safely. Utilisation rates show a growing increase in the rate of use of inpatient beds in private hospitals. As of  28th May 2020, 54% of private inpatient beds were in use, up from 43% at the start of May.  </p>  <p>  The HSE is currently working to develop a continuity of services plan to examine how healthcare activity suspended because of Covid-19 can be resumed while maintaining acute occupancy at 80% to provide for surge capacity in the event of a further wave of Covid-19. This work should enable non-urgent elective care to resume within the necessary constraints.</p>  <p>  The key to maintaining reduced acute hospital occupancy is to address the gap between capacity and demand as set out in the Health Service Capacity Review 2018. The HSE has advised that plans to address the findings of the capacity review are currently being revised in response to the emerging and potential long-term impact of Covid-19, and my Department is continuing to engage with the HSE in this regard.</p>  <p>  My Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund are currently working together to estimate the impact of Covid-19 on Scheduled Care waiting lists with a view to informing activity going forward. As the system continues to deliver Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 care side-by-side over a more prolonged period, my Department and the HSE will continue to work closely together to protect essential non-Covid-19 acute care and progress the provision of more routine non-Covid-19 care.</p></reply>

An additional &euro;52 million was provided in 2020 for home support services, bringing the total budget in 2020 to almost &euro;490 million and a target in the National Service Plan 2020 to deliver over 19.2 million hours of home support. It was intended that over 53,700 people would be in receipt of home support services at any one time, including approximately 235 people who would receive intensive home support packages to a level of 360,000 hours. However, the spread of COVID-19 is posing significant challenges for many areas of the health service, including home support services.</p>  <p>  The HSE provides in the region of &euro;12 million in annual funding to a range of organisations who deliver dementia-specific respite, home care, day care, cognitive stimulation therapy, social clubs and supports for family carers around the country.</p>  <p>  In addition,  the HSE provides &euro;400,000 per annum in support for the Dementia Adviser Service which spans 12 counties and is operated by the Alzheimer Society of Ireland. In line with the continued rollout of the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Plan, &euro;10 million has been secured in Budget 2020 to enhance Community Services including allied health professionals, with a full year investment of &euro;60 million for 2021. As well as providing for up to 1,000 therapists, nurses and other professionals in the community, this funding will also facilitate the recruitment of additional dementia advisers, whose information, advice and signposting service is highly valued by people with dementia and their families and carers.</p>  <p>  &euro;6.26 million has been secured through the 2016, 2017 and 2018 Dormant Accounts Action Plans for a range of dementia projects completed or being rolled out by the HSE's National Dementia Office. Funded projects include a national network of memory technology resource rooms, the mapping of dementia-specific community based services, a national rollout of the Dementia Training Programme for HSE homecare staff, a national intellectual disability memory service and a review of the diagnostic process for people with early-onset dementia.</p>  <p>  In summer 2019, a &euro;1 million fund was made available for community and voluntary groups to continue to support older people to stay well and remain connected with their local community.

In order to urgently ramp up capacity for acute care facilities, an arrangement was agreed with the private hospitals to use their facilities as part of the public system on a temporary basis, to provide essential services. A Heads of Terms of an Agreement between the HSE and the Private Hospitals was agreed at the end of March 2020 and all 18 of the acute private hospitals signed up to it. Under the arrangement, all patients in the private hospitals are treated as public patients and their treatment is prioritised based on clinical need. Provision was made under the agreement to allow for continuity of care for patients who were in a private hospital or attending for treatment at the time the Heads of Terms of the Agreement were agreed, on the grounds that these patients would be treated as public patients. </p>  <p>  The agreement was reviewed at the end of May and the Government decided that the existing arrangement should not be extended beyond the end of June. It has however mandated the HSE to negotiate a new arrangement with private hospitals which would provide the HSE with full access to private hospital capacity in the event of a surge of Covid-19 and separately with ongoing agreed access, to enable the HSE to meet essential and elective care needs</p>  <p>  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic the HSE had to take measures to defer all non-urgent elective scheduled care activity, including outpatient clinics. This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for COVID-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the World Health Organisation, the measures set out in the Action Plan in Response to Covid-19 and the recommendation of NPHET. The NPHET has now recommended that steps be taken to resume non-urgent scheduled care in the context of the safe care guidelines set out by its Expert Advisory Group. </p></reply>

This information was sent by the Department on the same day to the HSE for their attention and the HSE has confirmed on-going risk management of these centres.</p>  <p>  On 29th and 30th of March key officials from the Department, HIQA, HPSC and HSE met to discuss nursing homes. It was agreed that representatives from the Department, HIQA, HSE and HSPC would collaborate to prepare a paper, encompassing a framework of necessary information, for consideration by the NPHET at its meeting of 31st March on the specific issues and risks relating to COVID-19 infections in residential healthcare facilities. To inform the development of the paper, HIQA provided an information framework document to the team on March 30th. A variety of potential risks were identified. These included the risk of small providers, access to infection prevention and control (IPC) advice, access to PPE and timely access to testing. Following consideration of the paper referred to at the above NPHET meeting of 31st March, NPHET requested HIQA to risk assess all nursing homes and liaise with relevant national and regional governance structures as necessary in light of mitigating actions. This was part of an overall package of public health measures recommended following this meeting. </p>  <p>  At the NPHET meeting 17th April an action was agreed that &lsquo;HIQA publishes and assesses a COVID-19 Quality Assurance Regulatory Framework&rsquo;. This Framework has been designed to ensure that providers are prepared for, and have contingency plans in place for, an outbreak of COVID-19. As part of the programme HIQA has developed a self-assessment tool for nursing home providers. This self-assessment tool sets out the minimum standard required to effectively respond to an outbreak of COVID-19 in a designated centre. This involves a self-assessment by the registered provider and an onsite assessment by inspectors of social services to verify the provider&rsquo;s compliance against specified regulations. </p>  <p>  If further action is required by the registered provider to ensure compliance with the specified regulations, a compliance plan will be issued to the registered provider by the inspector of social services following the in-site assessment. </p></reply>

Since 2009 the HIQA has been the statutory independent regulator for the nursing home sector.  This responsibility is underpinned by a comprehensive quality framework comprising of Registration Regulations, Care and Welfare Regulations and National Quality Standards. These have all been revised and amended since their introduction.</p>  <p>  Since the onset of this pandemic, HIQA has put in place a quality assessment process whereby all designated centres, including nursing homes are formally contacted on a regular basis by an inspector of social services to assess how they are coping, the welfare of the residents, any concerns they have, and any deficits identified in their ability to sustain a safe, high-quality service. HIQA has completed a risk assessment of all nursing homes. On 6 April, it commenced a focused COVID-19 Infection Prevention and Control Hub to provide nursing home providers with guidance and supports; including an escalation pathway, where required, to the HSE. </p>  <p>  In addition, I would like to note that HIQA has developed a regulatory assessment framework of the preparedness of designated centres for older people for a COVID-19 outbreak. The regulatory assessment framework aims to support those centres that are currently free from COVID-19 to prepare for an outbreak of COVID-19 and put in place the necessary contingency plans. This programme is in line with HIQA&rsquo;s established Authority Monitoring Approach. </p>  <p>  The purpose of this programme is to provide support to nursing home providers to ensure that they are fully prepared and to build confidence in their ability to mitigate and manage COVID-19. The HIQA team will support providers, as necessary, to ensure that they plug into the supports being provided by the HSE.  </p>  <p>  Nursing home providers are ultimately responsible for the safe care of their residents. All nursing homes, public and private have a duty to ensure continued adherence to the existing regulatory and standards framework in the discharge of their duties. </p>  <p>  In addition to the ongoing support of independent regulator the HSE continues to provide unprecedented supports to nursing homes including relevant clinical and infection prevention and control advice, funding, access to PPE and in some cases, where necessary, staffing support. </p>  <p>  I would also like to advise the Deputy that there has been ongoing engagement with Nursing Homes Ireland, the representative body for private nursing homes, at Ministerial and Official level. </p></reply>

The sale of medicines is governed by the Medicinal Products (Prescription and Control of Supply) Regulations 2003, as amended, with specific provisions which apply exclusively to the sale of medicines that consist of, or contain, paracetamol. These regulations provide that paracetamol may only be supplied, without prescription, from pharmacies and non-pharmacy outlets, subject to certain restrictions on presentation and quantities that may be supplied.</p><p>Under European and Irish legislation, before a medicine can be placed on the Irish market, the manufacturer must seek an authorisation from the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA), or in the case of certain medicinal products, the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Restrictions on the sale of medicines are based on their licensed indications and the indicated patient population, as contained in the summary of product characteristics (SmPC). The SmPC is a legal document that forms part of the authorisation for a medicine.</p><p>The HPRA is the competent authority for the regulation of medicines in Ireland and is responsible for determining the method of sale and supply of a medicine. The HPRA may determine the classification of a medicine as suitable for supply without prescription having regard to the maximum single dose of the product concerned, the maximum daily dose; the strength of the product; its pharmaceutical form; its packaging; or any other circumstances relating to its use as the HPRA may consider appropriate, for example, for a particular indication only. </p><p>In determining if a product should be classified as available on general sale in non-pharmacy outlets, the HPRA must have regard to the nature and purpose of the product and must be satisfied that the product concerned can, with reasonable safety, be sold other than under the supervision of a pharmacist. There is generally no prohibition, on age grounds, as regards the retail sale of medicines because the medicines are normally indicated for use in minors as well as adults. </p><p>However, in non-pharmacy outlets the pack sizes available are restricted under the legislation to:</p><p>- 12 or fewer dosage units, each of which contains more than 120mg of paracetamol but not more than 500mg of paracetamol</p><p>- 10 or fewer dosage units, each of which contains more than 500mg of paracetamol but not more than 600mg of paracetamol</p><p>In the case of a medicine intended for use in children under 6 years of age:</p><p>- Packs must contain 12 or fewer dosage units, each of which contains no more than 120mg of paracetamol</p><p>- Pack size of liquid forms should contain 60ml or less with no more than 120mg of paracetamol contained in 5ml</p><p>In addition to these requirements, a non-pharmacy retailer may only supply one pack of a paracetamol medicine per sales transaction.</p><p>In recent years the HPRA has highlighted to retailers the need to adhere to the legal requirements with respect to selling paracetamol and to ensure that all staff are aware of the restrictions that apply. The HPRA has published a Guidance Note on the Sale of Paracetamol-containing Medicinal Products by Non-pharmacy Retailers:  www.hpra.ie/homepage/about-us/publications-forms/guidance-documents/item?id=60380826-9782-6eee-9b55-ff00008c97d0&amp;amp;t=/docs/default-source/publications-forms/guidance-documents/guidance-note-on-the-sale-of-paracetamol-containing-medicinal-products-by-non-pharmacy-retailers  </p><p>and highlighted in particular the need for vigilance around the responsible selling of paracetamol-containing medicines. </p><p>In accordance with the HPRA&rsquo;s guidance retailers are advised to:</p><p>- Ensure all staff are aware that only one pack of a medicine containing paracetamol may be sold to a customer per transaction and that this is emphasised in all training for future new staff.</p><p>- Use signage to remind staff that only one pack of a medicine containing paracetamol can be sold per transaction.</p><p>- Identify all products that contain paracetamol and ensure restrictions are in place so that only one pack of a medicine containing paracetamol can be sold per transaction.</p><p>- Ensure that all staff are vigilant for customers attempting to purchase different brands of medicines containing paracetamol.</p><p>- Have an alert on the cash register to signal to staff that the product scanned contains paracetamol and, therefore, only one pack may be sold per transaction.</p><p>- Implement &lsquo;a block&rsquo; at the cash register and self-service tills that does not allow two packs of medicines containing paracetamol to be scanned/sold in one transaction.</p><p>- Emphasise to staff that it is not acceptable to bypass the requirement by selling more than one pack to a single customer by carrying out a second, separate, transaction.</p><p>Any specific concerns about the sale of paracetamol products can be raised directly with the HPRA via reportacase@hpra.ie.</p></reply>

The Roadmap specifies that decisions in relation to which actions will be taken and which public health measures might be lifted will be made in accordance with the Framework for Future Decision-Making which is as follows:</p><p>1. Before each Government consideration of the easing of restrictions, the Department of Health will provide a report to the Government regarding the following on/off trigger criteria:</p><p>a. The latest data regarding the progression of the disease,</p><p>b. The capacity and resilience of the health service in terms of hospital and ICU occupancy,</p><p>c. The capacity of the programme of sampling, testing and contact tracing,</p><p>d. The ability to shield and care for at risk groups,</p><p>e. An assessment of the risk of secondary morbidity and mortality as a consequence of the restrictions.</p><p>2. It will also provide risk-based public health advice on what measures could be modified in the next period.</p><p>3. The Government would then consider what restrictions could be lifted, having regard to the advice of the Department of Health as well as other social and economic considerations, e.g. the potential for increased employment, relative benefits for citizens and businesses, improving national morale and wellbeing etc.</p><p>4. It is acknowledged that there is also an ongoing possibility that restrictions could be re-imposed and this process will be carried out on an ongoing basis once every 3 weeks.</p><p>As is clear from the framework, it is the Government rather than I or my Department that will decide on any modifications to the current public health measures in place and those decisions will be informed by the status of the on/off trigger criteria and the public health advice received at the time that a decision is being made.</p><p>With regard to social distancing, while the evidence relating to the SARS-CoV-2 virus is evolving, it is clear now that the risks of transmission of any respiratory pathogens such as the type that causes Covid-19 are lessened when greater distance is maintained between people. This evidence is kept under review by the National Public Health Emergency Team on a continuing basis.  </p><p>In general, with the exception of public health advice, the responsibility for providing guidance in relation to a particular sector of our economy or on a specific activity remains with the Government Department with responsibility for that sector or activity. In relation to restaurants and other food related businesses, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland has prepared specific advice which is available on its website at . </p></reply>

However, the Guidelines also acknowledge that a compassionate, pragmatic and proportionate approach is required in the care of those who are dying.

This information was sent by the Department on the same day to the HSE for their attention and the HSE has confirmed on-going risk management of these centres.</p>  <p>  On 29th and 30th of March key officials from the Department, HIQA, HPSC and HSE met to discuss nursing homes. It was agreed that representatives from the Department, HIQA, HSE and HSPC would collaborate to prepare a paper, encompassing a framework of necessary information, for consideration by the NPHET at its meeting of 31st March on the specific issues and risks relating to COVID-19 infections in residential healthcare facilities. To inform the development of the paper, HIQA provided an information framework document to the team on March 30th. A variety of potential risks were identified. These included the risk of small providers, access to infection prevention and control (IPC) advice, access to PPE and timely access to testing. Following consideration of the paper referred to at the above NPHET meeting of 31st March, NPHET requested HIQA to risk assess all nursing homes and liaise with relevant national and regional governance structures as necessary in light of mitigating actions. This was part of an overall package of public health measures recommended following this meeting. </p>  <p>  At the NPHET meeting 17th April an action was agreed that &lsquo;HIQA publishes and assesses a COVID-19 Quality Assurance Regulatory Framework&rsquo;. This Framework has been designed to ensure that providers are prepared for, and have contingency plans in place for, an outbreak of COVID-19. As part of the programme HIQA has developed a self-assessment tool for nursing home providers. This self-assessment tool sets out the minimum standard required to effectively respond to an outbreak of COVID-19 in a designated centre. This involves a self-assessment by the registered provider and an onsite assessment by inspectors of social services to verify the provider&rsquo;s compliance against specified regulations. </p>  <p>  If further action is required by the registered provider to ensure compliance with the specified regulations, a compliance plan will be issued to the registered provider by the inspector of social services following the in-site assessment. </p></reply>

Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy, a standardised approach to managing scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures, since January 2014, has been developed to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. This policy, which has been adopted by the HSE, sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists.</p>  <p>  In response to the Covid-19 pandemic the HSE had to take measures to defer all non-urgent elective scheduled care activity, including outpatient clinics. This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the World Health Organisation, and the National Action Plan published on 16 March. The trajectory of the disease means there is now an opportunity for increasing the provision of non-covid care including more routine care. </p>  <p>  My Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund are currently working together to estimate the impact of Covid 19 on Scheduled Care waiting lists, in order to be prepared to address any backlog or pent up demand. My Department continues to ensure that the resources available throughout our health system are best utilised at this unique and challenging time.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly.</p></reply>

In order to urgently ramp up capacity for acute care facilities, an arrangement was agreed with the private hospitals to use their facilities as part of the public system on a temporary basis, to provide essential services. A Heads of Terms of an Agreement between the HSE and the Private Hospitals was agreed at the end of March 2020 and all 18 of the acute private hospitals signed up to it. Under the arrangement, all patients in the private hospitals are treated as public patients and their treatment is prioritised based on clinical need. Provision was made under the agreement to allow for continuity of care for patients who were in a private hospital or attending for treatment at the time the Heads of Terms of the Agreement were agreed, on the grounds that these patients would be treated as public patients. </p>  <p>  The agreement was reviewed at the end of May and the Government decided that the existing arrangement should not be extended beyond the end of June. It has however mandated the HSE to negotiate a new arrangement with private hospitals which would provide the HSE with full access to private hospital capacity in the event of a surge of Covid-19 and separately with ongoing agreed access, to enable the HSE to meet essential and elective care needs</p>  <p>  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic the HSE had to take measures to defer all non-urgent elective scheduled care activity, including outpatient clinics. This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for COVID-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the World Health Organisation, the measures set out in the Action Plan in Response to Covid-19 and the recommendation of NPHET. The NPHET has now recommended that steps be taken to resume non-urgent scheduled care in the context of the safe care guidelines set out by its Expert Advisory Group. </p></reply>

In keeping with this contract, they are required to provide practice premises and facilities that are fit for purpose, suitable for the delivery of the services and sufficient to meet the needs of patients. The GP also undertakes to work towards meeting and maintaining generally accepted standards in relation to practice premises.   Part of the project brief of every PCC is the provision of suitable accommodation for GPs, which the HSE offers at attractive terms.  </p>  <p>  The Government acknowledges the important role of GPs in the delivery of our health service and is working to ensure patients across the country continue to have access to GP services and that general practice is sustainable in all areas into the future. The Agreement reached in 2019 on GP contractual reforms and service developments will see an increase in expenditure on GP services of &euro;210 million annually by 2023, providing significant increases in capitation fees for participating GPs as well as additional supports for rural practices and practices in urban areas of deprivation.   New supports have also been introduced to assist GPs during the Covid-19 public health emergency. </p></reply>

In order to urgently ramp up capacity for acute care facilities, an arrangement was agreed with the private hospitals to use their facilities as part of the public system on a temporary basis, to provide essential services. A Heads of Terms of an Agreement between the HSE and the Private Hospitals was agreed at the end of March 2020 and all 18 of the acute private hospitals signed up to it. Under the arrangement, all patients in the private hospitals are treated as public patients and their treatment is prioritised based on clinical need. Provision was made under the agreement to allow for continuity of care for patients who were in a private hospital or attending for treatment at the time the Heads of Terms of the Agreement were agreed, on the grounds that these patients would be treated as public patients.  </p><p>The agreement was reviewed at the end of May and the Government decided that the existing arrangement should not be extended beyond the end of June. It has however mandated the HSE to negotiate a new arrangement with private hospitals which would provide the HSE with full access to private hospital capacity in the event of a surge of Covid-19 and separately with ongoing agreed access, to enable the HSE to meet essential and elective care needs. </p><p>Under the agreement payment to the private hospitals is on a cost only Open Book model whereby the hospitals are to be reimbursed only for the operating costs properly incurred during the period. The costs that will be covered will be limited to normal costs of operating the hospital. While the private hospitals are paid a monthly sum equal to 80% of estimated monthly costs, the hospitals will only receive their actual operating costs when these have been verified. The final cost will be verified by independent firms of accountants appointed by the HSE and the private hospitals and there will be an arbitration mechanism in place in the event of any disagreement. As the funding of the agreement is based on cost  recovery, validated costs will not be available until the agreement  is completed, however it is estimated that the cost of the agreement will be of  the order of &euro;300m.</p><p>As the hospitals are private enterprises, the detailed information regarding payments to individual hospitals or hospital groups is commercially sensitive and therefore in line with the Heads of Terms regarding confidentiality these details will not be published. In the interests of transparency, it is intended to publish summary financial information regarding the arrangement in due course. </p><p>The HSE has been working with National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to establish a mechanism to allow for return of electronic data from Private Hospitals. This system went live on the week ending 18th May with guidance issued to private hospitals around the process for submission of data. In order to ensure early reporting of activity the HSE has put a manual data reporting system in place with private hospitals. This supports the return of a limited dataset which remains subject to validation based on electronic data returns through the NTPF.  </p><p>While the current dataset does not provide for the full range of information the Deputy has requested, details regarding bed occupancy and the volume of procedures undertaken by private hospital&rsquo;s are set out in the attached document.  </p><p>In order that the Deputy be provided with the most up to date financial position, I have referred your question to the HSE and asked them to respond to you directly.</p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th>Hospital</th>       <th></th>       <th>Inpatient Beds</th>       <th>Daybed Capacity </th>       <th>Critical Care Capacity</th>       <th>In-patient occupancy</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Aut Even</td>       <td>Kilkenny</td>       <td>71</td>       <td>18</td>       <td></td>       <td>21%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Beacon Hospital</td>       <td>Dublin</td>       <td>166</td>       <td>38</td>       <td>15</td>       <td>38%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Blackrock Clinic</td>       <td>Dublin</td>       <td>152</td>       <td>34</td>       <td>12</td>       <td>42%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Bons Secours Cork</td>       <td>Cork</td>       <td>183</td>       <td>52</td>       <td>10</td>       <td>67%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Bons Secours Dublin</td>       <td>Dublin</td>       <td>107</td>       <td>66</td>       <td></td>       <td>35%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Bons Secours Galway</td>       <td>Galway</td>       <td>73</td>       <td>36</td>       <td>8</td>       <td>42%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Bons Secours Limerick</td>       <td>Limerick</td>       <td>10</td>       <td>27</td>       <td></td>       <td>15%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Bons Secours Tralee</td>       <td>Tralee</td>       <td>87</td>       <td>39</td>       <td></td>       <td>83%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway Clinic</td>       <td>Galway</td>       <td>134</td>       <td>54</td>       <td></td>       <td>19%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Hermitage Clinic</td>       <td>Dublin</td>       <td>88</td>       <td>61</td>       <td>8</td>       <td>57%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kingsbridge Sligo</td>       <td>Sligo</td>       <td>10</td>       <td>9</td>       <td></td>       <td>0%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mater Private Cork</td>       <td>Cork</td>       <td>60</td>       <td>15</td>       <td></td>       <td>46%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mater Private Dublin</td>       <td>Dublin</td>       <td>196</td>       <td>27</td>       <td>9</td>       <td>49%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Sports Surgery Clinic Santry</td>       <td>Dublin</td>       <td>63</td>       <td>21</td>       <td></td>       <td>8%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>St Francis</td>       <td>Dublin</td>       <td>48</td>       <td>17</td>       <td></td>       <td>0%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>St. Vincent&rsquo;s Private</td>       <td>Dublin</td>       <td>180</td>       <td>7</td>       <td>6</td>       <td>82%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>UPMC Kildare</td>       <td>Kildare</td>       <td>25</td>       <td>10</td>       <td></td>       <td>69%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>UPMC Whitfield</td>       <td>Kilkenny</td>       <td>60</td>       <td>57</td>       <td></td>       <td>47%</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy, a standardised approach to managing scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures, since January 2014, has been developed to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. This policy, which has been adopted by the HSE, sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists. </p>  <p>  Access to Home Support is based on assessment of the person&rsquo;s needs by the HSE and having regard to the available resources and the competing demands for the services from those people with assessed needs.

The OPAP covers a 10-year period up to 2025 and aims to reverse obesity trends, prevent health complications and reduce the overall burden for individuals, families, the health system, and the wider society and economy.  The OPAP is based on the best available evidence in the Irish and international literature, and is informed by established international models and frameworks.  </p><p>In relation to measures dealing with the level of consumption of products high in fat, sugar and salt (HFSS), the Sugar Sweetened Drinks Tax has already been introduced and commenced on 1<sup>st</sup>May 2018.  The current focus in this area is on putting in place a reformulation programme for HFSS food and drink, under Action 3.1 of the OPAP, &ldquo;<i>Agree food industry reformulation targets and review progress</i>&rdquo;.  To this end the Reformulation sub-group of the Obesity Policy Implementation Oversight Group (OPIOG) has been working on a roadmap for reformulation, including targets for reductions in salt, sugar, saturated fats and calories, and a proposed approach to achieve these targets.  A draft roadmap has been considered by the OPIOG and a consultation with stakeholders subsequently took place.  The submissions received as a result of that consultation process are being examined and it is expected that a report with the targets and final version of the roadmap will be submitted in the coming months.</p><p>Additionally, Ireland is participating in a Joint Action under the 3rd EU Health Programme called Best ReMaP (which stands for Best practice in Reformulation, Marketing and Public Procurement).  The Joint Action is awaiting final approval form the EU Commission, but it is hoped that work will commence in the autumn.  One of the work packages under this Joint Action is on reformulation, and this will be beneficial in assisting Ireland to achieve progress in its actions under the reformulation roadmap.</p></reply>

On 5 May, NPHET agreed that its recommendation of 27 March, in regard to the pausing of all non-essential health services should be replaced, in relation to acute care, with a recommendation that delivery of acute care be determined by appropriate clinical and operational decision making. Application of the essential risk mitigating steps set out in the guidance developed under the auspices of the NPHET Expert Advisory group will have operational implications, which will impact on throughput. The HSE is currently engaging with hospital groups to assess the impact of these guidelines on activity. The completion of this work should enable non-urgent elective care to resume within the necessary constraints. </p><p>My Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund are currently working together to estimate the impact of Covid 19 on Scheduled Care waiting lists, with a view to informing activity going forward. As the system continues to deliver Covid-19 and non-Covid 19 care side-by-side over a more prolonged period, my Department and the HSE will continue to work closely together to protect essential non-Covid 19 acute care and progress the provision of more routine non Covid-19 care.</p><p>Where possible, hospitals are working to find innovative ways to enable service provision, which include virtual clinics for some out-patient department appointments.

This information is reviewed frequently and provides up-to-date announcements on services available at each site:</p><p><i></i></p></reply>

The government must next review and approve the policy at which point the policy can then be published. This policy was developed following a process of research into international innovation and best practice in the field of mental health and an extensive national consultation of over 1,000 service users, family members, friends and carers, and other stakeholders. The revised policy contains an implementation roadmap that organises recommendations into short (0-6 months); medium (6-18 months) and long term (beyond 18 months) actions that will be costed within the various time frames allocated.  </p>  <p>  The revised policy recommends the establishment of a National Monitoring and Implementation Committee (NIMC) to oversee the implementation of the policy over the next ten years. In addition, the policy recommends that a national mental health and wellbeing strategy be developed by Healthy Ireland. </p>  <p>  The Department of Health would consider that the process which led to the finalisation of the new policy was very comprehensive as regards research and consultation, including detailed engagement with the Oireachtas Committee on the Future of Mental Health and with many other stakeholders, and therefore a high-level taskforce is not warranted at this stage. Our focus now is on setting up a focussed comprehensive implementation process with the HSE, once the new policy is approved by Government. </p>  <p>  However, in view of the recent requests, the Department of Health proposes that such a task force could be established as a sub-committee of the NIMC and work with the members of the Healthy Ireland mental health promotion strategy group to expand provision of existing Covid-19 interventions.</p>  <p>  This approach maximises collaboration and efficiency and ensures a strong implementation focus while minimising duplication of work, given that the proposed taskforce would carry out similar work to developments already afoot. Additionally, as the same personnel who have been involved in the above developments are likely to be involved in future developments going forward, this avoids duplication and creates space for mental health plans to be created without risk of overlap. The development of such a structure would take account of priority needs identified during and following Covid-19. </p>  <p>  With regards to the provision of mental health services during Covid-19, a planning Group (HSE, Department of Health, NGO sector) has been established to plan for additional current and/or anticipated needs as the crisis extends in duration. There are existing HSE guidelines, published in 2014, on &lsquo;Psychosocial and Mental Health Needs following Major Emergencies&rsquo;.   These guidelines recognise that prior to, during and following national emergencies there would be a need to support certain members of the population with their emotional, cognitive, social and physical needs.  </p>  <p>  The HSE is continuing to provide all community services, in so far as possible, while following Covid-19 guidelines to ensure the protection of patients and staff. At present, there is a range of existing services which offer online text and telephone supports to people seeking mental health information and advice. These include Samaritans, Pieta House, MyMind, Turn2Me; Aware, Crisis Text Ireland, Shine, BeLongTo, LGBT Ireland, Jigsaw, Bodywhys and Childline. The YourMentalHealth.ie website provides a &lsquo;one-stop-shop&rsquo; portal for people seeking information, supports and services, including information on accessing urgent help and a mental health text messaging support service is available 24 hours a day, 7 days each week to connect people with trained volunteers.  NGOs currently funded by the HSE are being supported and encouraged to develop updated responses to the Covid-19 outbreak. Details of these services are listed on the HSE website, www.yourmentalhealth.ie, and information on available services is also provided through the free mental health telephone information line, 1800 111888. </p>  <p>  In order to respond to the anticipated additional needs of the population during this crisis, additional online services are being delivered to support the population, including online counselling, expanded crisis textline support and online life skills training, building on existing pilot schemes and developments in digital mental health in recent years.</p></reply>

Since that time, it has met 33 times. In addition to the Expert Advisory Group, a number of sub-groups have also been established to support the work of the NPHET, including on: </p><p>- Acute Hospitals</p><p>- Behavioural Change </p><p>- Guidance and Evidence Synthesis</p><p>- Irish Epidemiological Modelling Advisory Group (IEMAG)  </p><p>- Health Legislation Subgroup </p><p>- Medicines and Medical Devices Criticality Subgroups </p><p>- Pandemic Ethics Advisory Group </p><p>- Vulnerable People Subgroup </p><p>- Health Sector Workforce Subgroup </p><p>Throughout the progression of the Covid-19 pandemic, there have been enormous efforts made to ensure that the activities and recommendations of NPHET were being appropriately communicated.

There is extensive guidance in place for healthcare workers and this can be found on the HPSC website:</p><p><i></i><i>.</i></p><p>There is also clear guidance in place for the assessment, testing and return to work of healthcare workers.</p><p>In addition, current guidance requires the testing of all staff and residents when a new case emerges in a long term residential care facility (including mental health facilities) that have not yet had a case. </p><p>As the deputy will be aware, a significant programme of testing across Long Term Residential Care Facilities commenced on 17 April following a NPHET recommendation. Over 100,000 tests have been completed under the residential care facilities mass testing programme. This includes the testing of all staff and residents in facilities that had an outbreak already, and the testing of staff in those facilities that didn't have an outbreak. This testing programme is now complete, and the results and findings will help inform and guide future testing strategy for these facilities. This is being given ongoing consideration by NPHET. </p><p>It is important to note that testing is only one element of a comprehensive strategic response to COVID-19. Testing for COVID-19 only provides a point-in-time result. It confers no guarantee that the individual with a 'not detected' result is not incubating the infection or the level of virus is below detectable levels at the time of the test. </p><p>Targeted, risk-based testing can yield important data to inform control measures, but does not constitute a control measure in and of itself. Testing should only be undertaken based on a public health risk assessment. A comprehensive response to the COVID-19 pandemic must include a strong focus on infection prevention and control and additional measures such as prompt identification and exclusion from work of symptomatic healthcare workers for example.</p></reply>

Decisions on the criteria for testing are made by NPHET and are informed by international guidance including from the WHO and ECDC. </p><p>The criteria for testing is as follows: A patient with acute respiratory infection (sudden onset of at least one of the following: cough, fever, shortness of breath) AND with no other aetiology that fully explains the clinical presentation&rdquo;. </p><p>On 28 May, NPHET agreed in principle to include in the case definition the sudden loss of smell (anosmia) and loss of taste (ageusia). This decision was subject to updated guidance from the ECDC and the ECDC published its updated case definition on 29 May. This can be found here:</p><p>In addition, all close contacts are now being tested twice (regardless of whether they have any symptoms) and contacted on a daily basis to monitor symptom development. </p><p>The criteria for testing in Long Term Care Facilities is broader than that above in recognition that the elderly may not display typical Covid-19 symptoms. Up to date criteria for testing can be found on the HPSC website. </p><p>Testing criteria is kept under review by NPHET as NPHET considers how best to target testing capacity. Our testing strategy will continue to evolve and will be based on public health risk assessments.</p><p>Turnaround times are improving rapidly thanks to process improvements and automation. Across community and hospital settings, overall end-to-end median turnaround times (meaning referral to contact tracing complete) last week for positive results was 2.3 days. The end-to-end turnaround time for negative test results is 2 days or less.</p><p>With regard to the number of contacts each positive case had, over the last 4 weeks (to 23 May) the median number of close contacts per case is 2. Typically contact tracing is completed on a same day or next day basis.</p><p>I am confident that the HSE is putting in place the measures to further reduce turnaround times and we are seeing continuing improvement. The HSE continues to streamline the process and to automate where possible. A range of process optimisation measures are being put in place, including automated swab appointments; offering the option to receive positive test results by text and enabling out of hours referrals. These are in addition to measures already in place including IT improvement, automation processes, and streamlined transportation logistics.</p></reply>

In respect of COVID-19, where the incubation period is currently understood to be a maximum of 14 days, that would imply a period of 28 days before the conclusion of an investigation.

In order to urgently ramp up capacity for acute care facilities, an arrangement was agreed with the private hospitals to use their facilities as part of the public system on a temporary basis, to provide essential services. A Heads of Terms of an Agreement between the HSE and the Private Hospitals was agreed at the end of March 2020 and all 18 of the acute private hospitals signed up to it. Under the agreement,  the HSE has access to 100% of the capacity of those hospitals and they are linked with the Hospital Group for their region.  Consultants who work wholly for the private hospitals have been offered temporary locum public patient only (Type A) contracts for the duration of the arrangement. Under the agreement all patients who are being treated in the hospitals will be treated as public patients and will prioritised based on clinical needs. Provision was made under the agreement to allow for continuity of care for patients who were in a private hospital or attending for treatment at the time the Heads of Terms of the Agreement were agreement, on the grounds that these patients would be treated as public patients. </p>  <p>  The arrangement with the private hospitals was reviewed at the end of May and the Government decided that the existing arrangement should not be extended beyond the end of June. It has however mandated the HSE to negotiate a new arrangement with private hospitals which would provide the HSE with full access to private hospital capacity in the event of a surge of Covid-19 and separately with ongoing agreed access, to enable the HSE to meet essential and elective care needs. </p></reply>

On this basis, it is recommended that the cocooning measures for the over 70s and for those in at risk groups be continued&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  Any future changes to the current public health measures and recommendations in place will be informed by the status of the on/off trigger criteria set out in the Roadmap and the public health advice received at the time that a decision is being made.  </p>  <p>  On 9 May the &ldquo;Return to Work Safely Protocol - COVID-19 Specific National Protocol for Employers and Workers&rdquo; was published. It provides clear guidance to employers and to workers on the measures that must be taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the workplace. The Protocol was developed through the cooperation of the Health and Safety Authority, the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, the HSE and my Department. It is designed to be used by all workplaces to adapt their procedures and practices to provide protection against the threat of COVID-19. </p>  <p>  In relation to vulnerable or at risk workers the Protocol advises that if an at-risk or vulnerable worker cannot work from home and must be in the workplace, employers must make sure that they are preferentially supported to maintain a physical distance of 2 metres. However, employers should enable vulnerable workers to work from home where possible.</p>  <p>  The Protocol is not static. There will be ongoing engagement at a national level between stakeholders on its implementation and it is subject to change in line with the latest public health advice or other developments in order to maximise the protection it will afford in our workplaces.</p></reply>

A key consideration in taking this approach was to prevent infection risk to patients in an evolving situation. Consideration is currently being given to how to increase delivery of services beyond time-critical essential services in line with the recommendation that delivery of acute care be determined by appropriate clinical and operational decision making.  This will include implementation of processes to mitigate risks associated with Covid-19 for both patients and healthcare workers. </p>  <p>  Individuals with hereditary haemochromatosis can continue to donate blood at all Irish Blood Transfusion Service fixed and mobile blood donor clinics free of charge.  The IBTS has advised that first time donors have been restricted from attending clinics because of Covid-19.

Along with animal welfare considerations, social and economic aspects in relation to the industry need to be taken into account. The Bill will make it illegal for any new fur farms to be established and will put in place phase out arrangements for the small number of current operators. This will allow for an orderly wind down of the sector and allow time for employees to find alternative opportunities. </p>  <p>  The necessary work to prepare the appropriate legislation is ongoing within the Department. </p></reply>

This Regulation is binding in full and has direct effect on all Member States. There is limited national discretion available to Member States in relation to a number of the Regulation's provisions. It is not, however, open to any Member State to seek a derogation on the implementation date of this Regulation.</p>  <p>  In 2004, European legislation established a requirement that all veterinary medicinal products that are intended for use in food-producing animals should be subject to a veterinary prescription.  However, a 2006 EU Directive allowed for the maintenance of non-prescription status for certain veterinary medicinal products which did not present a risk to human or animal health or to the environment, and which met the specified criteria for exemption from veterinary prescription. Ireland availed of the exemption in Directive 2006/130/EC at the time and antiparasitics were allowed to continue to be available without prescription.</p>  <p>  There is a similar exemption available under the new EU Regulation 2019/6. However, since that time, worldwide knowledge regarding the impact of extensive use of antiparasitics has changed.  For example, antiparasitic resistance has been widely reported in parasites of livestock species in Ireland and globally, resistance is developing year-on-year and is now a significant animal health issue.</p>  <p>  In 2019, the Health Product Regulatory Authority&rsquo;s (HPRA) Advisory Committee for Veterinary Medicines (ACVM) established a Task Force to review the method of supply of antiparasitic veterinary medicinal products that are intended for food-producing animals against the criteria set out in Regulation 2019/6.  A copy of the Report is available on the HPRA&rsquo;s website www.hpra.ie.</p>  <p>  The Report states that the available scientific evidence shows that antiparasitic veterinary medicines that are intended for use in food-producing species do not comply with the criteria for derogation from veterinary prescription specified in EU Regulation 2019/6. It also states that a consequence of this determination is that any such products that are supplied without veterinary prescription will need to be upregulated to supply under veterinary prescription. This brings Ireland in line with other Member States. </p>  <p>  In accordance with existing national legislation, antiparasitic veterinary medicinal products for use in food-producing species that are supplied under prescription may be dispensed by veterinary practitioners, pharmacists and licensed merchants. This means that all current stakeholders that are already permitted to supply such products will be entitled to continue to stock them in the future but, from January 2022 onwards, a veterinary prescription will be required to dispense them.</p>  <p>  My Department is committed to working with all stakeholders in considering how best to implement the new EU Regulations on veterinary medicinal products and plan to have a public consultation in Q2 2020. A dedicated email address has been set up for this purpose and I would encourage all interested parties to send their  observations to vetmedregs@agriculture.gov.ie.</p></reply>

For 2020, the EU Council agreed  a very small TAC and quotas for the North West Herring stocks and and for the Celtic Sea Herring stock to allow for the continued collection of scientific data which is set at a level that will not impair the recovery of these Herring stocks.</p><p>The number of new young fish entering the fishery each year, has been very low since 2013 and, as a rsult, the Spawning Stock Biomass (SSB) of Northwest Herring &ndash; the total weight of the stock old enough to reproduce &ndash; has been declining.  In 2016, a monitoring Total Allowable Catch (TAC) was established for this stock.  This has been in place since to allow the collection of samples and to continue the scientific time series. Management arrangements for the North West Herring stocks under these exceptional circumstances are recommended and supported by Industry representatives, including the National Inshore Fisheries Forum which represents small boats. For 2019 and earlier years, the 2012 Herring policy was set aside.  Recommendations from industry representatitives, which includes the NIFF, for the 2020 fishery is expected later in the year.</p><p>In the case of the Celtic Sea Herring stock, the SSB of this stock has been decreasing significantly since 2011.  Last year, ICES advised zero catches in 2020.  However, ICES suggested that a monitoring TAC for a sentinel fishery only should be conducted to allow for the collection of scientific data. In previous years, in accordance with Herring policy, the Celtic Sea Herring Sentinel fishery operated as an open fishery for vessels under 17m length overall confined to the Dunmore Box with 11% of quota set aside. The Management arrangements, under the Ministerial policy, for the Celtic Sea Herring fishery are recommended by the Celtic Sea Herring Management Advisory Committee, who includes representatives from the NIFF.  The Department is awaiting a recommendation for 2020.</p></reply>

The target in the Forestry Programme 2014 -2020 is therefore to plant 30% broadleaf species each year and, in 2019, the figure achieved was 25%, with 36% planted to end April this year.  All new afforestation supported under the Forestry Programme, including sitka spruce plantations, must include 15% broadleaves. These broadleaves can also be planted along the forest edge to soften the visual effect of the main forest crop and also to provide an additional habitat. New plantations are also encouraged to include an Area of Biodiversity Enhancement which comprises of open spaces, retained habitat and widely spaced native trees.  Their function is to conserve and encourage the development of diverse habitats, native flora and fauna, and biodiversity, to protect archaeological monuments and to facilitate an enhanced forest design.</p>  <p>  The importance of conserving Ireland's native woodlands and of encouraging the planting of new native woodlands on 'green field sites' is a critical part of our approach to supporting forestry in Ireland.  Under the Native Woodland Conservation Scheme, the appropriate restoration of existing native woodlands is funded, as is the  appropriate conversion of existing non-native forests to native woodlands.  Native woodland establishment attracts the highest grant and premium in the afforestation scheme, with &euro;680 per hectare payable to the native woodland landowner for 15 years. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, in order to make more attractive the native woodland scheme, the Department established a new Woodland Environmental Fund (WEF).  Under this Fund, businesses are encouraged to part fund the establishment of native woodlands by means of a once-off additional  payment of &euro;1,000 per hectare.. There has been a positive reaction from the business community to this scheme, with An Post, Microsoft, Aldi and Accenture already signed up and other businesses submitting formal expressions of interest in participating in the scheme.</p></reply>

Such planting can make an important contribution to carbon sequestration. The private sector may also have a role to play.  An example of a positive development to date in this area is my Department&rsquo;s &lsquo;Woodland Environmental Fund&rsquo; where businesses can part fund the establishment of native woodlands on farms. The additional funding provided amounts to &euro;1,000/ha and is paid directly to farmers. In return, businesses can declare the carbon captured by these trees against their carbon footprint. So far, Accenture, Microsoft, Aldi, Lidl, KBI Global Investments and An Post have participated in the scheme.  </p>  <p>  These and other possibilities will be considered in the context of developing a Strategic CAP Plan for Ireland for the period 2021 -2027, and having regard to our national and international climate change obligations.</p></reply>

In common with all economic forecasting at this time, because of the uncertainty around the extent and length of the shutdown, it is not possible to use conventional modelling, so a range of price decrease scenarios are explored. The Teagasc report examines the effect of price decrease scenarios on family farm incomes but is not forecasting price decreases or their extent.</p>  <p>  The report's analysis of a range of scenarios (price decreases of 10, 15 &amp;amp; 20%) finds that income across the sector as a whole could, in the scenarios examined, drop relative to the income forecast for 2020 (in the absence of the COVID-19); impacts on sector incomes could range from a drop of 22% (&euro;0.7 billion) to as much as 50% (&euro;1.6 billion). </p>  <p>  As an essential service, the agri-food processing, manufactruring and retail sector has remained open and functioning over the period. However, the Irish agri-food sector exports some 90% of production. The food service industry across Europe is experiencing a near-total collapse in demand due to the temporary shutdown of the hospitality sector. While food retail demand has increased, it is not offsetting the decline in food services. This demand imbalance has significant consequences for primary producers and agri-food businesses. Prices to date have dropped; beef by about 8% and dairy by 6%. The recovery of food services and export markets globally are vital for the Irish agri-food sector. We will continue to monitor the actual outcome.</p>  <p>  The agri-food sector is an essential part of the economic and social fabric of Ireland, especially in rural and coastal areas. I am working with all the agri-food stakeholders and ensuring that the sector, as our largest indigenous industry, is considered as part of the ongoing whole-of-Government response. </p>  <p>  The response to the economic impacts on the sector should include a strong, shared EU response, using the instruments available in the Common Agricultural Policy. I have already highlighted to Commissioner Wojciechowski the serious consequences for farmers and the food industry and the need to ensure that the full range of market supports available under the Common Market Organisation Regulation are made available. Following Ireland&rsquo;s efforts in leading an agreed EU-27 statement on the need for further supports, the Commission have introduced Aids to Private Storage for Dairy (SMP, Butter, Cheese), Beef and Sheepmeat.   </p>  <p>  I am also working with my colleagues in Government to ensure that all businesses, including those in the agri-food sector, get access to suitable supports, and the measures in place are being kept under review. </p>  <p>  Working with my colleague Minister Humphreys, I have ensured that up to &euro;180 million in new lending capacity is available for the agri-food sector:  40% of the &euro;250 million COVID-19 Working Capital Scheme will be available for food businesses. Similarly, 40% of an additional &euro;200 million tranche of the Future Growth Loan Scheme will be ring fenced to provide long-term investment support for farmers, fishers and food businesses.  I continue to liaise with the banks on liquidity for the primary sector, and also want to highlight the availability of working capital assistance to farmers and fishers through Microfinance Ireland&rsquo;s COVID-19 Business Loan. We will continue to keep the finance needs of the whole agri-food sector under review.</p>  <p>  I have already provided &euro;85m in supports for the beef sector in Budget 2020.  This includes a &euro;45 million provision for the Beef Data and Genomics Programme and &euro;35m for a Beef Environmental Efficiency Programme (Sucklers), which will deliver a maximum payment of &euro;90 per suckler cow for the first 10 cows, and &euro;80/head thereafter. </p>  <p>  Conscious of the cash flow pressures on farms at present, I have brought forward &euro;26m in GLAS payments by a month.  Balancing payments under the Organic Farming scheme have also been brought forward. I have also increased funding in my Department&rsquo;s Calf Welfare Investment Scheme from &euro;1.5 million to &euro;4 million, to assist farmers with extra calves.  A range of practical flexibilities have been introduced in departmental schemes, including, for example, the extension of completion deadlines for TAMS by 3 months, and the submission for Nitrates records to the end of June. </p>  <p>  My Department and agencies will continue to monitor the impacts on the agri-food sector as the situation evolves, and to provide appropriate supports to the sector.  My Department remains in constant contact with stakeholders right across the sector to share information on emerging issues and contingency planning, and we will continue to develop appropriate supports as the situation evolves.</p></reply>

For this reason, the Government classified fishing as an essential service and kept the fishery harbours and related support services open throughout the Pandemic. This remains the primary Government objective in relation to the fishing industry.</p>  <p>  I am very conscious of the disruptions to international seafood markets arising from the Covid-19 Pandemic and the impacts on our export markets and prices for our seafood.  There are, of course, similar impacts across the food sector and indeed the wider economy.  I have met with representatives of the fishing sector on a number of occasions throughout March and April to discuss how Government can assist the sector in this difficult period, bearing in mind Government's objectives outlined above, the universal income supports being made available by Government which are open to fishermen, and not least the capacity of Government to provide special supports to any one sector of our economy when businesses across the economy are facing many similar difficulties.  </p>  <p>  In response to intense lobbying from Member States and industry, the European Union amended the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund Regulation to make certain types of supports specifically relating to the impacts of Covid-19 eligible for EMFF aid under Member State's Operational Programmes, together with the existing array of supports for capital investment, innovation, marketing, and professional advisory services. However, no additional EU funds were made available to Member States to assist in implementing the new measures, so our capacity to use these measures is subject to the level of uncommitted funds remaining in Ireland&rsquo;s EMFF Programme, and to the availability of uncommitted funds in BIM&rsquo;s 2020 budget.  It is important to note that BIM continues to pay out on grants previously awarded and seafood enterprises continue to apply for new EMFF grants, including some that cite Covid-19 as the reason for their proposed projects.</p>  <p>  One of the measures made available by the EU in  response to the Pandemic is aid for temporary tie-up of fishing vessels and, in my meetings with fishing representatives, selective tie-up aid was the overwhelming request for support in order to reduce the amount of fish being brought to market to match supply with demand and support prices.  In response to those requests, I announced a Covid-19 Temporary Fleet Tie-up Scheme on 8 May with three one-month tie up periods to commence on 1 June and end on 31 August.  I will be reviewing the Scheme at the end of each month to ensure it is achieving its objectives and that market conditions continue to warrant its operation.  It is necessary that each tie-up period is consistent with the fisheries quota management regime which makes quotas available to each vessel for a one month period.  Given the objective of the scheme, it would not be appropriate to have vessels tie-up for say two weeks with tie-up aid and then land their quota in the remaining two weeks.  </p>  <p>  Bearing in the mind the universal income supports being made available by Government and the banking measures that assist fishing enterprises with vessel mortgages and other borrowings during the Pandemic, there was widespread acceptance by fishing representatives in our discussions that a tie-up scheme should assist only the fixed costs of vessel owners while tied up.  The Scheme I have put in place supports 100% of the fixed costs of fishing vessels across eight size categories and these figures come from the official EU Data Collection statistics gathered by BIM from information submitted by the fleet on their fixed costs.  I am aware of the proposal put forward by the Killybegs Fishermens Organisation, that the Tie-up Scheme should provide aid equivalent to 30% of the gross earnings of vessels per month in 2019.  However, that proposal is not consistent with aiding only the fixed costs of the vessels tie-up and would result in very significant over-compensation of the vessels involved.  In addition, it would cost many multiple of the funds available to me to support the entire seafood sector with the impacts of the Pandemic.  </p>  <p>  While the EU Regulation allows for the possibility that aid could be retrospective, this would do nothing to assist in  matching supply with demand or in supporting prices, as it would be aiding activities that have happened in the past.  It is important to bear in mind that the Tie-up Scheme is not an income support scheme.  The Government's Pandemic Unemployment Payment and Wage Subsidy Scheme support the incomes of those who cannot work because of the Pandemic.  Some other important considerations arise from the EMFF Regulation, which requires that vessels receiving aid for tie-up cease all fishing activity for the  period concerned and Member States are required by law to ensure this is the case.  This cannot be verified retrospectively for the majority of the fleet which are not equipped with on-board vessel monitoring systems.</p>  <p>  In relation to aquaculture, my officials have met with Aquaculture sector representatives on a number of occasions, most recently on 22 May.  It is worth recalling that aquaculture enterprises and their workers may avail of the Covid-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment or wage subsidy Scheme. The representatives of the sector agreed to reflect on the discussions and revert with a further submission which will seek to demonstrate how their enterprises are affected by the Pandemic in ways that are not common to businesses in the wider economy and which might warrant a special sector specific intervention by Government.</p></reply>

For this reason, the Government classified fishing as an essential service and kept the fishery harbours and related support services open throughout the Pandemic. This remains the primary Government objective in relation to the fishing industry.</p>  <p>  I am very conscious of the disruptions to international seafood markets arising from the Covid-19 Pandemic and the impacts on our export markets and prices for our seafood.  There are, of course, similar impacts across the food sector and indeed the wider economy.  I have met with representatives of the fishing sector on a number of occasions throughout March and April to discuss how Government can assist the sector in this difficult period, bearing in mind Government's objectives outlined above, the universal income supports being made available by Government which are open to fishermen, and not least, the capacity of Government to provide special supports to any one sector of our economy when businesses across the economy are facing many similar difficulties.  </p>  <p>  In response to intense lobbying from Member States and industry, the European Union amended the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund Regulation to make certain types of supports specifically relating to the impacts of Covid-19 eligible for EMFF aid under Member State's Operational Programmes, together with the existing array of supports for capital investment, innovation, marketing, and professional advisory services. However, no additional EU funds were made available to Member States to assist in implementing the new measures, so our capacity to use these measures is subject to the level of uncommitted funds remaining in Ireland&rsquo;s EMFF Programme, and to the availability of uncommitted funds in BIM&rsquo;s 2020 budget.  It is important to note that BIM continues to pay out on grants previously awarded and seafood enterprises continue to apply for new EMFF grants, including some that cite Covid-19 as the reason for their proposed projects.</p>  <p>  One of the measures made available by the EU in  response to the Pandemic is aid for temporary tie-up of fishing vessels and, in my meetings with fishing representatives, selective tie-up aid was the overwhelming request for support in order to reduce the amount of fish being brought to market to match supply with demand and support prices.  In response to those requests, I announced a Covid-19 Temporary Fleet Tie-up Scheme on 8 May with three one-month tie up periods to commence on 1 June and end on 31 August.  I will be reviewing the Scheme at the end of each month to ensure it is achieving its objectives and that market conditions continue to warrant its operation.  It is necessary that each tie-up period is consistent with the fisheries quota management regime which makes quotas available to each vessel for a one month period.  Given the objective of the scheme, it would not be appropriate to have vessels tie-up for say two weeks with tie-up aid and then land their quota in the remaining two weeks.  </p>  <p>  Bearing in the mind the universal income supports being made available by Government and the banking measures that assist fishing enterprises with vessel mortgages and other borrowings during the Pandemic, there was widespread acceptance by fishing representatives in our discussions that a tie-up scheme should assist only the fixed costs of vessel owners while tied up.  The Scheme I have put in place supports 100% of the fixed costs of fishing vessels across eight size categories and these figures come from the official EU Data Collection statistics gathered by BIM from information submitted by the fleet on their fixed costs.  I am aware of the proposal put forward by the Killybegs Fishermens Organisation  that the Tie-up Scheme should provide aid equivalent to 30% of the gross earnings of vessels per month in 2019.  However, that proposal is not consistent with aiding only the fixed costs of the vessels tie-up and would result in very significant over-compensation of the vessels involved.  In addition, it would cost many multiple of the funds available to me to support the entire seafood sector with the impacts of the Pandemic.  </p>  <p>  While the EU Regulation allows for the possibility that aid could be retrospective, this would do nothing to assist in  matching supply with demand or in supporting prices, as it would be aiding activities that have happened in the past.  It is important to bear in mind that the Tie-up Scheme is not an income support scheme.  The Government's Pandemic Unemployment Payment and Wage Subsidy Scheme support the incomes of those who cannot work because of the Pandemic.  Some other important considerations arise from the EMFF Regulation, which requires that vessels receiving aid for tie-up cease all fishing activity for the  period concerned and Member States are required by law to ensure this is the case.  This cannot be verified retrospectively for the majority of the fleet which are not equipped with on-board vessel monitoring systems.</p></reply>

Enforcement actions against illegal waste activity are a matter for the Local Authorities and the Office of Environmental Enforcement.   An allocation of &euro;3 million has been made to support the 2020 Anti-Dumping Initiative. Since the introduction of the Anti-Dumping Initiative in 2017, funding of &euro;6.3 million has been provided by my Department which has supported over 700 projects and removed 10,000 tonnes of illegally dumped waste across the country. This is in addition to the &euro;7.4m annual enforcement grant, which supports the recruitment and retention of 150 local authority waste enforcement personnel across the country.</p>  <p>  I have ring-fenced and prioritised one million euro of the 2020 allocation to combat illegal dumping activities associated with these challenging times with funding being provided for monitoring and surveillance of dumping black-spots, removal of illegally deposited waste and other measures that will prevent this activity and catch the perpetrators involved. </p>  <p>  A national anti-dumping awareness campaign has also been undertaken to highlight that household waste services are operating normally, that householders must use an authorised waste collector or their local civic amenity to dispose of household waste and that leaving waste, including recyclables, on the street close to waste collection amenities is considered illegal dumping.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that Government has designated waste collection as an essential service and that measures taken by my Department, working in conjunction with industry and other regulatory authorities, has ensured the continued operation and availability of these services across all local authorities. The investment made by my Department in the network of waste enforcement officers has resulted in a robust waste system which has been able to operate effectively in these challenging times.</p></reply>

This is partly due to changes to the scheme introduced in June 2018 which expanded and enhanced the range of energy efficiency measures available as well as an extension of the eligibility rules.  Also, it should be noted that due to COVID-19 all SEAI grant-aided home upgrade works have been paused but will recommence in line with national guidance.</p><p>The Climate Action Plan includes a commitment to review ways to improve how current energy poverty schemes target those most in need, including how to reduce waiting times.  The review has been carried out and recommendations for changes to the scheme will be made shortly.</p><p>There are currently 6,156 homes on the scheme waiting list. Some are awaiting allocation to a contractor while others are awaiting the initial survey of their home.

It is important to note that emissions and removals of greenhouse gases associated with land-based activities are reported in a different category to those associated with agricultural activity, in line with international reporting guidelines. Under the Effort Sharing Regulation (Regulation (EU) 842/2018), Ireland can avail of credits of up to 26.8MtCO2eq associated with land use, including forestry, over the period 2021 to 2030. Thus for 2030, under EU legislation, Ireland will be able to use a limited amount of removals associated with land-based activities, including forestry, in meeting our 2030 emissions reductions target under the Effort Sharing Regulation.</p>  <p>  Forestry provides verifiable removal and storage of CO2 from the atmosphere and will help Ireland in meeting our EU commitments over the period 2021 to 2030. The Government's Climate Action Plan identifies how Ireland will achieve its 2030 targets for carbon emissions, and sets us on a trajectory which would be consistent with net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Under the Climate Action Plan, it is estimated that afforestation and the sustainable management of existing forests will result in a cumulative abatement of 21 MtCO2eq over the period 2021-2030, based on a target afforestation rate of 8,000 hectares per annum.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-06-03a.2288.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1549" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020060300138#WRQQ02500"><p>The Government is fully committed to introducing a ban on the sale of fossil-fuelled internal combustion engine cars and to the targets set out in the Climate Action Plan for electric and low emissions vehicles by 2030.    The transition to alternatively-fuelled vehicles and away from fossil-fuelled vehicles is a necessary step-change to effect a substantial reduction in transport greenhouse gas emissions, particularly in the passenger car fleet which accounts for 52% of transport emissions, or approximately 10% of Ireland&rsquo;s total annual greenhouse gas emissions.</p>  <p>  The Climate Action Plan sets out a pathway for the uptake of electric vehicles over the next decade based on analysis prepared by consultants to identify key emissions abatement technologies.  That analysis concludes that the most cost-effective abatement opportunities for transport are in its electrification. It is widely expected that, over the next number of years, the combination of improvements in technology, reductions in vehicle purchase prices, increasing driving ranges and model availabilities, coupled with Government incentives and new investment in the recharging network will maintain the current positive policy environment under which electric vehicle sales have risen steeply in recent years, albeit from a low base.</p>  <p>  The Climate Action Plan therefore sets targets for electric and low emissions vehicles by 2030 as follows:</p>  <p>  - Increasing the number of passenger EVs on the road to 840,000 (split between 550,000 BEVs and 290,000 PHEVs)</p>  <p>  - Reaching 95,000 electric vans and trucks </p>  <p>  - Procuring 1,200 low-emissions buses for public transport in cities</p>  <p>  Critically, the Plan expects the bulk of the shift to EVs (and the resulting emissions reduction) to occur in the second half of the next decade, when prices have fallen in line with technology development, and purchasing behaviour patterns have changed. These targets are challenging but indicative of the scale of the transformation required if Ireland is to reach its legally binding emission ceilings in future years.</p>  <p>  Achieving the Climate Action Plan targets will likely require a suite of policy and regulatory interventions at national and EU level.  Action 79 of the Climate Action Plan committed to the development of a roadmap on the optimum mix of regulatory, taxation and subsidy policies to drive significant ramp-up in passenger EVs and electric van sales from very early in the next decade.  To meet this commitment, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has established an Electric Vehicle Optimum Policy Pathway Group in which my Department is participating. I understand this group expects to conclude its work and report to Government in Q3 2020.</p>  <p>  The General Scheme of the Climate Action (Amendment) Bill, approved by Government on 17 December 2019, proposes to include a provision to ban the sale of fossil fuel cars by 2030 and to stop the granting of NCTs by 2045 to address the commitments in the Climate Action Plan. Work on the drafting of this legislation is ongoing in my Department.</p>  <p>  There is no inconsistency between EU emission reduction targets for cars and emission reduction targets contained within the Climate Action Plan.  Since 2009, EU legislation sets mandatory emission reduction targets for all new passenger cars and vans registered in the EU. The legislation is the cornerstone of the EU&rsquo;s strategy to improve vehicle fuel economy and has driven car manufacturers to develop innovative energy efficient technologies. The regulations have iteratively been made more stringent, progressively decreasing EU fleet-wide average emissions along with increasing the availability of lower emission vehicles across the EU. </p>  <p>  In relation to the coming decade, Regulation (EU) 2019/631 sets CO2 emission performance standards to ensure that, by 2025 and 2030, the average emissions from new cars will be 15% and 37.5% lower, respectively, compared to 2021 levels.  The Regulation is also structured to incentivise manufacturers to increase the production of zero- and low-emission vehicles. </p>  <p>  Achievement of these targets by manufactures will make an important contribution to both the EU and individual Member State emissions reductions targets for 2030. Due to the absence of vehicle manufacturing here, Ireland will remain strongly dependent on continued action at an EU level in this respect.  Notwithstanding this, Member States may introduce additional domestic policies and measures and impose more ambitious targets for specific sectors. The Climate Action Plan adopted by Government imposes specific and differentiated targets for individual sectors, based on an analysis of the most cost-effective split of emissions reductions across the economy in order to meet Ireland's emissions reduction targets for the 2021 - 2030 period. The Plan targets a 45% - 50% reduction in transport sector emissions by 2030 relative to existing projections.</p>  <p>  The new European Green Deal proposes that, by June 2021, the Commission will revise the legislation on CO2 emission performance standards for cars and vans, to ensure a clear pathway from 2025 onwards towards zero-emission mobility.</p></reply>

Action 30 of the Climate Action Plan commits to the delivery of a framework for micro-generation from renewable technologies with a view to commencement of a support scheme by 2021, at the latest, to ensure that people can sell excess electricity they produce back to the grid, whilst ensuring principles of equity, self-consumption and energy efficiency first are incorporated. </p>  <p>  A Microgeneration Working Group, chaired by my Department, has been established and a detailed work programme is underway examining the main steps necessary to facilitate the feeding of electricity generation of private residence or commercial premises into the national grid.</p>  <p>  The proposed supports mechanisms will be outlined in a public consultation in 2020 and a suitable support payment for excess electricity generated on site and exported to the grid will be available to all micro-generators by 2021.</p></reply>

This new regime will replace existing State and development consent regimes and streamline arrangements on the basis of a single consent principle.  The General Scheme of the Bill was approved by Government on 17 December 2019. It has since been published and, subject to being taken up by the new D&aacute;il, will go to pre-legislative scrutiny as soon as the new Committee structures are set up. </p><p>A Working Group on the Framework for Offshore Electricity Grid was established in late 2019. It is chaired by my Department, and its membership includes Eirgrid, the CRU and ESB Networks. The objective of the group is to assess the options available for a suitable offshore grid model for Ireland. On behalf of the group, Eirgrid commissioned Navigant Consultants to deliver an Options Paper to look at how other Member States approach offshore grid planning and using that evidence base, to examine potential approaches that may be suitable for an Irish context. The Working Group have produced a draft Industry Consultation Paper which is due to be published for public consultation shortly. The options paper and feedback from the consultation will serve to inform a Government decision on Offshore Grid Framework in alignment with national policy including the National Marine Planning Framework.</p><p>My Department is also developing a new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) which will assist Ireland in meeting its renewable energy objectives to 2030 by providing supports to a range of technologies including offshore wind projects. Pending state aid clearance, this scheme will include a number of auctions exclusive to offshore wind.</p><p>Finally, together with the Minister of State for Housing and Urban Development, I announced on 19 May the seven offshore renewable energy projects that have been designated as Relevant Projects under the Transition Protocol. These are offshore wind projects that either applied for or were granted a lease under the Foreshore Act 1933, or offshore wind projects that are eligible to be processed to receive a valid grid connection offer. The announcement of the transition of these projects means that they can continue to work and update a number of aspects of their projects so that they will be in a position to apply under the new marine planning regime, once enacted, which will be introduced under the MPDM Bill. </p><p>The transition protocol for relevant offshore wind projects is outlined at  appendix 4 of the document at the following link:</p><p><i></i></p></reply>

The Scheme offers skills training, mentoring and a grant of up to &euro;2,500 to help small and micro-businesses to develop their ecommerce capability.   In April the Government provided an additional &euro;3.3m to the scheme bringing the total available in 2020 to &euro;5.6m. In addition, new flexibilities to Scheme were introduced including reducing the requirement for co-funding from 50% to 10% and allowing businesses to apply for a second voucher of up to &euro;2,500 where they have successfully utilised their first one.</p>  <p>  There has been a positive response to these changes and significant uptake of the Scheme. In that context my Department is currently reviewing the funding requirements of the Scheme.</p>  <p>  Since the initiation of the Scheme small and micro-businesses in the accommodation and food service sector have not been eligible to apply to the Scheme. The rationale for this was that the requirement to physically attend the service meant transactions were likely to take place offline, or the nature of the industry would require them to already be operating in the online space and did not appear to require state intervention. In the light of the Covid-19 pandemic my Department is reviewing this position.</p></reply>

The last change (a reduction) to licence duty occurred in 2011 by statutory instrument. Successive Ministers have consented to maintaining that reduction every year since. </p>  <p>  There are no circumstances, including those pertaining currently, which facilitate refunds within the primary legislation.  In that regard I would emphasise that a licence is for an entire period/season and logbook records demonstrate that licences are generally only used for a very small proportion of the time they cover. Licences remain usable and I would reiterate that angling has been allowed for the duration of the NPHET advised restrictions.</p></reply>

It will also help us to move towards 70% renewable electricity. A resilient and well connected energy infrastructure is vital for Ireland&rsquo;s economic well-being and the ability to respond to the future needs of energy consumers.</p><p>I have previously met public representatives in relation to the possible undergrounding of the north south interconnector and my Department has published an independent study on this in October 2018. It found that an overhead line remained the most appropriate option for the proposed interconnector. The study report is available on the Department's website at</p><p><i>.</i></p><p>EirGrid is the designated Transmission System Operator and its role includes the operation, maintenance and development of the electricity transmission network in Ireland. The construction of the North South Interconnector, and all related procurement activities, is an operational matter for EirGrid and ESB Networks and one in which I have no function. I am advised that due to the very long lead times that can arise in relation to projects of this nature and the benefits of a single joint procurement process to be undertaken and managed by ESB Networks, EirGrid sought approval from the regulators in Ireland and Northern Ireland to commence procurement. Following this approval, in September 2017, ESB Networks commenced a number of procurement processes in relation to the project. In June 2019, ESB Networks awarded a framework contract for the design, test and supply of steelwork in relation to the project. However, under this framework there will be no supply of materials and no critical procurement process for construction will be concluded until the planning process in Northern Ireland is complete.</p><p>The EU Projects of Common Interest (PCI) process seeks to encourage interconnection between Member States. The process is updated every two years and in the current, fourth, instalment, the UK was a full participant in the process as it reached its conclusion in late 2019.</p></reply>

In this context Covid-19 related information is being widely disseminated.  While not specifically a matter for my Department, a number of cross Government information programmes have been run across both local and national traditional media throughout the crisis to ensure the immediate dissemination of important information to those who need it in communities across the country, including older persons. Part of that national response includes the Local Authorities-led COVID-19 Community Call Forum which is working in partnership with ALONE, the national charity for older people. A leaflet with advice for older people, contact details for Alone and each of the Community Call Fora was distributed to homes throughout the country.</p>  <p>  Public service and community broadcasting are particularly important as readily available, trusted sources of information on Covid-19. At my request, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) has waived the broadcasting levy for commercial and community radio, for quarters 1 and 2 2020. The BAI has also agreed to my request that they put in place a Covid-19 funding round under the Sound and Vision Scheme of &euro;2.5m. This will be for commercial radio given its important role in Covid-19 awareness raising at a local level. It is expected that details of the outcome of this round will be available in the coming days. This will be complemented by a funding round of &euro;750,000 for the community radio sector over the summer.  </p>  <p>  HSE information is also being provided on the Saorview information channel which is available to those who may not have an internet connection.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, An Post has been delivering Covid-19 related information directly to homes. By providing information on a cross media basis and through An Post, information is in no way limited to those with an internet connection. </p></reply>

Enforcement actions against illegal waste activity are a matter for the local authorities and the Office of Environmental Enforcement.   An allocation of &euro;3 million has been made to support the 2020 Anti-Dumping Initiative. Since the introduction of the Anti-Dumping Initiative in 2017, funding of &euro;6.3 million has been provided by my Department which has supported over 700 projects and removed 10,000 tonnes of illegally dumped waste across the country. This is in addition to the &euro;7.4m annual enforcement grant, which supports the recruitment and retention of 150 local authority waste enforcement personnel nationally.</p>  <p>  One million euro of the 2020 allocation has been ring-fenced and prioritised to combat illegal dumping activities associated with these challenging times with funding being provided for monitoring and surveillance of dumping black-spots, removal of illegally deposited waste and other measures that will prevent this activity and catch the perpetrators. </p>  <p>  A national anti-dumping awareness campaign has also been undertaken to highlight that household waste services are operating normally, that householders must use an authorised waste collector or their local civic amenity to dispose of household waste and that leaving waste, including recyclables, on the street close to waste collection amenities is considered illegal dumping.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that Government has designated waste collection an essential service and that measures taken by my Department, working in conjunction with industry and other regulatory authorities, has ensured the continued operation and availability of these services across all local authorities. The investment made by my Department in the network of waste enforcement officers has resulted in a robust waste system which has been able to operate effectively during this crisis.</p></reply>

In line with the requirements of the EU Regulation, Ireland&rsquo;s Plan was reviewed in 2012, 2015 and 2018 when further public consultation was undertaken. The consultations afforded stakeholders the opportunity to make written submissions on all aspects of eel fishing in Ireland.  The measures in Ireland&rsquo;s management plan included closure of the eel fishery, improvement in water quality and assessment of barriers to migration.  In addition a trap and transport initiative, employing experienced eel fishermen to transport migrating eels around ESB Hydro-electric plants was also initiated.</p>  <p>  It is important to bear in mind that the European eel is a panmithic stock &ndash; a single stock across the entire continent - which spawns in the Sargasso Sea before arriving into European rivers and lakes.  The distribution is naturally random between countries.  </p>  <p>  Ireland has followed the objective of the EU Regulation which aims to ensure that escapement of eels to the sea should be at 40% relative to &ldquo;pristine conditions&rdquo; - those pertaining in the early 1980s which was the reference years selected. </p>  <p>  The scientific assessments carried out in each review and the recent EU proposals for a review and strengthening of the existing Eel Regulation do not support the assertion that elver runs are at a record level across Europe. </p>  <p>  The latest advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas (ICES) is that the species remains critically endangered and that recruitment of juveniles in the Northern part of the Atlantic is currently at 1% relative to pristine conditions.  The very latest international scientific advice is that anthropogenic (man-made) mortality should be kept at zero or as close to zero as possible.    </p>  <p>  In consideration of the economic and social impacts of the Eel Management Plan reported by fishermen, the Irish Government&rsquo;s Eel Support Scheme fund was made available from 2018 to all persons who were the holder of a State commercial public eel licence or an eel fishing permit in the 2007 season (the base year).  The scheme provided payments to former fishermen based on their track record in the 5 year period 2003-2007.</p></reply>

The RCNs will be redeemable for cash 6 months after issue but can also be used up to two years to book a replacement holiday.  If not redeemed or used upon expiry, the customer will receive the cash refund to the value of the original booking.  The objective is to protect consumer rights to security on cancelled bookings and at the same time, in circumstances where the customer is willing and able to receive a RCN, give the companies that make up the travel agent and tour operator sector - many of which are small, local family firms - some alleviation from the tidal wave of cancellations and the severe cash flow difficulties that this is causing.  </p>  <p>  Legislative provisions are currently being drafted to give effect to the RCNs.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware of the catastrophic financial impact of Covid-19 across the travel and tourism sector, affecting Irish companies selling holidays abroad and Irish companies selling and facilitating holidays in Ireland.  This particular scheme is part of a much broader package of measures that are either available or are being prepared to support as many viable businesses and jobs in the sector as possible.  It is limited to travel bookings made in Ireland for travel overseas, as comprehended by the EU Package Travel Directive (2302/2015), and it is aligned with recommendations made by the EU Commission last month.  Ireland continues to advocate for a consistent approach across the EU in order that a level playing field is maintained and to ensure that all companies in the travel supply chain receive the same level of support.  Within the EU travel area, at the least, such a common approach should be of some help to tour operators dealing with inbound visitors.</p>  <p>  In relation to the domestic tourism market more generally, on 20 May the Minister of State Brendan Griffin and I established the Tourism Recovery Taskforce in order to prepare a Tourism Recovery Plan. The plan will identify priority aims, key enablers and market opportunities for the sector for the period 2020-2023 to ensure that this vital sector to our economy can adapt and recover in a meaningful and sustainable way.</p></reply>

The purpose of the Taskforce is to prepare a Tourism Recovery Plan for submission to the Ministers which will include a set of recommendations on how best the Irish tourism sector can adapt and recover in the changed tourism environment as a result of the Covid-19 crisis. The plan will identify priority aims, key enablers and market opportunities for the sector for the period 2020-2023. The Taskforce may consult with stakeholders to inform its deliberations and will report back later this year.</p>  <p>  The Taskforce is made up of an independent chairperson and 13 other members from a broad spectrum of backgrounds including tourism policy, tourism enterprise, international, private and public service. The Minister of State and I selected members on the basis of each person's capacity to bring his/her personal knowledge, skills, experience, competence, capability, strategic leadership and ideas to the work of the group. We have appointed individuals who, together, will work for the good of Irish Tourism as a whole. I can assure the Deputy that in the same manner that no sector was deliberately included, no sector was deliberately excluded. </p>  <p>  It is envisaged that the Taskforce will establish working groups to carry out specific tasks and that the Taskforce will undertake a widespread stakeholder consultation process whereby all sectors and interested parties will have an opportunity to provide constructive inputs and innovative ideas on how this vital sector to our economy can adapt and recover in a meaningful and sustainable way. The CTTC will have an opportunity to contribute to the work of the Taskforce in this way.</p>  <p>  I should also point out that in addition to the Tourism Recovery Taskforce, there are other fora whereby tourism stakeholders, including representatives from the coach sector, can contribute. Representatives from the sector have been invited to participate in F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s Covid Advisory Group which meets on a weekly basis. Furthermore, officials on the Transport side in my Department are in regular contact with the CTTC in the context of the difficulties its members are facing as a result of the Covid crisis.</p></reply>

Public transport, including the small public service vehicle (SPSV) industry, remains an important service for those it has continued to carry, including essential workers and those making necessary journeys, and it will continue to play an important role in supporting Government&rsquo;s Roadmap to Reopening Society and Business in the weeks and months ahead.</p><p>That is why we have worked to introduce a wide programme of Government supports for impacted businesses.  The range of supports available includes new schemes of wage subsidies, rates waivers, re-start grants, lending facilities, equity injection, and business advisory supports for example. I also note that self-employed owner-operators of SPSVs may avail of the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment of &euro;350 a week.</p><p>The day-to-day regulation of the small public service vehicle (SPSV) sector is, of course, a matter for the National Transport Authority (NTA) under the provisions of the Taxi Regulation Act 2013.</p><p>In its role as regulator, the NTA recognises the very difficult business environment that small public service vehicle (SPSV) operators are now dealing with and, as part of its response to this situation, has published information for the SPSV industry which includes guidelines, based on the latest available public health advice, on measures operators can take to reduce the spread of COVID-19.  This document is available on the NTA's website. </p><p>The NTA has also taken a number of important actions to reduce the immediate financial burden on SPSV operators. It has extended licences expiring before 12 June 2020 by three months, waived late licence renewal fees, and temporarily relaxed rules around vehicle age limits. The need for further measures will continue to be reviewed in the context of the Government's Roadmap to Reopening Society and Business<i>.</i></p><p>As industry regulator, issues relating to vehicle standards for SPSVs and insurance requirements for SPSVs come within the NTA&rsquo;s area of responsibility and I have, therefore, forwarded your correspondence to the Authority for consideration and direct reply. Please advise this office if you do not receive a response within 10 working days. </p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from the Council's own resources supplemented by State road grants.  </p>  <p>  As previously indicated the extent of the cutbacks in grant funding during the post 2008 recession meant that grant funding for road improvement schemes had to be curtailed because expenditure on maintenance/renewal was falling well short of what was required to adequately maintain the regional and local road network. </p>  <p>  The National Development Plan (NDP) does provide for the gradual build up in funding for the road network but funding is not yet at the level needed for the adequate maintenance and renewal of regional and local roads.  For this reason the primary focus for capital investment at present is the maintenance and renewal of the network and implementation of the 12 regional and local road projects identified for development, subject to necessary approvals, in the NDP.  </p>  <p>  Some limited provision is being made in the capital budget for the appraisal of a pipeline of upgrade projects. This is intended to cover the appraisal of projects for future development, if possible.   </p>  <p>  The Department has formally made observations on the draft Preliminary Appraisal Report that that was submitted by Meath County Council and is continuing to liaise with the Council in relation to the further analysis required to underpin the assessment and costing of various options for managing traffic in the Julianstown area.   </p>  <p>  As also explained previously the project assessment process can be expected to take time and all proposed projects must now comply with the revised Public Spending Code published in December 2019.  In that regard, DTTAS understand that the Council intends  to carry out an origin-destination information gathering exercise to obtain a clear indication of the traffic movements and patterns in and around Julianstown. The Council has confirmed that the data collected from this will inform the project appraisal process and a wider transport study for Drogheda and East Meath area that Meath County Council proposes to carry out in conjunction with Louth County Council as part of a future Joint Urban Plan.  It is noted that this exercise is likely to be delayed as the collection of traffic data at this time is not advisable due to the ongoing impacts of the public health measures that are in place to reduce the spread of the COVID -19 virus.  </p>  <p>  Meath County Council has further confirmed that it is committed to implementing traffic management measures in the vicinity of Julianstown in the shorter term. </p></reply>

If it is the case that the NDLS centres have not re-opened before the extension period expires, the possibility of a further extension will be examined.</p>  <p>  The RSA is currently working, in consultation with my Department, on plans for the resumption of the range of services and functions for which it is responsible, following the publication of the Government roadmap and, more recently, the National Return to Work Safety Protocol as agreed by employer and trade union representatives.</p>  <p>  The resumption of driver testing test raises particular problems in terms of compliance with the Protocol and in particular social distancing rules, as it requires the driver tester and the candidate to be within a two metre distance continuously for a period in excess of 20 minutes, in a very confined space which is not in itself a workplace under the control of the RSA.</p>  <p>  I appreciate that the inability to carry out driving tests at this time is among the many difficulties that we all are having to endure at this time, for those awaiting such tests.  On a very preliminary appraisal of the Protocol, car driving tests may have to be the last of the statutory functions for which the RSA is responsible to recommence in or after Phase 5 of the Government's roadmap.</p>  <p>  Dates for the resumption of the RSA's services, and any special arrangements which will need to be put into place to allow for the provision of these services, will be determined in consultation with the relevant health authorities.</p>  <p>  As a private company, a driving school must ensure that they can comply with the necessary public health requirements before they can reopen their businesses.

I have referred to the obvious difficulties of holding a driving test while ensuring the health and safety of testers and test candidates, and explained that it is likely that the driving test will not resume until phase 5 of the Government's Roadmap for reopening the county.</p>  <p>  I am well aware of the difficulties which the suspension of driver testing services has caused, but as Minister I do not have the option of focusing on certain difficulties and ignoring the wider aspects of public safety.  There could be no justification for risking the safety of learner drivers or other road users by granting them licences without a test - without proving that they are suited to be qualified drivers.  </p>  <p>  Figures show that only 52% of candidates passed the driving test in 2019.  These people had all completed the mandatory programme of lessons.  I presume that their instructors advised the other 48%, or most of them, that they were ready to take the test.  Instructors are not testers, and their views of their pupils' driving abilities, however well-intentioned they might be, are hardly independent.</p>  <p>  Passing a driving test to the specified standards is a prerequite under EU law.  It is there for public safety.  To suggest that this vital safety standard should be waived because of the inconvenience caused by other essential safety measures - in this case the closure of the driver testing service for health reasons - is rather bizarre.

Project Ireland 2040 also states that if Government accepts a proposal to extend the route then that extension will be prioritised over the lifetime of the National Development Plan.</p>  <p>  In line with this commitment, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann commissioned a financial and economic appraisal of the proposal and, in late 2019, submitted a copy of that appraisal to my Department.  As was signalled publicly at the time of the commissioning of the appraisal, and, as is required under the Public Spending Code (PSC), my Department is reviewing the documentation that has been received and is engaging with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and the consultants as required during this review.  Once that review is complete, the matter will then be brought to Government for its decision.</p>  <p>  I hope the Deputy can see from the above that there has been no substantive delay to this process as first outlined in Project Ireland 2040   and as is required under the Public Spending Code. While there have been some unanticipated external factors in recent months, such as the dissolution of the 32nd D&aacute;il in January and the outbreak of the COVID-19 Emergency, I can assure the Deputy that work is ongoing in order to finalise the review and bring the matter to Government. The on-going nature of these deliberative process is also the reason that FOI requests on the matter were refused and the Office of the Information Commissioner has very recently affirmed the Department's position on the issue. </p></reply>

The purpose of this group is to provide support to the tourism industry and to facilitate the timely sharing of information and insights to help improve the sector's understanding and response to the crisis. F&aacute;ilte Ireland has also developed a COVID-19 Business Support Hub which offers a suite of targeted supports for tourism businesses including a series of webinars from experts in each field, as well as advice guides with detailed FAQs and templates where necessary.</p>  <p>  On 1st May, the Government published a Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business to ease the COVID-19 restrictions and reopen Ireland&rsquo;s economy in a phased manner.  In this regard F&aacute;ilte Ireland, in conjunction with the relevant authorities, is currently preparing guidelines for the tourism sector.</p>  <p>Minister Ross and I have appointed a Tourism Recovery Taskforce to prepare a Tourism Recovery Plan which will include a set of recommendations on how best the Irish tourism sector can adapt and recover in the changed tourism environment as a result of the Covid-19 crisis. The plan will identify priority aims, key enablers and market opportunities for the sector for the period 2020-2023. The Taskforce may consult with stakeholders to inform its deliberations and report back this year. The membership of the Taskforce is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-06-03a.2533.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020060300141#WRTT03700"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 888 to 891, inclusive, together.</p><p>Maintaining transport connectivity to support the movement of goods into and out of Ireland has remained a primary objective of Government throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Critical supply chains have continued to function well in recent months; however, the pandemic has negatively impacted freight activity levels across land, sea and air, with the road haulage sector, like many industries, having been affected as a consequence. </p><p>COVID-19 and the overall decline in economic activity have caused a shift to the usual patterns of imports and exports including those moved by sea. Reductions in overall freight activity are understandable given the temporary closure of a range of commercial activities both here in Ireland and abroad. Consequently, I understand that some hauliers operating internationally have in some instances found it increasingly difficult to ensure full loads for both inbound and outbound trips.</p><p>The CSO publishes details of roll-on/roll-off (RoRo) traffic handled by port each quarter including the number of freight vehicles, including details of the number of empty vehicles and trailers - the most recent details for RoRo traffic can be found at the following link: <i>www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/er/spt/statisticsofporttrafficquarter32019/</i>.</p><p>While the CSO figures for Quarter 1 and Quarter 2 of this year are not yet available, the Deputy will see from the CSO&rsquo;s statistics for Quarter 3 of 2019 that over 36,000 vehicles or trailers on RoRo routes (Dublin, Rosslare and Cork) were empty. My Department, in conjunction with the Irish Maritime Development Office (IMDO), continues to closely monitor maritime freight activity levels and overall supply chain issues continue to be monitored on a cross-departmental basis. The Government approved a temporary public service obligation arrangement with ferry companies to retain services on specific, strategically important routes during the COVID-19 outbreak. These arrangements safeguard maritime connectivity between Irish RORO ports and Great Britain/Europe during the crisis, which is crucial for Irish hauliers operating on international journeys. </p><p>An increase in &lsquo;empty leg&rsquo; journeys during the COVID-19 pandemic is not specific to Irish hauliers, with incidents reported across Europe at this time. As sectors begin to re-open both here (with Phase One of the Recovery Roadmap already underway) and across Europe, I expect the demand for goods to begin to rebound also. Phase Two of Ireland&rsquo;s Recovery Roadmap should see further commercial ventures returning to operation. As a consequence, business for haulage operators should begin to revert toward more traditional levels and encouragingly, freight activity is beginning to show some early indications of improvements. </p><p>In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s question to consider a refund of motor tax for vehicles temporarily off the road due to COVID-19, it should be noted that there is no provision in legislation for motor tax to be suspended or refunded in such circumstances. However, vehicles can be declared off the road if they are not going to be in use in a public place; the Non-Use of Motor Vehicles Act 2013 replaced the old system whereby a vehicle could be declared off the road retrospectively with a new system under which the vehicle must be declared off the road in advance.  A declaration must be made in the last month of an existing motor tax disc or renewed in the last month of a previously made declaration of non-use.  The declaration can be made for any number of calendar months between 3 and 12 months.  If a vehicle is subsequently required to be put back on the road, the declaration can be invalidated at any time simply by taxing the vehicle. Where a declaration is not made in advance, arrears of motor tax must be paid in full and motor tax paid for a minimum of 3 months before a declaration of non-use can then be made in the final month of the tax disc.  The provisions of the Act are not sector-specific and apply to all vehicle owners in the same manner. </p><p>Regarding exempting road hauliers from paying motorway tolls for the period of the COVID-19 crisis there have been very few examples where this has been implemented in Europe to date. The provision of toll exemptions is not widely employed due to the critical role that toll revenues play in funding the construction, operation and maintenance of the primary and secondary road network. Introducing a temporary toll-free period would in turn impact on Ireland&rsquo;s ability to fund necessary work and activities across the national road network which is a critical asset for the entire transport sector, including the road haulage sector. </p><p>Finally, the Deputy may wish to note that Ireland introduced a number of COVID-19 specific measures to support the continued functioning of the road haulage sector, including:</p><p>-  A temporary derogation from certain provisions of the EU drivers&rsquo; hours rules, put in place in mid-March, and which expired on 31 May 2020;</p><p>-  An extension of expiry dates on driver Certificate of Professional Competence (CPC) cards &ndash; Irish Driver CPC cards that expire during the COVID-19 outbreak will be valid up to 26 September 2020;</p><p>-  A three-month extension for vehicles with a Commercial Vehicle Roadworthiness (CVR) Test due on or after 28 March 2020;</p><p>-  An extension of validity periods for drivers with driving licences due to expire between 1 March and 30 June 2020 inclusive, their date of expiry being extended by 4 months; </p><p>-  Publishing an array of practical documents, including workplace guidance on how to manage business continuity; a communication regarding access to sanitary facilities and motorway services; a summary of motorway service area facilities; and guidelines for cleaning HGVs; </p><p>- An array of enterprise COVID-19 specific supports<i></i>that many sectors, including the road haulage sector can also avail of including the Credit Guarantee Scheme; the COVID-19 Working Capital Scheme; Microfinance Ireland COVID-19 loan finance; Wage Subsidy Payments; and Pandemic Unemployment Payments.</p></reply>

The purpose of the Taskforce is to prepare a Tourism Recovery Plan for submission to the Ministers which will include a set of recommendations on how best the Irish tourism sector can adapt and recover in the changed tourism environment as a result of the Covid-19 crisis.

I am engaging with my colleague, the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation about these matters and am raising with her the concerns and situation of the commercial operators.</p></reply>

If it is the case that the NDLS centres have not re-opened before the extension period expires, the possibility of a further extension will be examined.</p>  <p>  It must be understood that a learner permit is not a licence, but a permit to allow a person to drive while learning. The purpose of the driving test is to set out the minimum level of knowledge, skill and competency that a learner must demonstrate in order to become a fully licenced driver. Until a learner can meet this standard and pass this test, they are not safe to take to our roads without appropriate supervision.  </p>  <p>  I would also like to point out that the current pass rate for driving tests nationally stands at 52% for 2019, so having fulfilled all of the driving lesson requirements does not mean that an individual meets the standard required to pass the test. </p>  <p>  Studies have repeatedly shown that unaccompanied learner drivers are markedly more likely to be involved in fatal collisions.  For that reason, there can be no exceptions to the current laws in force around learner drivers.  Regrettably, there has been an increase in fatalities on our roads so far in 2020, and we must not relax the standards required of our drivers before being awarded a driving licence, even in the case of frontline workers.</p>  <p>  An unaccompanied learner driver who is stopped by an Garda Siochana may face penalty points, a fixed charge, seizure of the vehicle and possible prosecution.</p>  <p>  The RSA is currently working, in consultation with my Department, on plans for the resumption of the range of services and functions for which it is responsible, following the publication of the Government roadmap and, more recently, the National Return to Work Safety Protocol as agreed by employer and trade union representatives.</p>  <p>  The resumption of driver testing raises particular problems in terms of compliance with the Protocol and in particular social distancing rules, as it requires the driver tester and the candidate to be within a two metre distance continuously for a period in excess of 20 minutes, in a very confined space which is not in itself a workplace under the control of the RSA.</p>  <p>  I appreciate that the inability to carry out driving tests is among the many difficulties that we all are having to endure at this time, for those awaiting such tests.  On a very preliminary appraisal of the Protocol, car driving tests may have to be the last of the statutory functions, for which the RSA is responsible, to recommence in or after Phase 5 of the Government's roadmap.</p>  <p>  Dates for the resumption of the RSA's services, and any special arrangements which will need to be put into place to allow for the provision of these services, will be determined in consultation with the relevant health authorities.</p>  <p>  The safety of the public is of paramount importance at this time, whether from infection or from deaths and injuries on the road, and in this as in all aspects of the Covid-19 crisis, my Department will be guided by NPHET and national experts.</p>  <p>  As a private company, a driving school must ensure that they can comply with the necessary public health requirements before they can reopen their businesses.

Critical supply chains have continued to function well; however, the pandemic has negatively impacted on freight activity levels globally and the road haulage sector, like many industries, has been affected as a consequence. </p><p>The drop in freight activity was inevitable given the temporary closure of a range of commercial activities in Ireland and abroad. An increase in 'empty leg' journeys during the COVID-19 pandemic is, as pointed out, not specific to Irish hauliers, with incidents widely reported across Europe and I am aware that it has become more difficult for some Irish hauliers operating internationally to ensure full loads for both outbound and inbound journeys. </p><p>My Department, in conjunction with the Irish Maritime Development Office (IMDO) continues to keep maritime freight activity levels under review.  As sectors begin to re-open both here (with Phase One of the <i>Recovery Roadmap</i>already underway) and across Europe, I expect that the demand for goods will begin to rebound. As a consequence, business for haulage operators should begin to revert toward more traditional levels. In fact, since the easing of some restrictions freight activity levels have already begun to show some early indications of improvements on both maritime routes and on our roads network, including the Dublin Port Tunnel. </p><p>I note that the Deputy&rsquo;s question refers to a proposal whereby ferry companies in receipt of public service obligation (PSO) support should offer a discounted rate for empty vehicles or trailers. I wish to emphasise that the PSO arrangement was essential in safeguarding a basic level of maritime connectivity between Irish Roll-on Roll-off (RoRo) ports and Great Britain/Europe during the COVID-19 crisis. It was, and is, necessary to keep supply chains, and therefore hauliers, moving into and out of Ireland. The PSO support package is required to be targeted, temporary and restricted, with the explicit aim of keeping Ireland, as an island nation, connected to Great Britain and the EU. The PSO arrangement supports five routes only; other routes, where the number of services and providers were deemed sufficient to prevent market failure, were not supported. The aim was to ensure that operators continue to service the Southern and Continental Corridor instead of a complete cessation of these routes. The support measure is limited to covering the gap between specified costs and revenues generated on the relevant services. Under this model, no company would make a profit but the State secures strategically important services, which are vital for the haulage industry.  This is similar to other services such as public transport and regional air routes, which also receive PSO supports.  They do not, and cannot, reduce costs for any particular set of users but rather allow the service to remain in place for users to avail of. </p><p>The Deputy may wish to be aware of a number of COVID-19 specific measures that have been put in place, to help support the continued functioning of the road haulage sector, including:</p><p>-  A temporary derogation from certain provisions of the EU drivers&rsquo; hours rules, which has been in place since mid-March and which expired on 31 May 2020;</p><p>-  An extension of expiry dates on Driver Certificate of Professional Competence (CPC) cards. Irish Driver CPC cards that expire during the COVID-19 outbreak will be valid up to 26 September 2020;</p><p>-  A three-month extension for vehicles with a Commercial Vehicle Roadworthiness (CVR) Test due on or after 28 March 2020;</p><p>-  An extension of validity periods for drivers with driving licences due to expire between 1 March and 30 June 2020 inclusive, their date of expiry being extended by 4 months; </p><p>-Publishing an array of practical documents, including workplace guidance on how to manage business continuity; a communication regarding access to sanitary facilities and motorway services; a summary of motorway service area facilities; and guidelines for cleaning HGVs; and</p><p>-  An array of enterprise COVID-19 specific supports<i></i>that the haulage sector can also avail of including the Credit Guarantee Scheme; the COVID-19 Working Capital Scheme; Microfinance Ireland COVID-19 loan finance; Wage Subsidy Payments; and Pandemic Unemployment Payments.</p><p>In summary, while I recognise that the temporary closure of a range of commercial activities has led to a significant change in demand for goods into and out of Ireland, I am confident that the coming weeks will see an improvement in the situation as sectors continue to re-open here and across Europe. In the interim, I do not currently believe that Government subvention for empty leg journeys is an appropriate mitigation measure, and transportation costs should continue to be negotiated on a commercial basis between relevant parties. In addition, eligible hauliers may avail of the State supports outlined to assist them during these challenging times.</p></reply>

Any learner permits which were due to expire from 1 March 2020 to 30 June 2020 inclusive have had their period of validity extended by 4 months. If it is the case that the NDLS centres have not re-opened before the extension period expires, the possibility of a further extension will be examined. </p>  <p>  The RSA is currently working, in consultation with my Department, on plans for the resumption of the range of services and functions for which it is responsible, following the publication of the Government roadmap and, more recently, the National Return to Work Safety Protocol as agreed by employer and trade union representatives.  </p>  <p>  The resumption of driver testing raises particular problems in terms of compliance with the Protocol and in particular social distancing rules, as it requires the driver tester and the candidate to be within a two metre distance continuously for a period in excess of 20 minutes, in a very confined space which is not in itself a workplace under the control of the RSA.</p>  <p>  I appreciate that the inability to carry out driving tests is among the many difficulties that we all are having to endure at this time, for those awaiting such tests.  On a very preliminary appraisal of the Protocol, car driving tests may have to be the last of the statutory functions, for which the RSA is responsible, to recommence in or after Phase 5 of the Government's roadmap.</p>  <p>  Dates for the resumption of the RSA's services, and any special arrangements which will need to be put into place to allow for the provision of these services, will be determined in consultation with the relevant health authorities.</p>  <p>  The RSA has always been willing to consider arrangements for people who urgently need a driving test, and I anticipate that this will continue to be the case when the service resumes. </p>  <p>  The safety of the public is of paramount importance at this time, whether from infection or from deaths and injuries on the road, and in this as in all aspects of the Covid-19 crisis, my Department will be guided by NPHET and national experts.</p></reply>

The measures put in place by the Government to support businesses  initially focused on supporting those who have lost their jobs and in supporting businesses to remain viable during this difficult time with specifically targeted supports to assist companies to stay operational and retain their staff.</p>  <p>  As a result, many tourism businesses are now availing of the various cross-sectoral economic supports that the Government has already put in place such as; the wage subsidy scheme, increased unemployment benefits, the state credit guarantee scheme, working capital loan schemes, enterprise support schemes and deferrals of tax liabilities, VAT, social contributions and local authority rates.  </p>  <p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland has set up a COVID-19 Industry Advisory Group which meets weekly. The purpose of this group is to provide support to the tourism industry and to facilitate the timely sharing of information and insights to help improve the sector's understanding and response to the crisis. F&aacute;ilte Ireland has also developed a COVID-19 Business Support Hub which offers a suite of targeted supports for tourism businesses including a series of webinars from experts in each field, as well as advice guides with detailed FAQs and templates where necessary. </p>  <p>  Minister Ross and I have appointed a Tourism Recovery Taskforce to prepare a Tourism Recovery Plan which will include a set of recommendations on how best the Irish tourism sector can adapt and recover in the changed tourism environment as a result of the Covid-19 crisis.

The Taskforce may consult with stakeholders to inform its deliberations and report back this year. The membership of the Taskforce is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  On 1st May, the Government published a Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business to ease the COVID-19 restrictions and reopen Ireland&rsquo;s economy in a phased manner.

This Roadmap is a living, flexible framework document and will be subject to regular review.

As you will appreciate, the driving test raises particular problems in terms of compliance with the Protocol and in particular social distancing rules, as it requires the driver tester and the candidate to be within a two metre distance continuously for a period in excess of 20 minutes, in a very confined space which is not in itself a workplace under the control of the RSA.</p>  <p>  I appreciate that the inability to carry out driving tests at this time is among the many difficulties that we all are having to endure at this time, for those awaiting such tests.  On a very preliminary appraisal of the Protocol, car driving tests may have to be the last of the statutory functions, for which the RSA is responsible, to recommence in or after Phase 5 of the Government's roadmap.</p>  <p>  The RSA does, however, believe that it may be possible to carry out driving tests currently on certain classes of vehicles, including HGVs, and is prepared to consider each application on a case by case basis. </p>  <p>  As with other aspects of driving licence services, driver theory tests are currently suspended.  Although the contractor is making plans to clear the inevitable backlog of applications, a date has not yet been confirmed as to when their offices can reopen, and they will only do so when they can ensure that all Covid-19 related restrictions in place at that time can be strictly adhered to.</p>  <p>  It is not possible to carry out the driver theory tests remotely online, as it is vital that the identify of the candidate can be established, and that there is no possibility of fraud in relation to the test itself.</p>  <p>  Dates for the resumption of the RSA's services, and any special arrangements which will need to be put into place to allow for the provision of these services, will be determined in consultation with the relevant health authorities.</p>  <p>  Contracts for the operation of services is a matter for the RSA.  The driver theory test is operated by Prometric under contract awarded following a competitive process. </p>  <p>The safety of the public is of paramount importance at this time, whether from infection or from deaths and injuries on the road, and in this as in all aspects of the Covid-19 crisis, my Department will be guided by NPHET and national experts.  </p></reply>

If it is the case that the NDLS centres have not re-opened before the extension period expires, the possibility of a further extension will be examined.</p>  <p>  The RSA is currently working, in consultation with my Department, on plans for the resumption of the range of services and functions for which it is responsible, following the publication of the Government roadmap and, more recently, the National Return to Work Safety Protocol as agreed by employer and trade union representatives.  </p>  <p>  The resumption of driver testing raises particular problems in terms of compliance with the Protocol and in particular social distancing rules, as it requires the driver tester and the candidate to be within a two metre distance continuously for a period in excess of 20 minutes, in a very confined space which is not in itself a workplace under the control of the RSA.</p>  <p>  I appreciate that the inability to carry out driving tests at this time is among the many difficulties that we all are having to endure at this time, for those awaiting such tests.  On a very preliminary appraisal of the Protocol, car driving tests may have to be the last of the statutory functions, for which the RSA is responsible, to recommence in or after Phase 5 of the Government's roadmap.</p>  <p>  Dates for the resumption of the RSA's services, and any special arrangements which will need to be put into place to allow for the provision of these services, will be determined in consultation with the relevant health authorities.</p>  <p>The safety of the public is of paramount importance at this time, whether from infection or from deaths and injuries on the road, and in this as in all aspects of the Covid-19 crisis, my Department will be guided by NPHET and national experts.  </p></reply>

In this context, the NTA is engaging directly with both PSO and commercial transport operators and will publish their proposals shortly. </p>  <p>  My Department is also engaging directly with PSO and commercial operators to help inform policy decisions in relation to the public transport sector as we progress through the various phases of the Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business. Further, I am engaging with my colleague, the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation about these matters and am raising with her the concerns and situation of the commercial operators. </p>  <p>  I am aware that many operators in these sectors are particularly reliant on the tourism and hospitality sector. My Department has recently commenced engagement with the Coach Tourism &amp;amp; Transport Council of Ireland and since late February officials from my Department have engaged with the SPSV industry with a view to understanding the challenges facing the sector. In addition, with my colleague, Minister of State Griffin, I have established the COVID-19 Tourism Monitoring Group. This group comprises industry stakeholders, the tourism agencies and Departmental officials and has been specifically established to monitor the disruption to the tourism sector and to assist in formulating the sector&rsquo;s response to the crisis. </p>  <p>  The NTA has also taken a number of actions to reduce the immediate financial burden on SPSV operators and to make it easier for them to return to the industry when circumstances change. The NTA has extended licences expiring before 12 June 2020 by three months, waived late licence renewal fees, and temporarily relaxed rules around vehicle age limits. It has engaged with the insurance industry to facilitate a suspension of SPSV insurance for those operators who decide to temporarily stop working and suspend their licences.  The NTA has also put in place arrangements to facilitate the swift re-activation of the suspended licence when such an SPSV operator wishes to return to work. Furthermore, it is my intention to meet with Advisory Committee on SPSVs next month.</p></reply>

If it is the case that the NDLS centres have not re-opened before the extension period expires, the possibility of a further extension will be examined.</p>  <p>  The RSA is currently working, in consultation with my Department, on plans for the resumption of the range of services and functions for which it is responsible, following the publication of the Government roadmap and, more recently, the National Return to Work Safety Protocol as agreed by employer and trade union representatives.  </p>  <p>  The resumption of driver testing test raises particular problems in terms of compliance with the Protocol and in particular social distancing rules, as it requires the driver tester and the candidate to be within a two metre distance continuously for a period in excess of 20 minutes, in a very confined space which is not in itself a workplace under the control of the RSA.</p>  <p>  I appreciate that the inability to carry out driving tests is among the many difficulties that we all are having to endure at this time, for those awaiting such tests.  On a very preliminary appraisal of the Protocol, car driving tests may have to be the last of the statutory functions, for which the RSA is responsible, to recommence in or after Phase 5 of the Government's roadmap.  As well as the general provisions governing public health, I would remind the Deputy that the Road Safety Authority has legal responsibilities as an employer for the health and safety of its employees, including driver testing staff.</p>  <p>  However, the RSA believes that motorcycle testing may be possible during an earlier phase of the Government's phased reopening plans - subject to the same Workplace Resumption Protocols as every other service, and they are currently actively working on plans for reopening motorcycle testing.</p>  <p>  There will be a formal announcement in due course when all of the arrangements are in place. </p>  <p>  Dates for the resumption of the RSA's services, and any special arrangements which will need to be put into place to allow for the provision of these services, will be determined in consultation with the relevant health authorities.</p>  <p>  The safety of the public is of paramount importance at this time, whether from infection or from deaths and injuries on the road, and in this as in all aspects of the Covid-19 crisis, my Department will be guided by NPHET and national experts.</p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from the Council's own resources supplemented by State road grants. The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the Council. </p>  <p>  Before the post 2008 financial crisis, local authorities could apply on a regular basis for grants for Specific or Strategic Improvement Grants for the strengthening, widening or realignment of regional and local roads.  However, the extent of the cutbacks in grant funding during the crisis meant these grant schemes had to be curtailed after 2013 because expenditure on maintenance and renewal was falling well short of what was required to adequately maintain the regional and local road network. </p>  <p>  Project Ireland 2040 does provide for the gradual build up in funding for the road network but it will take some time yet to reach the level required for the adequate maintenance and renewal of the network. For this reason there is limited scope at present for funding projects under the Specific or Strategic Grant Programme.  </p>  <p>  Any projects proposed by local authorities for consideration under these Grant Programmes are assessed by the Department on a case-by-case basis.  All projects put forward by local authorities for consideration must comply with the requirements of the Public Spending Code and my Department's Capital Appraisal Framework and it is important for local authorities to prioritise projects within their overall area of responsibility with these requirements in mind.  No application in relation to the upgrade of the L2455 has been received for funding under the regional and local road grant programmes.</p>  <p>  I understand that there has been interaction between both Cork Councils and the National Transport Authority regarding the design of a road improvement scheme for the L2455 and that the NTA has provided funding in the amount of &euro;100,000 this year to Cork City Council to progress the design of the Lehenaghmore Project. The design team is currently considering alternative designs, requirements for land acquisitions, service diversions and related tasks. The Part 8 planning for the preferred layout is scheduled to progress to Part 8 Planning within the current calendar year with detailed design to follow thereafter, subject to planning and funding approval.</p></reply>

More specifically, the statutory power to levy tolls, to make toll bye-laws and to enter into agreements with private investors are vested in TII under Part V of the Roads Act 1993 (as amended).</p>  <p>  Regarding exempting motorists from paying motorway tolls until the end of 2020 there have been very few examples where this has been implemented in Europe to date. I am aware of toll free operations in the Mersey Tunnel, Liverpool and for a limited time period at the Ringsend Toll Bridge, Dublin. Providing toll exemptions are not widely employed due to the critical role toll revenues play in funding the construction, operation and maintenance of the national primary and secondary road network. Introducing a temporary toll free period on the M3 would require TII, and in turn the Exchequer, to reimburse the PPP concessionaire for loss of toll revenue.

The resumption of both driver testing  and driver instruction raise particular problems in terms of compliance with the Protocol and in particular social distancing rules, as both scenarios require the learner and either the tester or instructor to be within a two metre distance continuously for a period in excess of 20 minutes. To put this in perspective, on a very preliminary appraisal of the Protocol, car driving tests may have to be the last of the statutory functions, for which the RSA is responsible, to recommence in or after Phase 5 of the Government's roadmap. </p>  <p>  I understand that any company which reopens is subject to inspection by Health and Safety Authority, and may face serious sanctions, including closure, if found to be not in compliance with Covid-19 requirements.  </p>  <p>The safety of the public is of paramount importance at this time, whether from infection or from deaths and injuries on the road, and in this as in all aspects of the Covid-19 crisis, my Department will be guided by NPHET and national experts.  </p></reply>

The re-opening of Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare (ELC and SAC) services will be guided by this framework and will be underpinned by the Government's Return to Work Safely Protocol, expert advice, available evidence and consultation with ELC and SAC stakeholder representatives and providers themselves. </p>  <p>  Expert guidance on the safe reopening of childcare services during the COVID-19 pandemic was published by the HSE Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) on Friday, 29 May. The guidance recommends use of a &ldquo;play pod&rdquo; model which restricts interactions between closed groups of children and adults as an alternative to social distancing, on the basis that social distancing is not possible between young children. </p>  <p>  Services are now being asked to apply the guidance to their setting and determine what capacity they may offer. It is expected that a significant amount of capacity will be available in individual services that reopen in the summer, subject to, for example, their space, room layout and staffing availability.  Whilst there are 4,500 Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare services in the country, fewer than 2,000 of these normally remain open in July and August.</p>  <p>  I have been engaging intensively with a number of organisations representing the childcare sector, through an Advisory Group. A range of additional guidance and resources to assist the sector to prepare for reopening are currently being prepared and will start to issue in the coming days and continue over the remaining weeks before opening.</p></reply>

The Board are the legal entity and governance structure of the CCC and are mandated by the CCC's own Memoranda and Articles of Association or Constitution, as required by the Company&rsquo;s Registration Office (CRO) and, where applicable, the Charities Regulator.  Members of CCC Boards individually and collectively as company directors and as a legal entity are subject to governance responsibilities and accountabilities under common law in general and the Companies Act 2014.  </p>  <p>  CCC Boards are well established.  Boards ensure their memberships are of a size and composition that supports effective governance, operation and continuity.  The range of skills held by Board members is paramount, with members selected on the basis of their skills rather than the constituencies they represent.  </p>  <p>  My Department sets the key objectives and actions for the CCCs on an annual basis.  Pobal, on behalf of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, manages the funding of CCCs, oversees their work and provides development supports.  Each CCC must submit quarterly reports to Pobal in respect of their progress in delivering/implementing the actions as set by my Department.  My Department liaises closely with Pobal in this regard.  Pobal further undertakes audit and verification visits to CCCs ensure the investment by DCYA is appropriately accounted for.</p></reply>

All data collected by Tusla relating to reported closures is collated and verified on a rolling quarterly basis.</p>  <p>  Both my Department and Tusla are aware of and appreciate the difficulties faced by many early years providers as a result of the on-going Covid-19 public health restrictions and acknowledge the impact of these restrictions on the sector. </p>  <p>  Despite this difficult situation, data received by Tusla&rsquo;s Early Years Inspectorate has shown that there have been relatively few permanent closures of early years services to date as a result of the ongoing restrictions. The number of reported closures for Quarter 1 2020 is seven. Data for Quarter 2 is not yet available.</p>  <p>  As a direct response to the COVID-19 closure of ELC and SAC services, I launched the Temporary Wage Subsidy Childcare Scheme (TWSCS) which is a very significant measure to support the sector. TWSCS operates in conjunction with the Revenue Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS), which was initially introduced on 26 March to operate for 12 weeks, until 18 June.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently examining funding options for the childcare sector in relation to the reopening of services.</p></reply>

This will be underpinned by the Government's Return to Work Safely Protocol, expert advice, available evidence and consultation with ELC and SAC stakeholder representatives and providers themselves. To support this work, I have convened and chair an Advisory Group, that comprises eight organisations representing the ELC and SAC sector, one representing the childminding sector and a trade union representative. Intensive engagement with this Group has been underway for several weeks now.</p>  <p>  On 29 May I received Government support for the initial plans for re-opening ELC and SAC services under Phase 3 (29 June). The plan for re-opening is guided by the detailed public health guidance specific to ELC and SAC services received from the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) and noted by NPHET. </p>  <p>  The phased reopening will seek to meet the needs of parents and guardians who are returning to work, and prioritise the needs of vulnerable children who need ELC and SAC on child welfare grounds. </p>  <p>  It is intended that from 29 June, ELC and SAC services will be accessible by:</p>  <p>  -  Children of health and social care workers, other frontline workers,  early ELC and SAC practitioners themselves, and parents who need access to  ELC and SAC in order to return to work. In the first instance, places will be available to families from these categories who previously used the  ELC and SAC services.</p>  <p>  -  Vulnerable children, including children sponsored under the National Childcare Scheme (for example, children in the protection process and children who are homeless) along with children funded through legacy  ELC and SAC funding schemes who are experiencing poverty, disadvantage or child welfare issues.</p>  <p>  -  Children with disabilities, including those preparing to start school in September.</p>  <p>  -  Other children previously registered in  ELC and SAC services on March 12, whose parents continue to need  ELC and SAC and who were assured that they would retain their place through conditions attached to the DCYA Temporary Wage Subsidy Childcare Scheme. </p>  <p>  -  Subject to local availability of places, children who did not previously use  early ELC and SAC services and whose parents are now seeking a place.</p>  <p>  Detailed planning and costing of proposals is ongoing to provide a sustainable and viable funding model which can be applied for the initial phase of reopening of ELC and SAC service, through to operating at full capacity. Working with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, I will revert to Government for a decision when this work is advanced. </p>  <p>  I am very conscious of the importance of ELC and SAC for children&rsquo;s positive development and in terms of supporting the economy as we move beyond this crisis. The approach to resuming ELC and SAC programmes, including ECCE, will need to be an iterative one. Further consideration will be required on these issues as reopening progresses beyond 29 June and the response by both providers and parents becomes clearer, but it is my hope that children will be able to attend full-time or part-time depending on their family requirements. The situation remains under review and I will revert to the Deputy once further information is available. </p></reply>

The re-opening of Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare (ELC and SAC) services will be guided by this framework and will be underpinned by the Government's Return to Work Safely Protocol, expert advice, available evidence and consultation with ELC and SAC stakeholder representatives and providers themselves. </p>  <p>  The future stages of the Roadmap's re-opening of ELC/SAC services are stated as follows: </p>  <p>  Phase 3 (29 June), opening of cr&egrave;ches, childminders and preschools for children of essential workers in a phased manner with social distancing and other requirements applying. </p>  <p>  Phase 4 (20 July), opening of cr&egrave;ches, childminders and preschools for children of all other workers on a gradually increasing phased basis and slowly increasing thereafter. </p>  <p>  The sector has many questions regarding how the Roadmap will be implemented to enable services to re-open. While the COVID-19 emergency called for overnight action on closures, it is my ambition that the phased re-opening will enable sufficient time and planning to re-open in an orderly, safe and sustainable manner. I would like to reassure providers, practitioners, parents and children that I will be doing my utmost to support the sector in offering as smooth a transition as possible to the phased and restricted re-opening of ELC and SAC services.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently working with the sector to answer the many questions that exist. This is complex work and must balance a number of important issues, including those mentioned by the Deputy around capacity. Informed by NPHET and public health guidance, consideration is being given to a range of these issues, including:</p>  <p>  -  Minimising the public health risk, especially given the difficulty of maintaining social distancing among young children and those caring for them, </p>  <p>  -  Ensuring the need for any restrictions to be consistent with young children&rsquo;s well-being and development needs and for ELC and SAC provision at each phase to be child-centred.</p>  <p>  -  Providing ELC for pre-school children, meeting parental demand for ELC and SAC as the economy reopens, and meeting the commitment to retain places for families who paid for ELC and SAC before COVID-19, all while restricting capacity and thereby reducing adult-child ratios. </p>  <p>  -  Ensuring financial sustainability of the sector when capacity restrictions limit income and parents cannot afford to cover any higher costs with      higher fees.</p>  <p>  Ensuring a sufficient number of qualified ELC and SAC practitioners, given likelihood of reduced adult-child ratios and existing challenges with      recruitment and retention.</p>  <p>  I am actively engaging with key stakeholders in the sector to make sure that the work on re-opening services is informed by the practical reality across the country. I have established and Chair an Advisory Group that includes representatives chosen by the sector, specifically the Association of Childhood Professionals, Community Forum, Early Childhood Ireland, National Childhood Network, PL&Eacute; and Seas Suas. The group also includes Tusla, Pobal, SIPTU and Childminding Ireland. The first meeting of this Advisory Group took place on 13 May and I held follow up meetings on 15 and 19 May. A schedule of weekly meetings has also been agreed.</p>  <p>  The proposals for re-opening which are in development will have due regard to Public Health guidance over the phases of easing of restrictions.  I am conscious that the proposed timelines are subject to further NPHET advice, and decisions from Government. </p>  <p>  Identifying essential workers, who will be eligible for childcare as part of this reopening, is part of the wider Government effort to ensure that society and business are re-opened in a carefully managed and safe manner.</p>  <p>  If capacity issues emerge in ELC and SAC services  as they reopen, priority for places should be given to the children of essential or frontline workers. I would encourage parents to discuss this directly with their childcare provider or childminder.</p>  <p>  There are a number of key decisions to be made across Government that will impact significantly on the ELC and SAC sector, including the future of emergency measures such as the Revenue operated Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection operated Pandemic Unemployment Payment, and other business supports. The proposals for re-opening ELC and SAC services necessarily interact with these schemes and so I will be relying on whole of Government plans, which impact the ELC and SAC sector. </p>  <p>  It is my fervent hope that every early education and childcare service  around the country is currently considering how it can be part of helping Ireland get back to work, and how it can support children from June 29th in the very difficult circumstances they have experienced in recent months.  </p>  <p>  I will undertake to update the Deputy as soon as the work on re-opening services is at a more advanced stage.</p></reply>

This advice specifies that currently childminders may work in the child&rsquo;s home, but should not work in their own homes. </p><p>On Friday 1 May the Government released its Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business, which sets out Ireland's plan for lifting COVID-19 restrictions through five phases. The re-opening of Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare (ELC and SAC) services will be guided by this framework and will be underpinned by the Return to Work Safely Protocol, expert advice, available evidence and consultation with ELC and SAC stakeholder representatives. </p><p>The Roadmap proposes that the reopening of cr&egrave;ches, childminders and preschools in a phased manner will begin in Phase 3, which is currently scheduled to begin on 29 June. Last Friday, 29 May, I announced that childminders will also be able to resume looking after children in the childminder&rsquo;s home from 29 June, while complying with HPSC advice.</p></reply>

The Scheme was designed in response to a request from the Department of Health and the HSE to put emergency childcare in place for essential health workers. Existing, registered childcare services were invited to participate in the provision of childcare in the homes of essential healthcare workers.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Temporary Childcare Scheme for Essential Health Workers did not proceed on the 18 May as planned. The scheme was launched with a call to childcare services to volunteer to provide childcare for health workers in their homes. Unfortunately, uptake for the scheme among childcare providers was much lower than was hoped.</p>  <p>  The Temporary Childcare Scheme for Essential Health Workers was expected to operate for an initial period of 4 weeks, and would have utilised funding allocated under the Early Learning and Care and School Age Childcare budget over that time. Funding under this  ELC and SAC budget will be directed towards the phased reopening of early learning and childcare facilities from 29th June, in line with the Government's Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business. This budget also currently provides for the ongoing operation of the DCYA Temporary Wage Subsidy Childcare Scheme (TWSCS). The TWSCS was developed to sustain the early learning and care (ELC) and school Aged Care (SAC) sector and is layered on top of the wider Revenue operated TWSS. These emergency measures have been in place since 6th April.</p></reply>

These included the suspension of funding pending the appointment of a new Board, the appointment of Ms Jillian Van Turnhout to conduct a review of governance, which was completed in June 2018, and the requirement for regular updates on governance reforms by Scouting Ireland to my Department. </p>  <p>  In addition, earlier this year, I appointed Ms Brigid McManus to conduct a follow-up review of governance in Scouting Ireland.  This was published on 8th May and confirmed that all of Ms Van Turnhout&rsquo;s recommendations had been satisfactorily implemented, while outlining a small number of matters for follow up. </p>  <p>  I welcome the publication by Mr. Elliott of his learning review into historical sexual abuse in scouting.  My thoughts are with the adults who suffered so gravely as children through their involvement with scouting and who have carried this burden with them into their adult lives.   </p>  <p>  I met with Mr Elliott, following receipt of his review, and was pleased to hear that, notwithstanding the seriousness of the findings, he was very positive about the current governance arrangements in Scouting Ireland, with a Board that is strong and well-functioning, and with robust safeguarding in place.  Tusla has also written to the Department to indicate its satisfaction with current safeguarding practice in Scouting Ireland, particularly as it relates to the agreed Scouting Ireland / Tusla Action Plan.</p>  <p>  The Government had previously undertaken to give careful consideration to the question of an appropriate statutory investigation following the RT&Eacute; Investigates programme &ldquo;Scouts Dishonour&rdquo;. It was appropriate for Government to await the reports from Ms Brigid McManus and Mr Ian Elliott to inform this consideration.  In this regard, it is noted that Mr Elliott&rsquo;s report suggests that a statutory inquiry may face the same limitations as his Learning Review.  Mr Elliott has also emphasised the cooperation of Scouting Ireland in relation to his review.  As such, a key factor is whether a statutory or public inquiry would uncover new information.  This is something which will need to be taken into account in contemplating the question of an inquiry. </p></reply>

I am also very conscious of the importance of the early education and childcare sector, particularly in the context of the current conditions and with a view to supporting the economy as we move beyond this crisis.</p>  <p>  Recognising this, the Temporary Covid-19 Wage Subsidy Childcare Scheme was launched on 15 April.</p>  <p>  To support the Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare sector during COVID-19 closures, I announced plans on 25 March for the development for this Scheme.</p>  <p>  The aim of the Temporary Wage Subsidy Childcare Scheme is threefold:</p>  <p>  -  to support the sustainability of the Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare Sector so that it is in a position to reopen after COVID-19; </p>  <p>  -  to provide parents with a reassurance that they are not required to pay fees during this COVID-19 crisis, while providing them with reassurance that they will maintain places for their children; and</p>  <p>  -  to give Early Learning and Care Educators security and retain these vital Educators in the sector. </p>  <p>  To achieve this, the Temporary Wage Subsidy Childcare Scheme will provide funding towards a portion of staff wages and services overhead costs. Details of how to sign up have been made available through the Pobal programme platform used by childcare providers.</p>  <p>  Clearly the sector experienced considerable anxiety and stress on March 12 when closures were announced. To alleviate this, I had directed that the programme payments (including ECCE (free pre-school) and the National Childcare Scheme) continue on an ex-gratia basis, despite services being closed until the Temporary Wage Subsidy Childcare Scheme was up and running. </p>  <p>  Payments for those schemes continued until last Friday 10 April 2020 and reflect the amount that would have been expected by services, based on current child registrations and the calendars submitted by the service to Pobal on or before the closure of services on 12 March 2020. Whilst many services would benefit from the continuation of these ex gratia payments, many other services which relied more heavily on parental income were extremely exposed with the loss of this income stream. </p>  <p>  It was important to move to this new temporary funding model which repurposes existing monies to support the multiplicity of childcare provider types with varying ratios of state income and parental contribution. For example, had the schemes such as ECCE remained as they were, services in receipt of 90-100% of their income from the State would have managed during the closure period, but those with much less would have been very severely impacted. This could have resulted in permanent closure and loss of precious capacity post-COVID. </p>  <p>  The Temporary Wage Subsidy Childcare Scheme is available to all of the 4000 plus services that were contracted to my Department on March 12 and builds on the wider provisions by Government. It also recognises the unique place and importance of the childcare sector.</p>  <p>  Details regarding the mechanics of the scheme are addressed in a comprehensive set of FAQs that have been published on the DCYA website and shared with providers. The Pobal Service Provider Centre is also available to respond to queries.</p>  <p>  My Department has made considerable investment in the sector in recent years. I want to preserve the fruits of this investment and I want to ensure that early education and childcare places are still there for parents when these difficult times pass.</p></reply>

It is also the understanding of my Department that this is the case, but, this is under the remit of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and I would refer the Deputy to that Department for further information.</p>  <p>  However, I do wish to clarify that the Deputy&rsquo;s constituent can apply for support for her service under my Department&rsquo;s Temporary Wage Subsidy Childcare Scheme (TWSCS). </p>  <p>  The TWSCS supplements Revenue&rsquo;s Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme in two ways. One of these ways is to provide greater subsidies for wages, which an owner/operator who is not paid a wage therefore cannot directly benefit from; their staff however may be able to receive the benefit of the subsidy. Additionally, the TWSCS also provides top-up funding to support non-deferrable overhead costs. This funding is calculated at 15% of wage costs, with a minimum amount of &euro;300 per week awarded if 15% of wage costs is lower. An owner/operator who is neither eligible for the Covid-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment or the Revenue&rsquo;s Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme may still be able to access this overhead payment under the TWSCS. I hope that this measure will provide some support to the Deputy&rsquo;s constituent during these extraordinary times. </p></reply>

The TWSCS repurposes existing ELC and SAC monies to layer on top of the Revenue Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) and to support the multiplicity of ELC and SAC provider types with varying ratios of State income and parental contribution.</p><p>The TWSCS builds on the wider provisions by Government and also recognises the unique place and importance of the ELC and SAC sector.</p><p>Details regarding the operation of the scheme are addressed in a comprehensive set of FAQs which has been published on the DCYA website.</p><p>With regard to the questions raised by the Deputy's constituent which are not directly addressed in the FAQ:</p><p>-  The DCYA Temporary Wage Subsidy Childcare Scheme (TWSCS) is a supplement to the Revenue Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) and, as such, rules associated with the Revenue Scheme apply to the TWSCS. DCYA has no discretion with regard to the payment of certain providers who were not on the payroll.</p><p>-  The DCYA TWSCS provides funding to enable employers to top-up their employees&rsquo; wages as per the scheme guidelines. The DCYA TWSCS does provide additional funding towards the non-deferrable operating costs of an ELC/SAC service, including those of sole traders with no employees. </p><p>-  The terms of the Revenue TWSS have been updated to resolve the potential issue your constituent identified, where an employer wishes to pay a greater level of top-up  in order to bring the employee&rsquo;s pay to &euro;350 per week, tapering of the Revenue subsidy will now not take place </p><p>My Department has made considerable investment in the sector in recent years. I want to preserve the fruits of this investment for children, families and our much valued ELC and SAC workforce and ensure that, when COVID- 19 has passed, we will have retained as many services, staff and places as possible.</p></reply>

It was a key commitment for DCYA as part of the 2016 Programme for Partnership Government and the Government's broader commitment to continue to strive for the full inclusion of LGBTI+ people in Irish society.</p>  <p>  Three strategic goals were identified to support the achievement of the LGBTI+NYS vision; these goals cascade down into 15 Objectives and 59 actions, involving collaboration between Government Departments, Agencies and a wide range of other stakeholders. The Goals are aligned to the five national outcomes of the Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures: The National Policy Framework for Children and Young People, 2014-2020 (BOBF). </p>  <p>  In October 2019 the First Annual Report on the Implementation of the LGBTI+ National Youth Strategy was published. The reported documented progress on action implementation up to the 3rd quarter of 2019. This report, available on the Gov.ie website, shows that, by 2019, 55 of the 59 actions under the Strategy had already been initiated (47) or were planned for initiation (9). Since then further progress has been made in implementing the Strategy. </p>  <p>  Goal 1 of the LGBTI+ strategy seeks to ensure that LGBTI+ young people are safe, supported and included in all the environments and contexts in which they live their lives including formal education, employment, cultural representation, and welfare services. Goal 1 is comprised of 10 objectives and 38 actions. The actions are led by 17 Departments, Agencies and NGOs.  The report showed that 36 of the 38 actions under Goal 1 had either been initiated (30) or a plan was in place for their initiation (6). </p>  <p>  Goal 2 of the Strategy is to improve the physical, mental and sexual health of LGBTI+ young people, by identifying, tailoring and implementing health services and initiatives that support the health and wellbeing of LGBTI+ young people. This Goal is comprised of 4 objectives and 14 actions. The 4 objectives and 14 actions are led by the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive (HSE). The Implementation Report showed that thirteen of the 14 actions under Goal 2 were either initiated (11) or planned (2). </p>  <p>  Goal 3 is to develop the research and data environment in order to better understand the lives of LGBTI+ young people and to make their experiences visible is progressing. This is achieved by including relevant research and evaluation metrics in programme and intervention design, collecting evidence and measuring the impact of these initiatives on young people&rsquo;s lives. Objectives achieved include the further development and digitisation of the Irish Queer Archive, understanding the research and data gaps with regard to LGBTI+ young people, piloting questions related to sexual orientation and gender identity for a Household Survey in 2018/2019, and considerations of how language about gender identity and sexual orientation is used. This goal continues to be advanced during 2020 with research actions in train.</p>  <p>  At the beginning of this year the Secretary General of DCYA issued reminders to all Departments and other bodies of their obligations in relation to implementation of the LGBTI+NYS. </p>  <p>  Governance and implementation oversight of LGBTI+NYS sits within the comprehensive Framework for the implementation of BOBF, as one of its constituent strategies. Implementation of the LGBTI+NYS is additionally supported by the LGBTI+ Youth Forum, which involves young people in implementing the strategy, an annual implementation forum and the appointment of Olivia McEvoy to the BOBF Advisory Council specifically to represent LGBTI+NYS. </p>  <p>  Most recently, the implementation of the LGBTI+ NYS is also supported by its partner strategy from the Department of Justice and Equality (DJE), the National LGBTI+ Inclusion Strategy 2019-2021 published in November 2019. DCYA are collaborating with DJE on implementing shared actions from both strategies.</p>  <p>  The next phase of reporting will take place in due course.</p></reply>

This will be underpinned by the Government's Return to Work Safely Protocol, expert advice, available evidence and consultation with ELC and SAC stakeholder representatives and providers themselves. To support this work, I have convened and chair an Advisory Group, that comprises eight organisations representing the ELC and SAC sector, one representing the childminding sector and a trade union representative. Intensive engagement with this Group has been underway for several weeks now.</p>  <p>  On 29 May I received Government support for the initial plans for re-opening ELC and SAC services under Phase 3 (29 June). The plan for re-opening is guided by the detailed public health guidance specific to ELC and SAC services received from the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) and noted by NPHET. </p>  <p>  The phased reopening will seek to meet the needs of the increasing range of parents and guardians who are returning to work, and prioritise the needs of vulnerable children who need ELC and SAC on child welfare grounds. </p>  <p>  It is intended that from 29 June, ELC and SAC services will be accessible by:</p>  <p>  -  Children of health and social care workers, other frontline workers,  early ELC and SAC practitioners themselves, and parents who need access to  ELC and SAC in order to return to work. In the first instance, places will be available to families from these categories who previously used the  ELC and SAC services.</p>  <p>  -  Vulnerable children, including children sponsored under the National Childcare Scheme (for example, children in the protection process and children whose families are homeless) along with children funded through legacy  ELC and SAC funding schemes who are experiencing poverty, disadvantage or child welfare issues.</p>  <p>  -  Children with disabilities, including those preparing to start school in September.</p>  <p>  -  Other children previously registered in  ELC and SAC services on March 12, whose parents continue to need  ELC and SAC and who were assured that they would retain their place through conditions attached to the DCYA Temporary Wage Subsidy Childcare Scheme. </p>  <p>  -  Subject to local availability of places, children who did not previously use  early ELC and SAC services and whose parents are now seeking a place.</p>  <p>  In the context of  ELC and SAC, social distancing will only be relevant to distancing between adults when they are not engaged in  ELC and SAC activity (for example when on breaks and arriving for work). No masks will be worn in the service by adults (when working with children) or children themselves.  This is based on advice from the public health advice. </p>  <p>  When services reopen on 29 June, children will play together in set groups of children and adults in &lsquo;play pods&rsquo;.  The intention is that the same staff and children stay together each day, through the day, as far as possible. The purpose of &lsquo;play-pods&rsquo; is to limit the number of people a child has contact with, to facilitate tracing, and to support close, positive interactions between children and their adult caregivers, like in a key-worker system. he play pod model recognises that physical distancing is not possible with young children, nor may it be in their best interests. This system will also reduce the amount of contact adults have with each other. Children are returning to their service having been with their parent(s)/guardian(s) for several months, and the &lsquo;play-pod&rsquo; aims to develop a team-like spirit between the children where they help each other while playing and learning together.</p>  <p>  In terms of funding for the ELC and SAC sector, I have already put in place a number of supports to assist ELC and SAC providers in this time. The Temporary Wage Subsidy Childcare Scheme (TWSCS), launched by my Department on 15 April, builds on the wider provisions by Government and also recognises the unique place and importance of the ELC and SAC sector. It provides funds for staffing and overhead costs, while ensuring that parents are not charged fees for the duration of the scheme. </p>  <p>  As part of pre-existing sustainability funding, financial supports are available for community services presenting with sustainability issues following a financial assessment by Pobal.  My Department has begun to consider whether this sustainability funding can be extended to private services during the pandemic.</p>  <p>  These sector-specific supports are complemented by the range of supports across Government, many of which can also be availed of by ELC and SAC providers. This includes grants and loans for small businesses, advice and support from Local Enterprise Offices, the cancellation of commercial rates for a period, and a re-opening grant for small and medium enterprises. Further information on these supports is available from the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation. </p>  <p>  There remain a number of key decisions to be made across Government that will impact significantly on the ELC and SAC sector, including the future of emergency measures such as the Revenue operated Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection operated Pandemic Unemployment Payment, and other business supports. The proposals for re-opening ELC and SAC services necessarily interact with these schemes and so I will be relying on whole of Government plans, which impact the ELC and SAC sector. Detailed planning and costing of proposals is ongoing to provide a sustainable and viable funding model which can be applied for the initial phase of reopening of ELC and SAC service, through to operating at full capacity. This funding model is subject to agreement with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. </p>  <p>  I am very conscious of the importance of ELC and SAC for children&rsquo;s positive development and in terms of supporting the economy as we move beyond this crisis. I am minded always of these principles in the planning being done across Government, led by my Department, for the safe and sustainable re-opening of ELC and SAC services.</p></reply>

The re-opening of Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare (ELC and SAC) services will be guided by this framework and will be underpinned by the Return to Work Safely Protocol, expert advice, available evidence and consultation with ELC and SAC stakeholder representatives. </p>  <p>  The Roadmap proposes that the reopening of cr&egrave;ches, childminders and preschools in a phased manner will begin in Phase 3, which is currently scheduled to begin on 29 June. Last Friday, 29 May, I announced which children would be eligible to resume full or part-time childcare services from 29 June. Whilst initially the Government Roadmap had indicated that services would resume only for the children of essential workers, this has now been widened. </p>  <p>  Subject to local capacity, from 29 June services are encouraged to support: </p>  <p>  -  children of health and social care workers, other frontline workers, childcare practitioners and parents who need access to childcare in order to return to work;</p>  <p>  -  vulnerable children sponsored under the National Childcare Scheme (NCS) (for example, children who are homeless and Tusla referrals) and children funded through legacy childcare schemes who are experiencing poverty, disadvantage or child welfare issues;</p>  <p>  -  children with disabilities who previously attended part or full-time early learning and care, including those preparing to start school in September; and</p>  <p>  -  children previously registered in childcare services on March 12, whose parents continue to need childcare for employment or training purposes and who were assured that they would retain their place through conditions attached to my Department&rsquo;s Temporary Wage Subsidy Childcare Scheme (TWSCS).  </p>  <p>  Whilst demand for services may be lower than it was in March, some working parents who were using childcare services before the closures on March 12 will be reassured to know that they may now have the option to return to the service.  </p>  <p>  In the best interests of the child and parents, children should, as far as possible, be enabled to return to the childcare service they attended Pre-Covid19.  Given the changed model of interaction and the time lapse since the child last attended, it is important that further unfamiliar elements are not introduced to the child at this point.</p>  <p>  If local capacity issues emerge, services will be asked to give priority to the children of essential or frontline workers.</p>  <p>  As per HSE guidance and in accordance with the regulations under the Health (Preservation and Protection and Other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Act 2000, childminders who care for the children of essential workers in the children's home were permitted to continue working after childcare facilities were closed on 12 March, and are themselves considered essential workers. Childminders will also be able to resume looking after children in the childminder&rsquo;s home from 29 June.</p></reply>

When a Commission submits its final report there are a number of procedural matters which must be addressed before the relevant Minister would be in a position to seek the approval of Government to publish the report. For this reason there will always be an interval between receipt of such reports and arrangements for their publication. </p>  <p>  Today, Judge Murphy has submitted a communication to me with an update in relation to the Commission's progress. I will need to consider this communication and engage with my Cabinet colleagues as appropriate. </p>  <p>  On the second part of your question, the Commission has previously requested the Government to extend the timeframe for delivery of its final report on three separate occasions. In agreeing to these extensions the Government&rsquo;s priority has been to facilitate the independent Commission to address the crucial questions and conclude its investigations as expeditiously as possible in accordance with the legislative framework. </p>  <p>  I know that many former residents and their families have been disappointed and frustrated by the time taken to complete this sensitive work even though they recognise the complexity of the task. I have publicly expressed my support and understanding of their views in this regard. When considering the timeframe involved it is essential to acknowledge the significant scale of the task.  It is not a singular task. The investigation includes multiple lines of inquiry examining the operation of quite different institutions over a period of more than three quarters of a century. In its work the Commission has engaged with hundreds of former residents and sought to comprehensively collate and analyse information at a level beyond what was ever possible before.</p>  <p>  In this way the Commission&rsquo;s work provides a unique opportunity to significantly enhance our national understanding of the difficult experiences endured by mothers and children in these institutions.  I share the wish of all interested parties to see the Commission conclude its work as quickly as possible.</p></reply>

The re-opening of Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare (ELC and SAC) services will be guided by this framework and will be underpinned by the Government's Return to Work Safely Protocol, expert advice, available evidence and consultation with ELC and SAC stakeholder representatives and providers themselves. </p>  <p>  Last Friday, 29 May, I announced a number of developments to assist childcare providers and parents plan for the reopening of services on June 29 as part of Phase 3 of the Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business.</p>  <p>  Expert guidance written specifically for the childcare sector has been provided by the HSE Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC). </p>  <p>  The guidance focuses on use of a &ldquo;play pod&rdquo; model. The &ldquo;play pod&rdquo; model restricts interactions between closed groups of children and adults as an alternative to social distancing, which is not possible with young children. Play pods should not overlap but a large room may contain more than one play-pod provided there are partitions that prevent physical contact between the play-pods and provided the layout complies with the Early Years Regulations and with fire safety requirements.</p>  <p>  The purpose of &lsquo;play-pods&rsquo; is to limit the number of people a child has contact with, to facilitate tracing, and to support close, positive interactions between children and their adult caregivers, like in a key-worker system. This system will also reduce the amount of contact adults have with each other.</p>  <p>  The HPSC recommendation on use of play-pods is public health guidance for infection prevention and control during the COVID-19 pandemic. The HPSC guidance notes that separation of children into separate play-pods may not be relevant in small settings, where the children would in effect form one play-pod.</p>  <p>  The regulatory adult-child ratios will remain unchanged and so services should continue to operate within them. Where possible, there should be two adults in a &lsquo;play-pod&rsquo;, to reduce the need for floating/relief staff. The HPSC guidance notes that floating staff members who provide relief during breaks will be essential but this should be limited as much as possible. </p>  <p>  Services are now being asked to apply the guidance to their setting and determine what capacity they may offer. It is expected that a significant amount of capacity will be available in individual services that reopen in the summer, subject to, for example, their space, room layout and staffing availability.  Whilst there are 4,500 Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare services in the country, fewer than 2,000 of these normally remain open in July and August.</p></reply>

This will be underpinned by the Government's Return to Work Safely Protocol, expert advice, available evidence and consultation with ELC and SAC stakeholder representatives and providers themselves. To support this work, I have convened and chair an Advisory Group, that comprises eight organisations representing the ELC and SAC sector, one representing the childminding sector and a trade union representative. Intensive engagement with this Group has been underway for several weeks now.</p>  <p>  On 29 May I received Government support for the initial plans for re-opening ELC and SAC services under Phase 3 (29 June). The plan for re-opening is guided by the detailed public health guidance specific to ELC and SAC services received from the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) and noted by NPHET. </p>  <p>  The phased reopening will seek to meet the needs of the increasing range of parents and guardians who are returning to work, and prioritise the needs of vulnerable children who need ELC and SAC on child welfare grounds. </p>  <p>  It is intended that from 29 June, ELC and SAC services will be accessible by:</p>  <p>  -  Children of health and social care workers, other frontline workers,  early ELC and SAC practitioners themselves, and parents who need access to  ELC and SAC in order to return to work. In the first instance, places will be available to families from these categories who previously used the  ELC and SAC services.</p>  <p>  -  Vulnerable children, including children sponsored under the National Childcare Scheme (for example, children in the protection process and children who are homeless) along with children funded through legacy  ELC and SAC funding schemes who are experiencing poverty, disadvantage or child welfare issues.</p>  <p>  -  Children with disabilities, including those preparing to start school in September.</p>  <p>  -  Other children previously registered in  ELC and SAC services on March 12, whose parents continue to need  ELC and SAC and who were assured that they would retain their place through conditions attached to the DCYA Temporary Wage Subsidy Childcare Scheme. </p>  <p>  -  Subject to local availability of places, children who did not previously use  early ELC and SAC services and whose parents are now seeking a place.</p>  <p>  When services reopen on 29 June, children will play together in set groups of children and adults in &lsquo;play pods&rsquo;.  The intention is that the same staff and children stay together each day, through the day, as far as possible. The purpose of &lsquo;play-pods&rsquo; is to limit the number of people a child has contact with, to facilitate tracing, and to support close, positive interactions between children and their adult caregivers, like in a key-worker system. he play pod model recognises that physical distancing is not possible with young children, nor may it be in their best interests. This system will also reduce the amount of contact adults have with each other. </p>  <p>  In the best interests of children and parents, children should, as far as possible, be enabled to return to the childcare service they attended pre-COVID-19. Given the changed model of interaction and the time lapse since children last attended, it is important that there is as much continuity as possible for children. In light of the necessary changes, parents may also feel more reassured by placing their children in the care of childcare practitioners with whom they already have a relationship. Familiarity with other children attending the service and their parents may also help with the settling-in phase. </p>  <p>  Officials in my Department are undertaking primary research which is currently being rolled out in order to help us forecast supply of, and demand for ELC and SAC places from 29 June and beyond.  I will update the Deputy when these data have been returned from ELC and SAC providers and analysed. To begin with however, it is worth noting that in a normal year, just 40% of all ELC and SAC operate over the entire summer (approximately 1800 of the existing 4500 services).</p>  <p>  In terms of funding for the ELC and SAC sector, I have already put in place a number of supports to assist ELC and SAC providers in this time. The Temporary Wage Subsidy Childcare Scheme (TWSCS), launched by my Department on 15 April, builds on the wider provisions by Government and also recognises the unique place and importance of the ELC and SAC sector. It provides funds for staffing and overhead costs, while ensuring that parents are not charged fees for the duration of the scheme. </p>  <p>  As part of pre-existing sustainability funding, financial supports are available for community services presenting with sustainability issues following a financial assessment by Pobal.  My Department has begun to consider whether this sustainability funding can be extended to private services during the pandemic.</p>  <p>  These sector-specific supports are complemented by the range of supports across Government, many of which can also be availed of by ELC and SAC providers. This includes grants and loans for small businesses, advice and support from Local Enterprise Offices, the cancellation of commercial rates for a period, and a re-opening grant for small and medium enterprises. Further information on these supports is available from the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation. </p>  <p>  There remain a number of key decisions to be made across Government that will impact significantly on the ELC and SAC sector, including the future of emergency measures such as the Revenue operated Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection operated Pandemic Unemployment Payment, and other business supports. The proposals for re-opening ELC and SAC services necessarily interact with these schemes and so I will be relying on whole of Government plans, which impact the ELC and SAC sector. Detailed planning and costing of proposals is ongoing to provide a sustainable and viable funding model which can be applied for the initial phase of reopening of ELC and SAC service, through to operating at full capacity. This funding model is subject to agreement with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. </p>  <p>  I am very conscious of the importance of ELC and SAC for children&rsquo;s positive development and in terms of supporting the economy as we move beyond this crisis. I am minded always of these principles in the planning being done across Government, led by my Department, for the safe and sustainable re-opening of ELC and SAC services.  </p></reply>

The re-opening of Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare (ELC and SAC) services will be guided by this framework and will be underpinned by the Government's Return to Work Safely Protocol, expert advice, available evidence and consultation with ELC and SAC stakeholder representatives and providers themselves. </p>  <p>  The future stages of the Roadmap's re-opening of ELC/SAC services are stated as follows: </p>  <p>  Phase 3 (29 June), opening of cr&egrave;ches, childminders and preschools for children of essential workers in a phased manner with social distancing and other requirements applying. </p>  <p>  Phase 4 (20 July), opening of cr&egrave;ches, childminders and preschools for children of all other workers on a gradually increasing phased basis and slowly increasing thereafter. </p>  <p>  The sector has many questions regarding how the Roadmap will be implemented to enable services to re-open. While the COVID-19 emergency called for overnight action on closures, it is my ambition that the phased re-opening will enable sufficient time and planning to re-open in an orderly, safe and sustainable manner. I would like to reassure providers, practitioners, parents and children that I will be doing my utmost to support the sector in offering as smooth a transition as possible to the phased and restricted re-opening of ELC and SAC services.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently working with the sector to answer the many questions that exist. This is complex work and must balance a number of important issues, including those mentioned by the Deputy around capacity. Informed by NPHET and public health guidance, consideration is being given to a range of these issues, including:</p>  <p>  -  Minimising the public health risk, especially given the difficulty of maintaining social distancing among young children and those caring for them, </p>  <p>  -  Ensuring the need for any restrictions to be consistent with young children&rsquo;s well-being and development needs and for ELC and SAC provision at each phase to be child-centred.</p>  <p>  -  Providing ELC for pre-school children, meeting parental demand for ELC and SAC as the economy reopens, and meeting the commitment to retain places for families who paid for ELC and SAC before COVID-19, all while restricting capacity and thereby reducing adult-child ratios. </p>  <p>  -  Ensuring financial sustainability of the sector when capacity restrictions limit income and parents cannot afford to cover any higher costs with      higher fees.</p>  <p>  -  Ensuring a sufficient number of qualified ELC and SAC practitioners, given likelihood of reduced adult-child ratios and existing challenges with recruitment and retention.</p>  <p>  A further key factor is that, in the best interests of children and parents, children should, as far as possible, be enabled to return to the childcare service they attended pre-COVID-19. Given the changed model of interaction and the time lapse since children last attended, it is important that there is as much continuity as possible for children. In light of the necessary changes, parents may also feel more reassured by placing their children in the care of childcare practitioners with whom they already have a relationship. Familiarity with other children attending the service and their parents may also help with the settling-in phase. </p>  <p>  I am actively engaging with key stakeholders in the sector to make sure that the work on re-opening services is informed by the practical reality across the country. I have established and Chair an Advisory Group that includes representatives chosen by the sector, specifically the Association of Childhood Professionals, Community Forum, Early Childhood Ireland, National Childhood Network, PL&Eacute; and Seas Suas. The group also includes Tusla, Pobal, SIPTU and Childminding Ireland. The first meeting of this Advisory Group took place on 13 May and I held follow up meetings on 15 and 19 May. A schedule of weekly meetings has also been agreed.</p>  <p>  The proposals for re-opening which are in development will have due regard to Public Health guidance over the phases of easing of restrictions.  I am conscious that the proposed timelines are subject to further NPHET advice, and decisions from Government. </p>  <p>  Identifying essential workers, who will be eligible for childcare as part of this reopening, is part of the wider Government effort to ensure that society and business are re-opened in a carefully managed and safe manner.</p>  <p>  There are a number of key decisions to be made across Government that will impact significantly on the ELC and SAC sector, including the future of emergency measures such as the Revenue operated Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection operated Pandemic Unemployment Payment, and other business supports. The proposals for re-opening ELC and SAC services necessarily interact with these schemes and so I will be relying on whole of Government plans, which impact the ELC and SAC sector. </p>  <p>  It is my fervent hope that every early education and childcare service  around the country is currently considering how it can be part of helping Ireland get back to work, and how it can support children from June 29th in the very difficult circumstances they have experienced in recent months.  </p>  <p>  I will undertake to update the Deputy as soon as the work on re-opening services is at a more advanced stage.</p></reply>

It is expected that a significant amount of capacity will be available in individual services that reopen in the summer, subject to, for example, their space, room layout and staffing availability.  Whilst there are 4,500 Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare services in the country, fewer than 2,000 of these normally remain open in July and August.</p>  <p>  I have been engaging intensively with a number of organisations representing the childcare sector, through an Advisory Group. A range of additional guidance and resources to assist the sector to prepare for reopening are currently being prepared and will start to issue in the coming days and continue over the remaining weeks before opening.</p>  <p>  Since 2015 my Department has administered an annual capital funding programme, under which service providers registered with Tusla are invited to apply for capital funding to increase the capacity of their services,  or to maintain and improve their services.</p>  <p>  In 2020 I secured &euro;7.2m in capital funding for early learning and care (ELC)  and school age care (SAC).  I launched the application programme for the 2020 Capital Programme on 28 February but this had to be suspended due to the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  I am currently reviewing the allocation of the 2020 capital budget and I intend to launch a new capital grant programme in the coming days.  In doing so, I am conscious that demand for childcare services after COVID may be reduced, at least initially. I believe the best use of capital funding in 2020 will be made through supporting services and places already in existence, to reopen after the closure period, and to support them meet the new HPSC guidance. </p>  <p>  The application process for the 2020 Capital programme, which will be administered by Pobal, will go live shortly.</p></reply>

The scheme enables employees, whose employers are affected by the pandemic, to receive significant supports directly from their employer through the payroll system.  </p>  <p>  My Department's Temporary Wage Subsidy Childcare Scheme (TWSCS) was developed to sustain the early learning and care (ELC) and school age care (SAC) sector and is layered on top of the wider Revenue operated TWSS. The scheme was introduced for a temporary period only, until mid June. The scheme has received a very positive response from the sector with over 84% of services signing up to it.</p>  <p>  Any decision with regard to the extension of the DCYA temporary wage subsidy childcare scheme is dependent on the future of the Revenue scheme, which is currently under review by Government. I am also in the process of developing a new funding model for the reopening of childcare services on June 29th. I am conscious that approximately 2000 childcare services operate every summer and I am working with their representatives to support them in their plans for reopening. </p>  <p>  I will be happy to update the Deputy in the coming weeks as the new funding model is finalised.</p></reply>

The sector itself chose its representatives, which includes representatives from the Association of Childhood Professionals, Seas Suas, PL&Eacute;, the National Children's Network, the National Community Forum and Early Childhood Ireland. Childminding Ireland, SIPTU, Pobal and Tusla also sit on the group.  </p>  <p>  The Advisory Group which I chair had its first meeting on 13 May, and has had a total of four meetings to date.  A Communications Sub-Group and a Practice Sub Group, both of which include most of the sectoral representatives, have been established and meet regularly. </p>  <p>  A number of additional provider representative groups have contacted my Department seeking to be added to the membership of the Advisory Group. In response to such requests, I have established a Reference Group, to supplement the work of the Advisory Group. I chaired the first meeting of this group on 28 May.</p>  <p>  The Advisory Group has provided expert advice  which continues to be of great assistance in helping us to finalise plans for the reopening of the early learning and care and school age care sector.   I am satisfied that significant progress is being made and the publication of the HPSC guidance last week, together with details on who can access childcare from June 29, represent an important early milestone. In the coming days, I hope to publish a suite of resources for providers to assist them in planning for reopening. I will also be publishing information for parents who are considering returning to the use of childcare services.</p></reply>

At this meeting I communicated my intention to continue funding for youth organisations in Ireland throughout this crisis period.  I highlighted in particular how this funding would allow the continuation of targeted youth support to marginalised, disadvantaged and vulnerable young people.</p>  <p>  In the present difficult circumstances, I have made my position clear that the funding provided to youth services across the country is both necessary and essential.  Funding to services, for youth clubs and to national youth organisations has been maintained. I secured &euro;61.79 million in current funding for my Department's youth funding, an increase of &euro;1.4 million on 2019. </p>  <p>  My officials have been in regular contact with national youth organisation and the Education and Training Boards to monitor the situation affecting youth services funded by my Department.  I applaud the many services that are delivering essential work in their communities and that have innovated and adapted to find new and different ways of engaging young persons.</p>  <p>  Some organisations now find themselves in financial difficulty due to the ongoing crisis. My colleague the Minister for Rural and Community Development put in place a scheme using Dormant Accounts funding.  This comprises &euro;35 million for a Covid-19 Stability Fund and &euro;5 million as a commitment to a Philanthropy Fund, &lsquo;Innovate Together&rsquo;, to focus on projects that provide innovative and adaptive solutions to existing and emerging challenges.  </p>  <p>  Finally, officials from my Department have been working with representatives from funded youth organisations to develop sector specific guidance consistent with the roadmap for the re-opening of services and companies that was published by the Government recently. </p></reply>

My Department is currently reviewing the information and issuing  Funding Agreements to the relevant Local Authorities so that the works can commence on the roads in question.</p>  <p>  Given the constraints imposed by COVID-19, the process of determining the roads to be funded is still underway in a number of other Local Authority areas.  However, I understand that process will be concluded in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

It is supporting the following initiatives which could provide  opportunities to deliver social distanced outdoor activities to benefit, young people and individuals of all ages:</p><p>The 2020 CL&Aacute;R programme was launched on 25 May 2020 and includes a new Community Recreation Areas measure in response to the impact of COVID-19 on communities across Ireland. This Measure will support a variety of capital interventions provided that they contribute to the enhancement of existing, and/or the development of new, accessible Community Recreation areas where people can socialise outdoors in safe community spaces. This measure will include support for items such as picnic benches/tables, outdoor covered seating or BBQ areas, Car and bike parking, bandstand/stage areas, etc. </p><p>Community groups may apply through their Local Authority and in turn the Local Authority will select the projects to be submitted to the Department. More information on the CL&Aacute;R programme is available on the Gov.ie website. The closing date for applications is 28 August 2020.</p><p>The Town and Village Renewal Scheme was launched on 27 May 2020 with an Accelerated Measure to Respond to COVID-19, focusing on immediate interventions that can be delivered in the short-term to assist towns and villages to adapt to COVID-19. It will be administered by Local Authorities who will have the autonomy to identify and develop their own solutions in consultation with local business interests, Town Teams, and community groups as appropriate. The projects funded can be delivered directly by the Local Authority or by a community/business organisation. It is expected that the projects will involve expenditure on supplies and services of a capital nature and can include items such as capital expenditure associated with festivals or smaller-scale events which can be enjoyed by all age groups in the community later in the year when public health guidelines allow.</p><p>Funding may be also be available through the existing LEADER Programme for the type of project activity referred to by the Deputy. In order for a project to be eligible for LEADER funding, it must be compatible with the actions outlined in the approved Local Development Strategy for the relevant LEADER area, and it must comply with the Operating Rules and EU Regulations in place for the programme. </p><p>The decision to approve a project, or otherwise, is a matter for the Local Action Group (LAG) which administers the programme in each LEADER area. Interested applicants should, in the first instance, contact the relevant LAG through its Implementing Partners to discuss the funding that may be available.</p><p>The list of Local Action Groups, their Implementing Partners and their contact details is available on the National Rural Network website at the following link: </p><p>While recognising that the social recovery of Ireland post COVID-19 will require a whole of Government approach, my Department will continue to work with relevant stakeholders, including Local Authorities and Local Development Companies, to determine how best this can be achieved. </p></reply>

Section 11A of the Act provides that, where an employee believes the employer to be in breach of sections 9 or 10, they may pursue a complaint to the Workplace Relations Commission.  The Workplace Relations Commission&rsquo;s Customer Service Section provides information in relation to the rights and obligations of employees and employers respectively under employment rights legislation.  It is also an offence under section 11 of the Act where an employer fails to comply with sections 9 or 10.</p>  <p>  There is also an obligation under section 12 that makes it mandatory on employers proposing a collective redundancy to notify the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection of the proposed collective redundancy and to provide certain pieces of information to me.</p>  <p>  An employer is prohibited from issuing any notice of redundancy during the mandatory employee information and consultation period and until 30 days have elapsed from the date on which the Minister has been notified.  For the avoidance of doubt, the 30 day mandatory information and consultation process and the aforementioned 30 day period from the date of notification to the Minister may run concurrently.</p>  <p>  While I, as Minister, and the Government have no power or authority to step in and alter the course of a company&rsquo;s business plan or to dictate the progress or outcome of the mandatory consultations between the employer and employee representatives, there are industrial relations and employment rights supports available through the WRC and Labour Court mechanisms, where necessary. </p>  <p>  Financial supports are available through the Revenue Commissioner&rsquo;s Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme as well as the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection&rsquo;s wide range of social welfare schemes.  </p>  <p>  My Department has been at the centre of the response to the consequences of Covid-19 and will no doubt continue to be called upon in the weeks and months ahead.  While I hope for a very positive outcome to the Aer Lingus renegotiations, you can rest assured that the Department is available through its Intreo service to assist Aer Lingus workers in whatever way we can in terms of income supports and job-seeking if that proves to be necessary. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

Under Section 19 of the Act, an employee acquires an entitlement to 4 weeks&rsquo; annual leave if he or she works at least 1,365 hours in a leave year, or one-third of a working week for each month in the leave year in which he or she works at least 117 hours, or 8 per cent of the hours he or she works in a leave year (but subject to a maximum of 4 working weeks). </p>  <p>  The Act also provides for 9 public holidays in addition to the statutory annual leave entitlements. </p>  <p>  Any annual leave entitlements in the contract of employment over and above the statutory minimum will be a matter for negotiation between the employer and employee. </p>  <p>  Any plans to increase the current statutory entitlement, which is a minimum level of leave above which employers and employees are free to agree better terms, would have to be considered in the overall policy context. </p>  <p>  In general, an employee has no entitlement under employment law to be paid while on sick leave. Consequently, it is at the discretion of an employer to decide their own policy on sick pay and sick leave, subject to the employee&rsquo;s contract or terms of employment. </p>  <p>  It is worth my pointing out, for information, that the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) provides general information on employment, equality and industrial relations legislation, through the Workplace Relations Information and Customer Service Unit which can be contacted at Lo-call: 1890 80 80 90 or 059-9178990 or via its website www.workplacerelations.ie.  </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies matters for the Deputy. </p></reply>

Domestic, Sexual and Gender Based Violence Services, and in particular, Domestic Violence refuges have been identified as one of Tusla&rsquo;s three highest priority services in its crisis management responses to the period of Covid-19 public health measures.  A range of supports have been put in place to assure continuity of essential services and there is ongoing systematic engagement between Tusla and service provider organisations around emerging needs.</p>  <p>  Since the introduction of HAP, Rent Supplement continues to revert to original role of providing short-term support to those who have become temporarily unemployed and require income support to meet their tenancy cost whilst they seek alternative employment.  Rent supplement, by virtue of its short-term nature and its targeted customer cohort, is not considered the principal solution in meeting the accommodation needs of those fleeing domestic or sexual violence, in particular where, following a Housing Needs Assessment, HAP is an available option. </p>  <p>  There are no indications within my department that the rent supplement scheme is operating in a way that is preventing victims of domestic violence from getting the support they need, and Community Welfare Officers are using the full flexibility of the scheme to assist those in need during the current crisis.</p>  <p>  As I have already indicated, I support the call for additional supports to be made available to victims of domestic violence during the current pandemic.  Officials from my Department are engaging with SAFE Ireland representatives to explore their outline proposal to ensure that appropriate supports are provided to victims of domestic violence to access appropriate accommodation during the current COVID-19 pandemic.  Two constructive meetings have been held to date, with the most recent on 29 May 2020. As part of these discussions, officials in my Department are working with SAFE Ireland with a view of providing a formal framework, which will include input for other State actors, providing guidance on the use of rent supplement to this vulnerable group.  I assure the Deputy that the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme will continue its key role, alongside the various State agencies, supporting victims of domestic violence.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputies.</p></reply>

Recouping monies through our control measures ensures that all of our available resources are targeted to those with a genuine need. </p>  <p>  Control and compliance checks are an integral part of the day-to-day operations of the Department.  All members of staff involved in the administration of social welfare schemes are acutely aware of the need to implement appropriate eligibility checks at every stage of the lifecycle process of a claim. </p>  <p>  Overall, there are in the region of 900 staff members in my Department - out of approx. 6,000 - whose main responsibilities are related to control and compliance work.  This includes some 260 social welfare inspectors who are statutorily appointed to investigate and report on claims for benefit/assistance and to carry out employer inspections.  In addition, there are 112 trained investigators in the Department's Special Investigations Unit (SIU), which includes 21 members of An Garda Sioch&aacute;na who are seconded to the Unit.  </p>  <p>  The exclusive function of the SIU is to investigate and report on fraud and abuse of social welfare schemes.  Officers in the Unit carry out a broad range of liaison, enforcement, investigative and intelligence gathering duties and operate at the high or more organised end of social welfare fraud and abuse.  In carrying out a wide range of control activities and projects, the Unit works closely with staff from a number of other compliance and enforcement agencies such as Revenue, the National Employment Rights Authority and the Garda&iacute;.  </p>  <p>  Additionally, the Deputy should note that control work forms a central part of the work of all staff across the Department, including those who work in support roles such as systems development, IT, financial and corporate management, as well as front-line staff in Intreo Centres and centralised scheme areas.  Separately, 64 staff work in the central control area, including 22 staff members who are assigned to overpayment administration and recovery.  A further 16 staff deal with client identity services. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The programme is delivered through independent CE sponsoring bodies that receive state funding from the Department to cover the cost of CE employee remuneration. </p><p>Funding for CE supervisors is available until the person reaches the state pension age and they may remain on CE until the working day before they reach the state pension age as follows: </p><p>- 66 for those born before 1 January 1955; </p><p>- 67 for those born on or after 1 January 1955; and </p><p>- 68 for those born on or after 1 January 1961 </p><p>CE supervisors may apply for a State Pension on retirement from CE.  If they wish to continue to work beyond the state pension age they may apply for positions that are not state funded or, they can apply to the scheme to work in a voluntary capacity.</p><p>CE is a working age activation scheme and CE supervisors who continue to be funded through CE must be of working age.  As you will appreciate, if my Department continued to fund a CE supervisor that has reached the state pension age it would significantly impact on the opportunities for those people who are still of working age and also, would undermine the reputation of CE as an active labour market programme.</p><p>Officials from my Department are actively engaging with the CE sponsoring body in question to support the recruitment of a new CE supervisor. </p><p>I wish to acknowledge the valuable and dedicated service that CE sponsoring bodies provide in running CE schemes throughout the country.  CE supervisors, as employees of those organisations, are an integral part of that good work. </p></reply>

It, for the first time, acknowledged home caring periods prior to 1994.  Interim TCA provides for up to 20 years of home caring periods to be considered.  Those who have a 40 year record of paid and credited social insurance contributions, subject to a maximum of 20 years of credits/homecaring periods,  qualify for a maximum contributory pension where they satisfy the other qualifying conditions for the scheme. These arrangements benefit many people who are or who have been in receipt of Carer's Allowance, subject to them satisfying the other conditions regarding the State Pension (Contributory).         </p>  <p>  From April 2019, all new State (Contributory) Pension applications are assessed under all possible rate calculation methods, including the Interim TCA, with the most beneficial rate paid to the pensioner.</p>  <p>  It should be noted if a person does not satisfy those conditions, they may qualify for the means-tested State Pension (Non-Contributory), the maximum rate of which is over 95% that of the maximum rate of the State Pension (Contributory).  Alternatively, if their spouse is a State pensioner and they have significant household means, their most beneficial payment may be an Increase for a Qualified Adult, based on their personal means, and amounting up to 90% of a full contributory pension.</p>  <p>  The Total Contributions Approach (TCA), when it is introduced, is intended to be a fairer and more transparent system where the person&rsquo;s lifetime contribution will be more closely reflected in the benefit received.  Having carefully examined the outputs of the TCA consultation process, officials in the Department are designing the scheme, with a view to including significant recognition for home caring periods in the new model.  The final design of the TCA model will need to be brought to Government for consideration and approval in due course. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

This work can only begin when my Department has time and attention to focus on what will be a considerable task.</p>  <p>  While this is not ideal I can assure you that all cases will be examined and where arrears arise they will be processed and applicants will be notified.  Updates on the process will be available on www.gov.ie/deasp. </p>  <p>  If the person concerned is experiencing financial difficulties he can contact his local Community Welfare Service in the Bishop&rsquo;s Square Intreo Centre where his circumstances will be assessed.  Under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme, my Department can make a single Exceptional Needs Payment to help meet essential, once-off expenditure, which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income.  There is no automatic entitlement to these payments which are payable at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme, taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case, in order to ensure that the payments target those most in need of assistance.  The Community Welfare Service may be contacted by email at CWSBishopSquare@welfare.ie.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter.</p></reply>

As at the end of October 2019, with the project completed, 94,258 reviews have been finalised; of these, 53,092 (56%) are women and 41,166 (44%) are men.  Of the 53,092 women reviewed 28,528 (54%) received an increase while the rest remain on their existing rate.  Of the 41,166 men reviewed, 9,956 (24%) received an increase and the remainder continue to received their same rate of payment.  No pensioner had their pension payment reduced as part of this review.  </p>  <p>  From April 2019, all new State (Contributory) Pension applications are assessed under all possible rate calculation methods, including the Interim TCA, with the most beneficial rate paid to the pensioner.</p>  <p>  It should be noted if a person does not satisfy those conditions, they may qualify for the means-tested State Pension (Non-Contributory), the maximum rate of which is over 95% that of the maximum rate of the State Pension (Contributory).  Alternatively, if their spouse is a State pensioner and they have significant household means, their most beneficial payment may be an Increase for a Qualified Adult, based on their personal means, and amounting up to 90% of a full contributory pension.</p>  <p>  The Total Contributions Approach (TCA), when it is introduced, is intended to be a fairer and more transparent system where the person&rsquo;s lifetime contribution will be more closely reflected in the benefit received.  Having carefully examined the outputs of the TCA consultation process, officials in the Department are designing the scheme, with a view to including significant recognition for home caring periods in the new model.  The final design for the TCA model will need to be brought to Government for consideration and approval.  As eligibility under the scheme and associated costs are dependent on its design and parameters, it is not possible at this stage to estimate the numbers that may qualify and associated costs.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

These applications were processed as quickly as possible, with almost 59,000 people paid in the first week of the scheme, 283,000 people paid in the following week, and over 507,000 people in the third week of the scheme. To date, over 4.9 million payments have issued to just over 670,000 individuals at a cost of over &euro;1.7 Billion. </p>  <p>  Currently, the Department is focused on processing and managing payments to ensure that they continue to be made to all who qualify for them. The work involved in doing this is complex, with people joining and leaving the scheme each week, along with management of overlaps between the Covid-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment and the Revenue Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme. </p>  <p>  The Department is aware that many people are due some arrears and that each person&rsquo;s case is unique. This means that each person&rsquo;s application may need to be individually reviewed. This important work can only begin when the Department has time to focus on this considerable task. Accordingly, I am advised that the figures requested by the Deputies are not available at this time. </p>  <p>   It will take time to review all of the applications and assess for back payments. The Department is committed to reviewing cases as quickly as possible and work is underway to develop an IT based solution to support this important work. </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputies that all cases will be examined and where arrears arise they will be processed and claimants will be notified.  </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputies. </p></reply>

These have largely cushioned the income shock experienced by workers whose employers had to cease or scale back activities and have, importantly, helped buttress public support for the restrictive public health measures necessary to contain Covid-19.</p><p>The PUP payment of &euro;350 was introduced as an exceptional measure on a temporary basis and was set at a flat rate level of &euro;350 per week for a number of reasons:</p><p>- Administrative simplicity in order to ensure that the unprecedented number of applicants could be put into payment quickly (with certainty as to their future income stream);  </p><p>- The provision of a level of income support that would help insulate people against an income shock and, in so doing, to buttress support for the restrictive public health measures. </p><p>The rate of &euro;350 is broadly equivalent to the two-person household rate for the main social welfare payments and is also broadly equivalent to average take-home pay levels in the sectors most immediately affected by the restrictions (Hospitality and Retail). </p><p>As indicated by research from the ESRI and the CSO, this approach insulated the vast majority of people, and in particular lower paid workers, from a severe income shock.  Undoubtedly, this has been a major factor in securing and sustaining public, including business, support for the restrictive public health measures.

In line with most social assistance payments, deductions permitted for disability allowance include PRSI, union dues and superannuation (pension contributions).   </p>  <p>  The means-tested social assistance payments for which maintenance payments are assessed as means are jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance; disability allowance; farm assist; state pension non-contributory; supplementary welfare allowance; blind pension; one-parent family payment; pre-retirement allowance; and widow&rsquo;s, widower&rsquo;s or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s non-contributory pension.</p>  <p>  For these schemes, maintenance payments (including maintenance payments from a former spouse/partner or cohabitant) are assessed by first disregarding any housing costs incurred up to &euro;4,952 per annum (or &euro;95.23 per week), and then assessing the remainder at 50%. </p>  <p>  Accordingly, the total value of any maintenance payments is never assessed as means for these weekly income support payments and the total income received by the family (social welfare payment and maintenance payment combined) will be higher than someone not receiving maintenance payments. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that people receiving disability allowance may also be eligible for secondary benefits such as free travel, fuel allowance, the household benefits package, living alone allowance and the telephone support allowance.  Depending on their circumstance, recipients may also be entitled to rent supplement or housing assistance payment, to help meet housing expenses.  </p>  <p>  The Department also continues to implement a targeted case-by-case flexible payment policy approach &ndash; the National Tenancy Sustainment Framework - which allows for flexibility where landlords seek rents in excess of the rent limits.  Included within this Framework is the additional assistance required by persons with disabilities who require specially modified accommodation. </p>  <p>  Any changes to the means assessment for disability allowance would have to be considered in the overall policy and budgetary context. </p></reply>

These applications were processed as quickly as possible. To date, over 4.9 million payments have issued to just over 670,000 individuals at a cost of over &euro;1.7 Billion. </p>  <p>  Currently, the Department is focused on processing and managing payments to ensure that they continue to be made to all who qualify for them. The work involved in doing this is complex, with people joining and leaving the scheme each week, along with management of overlaps between the Covid-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment and the Revenue Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme. </p>  <p>  As with all schemes, there is a balance to be struck between &lsquo;ex ante&rsquo; checking of every claim in fine detail to absolutely verify its validity (a process which would be very time consuming and result in long payment delays) and &lsquo;ex post&rsquo; validation of claims.  The Department conducts both &lsquo;ex ante&rsquo; and &lsquo;ex post&rsquo; checks on all its schemes to prevent fraud and error from entering the social welfare system in the first instance and, where it does, to detect instances as quickly as possible.  </p>  <p>  Similar to other schemes, applications for the Pandemic Unemployment Payment are assessed in the first instance based on information provided by the claimant.  Where this information is incomplete or where it indicates that the person does not satisfy the eligibility conditions, the claim cannot be processed. In addition to a review of the information provided by the client, the Department has put in place a number of compliance checks to ensure that the payment of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment is only being made to those entitled to the income support. </p>  <p>  To qualify for the Pandemic Unemployment Payment, a person must have been in employment immediately prior to 13 March 2020, and be in a position to provide evidence confirming this when requested. Cases where an employer has failed to return PRSI contributions in respect of an employee will be investigated by the Department. Where any employer is found not to be operating the PRSI scheme correctly the Department will use all of its powers to recover any outstanding monies due to the exchequer. Payment of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment may be made in the interim once there is sufficient evidence to confirm that the employment took place.  </p>  <p>  If a person does not meet these requirements, they may be entitled to other supports under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme if they are experiencing financial hardship.</p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

It is individuals who claim PUP, not employers, and it is open to those employed as an employee or on a self-employed basis. </p>  <p>  The introduction of the PUP scheme was quickly followed by the establishment of the Covid-19 Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS), which is administered by the Revenue Commissioners. Application for payment under the TWSS is made by the employer and is paid to the employer.</p>  <p>  While suspected abuse of the TWSS is a matter for Revenue, my Department is responsible for ensuring that PUP claimants meet the eligibility conditions. Where any individual claimant is found not to have been entitled to a PUP payment, the Department will use all of its powers to recover any outstanding monies due. </p>  <p>  Additionally, it is expected that over the coming weeks and months the Department&rsquo;s engagements with employers in relation to the operation of the PRSI system will be in a position to increase as restrictions are eased. This includes the investigation of employment status issues, in particular the misclassification of employees as self-employed.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

These new planning reforms came into effect on 1 July 2019.   </p>  <p>  Where a person owns a property in a rent pressure zone which is not their principal private residence and intends to let it for short term letting purposes, s/he is required under the new arrangements to apply for a change of use planning permission unless the property already has a specific planning permission to be used for tourism or short-term letting purposes.</p>  <p>  However, home-sharing continues to be permissible for a person&rsquo;s primary residence. In addition, an annual cap of 90 days applies to the renting out on a short-term basis of a person's entire home where it is their primary residence, with such short-term lets restricted to periods of 14 days or less at a time.  Under these arrangements, people who wish to avail of the planning exemptions to use their own home for home-sharing or limited short-term letting purposes are required to register this with their local planning authority. These changes do not affect the operation of holiday homes as typically understood, or longer-term flexible lettings which are provided for those coming to Ireland under employment contracts. The purpose of the aforementioned changes to the planning code was primarily to address the longer term rental issues arising from the use of properties for short-term letting in designated rent pressure zones, which are areas of high housing demand. </p>  <p>  The broader regulation of tourism activity, including the possible development of a new regulatory or licensing/ registration system for commercial platforms and short-term letting agents - as recommended in the final Working Group report - is beyond the scope of the planning code and my remit. </p>  <p>   It will be a matter for the incoming Government to decide on any further actions it may wish to take in relation to the possible regulation of online platforms. </p>  <p>  As part of the immediate response to COVID-19, a number of properties formerly available as short-term lets were secured by local authorities to provide accommodation for households experiencing homelessness. The level of enquiries to local authorities indicates that there are a number of properties which have been previously rented as tourist accommodation.  Local authorities are engaging with property owners in relation to the use of such properties for longer-term social housing, including long-term leasing.  Given the number of households on the social housing waiting list, including the number of households in homeless emergency accommodation, it is important that as many of these properties as possible are converted from tourist accommodation to homes.  My Department is currently assessing the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic is having on the Short-Term Letting sector, and has asked the relevant local authorities to provide an update regarding same.</p></reply>

Local authorities are under a statutory obligation to levy rates on any property used for commercial purposes. </p>  <p>  In order to support the local government sector, my Department is continuing to keep local authority income, expenditure and cash flow generally under review and will work with all local authorities on both collective and individual issues arising.  In addition, my Department has engaged with the Departments of the Taoiseach, Public Expenditure and Reform, Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Employment Affairs and Social Protection, and Transport, Tourism and Sport in relation to commercial rates and local authority funding issues, as well as the role that local authorities may be in a position to play in supporting economic recovery. </p>  <p>  To that end, on 2 May 2020, the Government announced that a waiver of commercial rates will apply to all businesses that have been forced to close due to public health requirements, from 27 March 2020, for a three-month period. These costs, expected to be &euro;260m, will be met by the Exchequer.  The administration by local authorities of this measure will be by way of a credit in lieu of commercial rates.  My Department is currently preparing further guidance on the scope and application of the waiver for local authorities.   </p>  <p>  Government has also decided that the position following the end of the 3 month waiver will be reviewed at a later date, as part of a wider review of options to support enterprise and employment, and associated local authority funding implications, once the unwinding of public health restrictions has advanced. It is my intention, in the context of that review, that the waiver be extended for those businesses that are required to remain closed for a longer period. </p></reply>

The measures also prohibit any increases to rent for the duration of the emergency period.  Initially, these emergency laws will last for a period of 3 months, but they may be extended if the Government considers it necessary.  </p>  <p>  A notice of termination cannot be served for any reason during the COVID-19 emergency period, including where the landlord or his family wish to occupy the dwelling. All notices of termination which were served before the emergency period are suspended for duration of the emergency period. Accordingly, if on 27 March 2020, a tenant had 2 months left under a termination notice, he or she will still have 2 months left to run on that notice on the date of expiry of the emergency period.</p>  <p>  Section 8 of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 recognises that, prior to the emergency period, some tenants had been legally evicted including where a landlord or his or her family member intend to occupy the property but the tenants have nowhere to go during Covid-19 and remain in occupation in rental accommodation. Section 8 protects those tenants by allowing their continued occupation in the property subject to the same terms and conditions such as the obligation to pay rent, etc. However, an eviction can proceed in such circumstances if the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) determines a dispute in favour of the landlord to allow such a termination. Section 8 is an emergency measure to curtail the movement of people during the emergency period. </p>  <p>  Carrying out an illegal eviction, which includes prohibiting access to the property or making the property uninhabitable by disconnecting services, can result in damages of up to &euro;20,000 being awarded to the tenant. The RTB can seek an injunction from the Courts to reinstate the tenant and will continue to prioritise these cases during the emergency period.</p>  <p>  The RTB is encouraging all customers who may require assistance or advice, including in relation to any threatened eviction, to contact them via their web chat service as there may be delays to their phone lines during the emergency period.

This means that there is no designated competent authority, which has the power to approve or restrict access to the profession in Ireland under national or EU law. </p>  <p>  In early 2016, Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) published Awards Standards for Architectural Technology award. The Awards Standards are designed to be used by: </p>  <p>  (i) providers when designing new programmes and establishing minimum intended programme learning outcomes; </p>  <p>  (ii) awarding bodies when validating new programmes; and</p>  <p>  (iii) in the accreditation of programmes by the relevant professional bodies. They are also used by providers when reviewing their programmes.</p>  <p>  In general, the regulation of professions is in the first instance a matter for industry representatives working in consultation with relevant industry stakeholders.  My Department has been engaging with the Chartered Institute of Architectural Technologists (CIAT) in relation to the establishment of a statutory register. In this regard, CIAT has identified that its preferred route is to set up a stand alone register for Architectural Technologists. As such, it is now a matter for CIAT to set up a register on an administrative basis in keeping with registers already in place for other professional groupings under the Building Control Act 2007 and in consultation with the relevant industry stakeholders.  </p>  <p>  It is also worth noting that, depending on their personal background and experience, it may be open to persons who are Architectural Technologists, and who possess the requisite experience and competence in the design of buildings, to seek inclusion on either of the statutory registers in respect of Architects or Building Surveyors. A number of Architectural Technologists have already succeeded in gaining inclusion on the statutory registers to date and are thus in a position to act as Design Certifiers and Assigned Certifiers.</p></reply>

Local authorities are the employers of fire service personnel, and the Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) engages with appropriate staffing representative bodies in relation to overall terms of employment.  Fire services issues are managed in my Department through its National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management. </p>  <p>  My Department is not aware of the high churn of firefighters from the Fire Service described. Indeed in large urban areas where there is a full-time service, there remains a high level of interest in the Service, as indicated by the very high number of responses to recruitment campaigns, the most recent of which was held late last year in Dublin. I understand however, that the situation outside these areas, with full-time services, can vary. In this regard, local authorities and the LGMA continuously monitor the issue of recruitment and retention and work on developing strategies to address such issues, involving and briefing the NDFEM as appropriate. </p>  <p>  Work is ongoing in collating data from around the regions, however, provisional statistics would suggest that for the first quarter of 2020 the number of calls received nationally was similar to the previous 3-year rolling average. There is expected to be regional variations and some areas may have seen reductions in calls received. It is also likely that during the Covid-19 restrictions the number of calls will fall in line with public activity.</p></reply>

Fire authorities created under section 10 of the Fire Services Act, 1981 &amp;amp; 2003 are empowered under section 25 of that legislation to carry out or assist in any operation of an emergency nature.</p>  <p>  The National Ambulance Service may call on Community First Responders for assistance before its crews reach an incident and many fire services are equipped with automatic external defibrillators and the majority of fire services have trained their fire-fighters in Cardiac First Responder and Emergency First Responder to Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council standards for health and safety reasons. </p>  <p>  Therefore, fire services personnel in many fire stations are already trained and equipped to a standard that could enable them to respond to life threatening emergencies. Given the infrastructure of fire services around the country and particularly in rural locations, the Retained Fire Service is well placed to assist the HSE with responses to such life threatening emergency calls.</p>  <p>  As Minister with policy and legislative responsibility for fire safety and the provision of fire services by local authorities, a primary concern must remain, in accordance with the Fire Services Acts 1981 and 2003, that local authority provided fire services are meeting their statutory obligations in respect of their primary role in the provision of fire services and fire safety. These responsibilities include the important activity of community and other fire safety initiatives as well as response to emergency calls. </p>  <p>  Fire services generally respond to calls for assistance from external bodies in accordance with protocols operated within the three fire services Regional Communications Centres. </p>  <p>  The feasibility of fire services, outside the Dublin Fire Brigade area of operations, being commissioned by the HSE to provide a response service in support of the NAS in responding to life-threatening emergency calls was discussed at national level at the Fire Services National Oversight &amp;amp; Implementation Group, which consists of fire service management and staff representatives and it produced a discussion document as the basis to underpin discussions with the Health sector. The document was discussed at the Management Board of the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management in July 2018 where a number of issues including the transfer of risk and mechanisms for funding were raised that remain as items of discussion with the Department of Health.</p>  <p>  Any proposal for formalising this assistance would need to be subject to appropriate governance and cost reimbursement arrangements and to be set in the context of a service agreement with the HSE/National Ambulance Service which will not impact on or adversely affect fire services' primary roles. It is critical that local authority and fire services' resources are not inappropriately diverted from their statutory fire service and fire safety responsibilities. The potential impact on the current Community First Responders schemes would also have to be assessed.</p></reply>

It is important to point out however, that it did not find the fire service or any part thereof, as  unfit for purpose. </p><p>It did however, identify a number of areas where the fire service could be improved further. I have been informed, it was an important landmark in the development of fire services in Ireland and contributed towards a re-orientation and re-shaping of the fire service towards a more holistic approach with a greater emphasis on Community Fire Safety together with incident response. </p><p>Since the review was carried out there has been significant development of fire services in Ireland across a wide spectrum of areas. This included significant investment in and development of, infrastructure including fire stations, fire engines, equipment and training. The National Incident Command System, was established and standard operating guidance to support safe and effective operations have been implemented through the Fire Services Change Programme. The current service delivery structure was also introduced and the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management (NDFEM) was established in my Department.</p><p>The NDFEM carried out a further significant review of fire services and fire safety in Ireland in 2012 and the Report &quot;Keeping Communities Safe&quot;, was published in 2013. It sets out approaches across a number of areas, including: risk management; service delivery structures; fire safety; service response; dealing with large scale incidents; inter-agency work; major emergency management; quality assurance; performance reporting and implementation.  The Review is available on my Department's website at the following link:</p><p><i></i></p><p>In 2016, an external validation on the implementation of &quot;Keeping Communities Safe&quot;, concluded that the public are served well by fire services in Ireland.  There has been a welcome downward trend in fires and other emergencies requiring fire service assistance over a number of years and a reduction in the incidence of loss of life in fire. The validation was supported by visits to all fire services throughout 2014 and 2015 and the conclusions applied equally to both full-time and retained services. A similar evaluation exercise is targeted for completion in 2021. </p></reply>

To be eligible, tenants must meet certain criteria, including having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum and having been in receipt of social housing support for at least one year.</p>  <p>  The minimum reckonable income for eligibility under the scheme is calculated by the relevant local authority in accordance with the detailed provisions of the Ministerial Direction issued under Sections 24(3) and (4) of the 2014 Act. In calculating the minimum reckonable income, local authorities include income from a number of different sources and classes, such as from employment, private pensions, maintenance payments and certain social welfare payments, including pensions, where the social welfare payment is secondary to employment income. </p>  <p>  In determining reckonable income, the income of all tenants of the house, including adult children that are joint tenants, is included, as is the income of the spouse, civil partner or other partner / co-habitant of a tenant who lives in the house with them, thus ensuring the appropriate level of discount is applied to the purchase price.</p>  <p>  The minimum income criterion was introduced in order to ensure the sustainability of the scheme.  Applicants must demonstrate that they have an income that is long-term and sustainable in nature. This ensures that the tenant purchasing the house is in a financial position, as the owner, to maintain and insure the property for the duration of the charged period, in compliance with the conditions of the order transferring the ownership of, and responsibility for, the house from the local authority to the tenant.</p>  <p>  The financing of any house sold under the Tenant (Incremental) Purchase Scheme is a separate matter from the eligibility criteria for the scheme.  If the tenant is deemed eligible under the scheme, he or she may fund the purchase of a house from one, or a combination, of his/her own resources or a mortgage provided by a financial institution or a local authority house purchase loan.</p>  <p>  In line with the commitment given in the Government's Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan on Housing and Homelessness, a review of the operation of the first 12 months of the Tenant Purchase (Incremental) Scheme has been recently finalised and a full report has been prepared setting out findings and recommendations. </p>  <p>  This issue is part of a significant body of work undertaken in my Department in relation to the broader social housing reform agenda. I expect that the review will be published once all the work on these reform measures are completed.</p></reply>

The measures also prohibit any increase to rent for the duration of the emergency period.  Initially, these emergency laws will last for a period of 3 months, but they may be extended if the Government considers it necessary. </p><p>During the emergency period, a landlord can still serve their tenant with a warning notice if their tenant is in rent arrears or otherwise failing to fulfil their obligations. The landlord must give their tenant 28 days, rather than the usual 14 days, from receipt of a rent arrears warning notice to pay the arrears. The longer rent arrears warning notice during the emergency period is intended to  afford more time for tenants to seek any necessary income support. A notice of tenancy termination cannot be served by a landlord during the emergency period for any reason.</p><p>Carrying out an illegal eviction, which includes prohibiting access to the property or making the property uninhabitable by disconnecting services, can result in damages of up to &euro;20,000 being awarded to the tenant.

The nature of the problem related to the crumbling of the concrete blockwork in the external walls of affected dwellings, thereby compromising their structural integrity and giving rise to considerable personal distress to the many homeowners involved. At that time, several hundred homes were suspected to be affected in north Donegal. The presence of muscovite mica in abundant quantities in the aggregate constituent of the concrete blocks was suggested as being one of the main factors contributing to the deterioration of the concrete blocks.</p>  <p>  By the end of 2013, similar problems had also come to light in both public and private dwellings located in west Mayo and Mayo County Council submitted a report to my Department on problems that had been identified with the concrete blockwork in their social housing stock. In this instance, it was the presence of pyrite in the aggregate constituent of the concrete block that was suggested as being one of the main factors contributing to the deterioration of the concrete blocks. The emergence of similar problems among private households located in County Mayo was also reported in 2013.</p>  <p>  Over the course of 2014 and 2015, there were significant representations, media reports and letters from affected homeowners illustrating the increasing scale of the problems emerging in the two counties, the progressive nature of the external wall cracking and the resultant structural distress in the affected properties.</p>  <p>  An Expert Panel on Concrete Blocks was established by my Department in 2016 and its terms of reference were limited to the investigation of the problems that have emerged in the concrete blockwork of certain dwellings in Counties Donegal and Mayo.</p>  <p>   In 2017, the report of the Expert Panel was published and included eight recommendations, which my Department has been actively progressing with the relevant stakeholders. </p>  <p>  With regard to Recommendation 1, a standardised protocol was published by the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) on 13 November 2018 and is available at www.nsai.ie.</p>  <p>   This standard can be used by homeowners anywhere in the country, to assess and categorise the damage in properties where the concrete blocks are suspected to contain the minerals mica or pyrite, and it will inform the course of action in relation to remedial works for all such affected properties.</p>  <p>  Previously, there was no common way for engineers or homeowners to assess the damage caused by defective concrete blocks, in order to decide what, if any, remedial work could be carried out.  The standard:</p>  <p>  1. establishes a protocol for assessing and determining whether a building has been damaged by concrete blocks containing certain excessive amounts of  deleterious materials (free or unbound muscovite mica, or aggregate with potentially deleterious quantities of pyrite);</p>  <p>  2. describes methods for establishing the extent of the problem;</p>  <p>  3. describes the scope of any testing required; and</p>  <p>  4. categorises buildings, in  accordance with the standard, providing competent persons with guidance on the appropriate measures to be taken.</p>  <p>  With regard to Recommendation 2, my Department has been in contact with Engineers Ireland in relation to the establishment of a register of competent engineers for homeowners/affected parties&rsquo; reference. In June 2019, Engineers Ireland established such a register, which is available at www.engineersireland.ie/Services/I-S-465-2018-Register.aspx. </p>  <p>  The register lists Chartered Engineers, who have the necessary direct professional experience, competence and specialist training in accordance with the requirements set out in ' I.S. 465:2018 - Assessment, testing and categorisation of damaged buildings incorporating concrete blocks containing certain deleterious materials&rsquo;.</p>  <p>  In 2018, the Government agreed in principle to introduce a scheme to support affected homeowners in the counties of Donegal and Mayo to carry out the necessary remediation works to dwellings that have been significantly damaged due to defective concrete blocks.</p>  <p>  I made Regulations under sections 2 and 5 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1979, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, to provide for a grant scheme of financial assistance to support affected homeowners in the counties of Donegal and Mayo to carry out the necessary remediation works to dwellings that have been damaged due to defective concrete blocks. Dwellings Damaged by the Use of Defective Concrete Blocks in Construction (Remediation) (Financial Assistance) Regulations 2020. The regulations came into operation on 31 January 2020, and my Department has recently completed the process of finalising guidelines, which have been issued to the relevant local authorities. </p>  <p>  The scheme is targeted at assisting a restricted group of homeowners in the counties of Donegal and Mayo who have no other practicable options to access redress. It is not a compensation scheme and the regulations apply only in respect of qualifying works that have not commenced prior to confirmation of grant approval being issued in respect of a dwelling by the relevant local authority. Homeowners cannot seek the recoupment of costs associated with the remediation of a dwelling undertaken either prior to the commencement, or outside, of the scheme. This is in line with how similar Government schemes operate or have operated in the past, where prior approval is a key eligibility requirement.</p>  <p>  Budget 2020 provides funding of &euro;40 million to fund the operation of the pyrite remediation scheme and the defective concrete blocks grant scheme. Funding for future years will be agreed on an annual basis as part of the normal Estimates process and additional funding can be provided should it be required. Mindful that the scheme is being funded from the Exchequer the scope of the scheme cannot be open ended. The funding available must be used prudently to achieve the most efficient and cost effective outcomes.</p></reply>

In order to ensure greater uniformity with other measures in the Multi-Annual Rural Water Programme, the means test that previously applied to this grant scheme is being removed and the level of grant support is being increased to 85% of the eligible costs of installation/upgrade subject to a maximum grant of &euro;5,000 whichever is the lesser. The grant scheme is also being expanded to support the attainment of water quality objectives in what are called &lsquo;high status objective catchment&rsquo; water areas and &lsquo;prioritised areas for action&rsquo;, as identified in the River Basin Management Plan for Ireland 2018-2021.</p>  <p>  In recent days I made a number of regulations to give effect to the new Scheme, details of which will be available on my Department's website from today.</p></reply>

For existing applicants, local authorities are advised to ensure that final loan offers are made based on up to date financial and employment data from applicants as appropriate, having regard to the implications that COVID-19 has had for many businesses and employers.</p><p>My Department publishes information on the overall number and value of (i) local authority loan approvals and (ii) local authority loan drawdowns.

For applications for judicial review on decisions made prior to the 29th of March 2020, the portion of the statutory period in which judicial review may be sought, that remained on the coming into effect of the Section 251A order on 29th  March 2020, now resumes from 24th May 2020. </p>  <p>  In each case, the exact calculation of the statutory time period in which judicial review may be sought, will depend on the date the decision was made and is subject to legal advice on a case by case basis.</p></reply>

I also tasked the Management Board of my Department&rsquo;s National Directorate of Fire and Emergency Management (NDFEM) to implement the recommendations that are within my Department's remit, and to oversee the implementation of other recommendations.</p><p>In response to the Task Force recommendations, the NDFEM Board has brought forward a number of initiatives, including proposals for regulatory provisions and guidance for ensuring fire safety in buildings, and for fire services.  </p><p>Copies of both the Report and the Summary of Conclusions and Recommendations are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following links:</p><p>Fire Safety Task Force Report: </p><p><i>.</i></p><p>Summary of Conclusions and Recommendations:</p><p><i>.</i></p><p>It should be noted that when a building is constructed and occupied, statutory responsibility for safety is assigned by section 18(2) of the Fire Services Acts, 1981 &amp;amp; 2003, to the &lsquo;person having control&rsquo; of the building. The person having control is required to take reasonable measures to guard against the outbreak of fire and to ensure the safety of persons in the event of fire. In multi-unit developments, the &quot;person having control&quot; is generally the Owner Management Company.  </p><p>Under the Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011, (which is under the remit of the Minister for Justice and Equality), the owner management company must establish a scheme for annual service charges and a sinking fund for spending on refurbishment, improvement or maintenance of a non-recurring nature of the multi-unit development. </p><p>I believe that the building control reform agenda already well underway provides a comprehensive roadmap for embedding an enhanced culture of compliance and accountability within the construction industry and for strengthening the building control framework in Ireland.The reform agenda includes: amendments made to the Building Control Regulations;  the National Building Control Management Project; and the ongoing development of new legislation through the Building Control (Construction Industry Register Ireland) Bill.</p><p>My focus will remain firmly on ensuring the full roll out of the building control reform agenda, to ensure that all those that engaged in the construction sector take their responsibilities seriously and are appropriately held to account.</p></reply>

The design team are currently advancing a development framework and outline design for the site that can deliver approximately 200 units of which approximately 100 units can be delivered as part of phase one of the project. To facilitate this initial outline design process the LDA will be carrying out a survey of the site, its protected structures and existing buildings. </p>  <p>  As the project is at the outline design stage, it is not currently possible to provide a map of the development and access points. Once preliminary design is advanced, the LDA will commence the consultation process with Westmeath County Council - including the elected members - and other key stakeholders including the local community and community groups currently based on site. The LDA are fully committed to maintaining open lines of communication with all stakeholders throughout the life cycle of the development. Any planning applications that are made pursuant to these engagements will be consistent with the development plans, local area plans and national planning policy.</p>  <p>  As with all State bodies operating under the aegis of my Department, arrangements have been put in place by the LDA through which Oireachtas members can request information directly from the Agency in relation to operational matters - in this regard, the LDA may be contacted directly at oireachtas@lda.ie.</p></reply>

Outside of the usual rent review cycle, temporary reductions in rent can be implemented on an informal basis by agreement between the landlord and tenant.

The rate of the levy increased to 7% for sites listed on local authority vacant sites register from 2019 onwards which site owners became liable to pay in January 2020.</p>  <p>  The primary objective of the levy is to act as a mechanism to incentivise the development of vacant and underutilised sites in urban areas for both the provision of housing and the development and renewal of land, thereby facilitating the most efficient use of such land and sites and enabling them to be brought into beneficial use rather than allowing them to remain dormant and undeveloped.  The levy is not intended to be a revenue generating measure with the proceeds accruing to the relevant local authority rather than the Exchequer.  </p>  <p>  The levy proceeds generated are specifically intended to be used by local authorities for the provision of housing and regeneration development in the local area in which vacant sites are located.  No more than 10% of the levy monies received by planning authorities may be used on their administration costs.  </p>  <p>  My Department proactively engages with local authorities with a view to ensuring that the vacant site levy achieves its full potential in terms of bringing concerned sites into productive use. In this regard, my Department issued Circular PL 09/2019 on 13 November 2019 requesting a progress report on the implementation of the levy by each local authority. </p>  <p>  The returns from the local authorities indicated that, as of 31 October 2019, there were 359 sites listed on local authority registers. These sites had a market valuation of &euro;144.5m and were liable to the levy at a rate of 3% in 2019, indicating estimated levy proceeds due of &euro;4.335m.</p>  <p>  All levies due on an individual site will remain a charge on the land concerned until all outstanding levies due are paid. Accordingly, under the vacant site levy provisions, there will be a cumulative effect associated with not activating a site for development purposes for each year that a site remains vacant or idle. Local authorities are currently in the process of initiating debt recovery procedures to recoup levy arrears which remain outstanding.</p>  <p>  Information on the collection rates for Local Property Tax is the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Finance and is a matter for which I have no function.</p></reply>

The 999 homes referred to are being delivered using an availability based PPP model, in which a private sector company designs, builds, finances and maintains the social housing developments in return for a monthly unitary payment from the State.  The terms of the agreement provide for a cessation of the unitary payment and that the homes be returned to the full ownership of the State after a period of 25 years.  </p>  <p>  The Department is currently in the initial stages of working with the NDFA and participating local autorities to progress Bundle 3 of the PPP programme.  In total, it is intended to deliver up to 1,500 social housing units across the three bundles, and through investment with a capital value of &euro;300 million.</p></reply>

With effect from 27 March 2020, new emergency measures were introduced into law to protect tenants during the COVID-19 emergency period. Tenants cannot be forced to leave their rental accommodation, other than in exceptional circumstances, during this period. Initially, these emergency laws will apply for a period of 3 months, but they may be extended if the Government considers it necessary.  </p><p>My Department, in collaboration with the RTB, recently published a Guidance Document on Covid-19 supports for landlords and tenants that sets out the emergency rental measures and income and other supports available to tenants and landlords during the emergency period. The Guidance document is available on the RTB's website at:</p><p><i>https://onestopshop.rtb.ie/images/uploads/general/COVID_Update_Guidance_Document_final.pdf  </i></p><p>and a list of Frequently Asked Questions has been developed and is also available on the RTB's website at:</p><p><i>https://onestopshop.rtb.ie/images/uploads/Comms%20and%20Research/FAQs_on_Emergency_Legislation_Final.pdf.  </i></p><p>The  RTB has a communications plan in operation to inform stakeholders and the general public of the emergency legislative measures for the rental sector during the COVID-19 emergency period and to provide up-to-date and accurate information on its services. The communications plan involves the delivery of a multi-media, integrated communications campaign which utilises social media, digital and radio advertising,  the RTB website (including its webchat service) and stakeholder engagement to leverage the support of other organisations in  disseminating the necessary public information as widely as possible in a short time period. </p><p>In the four weeks from the commencement of the emergency period, there was a 40% increase  in activity on the RTB's website as well as significantly increased usage of its webchat service.  </p><p>COVID-19 related content was the most frequently visited page on the RTB's website - www.rtb.ie - during April and May. Calls to the RTB customer service centre during this time are primarily driven by the public seeking information on the emergency legislation. The RTB is in regular contact with over 300 stakeholders with news and updates on the emergency legislation announcement, which included distributing the Government Guidance document on the emergency legislation, the associated Frequently Asked Questions document, as well as updates on the RTB&rsquo;s customer contact support and dispute resolution services during Covid-19 emergency. The RTB continues to help stakeholders by addressing any queries that they have on the emergency legislation.  The RTB is currently in the process of finalising a plan to roll out webinar information sessions and virtual Stakeholder Forums to help further those living and working in the rental sector during this time. </p><p>I am satisfied that the RTB communications campaign continues to be effective in helping landlords and tenants to stay up-to-date on the impact of the emergency measures for the rental sector.</p></reply>

In this regard, the Department issued Circular PL 09/2019 on 13 November 2019 requesting a progress report on implementation of the Vacant Site Levy to be completed by the Director of Planning in each Local Authority. </p>  <p>  Progress report returns were received from all of the 31 local authorities which indicated that, as of 31 October 2019, there were 359 sites listed on local authority registers.

The rate of the levy increased to 7% for sites listed on local authority vacant sites register from 2019 onwards which site owners became liable to pay in January 2020.</p><p>Local Authorities can only apply the levy if the criteria set out in the Urban Regeneration and Housing Act 2015 (the Act) are satisfied i.e.</p><p>- the site is situated in an area where there is a need for housing,</p><p>- the site is suitable for the provision of housing, and</p><p>- the site, or a majority of the site, is vacant or idle.</p><p>The specific criteria in relation to determining whether or not there is a need for housing in an area within a planning authority's functional area are set out in section 6(4) of the Act. Such determination is required to be assessed by reference to -</p><p>- the housing strategy and the core strategy of the planning authority,</p><p>- house prices and the cost of renting in the area,</p><p>- the number of households qualified for social housing support in accordance with section 20 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 that have specified the area as an area of choice for the receipt of such support and any changes to that number since the adoption of the planning authority's development plan, and </p><p>- whether the number of habitable houses available for purchase of rent was less than 5% of the total number of houses in the area. </p><p>The primary purpose of the levy is to incentivise the activation of development of vacant sites in urban areas for housing and regeneration purposes, thereby bringing the sites into productive use. In certain local authority areas, particularly in more rural/ low population counties, housing need may not be as acute as in larger urban areas. Consequently, where the levy criteria are not satisfied in certain areas, there is justification for non-application of the levy in those areas. Currently 8 local authorities have not included sites on their registers.</p></reply>

The Plan includes an overall target of 663 tenancies in the period 2018-2021, with annual targets for each local authority.

The survey results, national targets, and regional targets are available in the Housing First National Implementation Plan document.

It is also working in partnership with other local authorities around the country. It is running a design review of the Sandy Road Regeneration Project in Galway which has the potential for up to 1,000 homes. It is also working with Limerick City and County Council on a site near Colbert Station in Limerick, funding a masterplan of the site which consists of lands owned by the Council, CIE, the Department of Education and the HSE.</p><p>As with all State bodies operating under the aegis of my Department, arrangements have been put in place by the LDA through which Oireachtas members can request information directly from the Agency in relation to operational matters - in this regard, the LDA may be contacted directly at oireachtas@lda.ie.</p></reply>

As such, since 1 March 2018, Credit Unions are permitted to provide funding, through a regulated investment vehicle, to Tier 3 AHBs for the provision of social housing.</p>  <p>  My Department referred the Credit Union representative bodies to the Irish Council for Social Housing (ICSH) with a view to both sectors sharing, as far as practical, the benefits of their respective work in this area, including the work undertaken by the ICSH on the development of special purpose vehicles for social housing financing purposes. The work of the ICSH was supported by grant funding from my Department.  In addition, my colleague, Damian English, Minister of State for Housing and Urban Development,  and I have met with the Credit Union movement and the AHB sector on this matter. The Department of Finance has also met with the Credit Union representative bodies.</p>  <p>  The ICSH, along with six Tier 3 AHBs, have worked with specialist financial advisors to establish a funding mechanism or vehicle which would identify suitable sources of non-state finance to fund the delivery of social housing by AHBs, based on best value for money. Market testing undertaken revealed good interest in lending to the AHB sector from various lenders including banks, institutional investors and the Credit Union sector. So far, one AHB has set up an SPV and several AHBs have sourced finance from private institutions. As such, the work in this area is ongoing and has led to individual AHBs establishing SPVs for financing social housing.</p>  <p>  The Credit Union sector is one potential funder whose terms are assessed as part of the process of market testing to establish best value for money and optimum terms and conditions from lenders.  While my Department will continue to be available to provide any clarifications that may be required in relation to social housing delivery, it falls to the relevant parties, i.e. the AHBs, on the one hand, and potential investors on the other, to agree a workable and mutually acceptable approach in order to bring potential investment possibilities to a successful conclusion.</p></reply>

Tenants cannot be forced to leave their rental accommodation, other than in exceptional circumstances, during this period. Initially, these emergency laws will apply for a period of 3 months, but they may be extended if the Government considers it necessary. </p><p>My Department recently published a Guidance Document on Covid-19 supports for landlords and tenants which sets out the emergency rental measures and income and other supports available to tenants and landlords during the emergency period. The Guidance document is available at:</p><p><i>https://onestopshop.rtb.ie/images/uploads/general/COVID_Update_Guidance_Document_final.pdf </i></p><p>and a list of Frequently Asked Questions has been developed and is available at:</p><p><i>https://onestopshop.rtb.ie/images/uploads/Comms%20and%20Research/FAQs_on_Emergency_Legislation_Final.pdf. </i></p><p>The Residential Tenancies Acts 2004-2019 provide for minimum notice periods to be served by tenants and landlords for tenancy terminations &ndash; for example, a student must provide 28 days notice to end a tenancy of less than 6 months duration or 35 days to end a tenancy of more than 6 months but less than 1 year. </p><p>The Acts do not prescribe specific terms and conditions regarding the payment of rents or deposits for inclusion in individual letting agreements in the private rental market including the student-specific accommodation sector. Contract law governs such arrangements.</p><p>The specific terms associated with an individual student&rsquo;s rights and obligations are likely to be set out in a written contract signed by both the student and the landlord. Engagement between the parties to clarify the respective contractual obligations of the student and the landlord is key in establishing whether a breach of contract had occurred.</p><p>Students may wish to contact their third level education providers to seek any assistance that they might be in a position to provide. If a student cannot come to an agreement with their accommodation provider, they might wish to contact the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) regarding their concerns &ndash; <i></i>&ndash; or to refer a dispute for resolution with regard to the non-refund of their deposit.</p><p>The RTB was established as an independent statutory body under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 to operate a national tenancy registration system and to resolve disputes between landlords and tenants. Due to the quasi-judicial nature of work of the RTB, it would be inappropriate for me, as Minister, or my Department to comment on or intervene in the specifics of any individual case, or to meet with anyone that may be party to a dispute lodged with the RTB. </p><p>I understand that the Department of Education and Skills is working with representatives from the higher education sector to address the challenges faced by students in this difficult time. The Department of Education of Skills understands, based on the information available to it, that the majority of students in university-owned accommodation will receive pro-rata refunds if they vacate their accommodation.  The Minister for Education and Skills has indicated that he would wish to see this principle applied in the case of students who were residing in privately owned student accommodation. However, it is not within the remit of the Department of Education and Skills nor of my Department to direct any accommodation provider to offer  rent rebates or credits.</p></reply>

The aim now is for the relevant local authorities to commence the receipt of applications without delay, and by 30 June at the latest.</p>  <p>  The scheme is targeted at assisting a restricted group of homeowners in the counties of Donegal and Mayo, who have no other practicable options to access redress. It is not a compensation scheme and the regulations apply only in respect of qualifying works that have not commenced prior to confirmation of grant approval being issued in respect of a dwelling by the relevant local authority. Homeowners cannot seek the recoupment of costs associated with the remediation of a dwelling undertaken either prior to the commencement, or outside, of the scheme. This is in line with how similar Government schemes operate or have operated in the past, where prior approval is a key eligibility requirement.</p>  <p>  Budget 2020 provides funding of &euro;40 million to fund the operation of the pyrite remediation scheme and the defective concrete blocks grant scheme. Funding for future years will be agreed on an annual basis as part of the normal Estimates process and additional funding can be provided should it be required. Mindful that the scheme is being funded from the Exchequer the scope of the scheme cannot be open ended.

With this in mind, guidelines on inter-authority movement were introduced in 2017 to allow for local authorities to facilitate movement of HAP households from one local authority area to another in cases where a HAP tenant, currently on a local authority waiting list, wishes to access rented accommodation with HAP support in another local authority area. Inter authority movement is subject to certain conditions. </p>  <p>  Additional guidance issued in April 2019. Households eligible for social housing support are now provided with the opportunity to avail of HAP in any local authority area, subject, of course, to the current Social Housing Income Eligibility Bands or confirmation that the applicant's income is below the threshold in the new local authority. </p>  <p>  HAP tenants continue to be dealt with by their originating local authority. However, the rent limits will be those that apply in the local authority where the property is situated. The originating local authority will engage with the relevant new local authority to facilitate eligible requests for inter-authority movement. </p>  <p>  At present, local authorities and the HAP Shared Services Centre are continuing to provide a critical service to all HAP customers. While local authorities are putting in place arrangements to reduce direct contact, because of public health requirements, alternative processes are in place to ensure a HAP service continues to be provided.  This is particularly important for those applying for support under Homeless HAP in the current crisis.</p>  <p>  Under the HAP scheme, priority is currently being given to HAP set-ups and ensuring that landlords are paid and that HAP tenancies are maintained.  HAP applications continue to be received and processed by local authorities, and the HAP Shared Service Centre is continuing to carry out all of the necessary back office activities in setting up HAP tenancies as normal.</p>  <p>  Under the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (COVID-19) Act 2020, the Government introduced additional supports and protections for renters. The Act provides for amendments to the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004 to 2019, which will operate for a period of 3 months from 27 March 2020. Provision has also been made for this period to be extended, if the Government considers it appropriate to do so.  A notice of termination cannot be served during the COVID&ndash;19 emergency period.  All notices of termination which were served before the emergency period are paused and tenants, in general, cannot be obliged to leave their rented accommodation during this time. </p>  <p>  The administration of the HAP scheme is a matter for the relevant local authority and it is the responsibility of the local authority to make a decision in each individual case.   This includes consideration of recent government announcements in relation to public health guidance measures introduced for the purpose of preventing, limiting, minimising or slowing the spread of Covid-19.</p></reply>

Since 2014, funding has been provided for this purpose under the Voids Programme, to accompany the funding invested by local authorities themselves in the management and turnaround of their own stock. More precise details on the tenanting of social homes by Longford and Westmeath County Councils will be available from the local authorities themselves.</p><p>Information on the precise number of properties owned by individual local authorities that are classified as OPDs or are suitable for tenants with a physical disability, is not held by my Department but should be available directly from the local authorities.</p></reply>

This includes the potential for a &lsquo;Shared Accommodation&rsquo; or &lsquo;Co-Living&rsquo; format.  This format comprises professionally managed rental accommodation, where living accommodation, that may comprise individual rooms, is rented within an overall development, that must also include access to shared or communal facilities and amenities, but not shared bathroom or toilet facilities. Up until 31 March 2020, developments comprising 294 co-living bedspaces have been approved by An Bord Plean&aacute;la under the SHD process since the guidelines came into force in 2018.  In comparison, in overall terms, there were more than 60,000 homes permitted, none of which incorporated co-living bedspaces, from when the guidelines were published to the end of 2019 alone.</p>  <p>  Shared accommodation is one of a number of residential settings that include hotels, hostels, residential institutions and student accommodation, where residential occupation comprises more than one household.  Although such accommodation formats are not as prevalent as individual houses or apartments, they nonetheless play an important role in catering for the diverse needs of the overall population. My Department will continue to monitor all relevant existing policy measures and activities, having regard to the most up to date Government public health advice and guidance, as the response to the COVID-19 pandemic evolves.</p></reply>

Much of this is invested by the Council through its Strategic Funding programme which includes grants to key arts organisations across the country. Additional funding is invested in projects and programmes, including Arts Centre Funding, Bursary Awards, Festivals Investment Scheme, and Project Awards for art organisations and artists nationwide. The Arts Council has a number of schemes and initiatives around the support of music, details of which are also available on its website.  </p><p>The Arts Council responded quickly to the impact of COVID-19 on the arts sector.  At the start of the crisis, the Council introduced a series of measures to help artists and arts organisations manage their businesses during the period of the COVID-19 crisis.  The Council announced that it would honour all existing funding commitments and asked in particular that its regularly funded arts organisation prioritise commitments to artists. Since March 12th the Arts Council has fast-tracked the payment of up to 90% of funding to organisations and individuals.  The Arts Council also announced that there will be no financial penalties for arts organisations and individuals unable to deliver programmed events and activities arising from the impact of the COVID-19 crisis. </p><p>The Council also undertook a number of detailed surveys of individual artists and arts organisations to identify the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on audiences, employment and finances for March, April and May.</p><p>I understand that over the past few months, based on information gathered and its knowledge of the sector, the Arts Council has taken decisions to direct its 2020 funding allocation in a way which would assist artists and arts organisations to best respond to the Covid-19 crisis.  These decisions have been taken on the back of extensive and on-going consultation with the arts sector and other stakeholders.  Priority in the use of all funds is being given towards supporting the artists and arts workers. </p><p>The Council announced a suite of programmes which include expanded bursary, commission and professional development awards designed to sustain the ecology at this difficult time, while also offering support which enables artists to develop work and supports arts workers to enhance their skill sets.  In relation to the touring and dissemination of work scheme, the Arts Council announced that the application date for has been deferred to later this year. This is due to the considerable uncertainty regarding programming brought about by the COVID-19 crisis. Details of upcoming funding schemes are routinely publicised by the Council on their website as follows .</p><p>Under Section 24 (2) of the Arts Act 2003, the Arts Council is statutorily independent in its funding decisions and I as Minister cannot intervene in its decisions in this regard. </p><p>More generally, my Department has engaged with a wide range of stakeholders since the commencement of the COVID-19 crisis including national cultural institutions, the Arts Council, Screen Ireland, resource organisations, advocacy bodies, and individual arts organisations and artists to assess the impacts of the crisis on the sector and to ensure that optimal use is made of available resources to sustain the sector through this challenging period.</p></reply>

Currently only island residents and those providing essential services are permitted to travel to the islands.  This action was taken in response to requests from island communities and the advice of the relevant health authorities.  </p>  <p>  My Department has worked closely with island representative groups and ferry operators in order to implement reduced ferry schedules serving the islands on a temporary basis.  This was done to properly protect both island communities and those working on their life-line transport services during the current pandemic.  These services will be fully restored in due course in accordance with best practice, following consultation with island communities and the relevant health authorities. </p>  <p>  The re-opening of the islands to the general public is scheduled for phase 5 of the National Roadmap.  While Government recognises the importance of tourism to the economy of the islands, the well-being of island residents and the operators of lifeline services to these islands must be given priority at this time.  Notwithstanding this if a reasonable request to reopen the islands earlier than Stage 5 of the National Plan were to come from the island communities through their representative body I would be willing to bring same to the appropriate authorities for consideration. My Department continues to engage with island communities through their representative body.</p></reply>

This development is integral to the future growth of the company in question which employs a significant number of people on P&aacute;irc Ghn&oacute; Ghaoth Dobhair. </p>  <p>  The expansion of the company will facilitate its ability to secure new contracts, expand the workforce and produce new products in Gaoth Dobhair. The building will need to be renovated as well as being extended to allow for the installation of the appropriate machinery as and when required and the company itself will complete and finance those works. </p>  <p>  The sale of enterprise property directly to client companies with an appropriate business model, resources, structure and profile is a long-established successful method by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and other development organisations to ensure longevity, sustainability and investment by companies in creating employment in rural Gaeltacht areas. </p>  <p>  As per the appropriate procedure, two independent valuations were received in order to ascertain the  market value of the building at the time of the sale. The higher of these valuations was selected and approved by the Board of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s as the minimum sale price for the property, subject to the property being used for enterprise and job creation </p>  <p>  The  sale price is commercially sensitive to the company in question and, therefore,  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta is legally bound not to disclose same at this time. </p>  <p>  No other company had expressed an interest in purchasing part or all of the site to which the Deputy refers from &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, despite ongoing proactive efforts by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s over many years to obtain a viable job creating project and accompanying investment.  </p>  <p>  Given that the site has lain dormant since 2004, the sale and expansion is a positive development for the Gaoth Dobhair area, which will see cutting edge research, development and innovation, and manufacturing taking place in this factory once again and most importantly, a proposed workforce in excess of 160 in total. </p>  <p>  As I stated in this house previously, at a time of global uncertainty, it is encouraging to see companies that are willing to innovate, develop and especially invest in their own local areas and to look to create new employment opportunities.</p></reply>

The Roadmap specifies that decisions in relation to which actions will be taken and which public health measures might be lifted will be made in accordance with the Framework for Future Decision-Making.</p>  <p>  My Department has worked with the Arts Council from an early stage in the COVID-19 crisis, on measures to sustain our cultural infrastructure, support artists and arts practitioners and ensure the ongoing provision of cultural services. Following a meeting I convened on 12 March with the Arts Council, the national cultural institutions and Screen Ireland, the Arts Council announced a series of immediate measures, including an undertaking to honour all funding commitments made to organisations and allow grantees to draw down up to 90% of their funding commitment.</p>  <p>  Government has introduced a range of supports for those affected by COVID-19 and those working in the arts, culture and audiovisual sectors are eligible to apply for these supports.  My Department has published a new booklet on its website which sets out support and information available to the arts sector in response to the COVID-19 crisis. Officials from my Department are in ongoing contact with the Arts Council and as well as with a broad range of sectorial stakeholders including resource organisations, advocacy groups as well as individual artists and arts practices. </p>  <p>  The Council has undertaken a detailed survey of arts organisations to identify the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on audiences, employment and finances for March, April and May as well as a survey of artists seeking information of the economic impact on individual artists and the results are published on their website. </p>  <p>  In the context of the wider cultural sector, officials  from my Department are continuing to work with the Arts Council as well as other parts of Government, to assess and measure the effects of COVID-19 on the cultural sector and to ensure that optimal use is made of available resources to sustain the sector through this crisis.</p></reply>

This Strategy proposed a particular focus of conservation efforts on the 8 best pearl mussel rivers in the country, and set out that it would not be possible to restore some of the 27 populations in SACs, including the Munster Blackwater main channel, because of the low number and poor condition of the remaining mussels, the bad status of the mussel habitat and the magnitude of the pressures in the catchment.</p>  <p>  The Blackwater River SAC had been designated on the basis of 18 qualifying interests (9 habitats and 9 species), including the presence at the site of the freshwater pearl mussel, which the Habitats Directive requires be conserved through designation of SACs.</p>  <p>  The European Union Environmental Objectives (Pearl Mussels) Regulations 2018 were made in order to remove the pearl mussel as a qualifying interest for the main channel of the Munster Blackwater River, in  line with the 2011 Strategy, and  in particular  amending S.I. 296 of 2009 &ndash; the EU Environmental Objectives (Freshwater Pearl Mussel) Regulations, to that effect. </p>  <p>  It was intended that the Conservation Objectives for the SAC would be altered so that the mussel would remain a qualifying interest in certain tributaries, but would no longer be so in the main channel of the river. </p>  <p>  In December 2018, a judicial review was brought before the High Court, challenging the  making of the 2018 Regulations. In light of the recent jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of the European Union in relation to the remit of the application of the  legal requirements of the SEA Directive, my Department decided  that the prudent course of action was to agree to an Order of Certiorari to have the making of the 2018 Regulations quashed. Accordingly, on 5 December 2019, the High Court by consent made an Order of Certiorari quashing the European Union Environmental Objectives (Pearl Mussels) Regulations 2018 (S.I. No. 355 of 2018). </p>  <p>  My Department is currently reviewing the case and all of the  evidence presented by affidavit. While the consent by the Department was agreed on foot of procedural matters, it was clear that the scientific evidence on which the 2011 strategy was based has changed in light of further knowledge; and it is clear that no change to the regulations would be possible without extensive survey work in the river, a substantial and difficult task give the length and size of the river, the high speed of the flow and the depth and dark nature of the water. The necessary survey work would be likely to require 2 years to complete, given reasonable weather and river conditions.</p></reply>

While grant funding is awarded on the basis of quality of work with reference to strategically important territories rather than on art form basis, there is a significant number of music grants given the strength of the Irish music sector and global interest in Irish music.</p>  <p>  At the beginning of the Covid-19 crisis, I approved the launch by Culture Ireland of the Ireland Performs initiative,  a new scheme to present artists online, enabling them to reach a global audience and supporting them with payment of &euro;1,000 per performance.   Priority was given to artists who had suffered the cancellation of live performances and touring contracts abroad.</p>  <p>  Ireland Performs  proved to be a great success with almost 500 applications received for the 120 performance slots over a 6 week period. To date the performances have attracted an audience of just over 800,000 with a wide global reach including Asia, the US, Australia and Europe.</p>  <p>  Artists from 28 counties participated and an enduring legacy of the programme is the technical expertise gained by the artists which will allow them to present their work on social media platforms in the future and provide access to worldwide audiences and new earning potential.</p>  <p>  With all national and most international showcases now cancelled for the foreseeable future, Culture Ireland is working across all artforms to develop new ways of presenting Irish arts and artists to a global audience over the coming months in order to maintain existing connections and develop future opportunities for Irish artists.</p>  <p>  Culture Ireland is working with bodies such as Literature Ireland, First Music Contact, Irish Film Institute International and our Cultural Centres in New York, London and Paris and the Network of Irish Cultural Centres across North America to ensure that Irish artists and organisations are supported to present their work globally and the existing budget is utilised to best advantage of Irish artists to reach audiences worldwide.</p></reply>

There are two regional ERDF Operational Programmes in Ireland, implemented by two Managing Authorities. It is a matter for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, in consultation with the Managing Authorities, to reorient funding to areas of most need currently, in line with the provisions of CRII.</p>  <p>  The Creative Europe Programme is the main financial instrument at EU level to support the cultural and creative sector. At two recent meetings of the EU Council of Culture Ministers to discuss the impact of the COVID-19 crisis and the actions to be taken to mitigate its effects, I, along with a number of my counterparts, called for an increase in funding to the next Creative Europe Programme as well as additional and immediate direct support to the sector as part of the EU Recovery Plan to help it through this crisis and to rebound in its aftermath.</p>  <p>  While discussions on the next EU budget are ongoing, several measures have been introduced with immediate effect in the Creative Europe Programme to protect the cultural and audiovisual sector while shut down, including; a new call for projects for the cross-border mainly digital distribution of performing arts works; &euro;5m in vouchers for hardest-hit cinemas; maximum flexibility for existing projects to reach completion; accelerated selection procedure for many schemes so that artists can start work under pre-funding arrangements; facility to invoke force majeure to recover sunk costs for stalled productions and works; and, maximum flexibility on the repayment of loans.</p>  <p>  Finally, on Wednesday last week the European Commission published the EU Recovery Plan. The Plan includes a new initiative, REACT-EU, with a budget of &euro;55 billion. It is proposed that the funds will support workers and SMEs and will be available across sectors, including culture. While the Plan is now subject to negotiation and approval by the Council and European Parliament, I am confident that measures in the Plan, together with those under the Creative Europe Programme, and the whole suite of measures that have been introduced by the Government are helping to protect the cultural, creative and audiovisual sectors during shutdown and as we emerge from public health restrictions.</p></reply>

This places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of the protected structure and also gives the local authority powers to deal with development proposals and to seek to safeguard its future.</p>  <p>  In the interests of the preservation, conservation, management and presentation of the built and archaeological heritage, my Department occasionally seeks to acquire certain heritage properties and monuments as resources and opportunities permit. From time to time such properties may come onto the open market, may be bequeathed to the State or may be offered to it free of cost. In addition, lands surrounding or in proximity to heritage properties or national monuments in State care (i.e. incorporating the setting of the structure) often reside in private ownership. In certain cases, improved protection of the property or monument, or access to same, would be possible if the State was to acquire such additional lands. In all cases my Department would need to examine the potential acquisition carefully, taking into account the conservation needs of the property and Value for Money principles.</p>  <p>  My Department, in cooperation with the Office of Public Works, is, however, only in a position to acquire, maintain, conserve and present to the public a very limited number of properties and monuments. While I am supportive of efforts to identify suitable future uses to safeguard historic buildings, crucial to their future is the identification of a viable use or uses with sufficient income to ensure their survival.  </p>  <p>  The national monuments in State care already number some one thousand sites at over 760 locations right across the country and these command considerable resource commitments in terms of both funding and personnel allocation. In addition, there are more than 45,000 protected structures spread across all 31 local authority areas in the country and in excess of 120,000 monuments listed in the Record of Monuments and Places that are not maintained by the State.</p></reply>

This is a key requirement in the application process.</p></reply>
