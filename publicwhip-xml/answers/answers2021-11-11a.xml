The most recent figures available from Census 2016 indicate that there were 183,000 vacant homes nationwide, a 20% reduction on figures reported in Census 2011 (230,000). </p>  <p>  However, work is underway by the Department of Finance through the current Local Property Tax returns to assess the present vacancy situation and once collated and analysed this data will contribute to a number of policy initiatives outlined in Housing for All, including: </p>  <p>  - A new local authority-led programme to help Local Authorities buy or compulsory purchase 2,500 vacant homes in their areas which can then be sold on the open market will ensure homes don&rsquo;t lie vacant.</p>  <p>  - Reform of the Fair Deal Scheme to remove disincentives to selling or renting unused homes.</p>  <p>  - The Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe (Towns) Fund will be delivered by local authorities for the provision of serviced sites for housing, to attract people to build their own homes and to support the refurbishment of vacant properties, enabling people to live in small towns and villages, in a sustainable way.</p>  <p>  - A new Town Centre First policy, which will include approaches to utilising existing stock and new financial incentive mechanisms. </p>  <p>  These measures are in addition to the vacant property tax consideration being pursued by the Department of Finance.</p>  <p>  Statistics in relation to social housing stock, at a point in time, are published by the National Oversight and Audit Commission (NOAC) in their Annual Reports on Performance Indicators in Local Authorities. These reports provide a range of information in relation to social housing stock, including levels of vacancy in local authority owned properties. The most recent report, relating to 2020, is available on the NOAC website. </p></reply>

In data returns submitted to the Department, planning authorities have reported 6,121 instances of properties potentially in breach of the short-term letting legislation since its introduction, resulting in the commencement of almost 3,000 investigations and the issuing of 2,300 warning letters. Of these, 806 individual cases have been resolved to the satisfaction of planning authorities through the registration of properties, obtaining planning permission, or the ceasing of short-term letting operations.</p>  <p>  Housing for All contains a specific action - (Action 20.4) - to &ldquo;develop new regulatory controls requiring short-term and holiday lets to register with F&aacute;ilte Ireland with a view to ensuring that houses are used to best effect in areas of housing need&rdquo;. I have engaged with my colleague Minister Catherine Martin on this matter, and a number of meetings have been held between my Department and the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, and with F&aacute;ilte Ireland and further engagement will take place in the near future. </p>  <p>  Significant progress has been made on these proposals, which are being led by the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media. Funding has been allocated in Budget 2022 and F&aacute;ilte Ireland will be commencing shortly with recruitment of staff to manage the design and infrastructure for a short term lettings registration system.  Work has also begun on scoping the legal changes which will be required  and are expected to be legislated for by Q2 2022.</p></reply>

This is the most ambitious housing plan in the history of our State, backed up by an unprecedented financial commitment of in excess of &euro;4bn per annum. At a national level, over 300,000 new homes will be built by the end of 2030, including a projected 90,000 new build social homes, 36,000 affordable purchase homes and 18,000 cost rental homes. These homes will be provided by Local Authorities, Approved Housing Bodies, the Land Development Agency, as well as through a strategic partnership between the State and retail banks.  </p>  <p>  The enactment of the Land Development Agency Act, 2021, establishing the LDA as a commercial State Agency, marks an historic move to use all lands available to the State to provide for housing supply and affordability needs and represents a crucial lever in terms of reaching a sustainable housing market.  However, it was not intended to delay or interrupt projects/ housing schemes already in-flight or at an advanced stage of planning. </p>  <p>  I understand the Deputy is referring to sites in both the South Dublin County Council and Dublin City Council areas. In relation to a recent sale of a site in South Dublin, I understand that the Members of the Council recently approved the disposal of lands to the preferred Economic Operator to build 372 affordable homes and 123 private residential units at Killinarden. The Council members agreed in March 2020 to progress the procurement process and proceed to land disposal under the relevant legislation to accelerate the delivery of much needed affordable homes in the area. In addition, 125 social homes will be delivered as part of this development.  The land associated with these social homes is not included in the approved disposal.</p>  <p>  I understand that it is proposed to dispose of two sites owned by Dublin City Council (DCC), Oscar Traynor Road and O'Devaney Gardens, through the Housing Land Initiative competitive dialogue process to the preferred Economic Operator under Section 183 of the Local Government Act 2001.  These schemes combined will deliver over 1,800 homes, including over 500 new social homes, and between 400 and 900 cost rental and affordable purchase homes.  The plans for Oscar Traynor Road and O'Devaney Gardens predate the establishment of the LDA and going back to the drawing board now would result in an inordinate delay (DCC advise this could be up to five years) in the delivery of vital homes.</p></reply>

The General Scheme was the subject of a public consultation process which ended in January 2020. The General Scheme sets out an initial outline of proposed revisions to the judicial review provisions in sections 50 to 50B of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended. </p>  <p>  My Officials are engaging with the Joint Oireachtas Committee (JOC) on Housing, Local Government and Heritage as the General Scheme of the Bill will be undergoing pre-legislative scrutiny before the JOC prior to the commencement of legislative drafting. The appearance before the JOC is now expected to be scheduled early in 2022, once my Departments current legislative files are concluded. It is intended that drafting of the Bill will commence shortly after the appearance before the JOC with the introduction of the new legislation in Q2 2022 and that the new reforms will come into effect on the establishment of the Environmental and Planning Law Court which is also committed to in the Programme for Government.</p></reply>

This will allow each Local Authority, including Clare County Council, to determine any affordability constraint in their area based on the Housing Need and Demand Assessment and plan the provision of affordable homes accordingly. </p>  <p>  Additionally, Part 4 of the Affordable Housing Act provides for the First Home Affordable Purchase Shared Equity scheme, which will commence in 2022 and will be available in all counties. </p>  <p>  In addition the Help to Buy Scheme and the Local Authority Home loan scheme remain available nationally and make housing more affordable to purchasers. </p></reply>

The four Dublin local authorities already co-operate in arrangements that enable social housing applicants to apply for housing in one or two of the other Dublin authorities simultaneously.  The household can therefore be eligible to receive offers of a social housing dwelling from any of the three authorities. Similar arrangements apply in the two Cork and two Galway local authorities.  </p>  <p>  It is also already possible for households to move and relocate between housing authority areas under the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) Scheme where there is agreement between the two housing authorities concerned and where the household income is within the appropriate income limits. </p>  <p>  The issue of providing for wider mobility is being examined and further consultation with the local authority sector will be carried out. To date local authorities have indicated that the demand for such a scheme is likely to be low and that the operation of such a scheme would present significant administrative issues for the sector. </p>  <p>  I will look at proposals in relation to such wider movement in due course along with the other reform package measures.</p></reply>

Housing for All &ndash; A New Housing Plan for Ireland does that through a range of interventions and unprecedented investment with in excess of &euro;20 billion in funding over the next five years.</p>  <p>  Housing for All lays the foundation for an entirely new housing tenure in Ireland, Cost Rental, which will be a game changer for rent affordability. Approximately 18,000 Cost Rental homes will be delivered by Local Authorities, Approved Housing Bodies and the Land Development Agency  between now and 2030. In building to this scale, with an average of 2,000 Cost Rental homes per year, the State will provide certain focused funding supports to help delivery partners provide rental homes that target affordable rents at levels in the order of 25% below market rents. Delivery of Cost Rental at scale will have a stabilising effect on the wider rental market.</p>  <p>  The Residential Tenancies (No. 2) Act 2021 introduced measures in July 2021 to better protect tenants with affordability challenges by extending the operation of Rent Pressure Zones (RPZs) until the end of 2024 and prohibiting any necessary rent increase in a RPZ from exceeding general inflation, as recorded by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP). </p>  <p>  When introducing these measures, I was very clear on the need to carefully monitor inflation. At that time, HICP inflation averaged 0.73% p.a. over the previous 3 years but had risen to 1.6% p.a. in the year ending June 2021. I needed to revise the RPZ rent control relatively quickly in July, on a basis that could be independently verified. </p>  <p>  To address the rent affordability challenges building on foot of the fast rising inflation rate, as recorded by HICP (CSO preliminary data for October 2021 shows HICP inflation of 5.1% p.a.), I secured Government approval on 4 November to introduce a cap on rent increases in RPZs of no more than 2% per annum pro rata. In effect, this will mean that rents may only increase by HICP inflation or 2%, whichever is the lower. The Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Bill 2021 will be published shortly and is intended for priority enactment as soon as possible in December.</p></reply>

If upon review, a household is found to exceed the limits on income eligibility grounds, for example, they would be removed from the list. Furthermore, authorities are also required, when directed by the Minister, to undertake a statutory Summary of Social Housing Assessments (SSHA) to count the number of households on the waiting list for social housing supports whose need has not yet been met. The SSHA process requires all local authorities to review those households who are on their housing list but who are not currently in receipt of housing support.  </p>  <p>  The 2011 Regulations prescribe maximum net income limits for each local authority, in different bands according to the area concerned, with income being defined and assessed according to a standard Household Means Policy. The 2011 Regulations do not provide local authorities with any discretion to exceed the limits that apply to their administrative areas. </p>  <p>  The income bands are expressed in terms of a maximum net income threshold for a single-person household, with an allowance of 5% for each additional adult household member, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10% and separately a 2.5% allowance for each child. </p>  <p>  Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI, Universal Social Charge and Additional Superannuation Contribution. The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once-off in nature. However, with the exception of the specific payments listed in the Household Means Policy as being disregarded, all income from social insurance and social assistance payments, allowances and benefits is assessable. </p>  <p>  The determination of whether an applicant household meets the income criteria is based on a calculation of their preceding 12 months&rsquo; net average income prior to the date of receipt of application. This ensures that the most comprehensive picture of a household&rsquo;s current and previous income is available at the point of carrying out the assessment.</p>  <p>  The documentation required with regard to proof of income is set out in the social housing application form. A degree of discretion is permitted to the local authorities as to the extent of documentation the authority deems necessary to ascertain a household&rsquo;s average income over the preceding 12 months in order to satisfy themselves of the household&rsquo;s true income pattern. </p>  <p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced in 2011 also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing. </p>  <p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support. The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources. </p>  <p>  As part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is underway.  As set out in Housing for All - a New Housing Plan for Ireland, the efficiency of the banding model and its application to local authorities will be considered. Equivalisation as between singles and families will also be considered. The review will also have regard to new initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and Cost Rental housing.

My Department continues to keep the operation of the HAP scheme under review. Under Housing for All, my Department will undertake an analytical exercise to examine whether an increase in the level of discretion available to Local Authorities under HAP is required, in order to maintain adequate levels of HAP support.</p>  <p>  The Homeless HAP Place Finder service is an important aid for homeless households or households who are at risk of homelessness. The Place Finder service has proven effective, with HAP accounting for approximately 72% of the exits from homelessness recorded so far in 2021. </p></reply>

The General Scheme is available on my Department's website at www.gov.ie/en/publication/34cf6-general-scheme-of-the-electoral-reform-bill-2020.  The Joint Oireachtas Committee carried out a thorough pre-legislative scrutiny process, taking in the views of a wide range of stakeholders and policy experts over seven sessions between January and August of this year. The committee's pre-legislative scrutiny report was published in August and is available from the Oireachtas website at www.oireachtas.ie/en/committees/33/housing-local-government-and-heritage/.   The recommendations in the report are currently being considered by my Department. My Department is continuing to work with the Attorney General's Office on the drafting of the Electoral Reform Bill and good progress is being made. The Bill is on the list of priority legislation for publication in the autumn legislation programme.</p>  <p>  In addition to the legislative work that is being advanced, progress is also being made in respect of the practicalities of the Commission's establishment.  In this regard, a team was put in place earlier in the year and is working on the preparatory institutional and administrative arrangements for the Electoral Commission, pending its formal establishment. </p></reply>

The ICT system is currently being procured by the Local Government Management Agency on behalf of the Sector. It is envisaged that stock condition surveys will be completed over a four to five year period and begin once the ICT system to capture the stock condition data is in place.  This has been delayed somewhat owing to the Covid pandemic restrictions and it is likely therefore to be 2022 before surveys commence.</p>  <p>  A Planned Maintenance Programme will be introduced in 2022 to provide funding support alongside budgetary provisions made by local authority elected members for housing repairs and cyclical maintenance as part of the local authority annual budget process. Funding will remain available under the existing programmes of stock improvement works, such as, Voids, Grants and Remedial Works Scheme during the transition to a planned maintenance approach over the years 2022 and 2023.  </p></reply>

They co-ordinate and implement County Heritage Plans and work with local environmental and community groups to organise events.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government outlines our ambition to tackle the biodiversity crisis and provides a framework for meeting the challenges that we face in doing so. Local authorities are uniquely positioned, within their own biodiversity plans and working with communities, to help halt biodiversity loss. Biodiversity officers are a key part of this and are crucial to the implementation of actions for biodiversity at local and regional level.</p>  <p>  My Department is committed to supporting local authorities in the important role they play in the implementation of actions contained in the National Biodiversity Action Plan. Officials in my Department are working on a programme to facilitate the roll-out of biodiversity officers within local authorities nationwide. My Department&rsquo;s investment in the biodiversity officer programme, through support of local authorities, will enhance their efforts to deliver benefits for biodiversity. In that context, I have allocated &euro;600,000 in 2022 towards the programme.</p></reply>

This includes &euro;1.459 billion (Current &euro;629m and Capital &euro;830m) in respect of domestic water services provision by Irish Water. </p>  <p>  The overall investment will deliver significant improvements in our public water and waste water services, support improved water supplies right across Ireland, including rural Ireland, and support a range of programmes delivering improved water quality in our rivers, lakes and marine area. It is key to addressing Ireland's shortcomings in water and waste water infrastructure including compliance with the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive (UWWTD).</p>  <p>  In respect of Dublin Bay, the Ringsend wastewater treatment plant was originally designed and built to treat wastewater for a population equivalent of 1.64 million and is now overloaded. In response, Irish Water is currently undertaking a major upgrade of the plant. This upgrade will increase the capacity of the plant to cater for the growing population of the Greater Dublin Area and will address compliance with EU law.  Planning permission was granted for the project in April 2019, and the project is currently underway. </p>  <p>  In addition, my officials are currently examining the most suitable options to provide for safe bathing water during the winter months, and improve the dissemination of information around bathing water quality, particularly in the Dublin bay area. Both Minister Noonan and I have met with a number local interest groups for the Dublin Bay area, including the Dublin Bay SOS Group, and I am committed to developing a solution that will allow flexibility around the bathing season and the protection of those people who swim throughout the year. </p>  <p>  Ongoing work by the Dublin Bay Task Group, chaired by Dublin City Council is aimed at improving bathing water quality all year round. The work of this group, and the welcome commitment from Irish Water to operate its ultraviolet filter at Ringsend for a period outside of the bathing season are already providing improved protection for bathers, while also improving our knowledge of the quality of our bathing waters outside of the defined season.  </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to funding Irish Water's capital investment plan for drinking water and waste water infrastructure on a multi-annual basis and delivery of the funding package committed to in Project Ireland 2040. The National Development Plan (NDP) 2021-2030 (published on 4 October 2021) commits to almost &euro;6bn capital investment to be undertaken by Irish Water in the period from 2021-2025 of which over &euro;4.5 billion will be Voted Exchequer funded in respect of domestic water services also referenced under Housing for All.  This substantial and sustained investment will build on improvements in recent years to deliver enhanced environment conditions in our rivers, estuaries, lakes and coastal waters.</p></reply>

Core to this plan are four pathways, one of which relates to addressing vacancy and the efficient use of housing stock. I have been clear that at a time of such housing need, it is imperative that houses already available throughout the state are fully utilised. This makes sense economically, environmentally and for the benefit of our cities, towns and villages.  </p>  <p>  To this end, Housing for All commits to establishing and funding a Towns Centre First policy in conjunction with the Department of Rural and Community Development and aligned to the National Planning Framework. The Town Centre First policy will act as a strategic guide to town centre planning, at the heart of which is the promotion of residential occupancy in towns and villages. </p>  <p>  The new Croi Conaithe (Towns) Fund will provide serviced sites to enable refurbishment of vacant properties and attract new building in the centre of small towns and villages in line with the National Planning Framework. A pathfinder programme in this area aims to make available as many as 2,000 sites for homes by 2025. </p>  <p>  We will also launch a Compulsory Purchase Order programme, led by Local Authorities, in order to maximise the opportunity to return vacant properties to productive use. The plan also brings a renewed focus on ensuring that state owned properties are either reactivated or placed on the market. </p>  <p>  In addition, more than &euro;1.8bn has been allocated across the Urban Regeneration and Development Fund (URDF) and Rural Regeneration and Development Fund (RRDF) programmes towards projects to regenerate metropolitan areas and towns across the country. </p>  <p>  Finally, the Government has committed in Housing for All to examine the introduction of sanctions, possibly through the introduction of a Vacant Sites Tax, for non-use of residential property. The Local Property Tax returns currently underway will provide important data to inform these policy decisions moving forward. </p></reply>

Investment is primarily delivered through Irish Water, while my Department operates the Rural Water Programme directly.</p>  <p>  Since 1 January 2014, Irish Water has statutory responsibility for all aspects of water services planning, delivery and operation at national, regional and local levels. Irish Water takes a strategic, nationwide approach to asset planning and investment, and meeting customer requirements. The prioritisation and progression of individual projects and programmes is a matter for determination by Irish Water.</p>  <p>  Irish Water continues to improve water services for customers, through the delivery of its capital investment programmes.  As part of Budget 2022, I have secured funding of over &euro;1.5 billion to support water services. This includes &euro;1.4 billion in respect of domestic water services provision by Irish Water. In addition, the Programme for Government supports the uptake of Irish Water's Small Towns and Villages Growth Programme 2020-2024, which will provide water and waste water growth capacity in smaller settlements that would otherwise not be provided for in Irish Water's capital investment plan. </p>  <p>  Complementary to that Programme, my Department is also currently examining waste water requirements in the context of villages and similar settlements that do not have access to public waste water infrastructure. I have instructed the relevant officials in my Department to prepare a report on this topic at a national level.  This process is at an advanced stage, and I will be in a position to consider the matter once I have received the final report. </p>  <p>  In addition, my Department&rsquo;s Multi-annual Rural Water Programme provides capital funding under a number of measures relevant to the Deputy's enquiry on the development of small waste water collection networks that are connected to the Irish Water system.  Information on the scope of capital grants and their amounts under the current multi-annual programme were provided to local authorities as part of the bids process under Circular L1/19 on 8 February 2019. The Circular, including the Framework for the Programme, can be found on my Department&rsquo;s website at this link.</p>  <p>  The operation by community-based groups of their own waste water treatment facilities, which are technically more complex than group water scheme treatment facilities, has never been included under the Rural Water Programme. This is because of the difficulties for voluntary groups in managing and maintaining such facilities in the long-term.</p>  <p>  In addition, my Department has recently appointed an external consultant to prepare a report on the provision of research and information, to support a review of the wider investment needs relating to the Rural Water Sector. The complete report, which is scheduled to be delivered by the end of 2021, will focus on the governance, supervision, funding and wider investment needs relating to the Rural Water Sector.  The report will be used by the Rural Water Working Group, in its considerations of the wider long term objectives and needs of the Sector.</p></reply>

Over the period of the Strategy structures have been put in place at national and local level to ensure that local authorities plan and set targets for the housing of people with disabilities.  A review of the current Strategy is underway and a new Strategy will be put in place from January 2022. </p>  <p>  To provide for the specific housing needs of younger persons leaving the care system my Department provides funding to Approved Housing Bodies for the provision of housing for this group. In the case of migrants who are non-EU citizens their eligibility for social housing is determined by their legal status with regard to residence in Ireland. In the case of programme refugees these are accommodated by local authorities under the International Refugee Protection Programme and asylum seekers are accommodated under the Direct Provision System which will be replaced by a new accommodation system by 2024.</p>  <p>  Applications for social housing support are assessed by the relevant local authority, in accordance with the eligibility and need criteria set down in section 20 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and the associated Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011, as amended. All eligible households are entitled to access all of the housing support  mechanisms on an equal basis with all other citizens and local authorities work to ensure that all persons are treated with dignity and consideration regardless of age or ethnicity.</p>  <p>  To ensure maximum delivery of homes for those who need them, particularly marginalised groups, I and my Department, have ongoing and extensive engagement with all local authorities across all delivery streams. We meet regularly with local authorities to progress social housing and I know that they are deeply committed to ensuring that such housing is provided to all eligible applicants as speedily as possible and that the support needs of all applicants are appropriately assessed. In addition to these meetings, targeted sessions have been held between my Department and local authority senior management to specifically discuss all aspects of social housing delivery. </p></reply>

This is the biggest such programme in the history of the State. There will be an increase in supply across all tenure types, with over 90,000 social homes, 36,000 affordable homes and 18,000 cost rental homes to be delivered by 2030.</p>  <p>  The most recently published data on homelessness, for September 2021, showed that there were 8,475 individuals comprising 6,131 adults, 1,005 families and 2,344 child dependants in emergency accommodation.  There was an increase of 263 individuals overall on the total for August 2021.  The year on year position is that September 2021 showed a decrease of 181 individuals, or 2.1%, on the 8,656 total recorded in September 2020.  Since its highest level in October 2019 the numbers of individuals in emergency accommodation has decreased by 2,039, or 19%, from 10,514.</p>  <p>  The increase in homelessness seen in recent months is a serious concern for Government. While we have made significant improvements on the situation we were facing two years ago when homelessness was at its highest, there is still a lot of work to be done.</p>  <p>  Recognising some weeks ago that there were increased numbers of households presenting to homeless services, I convened meetings with senior officials from the local authorities where homelessness is most prevalent. The meetings took place on the 7th October last and were attended by officials from Dublin City Council, South Dublin, Fingal, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, Meath, Kildare, Cork City, Limerick City and County, Galway City and Waterford City and County Councils. I convened these meetings to discuss solutions, and to prioritise measures around homelessness preventions and exits.</p>  <p>  I also convened a meeting of the Task Force on Homelessness in recent weeks. This Group&rsquo;s members comprise the Dublin Region Homeless Executive, the Peter McVerry Trust, Dublin Simon Community, Focus Ireland, Threshold, DePaul, Crosscare and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul as well as senior officials from my Department. The significant focus was on the common effort needed to prevent homelessness wherever possible, and to exit those in emergency accommodation into homes.</p>  <p>  The challenges in addressing homelessness are complex and require meaningful cross-departmental and interagency engagement. To this end. I intend to establish a National Homeless Action Committee that will bring together all key State Departments, agencies and authorities. The role of the Committee will be to drive delivery of interagency actions in Housing for All and to work together in a collaborative manner in bringing forward solutions to address homelessness.</p></reply>

A rent increase limit of 4% per annum initially applied in Rent Pressure Zones (RPZs) . The introduction of the rent increase restriction in RPZs had regard to the constitutionally protected property rights of landlords and takes account of local rental market factors, providing certainty to tenants and landlords with regard to medium-term rent levels. </p>  <p>  Section 24A of the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004, as amended, provides that the Housing Agency, in consultation with housing authorities, may make a proposal to the Minister that an area should be considered as a Rent Pressure Zone.  Following receipt of such a proposal, the Minister requests the Director of the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) to conduct an assessment of the area to establish whether or not it meets the criteria for designation and to report to the Minister on whether the area should be designated as a Rent Pressure Zone (RPZ). </p>  <p>  The criteria to be satisfied by an area under section 24A(4) of the Residential Tenancies Act for designation as an RPZ are as follows: </p>  <p>  - the information relating to the area, as determined by reference to the information used to compile each RTB Rent Index quarterly report, shows that the annual rate of increase in the average amount of rent for that area is more than 7% in each of at least 4 of the 6 quarters preceding the period immediately prior to the date of the Housing Agency's proposal, and  </p>  <p>  - the average rent for the area in the last quarter, as determined by reference to the information used to compile each RTB Rent Index quarterly report, is &ndash;  </p>  <p>  -  in the case of counties Kildare, Meath and Wicklow or an LEA in any one of those counties, above the average rent in the State, excluding rents in the 4 Dublin Local Authority areas, or  </p>  <p>  -  in the case of any LEA outside of the Greater Dublin Area (i.e. Dublin, Kildare, Meath and Wicklow), above the average rent in the State, excluding rents in the Greater Dublin Area. </p>  <p>  Each RTB quarterly Rent Index Report includes a summary in Table 9 of the data used to establish whether each Local Electoral Area fulfils the criteria for designation as a Rent Pressure Zone. This ensures transparency in relation to the position of individual areas in terms of average rent levels and increases. </p>  <p>  Having regard to the constitutionally protected property rights of landlords, a blanket extension of the RPZ rent predictability measure to rental properties across the entire country or a ban on rent increases is considered legally questionable and highly vulnerable to legal challenge. The Housing Agency and the RTB will continue to monitor national rents and if any LEA meets the designation criteria it will be designated as a RPZ. </p>  <p>  The Residential Tenancies (No. 2) Act 2021 introduced measures in July 2021 to better protect tenants with affordability challenges by extending the operation of Rent Pressure Zones (RPZs) until the end of 2024 and prohibiting any necessary rent increase in a RPZ from exceeding general inflation, as recorded by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP).</p>  <p>  When introducing these measures, I was very clear on the need to carefully monitor inflation. At that time, HICP inflation averaged 0.73% p.a. over the previous 3 years but had risen to 1.6% p.a. in the year ending June 2021. I needed to revise the RPZ rent control relatively quickly in July, on a basis that could be independently verified.</p>  <p>  To address the rent affordability challenges building on foot of the unexpectedly fast rising inflation rate, as recorded by HICP (CSO preliminary data for October 2021 shows HICP inflation of 5.1% p.a.), I have secured Government approval on 4 November to introduce a cap on rent increases in RPZs of no more than 2% per annum pro rata. In effect, this will mean that rents may only increase by HICP inflation or 2%, whichever is the lower. The Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Bill 2021 will be published shortly and is intended for priority enactment as soon as possible in December.</p>  <p>  Since 1 July 2019, the RTB is empowered under Part 7A &ndash; Complaints, Investigations and Sanctions &ndash; of the Residential Tenancies Acts to investigate improper conduct by landlords and to impose sanctions, where appropriate. The breaches of rental law that the Investigations &amp;amp; Sanctions (I&amp;S) unit of the RTB can investigate include a contravention of the rent increase restriction and related procedures in Rent Pressure Zones (RPZs). The RTB has the power to impose sanctions if improper conduct by a landlord is found to have occurred, ranging from a formal written caution and/or a fine of up to &euro;15,000 and/or costs up to &euro;15,000. </p>  <p>  The Government is fully committed to ensuring that the full protections for tenants provided for in the Residential Tenancies Acts are applied. As of Quarter 2 2021, the RTB has commenced over 400 investigations into improper conducts and to date, almost &euro;260,000 has been refunded to current and former tenants as a direct result of breach of rent setting rules.   </p>  <p>  I have formally requested the RTB to escalate its response to non-compliance with the RPZ rent increase restriction, given its extensive investigation and sanction capabilities. An increase of &euro;2M in Current Exchequer Funding was made available to the RTB in 2020, bringing the total amount of funding available to the RTB for operational costs to &euro;9M for 2020.  </p>  <p>  An additional &euro;2M in Current Exchequer funding for RTB operational costs was secured in Budget 2021 bringing the total amount available to &euro;11M in 2021.</p></reply>

The Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) was established as an independent statutory body under the Act to operate a national tenancy registration system and to facilitate the resolution of disputes between landlords and tenants.  </p>  <p>  Since 1 July 2019, the RTB is empowered under Part 7A &ndash; Complaints, Investigations and Sanctions &ndash; of the Residential Tenancies Acts to investigate improper conduct by landlords and to impose sanctions, where appropriate. </p>  <p>  The breaches of rental law that the Investigations &amp;amp; Sanctions (I&amp;S) unit of the RTB can investigate include a contravention of the rent increase restriction and related procedures in Rent Pressure Zones (RPZs). The RTB has the power to impose sanctions if improper conduct by a landlord is found to have occurred, ranging from a formal written caution and/or a fine of up to &euro;15,000 and/or costs up to &euro;15,000.</p>  <p>  To date, the RTB has commenced over 400 investigations which are at varying stages in the investigation process. As of the end of Quarter 3 2021, 282 cases are in the investigation process. Over 130 cases have been issued to Decision Makers for Decision. The Decision Makers are legal professionals with extensive decision-making experience. </p>  <p>  In over 90 cases, the decision of the Decision Maker has been finalised and has been issued to the relevant landlord. Of the decisions issued to Landlords, to date over 70% of decisions have resulted in a sanction. </p>  <p>  Covid-19 greatly impacted the number of court confirmations as the Courts were closed for large parts of 2020/2021. By the end of July 2021, sanctions had been confirmed for 29 cases. These were the first cases to be heard by the Circuit Court under the new processes established by Part 7A of the Residential Tenancies Act. </p>  <p>  Since the Court&rsquo;s reopening after Summer Vacation, a further 8 applications for confirmation have been heard and confirmed (please note that in some of these cases the landlord may still choose to appeal the Circuit Court decision to the High Court should they wish to do so) and it is hoped to have more scheduled for hearing before the end of Quarter 4 2021.</p>  <p>  The RTB will continue to work with the Courts Services and will be making applications to relevant Circuit Courts for confirmation of sanctions on an ongoing basis. The RTB expects over 250 cases to be confirmed in 2022 as more cases come through the investigation pipeline, efficiencies in the process develop and access to the Circuit Court returns to pre-Covid operations. The RTB will publish the particulars of sanctions confirmed by the circuit court on its website once all legal and administrative processes have been completed. </p>  <p>  Since its inception, the Investigations and Sanctions Unit of the RTB has prioritised investigations into potential breaches of RPZ restrictions and during its first full year of operation in 2020, 92% of investigations related to a breach of RPZ. </p>  <p>  The RTB is continuing to use its proactive powers of investigation to identify and investigation potential breaches of RPZ rules.  I have requested that the full powers and resources of the RTB are brought to bear in initiating and executing a robust and thorough campaign to identify non-compliance and breaches of RPZ rent increase restrictions and related procedures, including those related to rent reviews and notification of exemption from the restrictions. In response to this, the RTB will activating a targeted and an incremental campaign over the coming weeks to identify tenancies where higher probabilities of non-compliance exist, to ensure such tenancies are compliant with all relevant legislation. </p></reply>

National Planning Objective (NPO) 19 aims to ensure that a policy distinction is made between areas experiencing significant &lsquo;overspill&rsquo; development pressure from urban areas within the commuter catchment of cities, towns and centres of employment, on the one hand, and remoter rural areas where population levels may be low and or declining, on the other. </p>  <p>  NPO 19 is aligned with the established planning approach as per the 2005 Guidelines, whereby considerations of social (intrinsic part of the community) or economic (persons working full or part-time) need may be applied by planning authorities in certain rural areas under urban influence in order to prevent urban sprawl.</p>  <p>  A working group was established to review and, where necessary, recommend changes to the 2005 Guidelines and this group met on five occasions between May 2017 and January 2019.  During this period, in 2018, the National Planning Framework (the NPF) was published and provides an important strategic basis for interpreting the 2005 Guidelines.  National Policy Objective (NPO) 15 of the NPF fully supports the concept of the sustainable development of rural areas by encouraging growth and arresting decline in areas that have experienced low population growth or decline in recent decades, while simultaneously indicating the need to manage certain areas around cities and towns.</p>  <p>  Updated Rural Housing Planning Guidelines are currently being prepared by my Department to ensure consistency with new requirements and legislation at national and EU level introduced in respect of areas related to rural housing such as environmental protection, the Gaeltacht and climate action. The new guidelines will ensure a more consistent approach between counties and alignment with NPF objectives, and will be prepared in draft before the end of 2021.</p></reply>

This scheme may return tax paid in the previous four years, up to a maximum amount of &euro;30,000, to eligible first-time buyers who can use this amount as a deposit when purchasing a newly constructed home. More information on the Help to Buy scheme is available online at: www.revenue.ie/en/property/help-to-buy-incentive/index.aspx. </p>  <p>  In relation to affordable housing measures more broadly, the Housing for All strategy delivers on the Programme for Government commitment to put affordability at the heart of the housing system. Over &euro;4 billion in funding is provided annually, representing the highest ever level of Government investment in building social and affordable housing. </p>  <p>  A multi-faceted approach is being implemented to deliver 54,000 affordable homes interventions between now and 2030.  This will be facilitated by local authorities, Approved Housing Bodies, the Land Development Agency, as well as through a strategic partnership between the State and retail banks,.</p>  <p>  Delivery of affordable housing, in accordance with the Local Authority Affordable Purchase Scheme established in Part 2 of the Affordable Housing Act 2021 will be underpinned by the preparation by each local authorities Housing Delivery Action Plan. This will allow each local authority to determine any affordability constraint in their area based on the Housing Need and Demand Assessment and plan the provision of affordable homes accordingly. Local authorities will be submitting their Plans to me, to include social and affordable housing, before the end of December 2021. </p>  <p>  Part 4 of the Affordable Housing Act provides for the &lsquo;First Home&rsquo; scheme to primarily support affordability-constrained first-time buyers to purchase privately developed new homes. This scheme will commence in 2022 and will be available at a national level.</p>  <p>  Part 3 of the Affordable Housing Act provides for the establishment of a Cost Rental sector in Ireland, through the designation by the Minister of Cost Rental dwellings. Budget 2021 allocated &euro;35 million to the Cost Rental Equity Loan (CREL) scheme which enabled the first Cost Rental homes to be delivered this year by the Cl&uacute;id AHB at Taylor Hill, Balbriggan. The tenanting processes for further Cost Rental homes at Enniskerry Road in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown and Barnhall, Leixlip, County Kildare, are currently underway. In total, 390 Cost Rental units will be delivered through this funding, with the initial focus being in the Greater Dublin Area and Cork. A further &euro;75 million was allocated in Budget 2022 to help meet the Housing for All target of 750 Cost Rental homes in 2022.</p>  <p>  The LDA will deliver both homes for affordable purchase and Cost Rental.  The Housing for All strategy outlined how the Land Development Agency through Project Tosaigh will seek to unlock stalled developments and accelerate the delivery of affordable homes.</p>  <p>  The Housing for All strategy also introduced the Local Authority Home Loan as a successor to the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan scheme. This new scheme will include an increase in the income ceiling for single applicants in urban areas, thus increasing the number of people eligible. Additionally, from 10 September 2021, I have already implemented a reduction of the mortgage interest rate by 0.25% for new borrowers under the existing Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan. This lower rate will also apply to loans issued under the forthcoming Local Authority Home Loan scheme.   </p>  <p>  Collectively, these measures will improve affordability for all families or individuals across society wishing to secure a home.   </p></reply>

Strict protections are likely to include areas such as ancient woodland and significant other carbon-rich ecosystems, such as peatlands, grasslands, wetlands and seagrass meadows. </p>  <p>  Specific criteria for identification of additional protected areas, the parameters of strict protection, and the question of burden-sharing across the EU27 in reaching the 30% target are still under discussion, however all Member States have been asked to nominate a list of existing protected areas (in addition to Natura 2000 sites) for selection, and to make an initial pledge for new areas to be protected as a contribution to reaching the 30% target across the EU as a whole.  These initial pledges will be discussed in a framework of biogeographical meetings with national authorities, relevant stakeholders and experts, which the Commission intends will take place over the next two years.  Ireland will be discussed with other Member States in the Atlantic biogeographical region.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, my Department is exploring a range of initiatives including the potential to designate areas of land within public and semi-state ownership, to meet the commitments of the Biodiversity Strategy.

In terms of eligibility, they will be targeted at households constrained by the maximum mortgage and deposit available to them. The schemes will bridge the gap between the market value and what the household can afford via the provision of equity support. The equity support can subsequently be redeemed at any time at the homeowner&rsquo;s discretion, or remain outstanding until the home is sold or passed on.</p>  <p>  The detailed design of the First Home is currently progressing for the scheme&rsquo;s introduction in 2022. Eligibility will be informed by the Central Bank&rsquo;s macro-prudential rules, along with designated price ceilings established by area for the scheme. Price ceilings for eligible homes and the maximum level of support available will be confirmed in advance of the scheme&rsquo;s operation.</p>  <p>  The first Cost Rental homes were delivered by the Approved Housing Body Cl&uacute;id at Taylor Hill, Balbriggan, in August 2021, utilising funding from the Cost Rental Equity Loan scheme. The eligibility criteria  for prospective tenants was agreed with my Department on an administrative basis, given the need to occupy these homes as soon as possible. For Taylor Hill, tenants were required to prove that their net household income was below &euro;53,000 per annum, that they were not in receipt of any social housing supports, that their household size matches the size of the property advertised, that they could afford to pay the cost rent for the home and that their household had only entered one application for a specific cost rental property.</p>  <p>  With the relevant elements of the Act relating to the local authority Affordable Purchase Scheme (Part 2) and Cost Rental (Part 3) commenced, it is my intention to make further Regulations governing the eligibility and price ceilings that will be applicable to these schemes in the near future. </p></reply>

This funding was introduced originally to tackle long term vacant units and is now increasingly targeted to support authorities to ensure minimal turnaround and re-let times for vacant stock.  </p>  <p>  In 2021, Kerry County Council was allocated &euro;1.56 million under the Voids Programme to remediate 78 vacant properties. My Department will continue to support the council in their work remediating vacant social housing properties. Details of the 2022 Voids Programme will be finalised in early 2022.</p>  <p>  My Departments Energy Efficiency Programme also provides funding support to local authorities for retrofitting works which, can be carried out across all local authority properties. The budget for this programme increased substantially in 2021 to &euro;65 million. Kerry County Council received an allocation of &euro;1.38 million to upgrade 51 properties. Their allocation under the 2022 programme will be announced early next year. </p>  <p>  Local authorities will always have a level of vacancy in their housing stock. This will fluctuate over time, as tenancy surrender and re-letting of stock is an ongoing process. Therefore, ongoing data in relation to vacant local authority owned homes are not collated by my Department.</p>  <p>  However, statistics in relation to social housing stock, at a point in time, are published by the National Oversight and Audit Commission (NOAC) in their Annual Reports on Performance Indicators in Local Authorities. These reports provide a range of information in relation to social housing stock, including levels of vacancy in local authority owned properties. The most recent report, relating to 2020, is available on the NOAC website at the following link: </p>  <p>  noac.ie/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/NOAC-Local-Authority-Performance-Indicator-Report-2020.pdf</p>  <p>  It is important to note that my Department and local authorities supported by the Local Government Management Association  are working to transition from a largely response and voids based approach to housing stock management and maintenance to a planned maintenance approach as referenced in Housing for All, policy objective 20.6. This will require the implementation of centrally hosted ICT system to support the completion of stock condition surveys by all local authorities and the subsequent development of strategic and informed work programmes which will be supported by my Department&rsquo;s stock improvement funding programmes. It is envisaged surveys will commence early in 2022.</p></reply>

The proposals were evaluated and prioritised on the basis of the:</p>  <p>  - Area Risk Categorisation of the fire station (population, fire risks, etc.);</p>  <p>  - established Health and Safety needs;</p>  <p>  - state of development of the project (is site acquired?, etc.); and </p>  <p>  - value for money offered by the proposal.</p>  <p>  This new Programme will see six new fire stations built, continued support for the construction of a further 12 new fire stations, nine fire station refurbishments as well as the allocation of 35 new fire engines. In order to maximise the available Capital Programme funding, my Department re-assesses the status of projects in the Programme on an annual basis, and some flexibility is normally available to advance projects that are ready and that offer best value-for-money taking account of the state of readiness of projects more generally. </p>  <p>  Project consideration stages in my Department include submission of preliminary and detailed appraisals; submission of design brief; selection of site; application for approval in principle; appointment of design consultants; submission of a preliminary design; planning application; submission of preliminary cost plan, detailed design and cost plans; and tender process and construction stages - each step subject to approval from my Department.</p>  <p>  I understand that there was an historic project application in relation to the fire station in Rathdowney that did not eventually progress as proposed and that, in 2017, Laois County Council put in place an extension on to Rathdowney Fire Station, consisting of separate male and female toilets, a shower cubicle and a new muster bay. While a new fire station at Rathdowney is not currently included in my Department&rsquo;s 2021 &ndash; 2025 Fire Services Capital Programme, it is included in a list for annual review.

This will enable the accelerated delivery of housing on key development sites in urban areas of high demand. LIHAF was designed to specifically address the issue of housing supply, a crucial factor in terms of house prices. 30 projects were approved with an overall budget of &euro;195.7m, &euro;146.8m Exchequer funded and the remainder funded by local authorities. </p>  <p>  The Midleton Water-Rock LIHAF infrastructure includes services corridor link roads, trunk surface water drainage and other road/junction improvements and received original funding of &euro;5.5m of which the Department will fund &euro;4.13m.  Cork County Council issued an invitation for the works 3 August 2021 and the tender submission return date was 17 September 2021. The Council is currently in the process of concluding the tender evaluation process for construction of the Water-Rock works. It is expected that this process will be concluded by the end of November 2021 and will have identified the most economically advantageous tender. Cork County Council has advised that it intends to make a submission on this matter to my Department shortly thereafter. </p>  <p>  Commencement of infrastructure construction is dependent on receiving approval from my Department and full implementation of the Section 47 agreements by the Landowners. Section 47 Agreements between the Landowners and the Council were countersigned by the Chief Executive of Cork County Council 31 July 2021.  Subject to both conditions above it is intended that the construction phase will commence in Q1 2022.   </p></reply>

Local authority fire services are delivered by approximately 3,300 local authority staff engaged at 217 fire stations nationwide. 16 of these stations being staffed by full-time firefighters, a further 4 are mixed full-time and retained, and 197 are staffed by retained firefighters, with approximately 2,065 retained firefighters around the country. It is important to note that the numbers of fire service front-line staff have been maintained at a constant high level throughout the economic challenges of the past number of years, even when staffing numbers, by necessity, were reduced in other areas of the local authority sector. </p>  <p>  In 2013, my Department published 'Keeping Communities Safe (KCS) - A Framework for Fire Safety in Ireland'. The adoption of KCS as national policy saw national norms/ standards being established for fire services in Ireland for the first time, against which local authority fire services could benchmark themselves.   The report of the Fire Service Validation Group, ' Fire Services in Ireland, Local Delivery - National Consistency', published in 2016, noted the staffing arrangements in place in fire services across Ireland to achieve these standards and that fire services manage staffing levels in fire stations to achieve the national standards of fire service response.</p>  <p>  The prioritisation of work and effective management of all resources is, in the first instance, a matter for management in each of the fire services, based on their assessment of local risk, needs and resources. In relation to the staffing requirements in each local authority, under the Local Government Act, 2001 it is the responsibility of each Chief Executive to employ such staff and to make such staffing, funding, recruitment and organisational arrangements as may be deemed necessary for the purposes of carrying out the functions of their local authority.The provision of fire services by local authorities is based on a risk management approach which involves an analysis of the nature of the fire hazards and the incidence and extent of fires which occur, as well as the fire protection measures in place. There has been a welcome downward trend in the incidence of fire, with the fire fatality rate per million of population, using a three-year average, currently at 4.3 deaths per million of population. While each death is one too many, this figure is a third of what it was twenty years ago when it stood at 12.9 deaths per million of population and positions Ireland among countries with very low fire fatality rates.</p>  <p>  In relation to issues regarding recruitment and retention within the retained fire service; the Management Board of the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management has approved a proposal for undertaking a review of the model of local authority &lsquo;retained&rsquo; fire services delivery, with particular emphasis on the recruitment and retention of staff. The objective is to explore and understand the issues which are impacting on service delivery, to undertake research and analysis and to propose options which will underpin the continuing provision of effective and inclusive local authority fire services into the future.  </p></reply>

This will allow each local authority to assess the level of demand with affordability constraint in their area based on the Housing Need and Demand Assessment and plan provision accordingly.</p>  <p>  Funding to support local authority delivery of affordable housing was made available through the Serviced Sites Fund (SSF). Following the Programme for Government commitment to extend the SSF, a progress review of SSF projects was undertaken. Considering feedback from local authorities, significant improvements to the scheme, now named the Affordable Housing Fund, have been agreed and communicated to local authorities by Circular in June 2021.   </p>  <p>  In relation to the scheme governing the affordable purchase of local authority provided or arranged affordable housing, it is intended that regulations regarding income eligibility in respect of the Local Authority Affordable Purchase Scheme will be in place shortly.  </p></reply>

Were the individual to have made a financial gain in releasing their rights to the property, such as being bought out by the other party who remains resident in it, they would be deemed to have been compensated for their interest in the property, and therefore not be eligible as a first-time buyer.</p><p>The final decision on loan approval is a matter for the relevant local authority and its credit committee on a case-by-case basis. Decisions on all housing loan applications must be made in accordance with the Regulations establishing the scheme and the credit policy that underpins the scheme, in order to ensure prudence and consistency in approaches in the best interests of both borrowers and the lending local authorities.</p><p>As part of Housing for All, a &lsquo;Fresh start&rsquo; principle will apply to applications to State-run affordable housing and loan schemes in future. This means that people who are divorced/separated and no longer have a financial interest in the family home, or who have undergone bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings, will be eligible to apply for State loan schemes. </p><p>Therefore, the successor to the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan, the 'Local Authority Home Loan', will apply this 'Fresh start' principle.  </p><p>Local authority mortgage protection insurance (MPI) scheme has applied to all house purchase loans approved by local authorities after 1 July 1986, including the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan introduced on 1 February 2018. </p><p>One of the conditions of the MPI scheme, which is a group policy, is that it is obligatory for all local authority borrowers who meet the eligibility criteria to join the scheme. Altering this condition would have a negative impact on the scheme and increase the cost for all existing borrowers. A local authority housing loan applicant, who is not eligible for the local authority MPI scheme, must source a suitable comparable individual MPI policy from the market.</p><p>I look forward to announcing further details in respect of the Local Authority Home Loan in the coming months. </p></reply>

The HAP scheme is legislated for under Part 4 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014.

Oversight of the LDA, as a commercial state body, will be by way of a Shareholder Letter of Expectation (SLE). The SLE will include the objectives to be met by the LDA, the expected achievements of the Agency and the return expected by the shareholders, which will be the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage  and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. The LDA will also be required to produce a five year business and financial plan which will outline the LDA's strategy, its planned investments and appropriate financial targets. </p>  <p>  Under Section 9 of the LDA Act, the LDA will also be required to report to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage  on its progress with regards to the achievement of the purposes of the Act on 31 March 2024, and every five years thereafter, as committed to under the Programme for Government. This will be in addition to the Annual Report on the performance of its functions to be published each year by the Agency under Section 48 of the Act. </p>  <p>  Additionally, under Section 52 of the LDA Act, the LDA shall furnish a report to Government every 2 years detailing how public lands are being utilised and identifying any lands which may be appropriate for the LDAs objectives. The first report to be provided by the LDA to Government is required to be submitted within 12 months of the coming into operation of Section 52 of the Act. </p>  <p>  In relation to housing delivery, the Housing for All strategy allocated &euro;1 billion to the LDA through Project Tosaigh to unlock stalled developments and accelerate the delivery of affordable homes, with a specific target of 5,000 affordable homes to 2026, the majority being cost rental.

As such, they are not covered by the statutory framework for employees on issues such as maternity leave, sick leave and annual leave.</p>  <p>  As matters stand, however, under the provisions of Section 18 of the Local Government Act 2001, councillors may be absent from the role for maternity purposes. Under Section 18, a councillor shall be deemed to have automatically resigned from membership of a local authority if he or she is absent from meetings for a continuous period of 6 consecutive months.  Where the absence is due to illness or &ldquo;in good faith for another reason&rdquo;, then the period of absence may be extended first to 12 months and then to up to 18 months by resolution of the Council.</p>  <p>  A councillor who is absent for 6 months will continue to receive the full amount of his or her Representational Payment, currently worth &euro;25,788 per annum. Thereafter this payment is reduced by 50% for absences of 6 to 12 months duration. A councillor who is absent for more than 12 months will not receive any further payments regardless of the reason for the absence. </p>  <p>  With effect from January 2017, the Social Welfare Acts were amended so that councillors gained access to the same benefits as self-employed contributors.  Accordingly, councillors are now reckonable for the purposes of accessing Class S benefits, including Maternity Benefit.   </p>  <p>  Following the publication of Ms Sara Moorhead S.C.&rsquo;s Review of the Role and Remuneration of Local Authority Elected Members, I approved the establishment of a working group of key local government stakeholders, including councillor representative organisations.  The working group was tasked with drawing up an Action Plan for examination and implementation of the non-pay related recommendations in the Moorhead Report. Addressing these non-pay issues, together with the significant pay reforms for elected members that were approved by Government and brought into effect on 1st July 2021, will facilitate the retention of existing councillors, while also maximising the accessibility of local government to future candidates.  </p>  <p>  As I believe that the issue of maternity leave warrants urgent attention and includes wider matters and supports other than maternity leave, I asked the local government stakeholder working group to establish a subgroup specifically to examine all maternity-related matters for councillors.  This group, which is a representative and cross political party group of women councillors, has met a number of times to date, and has given my officials and I greater understanding of the needs of women councillors in this regard. </p>  <p>  My officials are working closely with the Office of the Attorney General on the legal issues identified.  My intention, over the coming months, is to bring forward a package of maternity-related measures, including proposals for legislative change, which councillors will be able to avail of. I am determined to address as a matter of urgency, in a progressive and comprehensive manner. This will help to ensure that councillors are more fully representative of the constituents they serve, but also that the role of the councillor is accessible, manageable and sustainable for all.</p></reply>

They are subject to ongoing review in the interests of safety and the well-being of persons in the built environment and to ensure that due regard is taken of changes in construction techniques, technological progress and innovation. Part M of the Building Regulations deals with Access and Use. The associated Technical Guidance Document M provides guidance indicating how the requirements of Part M can be achieved in practice. Where works are carried out in accordance with TGD M, this will, <i>prima facie</i>, indicate compliance with Part M of the Second Schedule of the Building Regulations.</p><p>Part M of the Building Regulations aims to foster an inclusive approach to the design and construction of the built environment. While the Part M requirements may be regarded as a statutory minimum level of provision, the accompanying technical guidance encourages building owners and designers to have regard to the design philosophy of universal design and to consider making additional provisions where practicable and appropriate.</p><p>In December 2020, my Department established a Working Group to examine the provision for a changing places toilet in certain buildings. A changing places toilet offers larger supported facilities that address the needs of people for whom current accessible sanitary accommodation is inadequate. These facilities enable people with complex care needs to take part in everyday activities such as travel, shopping, family days out or attending a sporting event.</p><p>The plenary Working Group has met six times to date, in addition to a number of sub-group meetings.  Draft documentation, which includes Draft Building Regulations (Part M Amendment) Regulations 2021, Draft Technical Guidance Document M &ndash; Access and Use 2021 and a Regulatory Impact Analysis, is currently being prepared  to support a  public consultation in the matter later this year.</p></reply>

A further &euro;75 million was allocated for the delivery of Cost Rental homes in Budget 2022. </p>  <p>  A total of 390 Cost Rental homes were approved under this first tranche of CREL funding in early 2021. Twenty five of these homes, being the first Cost Rental homes to be designated in Ireland, were acquired by the Cl&uacute;id AHB at Taylor Hill, Balbriggan. The first tenants moved in to Taylor Hill from 28 August 2021. The cost-covering rents for these homes is approximately 40% below comparable open-market prices in the area, ranging from &euro;935 per month for a two-bed terraced house to &euro;1,150 for a four-bed detached house. Cl&uacute;id has also commenced their tenant selection for a further 56 Cost Rental homes at Barnhall in Leixlip, Co. Kildare. </p>  <p>  In addition to these 390 homes, another 50 Cost Rental apartments are currently being constructed at Enniskerry Road, Stepaside, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, by the Respond and Tuath AHBs, alongside 105 social housing units. Construction of these purpose-built Cost Rental homes is due to be completed before the end of the year and the tenant selection process is underway. </p>  <p>  Delivery of CREL homes is subject to construction schedules, which, together with housing projects more generally, were impacted by COVID delays at the beginning of this year. The initial timeframes submitted by AHBs were based on all efforts being made to deliver the homes as soon as possible. As AHBs sought to use CREL funding to allow developers to construct homes that may otherwise not have been delivered, the commencement of construction on these specific units was, in most instances, not possible until the lifting of relevant COVID restrictions.</p>  <p>  Under the Housing for All Strategy, the Government recently confirmed it is intended that approximately 18,000 Cost Rental homes will be delivered by Local Authorities, AHBs and the LDA by 2030. In building to this scale and with an average of 2,000 Cost Rental Units per year, the State will provide certain focused funding supports to help delivery partners to provide rental homes targeting affordable rents, at levels in the order of 25% below market rents.  </p></reply>

Individual targets for the delivery of social housing have been provided to each local authority for the period 2022 - 2026 and under Housing for All, each local authority is required to develop a Housing Delivery Action Plan by December 2021. These plans will set out details on how and when local authorities will deliver their social housing targets.</p>  <p>  Details on social housing delivery for each local authority, across the various delivery mechanisms, are included in the social housing statistics published by my Department. This data allows for monitoring the progress of each local authority and is available to the end of Quarter 2 2021 on the statistics page of my Department&rsquo;s website, at the following link: www.gov.ie/en/collection/6060e-overall-social-housing-provision/. </p>  <p>  Details on the number of households qualified for social housing support in each local authority administrative area are provided in the annual statutory Summary of Social Housing Assessments (SSHA).

A key objective is that everyone in the State should have access to a home to purchase or rent at an affordable price, built to a high standard and in the right place, offering a high quality of life. </p><p>Aligned with our overall National Planning Framework (NPF) objective for compact growth, vibrant, liveable cities and towns must offer options for both owner occupiers and renters, at all income levels.  The new Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe<b></b>fund as outlined in Housing for All, is intended to ensure that aligned with the objectives of the NPF, additional choices are made available to home buyers in our urban cores, and town centres.It will do this by working to extend home ownership options, where the choice is currently limited:</p><p>- In urban areas, for apartment living in developments over a certain height/density threshold;</p><p>- In towns, where options for building new private dwellings have been constrained by the lack of serviced sites. </p><p>In relation to towns, particular  challenges arise for facilitating owner-occupation in towns, where viable sites available for building of new homes are in short supply. There is significant potential for local authorities to support homeownership in these areas by making available serviced sites at a reduced cost or providing support towards the refurbishment of vacant properties where the level of vacancy or dereliction is high.  A pathfinder programme will be initiated as part of a Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe (Towns) fund, to facilitate the making available of some 2,000 sites for homes by 2025.</p><p>Both the Towns and Cities elements of Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe will work alongside other related funds such as the Affordable Housing Fund and complement measures forthcoming in the Towns Centre First (TCF) policy framework, details of which are expected to be finalised before the end of 2021.  </p></reply>

Over 300,000 new homes will be built by the end of 2030, including a projected 90,000 social homes, 36,000 affordable purchase homes and 18,000 cost rental homes.</p><p>The Plan is backed by historic levels of investment with in excess of &euro;20bn through the Exchequer, the Land Development Agency and the Housing Finance Agency over the next 5 years. This will provide the sector with the stability and certainty it needs.  <b></b></p><p>Indications of increased construction activity are becoming evident which will help increase the supply and availability of housing.</p><p>There is a strong supply pipeline, with latest Commencement Notices data showing that in the year to September 2021, 30,519 residential units were commenced, up 40% year-on-year, when compared to the same period to September 2020. The number of homes for which Commencement Notices were provided in September 2021 (3,203) was up 48% on August&rsquo;s figure.</p><p>11,150 units were granted planning permission in Q2 2021, a 16.6% increase compared with pre-pandemic levels in Q2 2019 (9,566).</p><p>The CSO&rsquo;s Quarter 3 2021 New Dwellings Completion Report shows the number of new homes becoming available for use in the year was 24,156: a 7% increase when compared to the year to Q3 2020 (22,585).  <b></b></p><p>With regard to social and affordable housing delivery, and in line with Housing for All, each local authority is required to develop a Housing Delivery Action Plan by end December 2021. The Plans will set out details of both social and affordable housing delivery, as appropriate, over the period 2022-2026, in line with targets set under Housing for All.</p><p>The Social Housing Construction Status Report (CSR) published by my Department outlines the ongoing delivery of social housing across the country. The CSR provides a breakdown of local authority and approved housing body social housing new-build activity from 2016 to date. The Report includes scheme level details on the completion of social housing new builds, as well as information on each construction scheme as it progresses through the design and tender processes.</p><p>The most recent report for Quarter 2, shows that there were 8,755 social homes onsite with an additional 9,128 homes at design and tender stage. During Quarter 2 2021, 137 new construction schemes, (1,883 homes) were added to the pipeline.</p><p>Early delivery of affordable housing will principally arise from previously approved Serviced Sites funding of local authority schemes where construction is commenced and, in early 2022, via the First Homes scheme. There are three Serviced Sites Fund projects on-site which will cumulatively assist in the delivery of 205 affordable homes. &euro;55m has been allocated to the Affordable Housing Fund (formerly the Serviced sites Fund) which will support the delivery of 500 affordable purchase homes in 2022, to be delivered through local authorities.</p><p>In addition, the Affordable Housing Act, 2021 provides the statutory basis for a new tenure in Ireland: Cost Rental. Budget 2021 allocated &euro;35 million to the Cost Rental Equity Loan (CREL) scheme which enabled the first Cost Rental homes to be delivered this year by the Cl&uacute;id AHB at Taylor Hill, Balbriggan. The tenanting processes for further Cost Rental homes at Enniskerry Road in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown and Barnhall, Leixlip, County Kildare, are currently underway. In total, 390 Cost Rental units will be delivered through this funding, with the initial focus being in the Greater Dublin Area and Cork. A further &euro;75 million was allocated in Budget 2022 to help meet the Housing for All target of 750 Cost Rental homes in 2022.</p><p>Housing for All requires an innovative construction sector that will support the development of its existing workforce, including through lifelong learning, and presents an attractive and sustainable career for those preparing to enter the labour force.</p><p>The industry will be supported in returning existing workers to full employment, and there will be proactive engagement to attract international labour, where supply is restricted locally. In this regard, Minister of State for Business, Employment and Retail, Damien English TD, recently announced changes to the employment permits system for workers from outside the European Economic Area (EEA), in order to increase the number of skilled construction workers.</p><p>In support of the development of Housing for All, the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN) undertook an analysis of the labour required to deliver on the Plan&rsquo;s annual targets, including at occupational level. This analysis has informed the labour demand forecast of 67,500 i.e. an additional 27,500 workers, for the construction of new builds by 2025, in order to keep pace with an expected graduated increase in annual supply to 33,000 homes in that year. Efforts to expand the workforce will operate to this timeline.</p><p>These efforts are being informed by a range of forecasts, undertaken by the EGFSN, across all construction activities. Forecasts in the EGFSN&rsquo;s 2020 report Building Future Skills: The Demand for Skills within Ireland&rsquo;s Built Environment Sector to 2030 are being updated in line with the labour demand estimates for housing, as well as estimates from an EGFSN study on the Climate Action Plan&rsquo;s retrofit targets and the construction of renewable energy projects.</p><p>Education and training output will also be aligned and expanded with these requirements, in order to accommodate the different demands on the construction sector, for example through implementation of the Action Plan on Apprenticeship 2021-2025, which aims to increase apprenticeship registrations to 10,000 per annum.</p><p>As of Q2 2021, CSO data indicates that there were 127,100 employed in the construction sector. It must be borne in mind that the workforce involved in new build construction is just a sub-set of this figure.</p><p>Through the EGFSN Secretariat's close engagement with relevant stakeholders, the analysis, which includes detailed breakdown and forecasts of skills needs at occupational level, as well as recommendations aimed at enhancing skills supply across the Built Environment sector, is informing skills planning across Government, industry and the education and training system, to ensure that the Government's ambitions in Housing for All are delivered upon.</p></reply>

Funding is provided to organisations on an annual basis to promote the Irish language outside of the Gaeltacht and some of these include Gaillimh le Gaeilge, Gn&oacute; Mhaigh Eo, Cill Dara le Gaeilge, An Taibhdhearc, and An Cumann Scoildr&aacute;ma&iacute;ochta. I also hope to be in a position to announce specific funding for the promotion of the language in Dublin shortly.  The aim of these organisations is to implement a strategy that will increase the visibility of the Irish language, increase opportunities for the use of the language, especially within the business community, and ensure that the language is more heard in the cities. </p><p>Gl&oacute;r na nGael's schemes, Fond&uacute;ireacht Sheosaimh Mhic Dhonncha and Sc&eacute;im Teanga T&iacute; are also supported through the Irish Language Support Schemes - the former supporting the use of the language in the GAA  and the latter aimed at communities of Gaelscoileanna.</p><p>The purpose of the capital assistance provided under this fund is the strengthening of Irish as a community and family language in accordance with the objectives of The Gaeltacht Act 2012 and the 20 Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-2030.  This funding is provided to assist with the cost of refurbishing existing Irish Language Centres, developing new builds, and to purchase equipment for such venues.  The following organisations in the capital are being funded from my Department: </p><p><b>Conradh na Gaeilge</b>The flagship headquarters of Conradh na Gaeilge at no. 6 Harcourt Street has received planning permission and its development as an Irish Language Centre is referenced in the National Development Plan. </p><p><b>Gaelphobal Thamhlachta</b>This project involved the development of an Irish Language Centre situated in Tallaght village.</p><p><b>&Aacute;ras Chr&oacute;n&aacute;in, Cluain Dolc&aacute;in</b>This long-standing Irish Language Centre situated in Clondalkin was provided with funding for the upgrade of facilities. </p><p>As the Deputy is no doubt already aware, a firm commitment was made in the Programme for Government that a network of Irish Language and Cultural Centres, promoting a community-based approach in the promotion of the Irish Language, would be developed in Dublin and on a nationwide basis.</p><p>This commitment builds on commitments made in the past in relation to Irish Language and Cultural Centres under the 5-Year Plan for the Irish Language 2018-2022 and under the National Development Plan 2018-2027.  A commitment to developing a comprehensive language plan for Dublin City is also contained in the 20-Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-2030.  </p><p>Significant progress has been achieved in regards to the implementation of the Language Planning Process as defined under the Gaeltacht Act 2012.  To date, Language Plans have been approved in respect 24 Gaeltacht Language Planning Areas, 4 Gaeltacht Service Towns and 3 Irish Language Networks. </p><p>A significant increase was provided in budget 2021 in respect of the Language Planning Process. An overall budget of &euro;5m has been provided for the preparation and implementation of language plans along with a range of initiatives central to the process as follows, Family, Early Years and the Traditional Arts.  This budget has been increased again to &euro;5.8m for 2022.  As it relates to Dublin, it is worth noting that one of the approved Irish Language Networks under the Act is Clondalkin, the language plan for which was approved in January 2020.  Further information on the scheme can be found on my Department's website . </p></reply>

Under the SCEP, grants of up to &euro;300,000 are available to community organisations, sports clubs, national governing bodies of sport and local authorities to develop or refurbish sports facilities. The LSSIF is designed to provide financial support to sports projects where the grant sought is greater than the maximum available under the SCEP. The first allocations under the LSSIF were announced in January 2020 and to date approximately &euro;86.4m has been provisionally awarded to 33 different proposals. </p>  <p>  Dublin City Council's proposal for the development of Dalymount Park was among the successful projects and a grant of &euro;918,750 was awarded towards the cost of bringing the project to tender stage. The evaluation procedures and guidelines for the LSSIF provide that once provisional allocations are announced, the projects being suggested for funding undergo a further process of due diligence.  This process has been completed for the Dalymount project and a formal grant agreement has been signed by Dublin City Council and my Department. Design work has commenced and it is expected that it should advance so that planning permission for the development can be sought in the second quarter of 2022. This is with a view to tendering for construction works later that year subject to funds being available for same. Dublin City Council has yet to drawdown funds in respect of the project but I understand that a request for funding will be made to my Department before the end of the year.</p>  <p>  In relation to Tolka Park, as the stadium is owned by Dublin City Council, any future plan for the ground is a matter for the Council in the first instance and I understand that no definitive decision has been taken in that regard.</p>  <p>  While it is not proposed to open the LSSIF for new applications at present, my Department is undertaking a review of the LSSIF which is expected to be complete shortly. This review will look at, inter alia, progress on all existing grants and the timing of a new call for proposals will also be considered. </p>  <p>  Any future application for funding for either Dalymount or Tolka Park under either the SCEP or LSSIF will be considered on its own merits in line with the relevant assessment criteria.</p></reply>

Tourism has been devastated by the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the necessary public health restrictions introduced to control it. Now, as our economy and society begins to open up, we have an opportunity to reconfigure our tourism sector and to more meaningfully address sustainable development and management within the tourism ecosystem.</p>  <p>  I recently brought a report to Government, developed by the Sustainable Tourism Working Group, which identifies a suite of actions that will promote sustainable tourism practices which can be implemented prior to the development of a new national tourism policy. The actions identified in this interim action plan will help to form a clear narrative for communicating about the sustainability agenda, build a better understanding and awareness among tourism stakeholders and allow for visitors to practice responsible tourism. The successful implementation of the interim action plan, along with the guiding principles that were developed in 2019, will underpin the advancement of a new tourism policy which will mainstream sustainability. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, in Budget 2022, I secured a record level of funding for tourism. This funding will support measures to help address short-term survival-related concerns and also enable recovery across industry as we reopen to international tourism and begin to transition to a more sustainable future. This funding will also allow the tourism agencies to deliver on their commitments in the interim action plan. For example, next year F&aacute;ilte Ireland will develop and roll out a suite of supports and workshops to help tourism businesses to implement sustainability best practice and leverage the benefits for their business. Tourism Ireland will create new sales and marketing opportunities for those sustainable tourism businesses that want to grow their international business. </p>  <p>  Measures such as these will shine a light on areas and destinations at home that are striving to be best in class in terms of sustainability and provide better access to information and tools for the tourism industry and visitors to practice responsible tourism. As we rebuild our tourism sector we will seek to realise Ireland&rsquo;s ambition to be amongst the world-leaders in sustainable tourism practices and set out a path for a green transition of the tourism industry and our destinations to become leading sustainable tourism destinations. Many parts of Ireland are very well positioned to advance down this path, including the Deputy's own West Cork which, with its strong food and cultural focus and spectacular scenery and natural heritage, has built a very strong international awareness of all that it has to offer.</p></reply>

The resilience of these sectors, in the face of the extraordinary circumstances of the pandemic, has been remarkable, particularly as many were among the first sectors to close and are the last to return to full capacity. </p>  <p>  I am greatly  heartened at the response to and uptake of the various supports, both horizontal and sectoral, that have been put in place.  Recognising that resilience and the hugely important role that these sectors play in Ireland's collective economic and social well-being, I will continue to work with the stakeholders to  monitor the evolving situation and to work with my Government colleagues to support these sectors and, with officials and Government colleagues, to support a strong and stable recovery as we emerge from the pandemic.</p></reply>

As we rebuild this vital sector, which supports livelihoods all across Ireland, we have an opportunity to ensure that the sector recovers and grows in a way which delivers social and economic gain to cities, towns and villages all across Ireland, more evenly spread throughout the year, and in a manner that protects our unique environment. The significant additional funding that I have secured for tourism services in Budget 2022 will help address immediate survival-related concerns while also enabling further resilience and recovery across industry as we reopen to international tourism and transition to a more sustainable future. </p>  <p>  The  funding for Tourism in Budget 2022 amounting to &euro;288.5m represents an increase of &euro;67.6m over the 2021 allocation. This includes &euro;50m funding for further Tourism Business Continuity Supports to assist strategic tourism businesses with their survival and recovery.  This funding will assist vulnerable tourism businesses to survive until summer 2022 when it is expected that inbound tourism will recover. F&aacute;ilte Ireland is finalising its detailed plans for 2022 which will include the allocation of Tourism Business Continuity Funding. </p>  <p>  The 2022 funding is in addition to the &euro;55m in Tourism Business Continuity supports which were made available in 2021. Five phases of this Scheme have been launched since the beginning of 2021. Phases 4 and 5 closed for applications on 24 September 2021. By  the end of 2021 hundreds of tourism businesses will have received vital funding to help them survive the impacts of the pandemic. Hundreds more will again receive support in 2022. </p>  <p>  In addition to the &euro;50m for the Tourism Business Continuity Scheme, the budget measures include a &euro;35m increase in the Tourism Marketing Fund in 2022 to enable Tourism Ireland to support the delivery of a marketing strategy to help restore inbound tourism to Ireland. Funding is also being provided for a range of initiatives including domestic marketing and festivals, supporting the digitalisation of tourism businesses as well as skills development and staff retention.  &euro;36.5m is also being  provided in capital funding for tourism product development for the delivery of enhanced visitor experiences in line with the objectives of the National Development Plan 2021-2030.</p>  <p>  The supports for Tourism also include a range of cross-Government measures which will assist the sector in its recovery and growth. Tourism enterprises continue to benefit from measures such as the continuation of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme to April 2022, tax warehousing and a commercial rates waiver while the 9% VAT rate for hospitality remains in place until September 2022.</p>  <p>  I am committed to continued support for tourism through this difficult period and to working towards a sustainable recovery.  </p></reply>

Compared to 2018, we will have achieved an increase of almost &euro;70m.  </p>  <p>  Current expenditure funding for Sport Ireland for 2022 will be &euro;96 million, an increase of over &euro;4m from 2021 and up by &euro;44 million compared to 2018. This funding will enable Sport Ireland to continue to support the sector as it recovers from the challenges of Covid. It will also allow continued support for high performance sport, participation programmes and other funding programmes. </p>  <p>  We are continuing our investment in sport capital programmes. At least &euro;34.5 million has been provided for the Sports Capital and Equipment Programme in 2022, which will cover all existing allocations under older rounds of the Programme plus significant new allocations for the 2020 Capital applications. At least &euro;14.6 million is available for the Large Scale Sports Infrastructure Fund next year.</p></reply>

This new package is additional to the &euro;88.5 million that was provided last year, which benefited all levels of the sport sector, including thousands of grassroots clubs and Community Groups across the country. </p>  <p>  In addition to these financial supports, which benefit young and old alike, I consider that a public information campaign emphasising the benefits of sport can also contribute to a comprehensive resumption to sporting activity. Last month, Sport Ireland launched such a campaign under the title of &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s Get Back&rdquo;. The campaign is aimed at encouraging members of the public that are anxious or unsure about returning to sport and physical activity that it is possible to do so in a safe and secure manner. The campaign also collaborated with social media influencers and platforms to promote the message to the younger demographic.  </p>  <p>  The campaign is part of a wider winter initiative to get people back to sport, with activities planned throughout the sports sector, and provides National Governing Bodies with a perfect platform to launch their Winter Programmes.</p>  <p>  Under this initiative, Sport Ireland are co-ordinating activities across the NGB and LSP sector, to ensure that a Return to Sport takes place across the Winter months. Hundreds of activities are already planned or taking place across the country, and this will continue throughout the winter as we strive to get the sport sector back on its feet.</p>  <p>  In line with a safe return to sport, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that Government agreed last week to widen the range of sporting opportunities for young people which enables under 18 indoor sports games and competitions in sports such as basketball to go ahead. On foot of this, updated guidance has been provided by Sport Ireland to sporting organisations to allow children under 18 years of age to participate in indoor games and competition activities according to the ordinary rules and limits of the sport concerned.  The full guidance can be accessed on the Sport Ireland website at:</p>  <p>  www.sportireland.ie/covid19/return-to-sport-and-physical-activity</p>  <p>  While the pace and extent of the return to sport for all people is significantly dependent on the capacity of the various sporting organisations and clubs at local level, I hope that these measures will help support organisations and clubs in bringing many people back to sporting activity as quickly as possible.</p></reply>

The total funding of &euro;288.5 million represents an increase of &euro;67.6 million over the 2021 allocation. The allocation includes a &euro;35 million increase to the Tourism Marketing Fund, to support the delivery of a marketing strategy to help restore inbound tourism to Ireland.</p>  <p>  As part of its marketing strategy, Tourism Ireland has established a recovery framework entitled: RESTART, REBUILD and REDESIGN, which will be underpinned by an extensive programme of promotional activity throughout 2022. </p>  <p>  Tourism Ireland has already begun to &lsquo;roll out the green carpet&rsquo; as they work to encourage as many overseas holidaymakers as possible to book Ireland for their next holiday destination. The concept revolves around creating a commitment to travel, by &lsquo;pressing the Green Button&rsquo; &ndash; green being the universal colour of &lsquo;go&rsquo; and instinctively connected with the island of Ireland. I was happy to help Tourism Ireland launch this new campaign in both the UK and the United States recently when I travelled to both markets to engage with our industry partners to reassure them that Ireland was open and waiting to welcome back visitors. </p>  <p>  Tourism Ireland will continue to work with airlines and ferry companies through a programme of jointly funded marketing initiatives to support the restoration of air and sea access routes, which are so vital for tourism&rsquo;s return to growth.</p>  <p>  Given the projected slow return of international visitors, additional funding has also been allocated to F&aacute;ilte Ireland in Budget 2022, for domestic marketing and festivals. Festivals are a key motivator for visitors to travel and provide an urgency and a specific time frame in which potential visitors must visit Ireland, while domestic visitors will be crucial in sustaining businesses and jobs in the sector.</p>  <p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland recently embarked on extensive domestic marketing and communications campaigns, including their &lsquo;Keep Discovering&rsquo; and &lsquo;Winter in Dublin&rsquo; programmes, designed to encourage domestic holidaymakers to discover Ireland. </p>  <p>  There is increasing recognition that tourism growth must be sustainable, as well as being consistent with our sectoral climate change targets and commitments. In that regard, I know that Tourism Ireland and F&aacute;ilte Ireland are working towards the longer term goal of ensuring that we are successfully marketed as a sustainable tourism destination.</p></reply>

This has created 40-50 new construction jobs across Gaeltacht communities in the short term and the re-developed building stock will support the longer-term creation of 320 new jobs in the Gaeltacht, in &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta client companies.</p>  <p>  Against this backdrop, the Board of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta has approved over &euro;7.4m of COVID-19 supports to date for over 435 Gaeltacht companies to address financial and supply difficulties, ensure cash-flow and enhance their ability to access global online sales markets. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that I have recently set up a stabilisation fund worth &euro;1.7m to help the Irish Language summer colleges sector. The funding is being made available to college authorities as a result of the cancellation of Irish language courses in the Gaeltacht for the second summer in a row due to COVID-19.  This latest assistance follows the special &euro;2.2m fund announced in July to support Gaeltacht families who provide accommodation for Gaeltacht college students and &euro;240,000 for Gaeltacht community halls to address the impact of COVID-19 on the summer colleges sector.</p>  <p>  I might also point out that an additional exchequer allocation of &euro;14.8m was included in Budget 2021 for the Irish language and Gaeltacht sectors.  This additional allocation ultimately means that total funding in excess of &euro;78m is being deployed in support of the Irish language via my Department alone this year.  Following Budget 2022, this will increase significantly to &euro;85m next year.</p>  <p>  In summary, the impact of Covid-19 on the country as a whole and particularly on the Gaeltacht should not be underestimated.  However, in commending Gaeltacht communities for showing great resilience in the face of the challenge presented, I am also satisfied that both my Department and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta rose to the challenge to mitigate the impact of the pandemic in as far as possible.</p>  <p>  I think it is important at this juncture to recognise the vital work carried out by Gaeltacht co-operatives and community organisations during the bleakest of times during the past 18 month.  The people involved in this network went above and beyond the call of duty in reaching out to the most vulnerable in their communities and, for that, they should be highly commended.  It is at times like this that we realise the importance of these locally-based organisations to their communities.</p></reply>

In excess of 1,000 grants were provided to support businesses under these schemes. I also extended the application deadlines a number of times to ensure people had adequate time to apply.</p><p>At its meeting of 19<sup>th</sup>of October Government agreed that the remaining aspects of the hospitality, entertainment and night-time economy sector could reopen from October 22<sup>nd</sup>with the full range of protective measures in place and the wide and robust implementation of the COVID-19 pass.This represents an important next step towards the full reopening of our economy and our society, and is a crucial opportunity to return to work for those who work in the live entertainment and events sector. </p><p>I was very cognisant of the challenges the restrictions caused for the arts/culture and live entertainment industry in 2021 and I allocated over &euro;60m to support the sector and drive employment opportunities  through the introduction of the following schemes:</p><p>- &euro;25m Live Performance Support Scheme (LPSS)</p><p>- &euro;16.5m Events Sector Covid Support Scheme (ESCSS)</p><p>- &euro;10m Local Live Performance Support Scheme (LLPSS)</p><p>- &euro;4m Music and Entertainment Support Scheme (MEBAS)</p><p>- &euro;5m Commercial Entertainment Capital Grant Scheme (CECGS)</p><p>- &euro;1m St. Patrick's Festival</p><p>I have allocated &euro;25m for the live entertainment sector as part of Budget 2022 and I am examining the supports in place for the sector to ensure that available resources are best deployed to meet the needs of the sector to ensure a full recovery is possible.  </p><p>As part of Budget 2022, I have maintained the Arts Council allocation at the record-level of &euro;130m. This allocation will allow the Arts Council to continue to protect jobs and livelihoods of artists, and assist arts organisations through financial difficulties. </p><p>Other priorities for Budget 2022 was to secure &euro;25m in funding for a pilot Basic Income Guarantee Scheme for artists and arts workers. I plan to launch this pilot scheme early in 2022 and I hope it will provide an important legacy for our artists and creatives.</p></reply>

It has engaged comprehensively with stakeholders, including local media.   Its work has now been completed.  The report of the Commission has been submitted to An Taoiseach and myself and we are currently considering its contents in advance of bringing the matter to Government, after which the report will be published.</p>  <p>  In terms of supports for the local print sector, I understand that at least &euro;4.4 million was spent by Government on regional and local print advertising from March 2020 to date. Recently, my Department's campaign for Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g included a spend of &euro;187,000 on local print advertising.</p>  <p>  In relation to the local radio sector, I allocated additional funding to the Sound and Vision Scheme administered by the BAI in December 2020. This enabled a specific round of &euro;2.48m  for the independent and local radio sector which was distributed in April 2021. This funding, which is Round 39 of the Sound and Vision 4 scheme, was in addition to a similar funding round of Sound and Vision that took place in 2020, together with a waiver of the broadcasting levy for the first half of that year, which was worth &euro;1m to the sector. </p>  <p>  Moreover, Government COVID-related advertising spend provided an additional &euro;1.8m to the sector in Q2 2021 and 11 radio stations availed of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), receiving a total of &euro;0.9m in Q2 of this year. </p>  <p>  The BAI will continue to report to me on the financial status of the independent radio sector in the coming months.  </p></reply>

These sectors are of great economic significance to Ireland, they generate both domestic and export earnings and employ people across the country, a fact made even more apparent by the impact of the pandemic. </p><p>The diverse yet related range of sectors served by this department has been amongst those most severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.  The Statement of Strategy sets out the priorities for my Department over the next few years to ensure these sectors recover and grow in a manner that underpins social cohesion and supports strong, sustainable economic growth, with a focus on a number of cross cutting goals of equality, diversity, social inclusion, the Irish language and environmental sustainability. </p><p>This work will be progressed within the context of the <i>Programme for Government &ndash; Our Shared Future </i>which outlines an inclusive vision of an Ireland for all ages, where the arts and culture thrive, the Irish language is nurtured and developed, a safe digital environment facilitates the use of technology, and sport inspires us to lead healthier and better lives.  The Programme charges the Department to deliver across a range of commitments some of which involve collaboration with other government departments and state agencies. These are reflected in the strategies and actions outlined in this document. </p><p>The Government's Economic Recovery Plan sets out the framework of actions for an investment led recovery leading to a renewed and restructured, people-focused economy.  Decarbonising the economy and addressing regional and sectoral imbalances are particular priority areas under the plan. It also sets the context for a coherent, national response to the urgent need for Climate Action, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the outcome of BREXIT.  The plan recognises the broad context for the Department&rsquo;s work, in terms of its capacity to support economic recovery and resilience, and its contribution to individual and collective wellbeing. </p><p>The extensive package of supports announced under Budget 2022, which resulted in the increased total allocation for my department in 2022 of &euro;1.197bn, includes:</p><p>- &euro;288.5m for Tourism</p><p>- &euro;346.5m for Arts &amp;amp; Culture</p><p>- &euro;181.2m for Sports and Recreation</p><p>- &euro;5.5m for establishment of new Media Commission and an increased finding allocation of &euro;44.933m for TG4.</p><p>Details of the strategies to be followed by my Department in the delivery of these diverse but critical work programmes and the indicators to be used in tracking progress towards achieving the intended outcomes are set out in the Statement of Strategy.</p><p>I welcome the Deputy&rsquo;s interest in the work of my Department and look forward to providing further detail in respect of the progress attained in respect of individual programmes in due course.</p></reply>

This includes funding for business supports for tourism enterprises. The eligibility criteria for the Tourism accommodation Providers Business Continuity Scheme is a matter for F&aacute;ilte Ireland.</p>  <p>  I understand that F&aacute;ilte Ireland provided a response to question 394 to the Deputy on the 29th October in which F&aacute;ilte Ireland confirmed that the general eligibility criteria section of the guidelines for the Tourism Accommodation Providers Business Continuity Scheme advises applicants that they must be registered or approved (or in application) under F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s National Quality Assurance Framework (NQAF) as at July 23rd 2021. </p>  <p>  The F&aacute;ilte Ireland National Quality Assurance Framework (NQAF) was developed to provide visitors with the assurance that nationally recognised minimum standards are in place. The Framework was also designed to maintain and develop standards across the tourism accommodation industry and to support the development of individual tourism accommodation operators. Given the importance of the Framework in this regard, funding was restricted to accommodation providers for those registered or approved under the NQAF. It should be noted that F&aacute;ilte Ireland waived its registration fee for accommodation providers in 2021.  Accordingly applicants could register at no cost.  </p>  <p>  As with all Government funded grants and supports, F&aacute;ilte Ireland is obliged to follow strict protocols to ensure the grant application process is followed in a fair and consistent manner and that all relevant criteria are met by applicants.</p>  <p>  &euro;55m funding was provided in Budget 2021 for a Tourism Business Continuity Scheme. Phase 5 of this scheme supports eligible F&aacute;ilte Ireland approved tourism accommodation providers such as hotels, guesthouses, hostels, holiday camps, camping and caravan parks, self catering and B&amp;Bs.  The maximum grant amount is &euro;800,000. This phase opened for applications on 5th August 2021 and closed on 21st September 2021.  There are approximately 400 applications being evaluated for this scheme, with payments expected to commence in the near future.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware be aware, accommodation providers can also benefit from many of the horizontal supports provided by Government such as the VAT reduction, the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme, tax warehousing and rates waivers. </p></reply>

As Minister with responsibility for Arts and Culture, I am conscious of the value that this sector brings to all Irish citizens.  The importance of Irish culture, Irish art and Irish productions as a whole cannot be understated - it contributes to individual and societal well-being, as well as contributing to Ireland's reputation as a country with a rich cultural history and output.  The intrinsic value of culture and the arts to society was particularly evident during the pandemic. </p><p>Against this backdrop, and my own experience of the arts, funding for the Basic Income Guarantee Pilot Scheme was a key priority of mine for Budget 2022 and I secured &euro;25m to realise the pilot scheme next year.  </p><p>In relation to the timeline for the launch of the pilot the Deputy will appreciate that this is a major policy intervention requiring significant resources to develop a coherent policy and to operationalise.  This work is ongoing and my ambition is to open the scheme for applications  early in Q1 2022. The Oversight Group continues to meet regularly and met yesterday with a representative from SIPTU.</p><p>The selection process for recipients of the basic Income will be finalised following the stakeholder engagement early next month, however, I can confirm the following: </p><p>- Participation in the scheme will not be based on a means test.</p><p>- It will be a non-competitive process, therefore once a person satisfies the eligibility criteria they will be included in a randomised selection process.</p><p>- A number of unsuccessful applicants will be invited to participate in a control group to facilitate a comprehensive ex post appraisal of  the pilot in due course. </p><p>- Proposals for  the parameters of the scheme will be finalised in light of the stakeholder engagement.</p><p>I believe the Basic Income Guarantee pilot scheme will bring new life and support to the Arts and Cultural Sector and I hope it will provide an important legacy for our artists and creatives.</p></reply>

To this end, I secured &euro;5.5m in Budget 2022 to facilitate the establishment of the Commission.  Through the provision of this funding, we as a Government are demonstrating our commitment to the timely establishment of the Commission.</p>  <p>  On establishment, the Media Commission will be required to carry out a range of tasks in order to commence the day to day operations and administration of the organisation including the matters related to the absorption of the BAI and to develop regulatory codes and working relationships required in order to execute the functions assigned under the legislation. In particular, it is envisaged that the development of regulatory codes and the designation of services for the online safety aspect of the legislation will result in a significant workload, by virtue of the complexity involved and the need to carry out extensive stakeholder and industry consultation. </p>  <p>  Considering the scale and complexity of the entitles to be regulated under the online safety strand,  I envisage that staff with significant legal, regulatory, financial, and social media experience will be required to ensure that the Media Commission has the capacity to develop and implement appropriate regulatory measures to fulfil the objectives and functions set out in legislation.  I am of the view that it is imperative that the capacity building process must begin at the earliest possible stage.  </p>  <p>  The Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill also provides that the staff of the BAI will transfer to the Commission on their existing terms and conditions and that current broadcasting regulation will continue in force.   The Department is working closely with the BAI to ensure an orderly transition to the new Media Commission.</p></reply>

It is for this reason that the Programme for Government expanded the remit of the Public Service Broadcasting Commission to become the Future of Media Commission. The Commission was tasked with considering the future of print, broadcast, and online media in a platform agnostic fashion and with recommendations to put media on a sustainable footing over the next decade. </p>  <p>  The Commission was chaired by Professor Brian MacCraith, and it included experts in public service media, independent journalism, social media, new technology platforms, media economics, culture, language, creative content, governance and international best practice.</p>  <p>  The Commission engaged comprehensively with stakeholders, including broadcasters, journalists, publishers, regional media and the wider public. The first phase of the Future of Media Commission public consultation, which ran from December 12th 2020 to January 8th 2021, resulted in over 800 written submissions from stakeholder groups and the general public on a wide range of themes.</p>  <p>  At the end of January 2021, the Commission began a series of thematic dialogues. In these online webinars, panels of experts explored key themes in more depth and answered follow-up questions from the virtual audience and the Commission members.  The webinars and the public consultations are all available on the Future of Media Commission&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  The work of the Future of Media Commission has now been completed.  The report of the Commission has been submitted to An Taoiseach and myself and we are currently considering its contents in advance of bringing the matter to Government, after which the report will be published. </p></reply>

As we rebuild this vital sector, which supports livelihoods all across Ireland, we have an opportunity to ensure that the sector recovers and grows in a way which delivers social and economic gain to cities, towns and villages all across Ireland, more evenly spread throughout the year, and in a manner that protects our unique environment. The significant additional funding that I have secured for tourism services in Budget 2022 will help address immediate survival-related concerns of tourism businesses while also enabling further resilience and recovery across industry as we reopen to international tourism and transition to a more sustainable future.   </p>  <p>  The  funding for Tourism in Budget 2022 amounting to &euro;288.5m represents an increase of &euro;67.6m over the 2021 allocation. This includes &euro;50m funding for further Tourism Business Continuity Supports to assist strategic tourism businesses with their survival and recovery.  </p>  <p>  The budget measures also include a &euro;35m increase in the Tourism Marketing Fund in 2022 to enable Tourism Ireland to support the delivery of a marketing strategy to help restore inbound tourism to Ireland. Funding is also being provided for a range of initiatives including domestic marketing and festivals, supporting the digitalisation of tourism businesses as well as skills development and staff retention.  &euro;36.5m is also being  provided in capital funding for tourism product development for the delivery of enhanced visitor experiences in line with the objectives of the National Development Plan 2021-2030.   </p>  <p>  The supports for Tourism also include a range of cross-Government measures which will assist the sector in its recovery and growth. Tourism businesses continue to benefit from measures such as the continuation of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme to April 2022, tax warehousing and a commercial rates waiver while the 9% VAT rate for hospitality remains in place until September 2022.</p>  <p>  In relation to jobs in the tourism sector, a work programme is currently underway by F&aacute;ilte Ireland to understand the views of employers and employees around the skills and labour force challenges facing the sector. F&aacute;ilte Ireland is also engaging with the recruitment sector and undertaking an international review to understand the experience of other sectors and other destinations. The work programme is informing the agency&rsquo;s work plans on how to support businesses to drive change, retain talent and build the appeal of working in the industry.  </p>  <p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland carried out a number of activities in 2021 supporting the industry&rsquo;s recruitment drive for reopening including chairing the Tourism and Hospitality Careers Oversight Group, delivering a multi-channel #BeThePulse Recruitment Awareness Campaign, promoting and enhancing tourismcareers.ie website and working with education providers and with the  with the Department of Social Protection to promote the Government&rsquo;s Pathways to Work strategy.</p></reply>

While our domestic tourism market has helped sustain the industry, it now needs international visitors to return in significant numbers in order to facilitate a meaningful recovery. Since the easing of restrictions on the 19th of July overseas visitors have started to return to our shores but at a much lower level than prior to the pandemic.</p>  <p>  Last year, a Tourism Recovery Taskforce was put in place to prepare a Tourism Recovery Plan with recommendations on how best the Irish Tourism sector can adapt and recover in a changed tourism environment as a result of the crisis.  One of its recommendations was an increase in the overseas Tourism Marketing Fund to help protect Ireland's existing brand position and kick-start the recovery in inbound tourism. </p>  <p>  In the recently announced Budget 2022, I was happy to secure additional resources to support tourism next year, including a substantial &euro;35 million increase in our overseas marketing fund and a provision of &euro;50 million for further business continuity supports for tourism businesses. </p>  <p>  The competition globally to attract tourism will be more challenging than ever and I am more than confident that Tourism Ireland is equally equipped for and up for the challenge. To this end Tourism Ireland has started to &lsquo;roll out the green carpet&rsquo; and welcome back our international visitors as they work to encourage as many overseas holidaymakers as possible to book Ireland for their next holiday destination. The concept revolves around creating a commitment to travel, by &lsquo;pressing the Green Button&rsquo;; green being the universal colour of &lsquo;go&rsquo; and instinctively connected with the island of Ireland. I was happy to help Tourism Ireland launch this new campaign in both the UK and the United States recently when I travelled to both markets to engage with our industry partners to reassure them that Ireland was open and waiting to welcome back visitors.</p>  <p>  Last week I attended World Travel Market in London and saw first-hand the excellent work undertaken by Tourism Ireland in highlighting Ireland&rsquo;s world-class tourism experience to international tour operators. There is increasing recognition that tourism growth must be sustainable, as well as being consistent with our sectoral climate change targets and commitments. In that regard, I know that Tourism Ireland will be working towards the longer term goal of ensuring that we are successfully marketed as a sustainable tourism destination.</p></reply>

I also thank the Deputy and her colleagues in the Joint Oireachtas Committee (JOC) for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media for the publication, on Tuesday of last week, of a comprehensive pre-legislative scrutiny report in relation to the General Scheme of the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill. The 33 recommendations contained in the report raise a wide range of important issues and highlight the scale and complexity of the matters to be addressed in the Bill.</p>  <p>  I commend the thorough and consultative approach taken by the JOC in conducting its pre-legislative scrutiny, which represents a continuity of the approach in developing the General Scheme, which involved public consultation and significant stakeholder engagement. </p>  <p>  Last year, when I asked the Government to request that the JOC conduct pre-legislative scrutiny, I also asked the Government to approve the commencement of detailed drafting of the Bill by the Office of the Attorney General at the same time. The detailed drafting process is now nearing completion and will be finalised once I have carefully considered the JOC's report and recommendations. </p>  <p>  A number of recommendations in the JOC report are straightforward and can be provided for with some additional legal drafting work from the Office of the Attorney General. A number of others are more complex, either directly dealing with technical legal drafting matters, or raising new policy proposals with significant practical and legal implications.</p>  <p>  While I am closely considering all the recommendations, there are some which deal with issues that I have been examining for some time. This includes how the Bill can be further strengthened in order to better protect individuals online, including issues relating to the appropriate avenues of complaint or redress.</p>  <p>  I intend to progress the Bill as a matter of urgency. It will be published as soon as is practicable following due consideration of the JOC's report and recommendations.</p>  <p>  Finally, I note that &euro;5.5 million was allocated in Budget 2022 to establish a new regulator, the Media Commission, under the Bill. While the Commission will ultimately be funded by an industry levy, this start-up funding will enable the Commission to hire an Online Safety Commissioner, to begin work on key issues and to hit the ground running following the enactment of the Bill in 2022.</p></reply>

This strategy, entitled High Performance Strategy 2021-2032, was published in June 2021 and includes specific targets, and it will be a key component for the strategic and operational delivery objectives of the Sport Ireland Institute across its performance, leadership, coaching and specialist services.</p><p>A copy of the Strategy can be found at on the Sport Ireland website at the following link<i>: www.sportireland.ie/sites/default/files/media/document/2021-06/strategy_eng.pdf </i></p><p>The High Performance Strategy sets out challenging but achievable targets and signals our belief that Irish athletes can compete with the best in the world and win medals at the Olympic and Paralympic Games, and other major international competitions, on a consistent basis.</p><p>World class facilities and equipment is one of the strategic pillars of the Strategy. The Sport Ireland Campus is a major statement of the commitment to high performance sport.  The Campus will be further developed and expanded in the coming years to really deliver the best possible facilities for existing and emerging athletes.</p><p>Sport Ireland, which is funded by my Department, is the statutory body with responsibility for the development of sport, including high performance sport and its funding allocations. Sport Ireland provides High Performance Programme funding which supports Irish athletes in reaching finals and achieving medals at European Championships, World Championships, and the Olympic and Paralympic Games. High Performance investment in 2020 was approximately &euro;15.5 million and is estimated to be &euro;18.5 million for 2021. Our ambition is to double the State's investment in sport, from &euro;112 million in 2018 to &euro;220 million by 2027.</p><p>In Budget 2022, we announced over &euro;181 million for sport next year, an increase of almost &euro;11 million compared to the 2021 Revised Estimate. Compared to 2018, we will have achieved an increase of almost &euro;70m.  </p><p>Current expenditure funding for Sport Ireland for 2022 will be &euro;96 million, an increase of over &euro;4m from 2021 and up by &euro;44 million compared to 2018. This funding will enable Sport Ireland to continue to support the sector as it recovers from the challenges of Covid. It will also allow continued support for high performance sport, participation programmes and other funding programmes.</p><p>We recognise the benefits of multi-annual funding and the National Sports Policy aims to deliver funding on a multi-annual basis for high performance and participation programmes (Action 44).  The Sport Ireland High Performance Strategy 2021-2032 also provides a commitment to multi-annual funding within High Performance Sport. Progress is being made in this regard with Sport Ireland intending to introduce multi-annual funding from 2022 to 2024 to National Governing Bodies (NGBs) who operate High Performance Programmes. Sport Ireland will have set criteria in order for NGBs to be considered for multi-annual funding, which will include the adoption and compliance with the Governance Code by December 31, 2021. Sport Ireland will work closely with NGBs to ensure they achieve and maintain the standards required for multi-annual funding. </p></reply>

The Programme for Government, Our Shared Future, provided for the establishment of the Future of Media Commission, in recognition of the importance of a sustainable Irish media sector. It was tasked with considering the future of print, broadcast, and online media in a platform agnostic fashion.</p>  <p>  On 29 September 2020 the Government agreed the terms of reference and membership of the Future of Media Commission.  It was chaired by Professor Brian MacCraith, and it included experts in public service media, independent journalism, social media, new technology platforms, media economics, culture, language, creative content, governance and international best practice.</p>  <p>  The goals of the Independent Commission were to explore the Irish experience and the challenges created for media by new global platforms and changing audience preferences. The Commission also sought to consider to what extent the current models of delivery are the appropriate ones for the next 10 years. The Commission also reviewed best practice in other countries, especially across the European Economic Area.</p>  <p>  The Commission was tasked with proposing how public service aims should be delivered in Ireland over the next ten years in a sustainable way. The Commission was also asked make recommendations on RTE&rsquo;s role, financing and structure.</p>  <p>  The Commission held its inaugural meeting on 29 October 2020. This was followed by a period of public consultation, which ran from December 12th 2020 - January 8th 2021, resulting in over 800 written submissions from stakeholder groups and the general public. In addition, six Thematic Dialogues were held between January 28th and April 15th which involved panels of speakers on a range of matters who responded to questions from online participants and Commission members. These dialogues are available on the Commission's website.  As such, the Commission facilitated a very extensive process of national dialogue and policy debate on the Irish media. </p>  <p>  The work of the Future of Media Commission has now been completed.  The report of the Commission has been submitted to An Taoiseach and myself and we are currently considering its contents in advance of bringing the matter to Government, after which the report will be published.</p></reply>

The FAI presented their directional Strategic Plan to their AGM last July and made a commitment to consult widely with Irish soccer stakeholders via a variety of consultation formats. I understand that this consultation is well underway and that the FAI aims to have its strategic plan completed by December.  </p>  <p>  The Memorandum also requires the FAI to engage with clubs and players from the League of Ireland and the Women&rsquo;s National League to draft a 5-year strategy to develop the Leagues and to commit appropriate funding and other resources to implement this development strategy, recognising their importance to the development of Irish soccer. I understand that, once the FAI has completed its strategic plan, an overall strategy for the League of Ireland and Women&rsquo;s National League will be developed.</p></reply>

As Minister with responsibility for Arts and Culture, I am conscious of the value that this sector brings to all Irish citizens.  The importance of Irish culture, Irish art and Irish productions as a whole cannot be understated - it contributes to individual and societal well-being, as well as contributing to Ireland's reputation as a country with a rich cultural history and output.  The intrinsic value of culture and the arts to society was particularly evident during the pandemic. </p>  <p>  Against this backdrop, and my own experience of the arts, funding for the Basic Income Guarantee Pilot Scheme was a key priority of mine for Budget 2022 and I secured &euro;25m to realise the pilot scheme next year. </p>  <p>  In relation to the timeline for the launch of the pilot the Deputy will appreciate that this is a major policy intervention requiring significant resources to develop a coherent policy and to operationalise.  This work is ongoing and my ambition is to open the scheme for applications early in Q1 2022. The Oversight Group continues to meet regularly and met yesterday with a representative from SIPTU.</p>  <p>  The selection process for recipients of the basic Income will be finalised following the stakeholder engagement early next month, however, I can confirm the following:  </p>  <p>  - Participation in the scheme will not be based on a means test. </p>  <p>  - It will be a non-competitive process, therefore once a person satisfies the eligibility criteria they will be included in a randomised selection process.  </p>  <p>  - A number of unsuccessful applicants will be invited to participate in a control group to facilitate a comprehensive ex post appraisal of  the pilot in due course.  </p>  <p>  - Proposals for the parameters of the scheme will be finalised in light of  the stakeholder engagement.  </p>  <p>  I believe the Basic Income Guarantee pilot scheme will bring new life and support to the Arts and Cultural Sector and I hope it will provide an important legacy for our artists and creatives.</p>  <p>  From the outset of the COVID-19 crisis, the Arts Council has been focused on protecting jobs and livelihoods of artists and arts workers, assisting arts organisations experiencing financial difficulties, working to encourage audiences to re-engage with in-person events in a safe environment, and supporting and developing the sector more broadly. </p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2022, I have maintained the Arts Council allocation at the record-level of &euro;130m. With this ongoing strong public funding in 2022, the Arts Council is empowered to play a strong role in supporting artists and arts organisations to flourish in the years ahead.</p></reply>

This includes the allocation of funding to sporting organisations across a variety of funding schemes.  </p>  <p>  Sport Ireland is in the process of developing a Diversity and Inclusion policy to further broaden the scope of its remit in this area. Sport Ireland recently concluded a wide ranging research and consultation process with the sport sector, representative organisations and the general public, specifically encouraging the LGBTI+ community, people with a disability and those from minority ethnic communities, including the Travelling community, to share their views. </p>  <p>  The aim of the research and consultation process was to identify the barriers and challenges to participation in sport and physical activity faced by certain communities, and to identify opportunities to remove or reduce those barriers. The insights gained will inform the identification and development of supports and initiatives to promote participation in sport and physical activity across under represented communities, including the LGBTI+ community. </p>  <p>  The Local Sports Partnership Network (LSP) which is comprised of 29 LSPs around the country, plays a vital role in increasing participation levels in sport and physical activity, especially among those sectors of society that are currently underrepresented in sport. Working with trusted professionals and valued volunteers, the Network engages communities to deliver opportunities for participation in sport and physically activities that are progressive, innovative and fully inclusive at a local level.</p>  <p>  In 2020, 340,000 people from communities across Ireland including LGBTI+ persons took part in sport and physical activity opportunities organised by Local Sports Partnerships. In recent years, the LSP Network has utilised funding from the Dormant Account Fund to support inclusive initiatives and programmes that focus on groups with lower levels of participation which includes members of the LGBTI+ community. </p>  <p>  In June 2021, the Local Sports Partnerships and National Governing Bodies of Sport supported the inaugural #LetsGetVisible campaign, which was developed by Sporting Pride in association with Sport Ireland. The aim of the campaign was to recognise and promote the importance of visibility and representation amongst the LGBTI+ community. </p>  <p>  The Sport Ireland participation unit is currently working with Sporting Pride to explore opportunities to grow and develop this campaign in 2022 utilising the forthcoming Sport Ireland Diversity and Inclusion Policy which will contain specific actions on promoting participation and inclusion of people from the LGBTI+ community, as recommended in Action 43 of the Sport Ireland Participation plan. </p>  <p>  The Deputy might also be interested to note that I will soon be launching a Sports Action Plan covering the period to end 2023, which will include a series of actions and initiatives aimed at increasing participation levels across the board. The plan's emphasis will be geared towards increasing inclusion, diversity and equality in sport.</p></reply>

Funding has been made available under the National Development Plan for a culture and creativity investment programme. This investment programme is closely aligned with the Creative Ireland Programme and includes a range of investments in regional arts and culture facilities which include a number of artists&rsquo; workspace projects among other initiatives. Based on this investment we can expect to see the delivery of significant redevelopments our National Cultural Institutions including the Abbey Theatre and the National Concert Hall as well as investments in regional arts and culture facilities.</p><p>Local authorities have important functions with respect to the provision of  artists'  work spaces. My Department has allocated up to &euro;3 million to Dublin City Council for capital development of studio workspaces towards funding provided under the urban regeneration development fund on sites owned by the city council. This level of investment will be of significant benefit to artists in the area and address the deficit in artist workspaces in Dublin city.</p><p>Recent decades have seen the development of a nationwide infrastructure of venues and arts centres, many of which were initiated and funded by local authorities. These centres are also supported through capital schemes largely operated by my Department. Projects supported included the provision of new integrated art centres, theatres and studio space and the refurbishment of existing performance spaces.  Support provided to these arts centres by local authorities and the Arts Council is critical to ensuring that a stable and vibrant network can be maintained. Capital funding schemes operated by my Department continue to be focused on enhancing this existing stock of arts and culture centres throughout the country. Recent capital schemes are being informed by the strategic Review of Arts Centres and Venues commissioned by the Arts Council and CCMA, as well as the Arts Council's published Arts Centre Policy and Strategy 2019, which sets out its funding criteria for arts centres from 2020 onwards.</p><p>The Cultural Capital Scheme 2019-2022 is a &euro;4.7m capital investment scheme for arts and culture centres which is being administered by my Department.  The scheme will run until 2022 and focuses on enhancing the existing stock of arts and culture centres throughout the country. Projects that provide additional capacity for artists and artistic production particularly in arts centres are favoured. The Cultural Capital Scheme 2019-2022 is constructed of a number of funding streams one of which is Stream C which is aimed at upgrading visual artists' workspaces and is run by Visual Artists Ireland (VAI) on behalf of my Department. Funding of approximately &euro;79k was announced in October 2020 by VAI for Stream C to 10 applicants.</p><p>In response to Covid-19,  capital funding towards the pilot Outdoor Public Space Scheme 2021  by my Department is intended to fund local authorities to adapt, equip or otherwise improve public spaces for cultural and events activities, taking account of public health guidelines and of the needs of the local arts community. Outdoor public spaces that can provide year-round use can improve well-being and contribute positively to the public realm. </p><p>The Deputy may be aware that I established the Night-Time Economy Taskforce on 30 July 2020 as one of the priority actions for the Department and on foot of a commitment in the Programme for Government.  The report, which I help launched last September, contains recommendations that aim at having a more diverse and inclusive Night-Time Economy sector.  These include bringing more venues into late night use by linking promoters and artists with existing spaces as well as increased collaboration across Government to deliver a high impact and well-functioning public realm to encourage more outdoor activities in the Night-Time Economy.  The report is published on my Department&rsquo;s website and can be accessed at the following link: <i>www.gov.ie/en/publication/c1ba7-report-of-the-night-time-economy-taskforce/.</i>Aligned with the Night-Time Economy report, the Arts Council plan to launch its spatial policy later which I understand will prioritise funding for new artist&rsquo;s workspaces in 2022.</p><p>It should be noted that the Arts Council operates a number of schemes and initiatives that have been established for the particular support of visual arts, including the Visual Artists Workspace Scheme.  The purpose of the Visual Artists Workspace Scheme is to support artists&rsquo; workspaces throughout the country to provide the best possible working environment for visual artists and, where feasible, to enable a level of subsidy for the artists working in these spaces.</p><p>County and city development plans are being drawn by local authorities and I understand that the new draft City Development Plan 2022 &ndash; 2028 for Dublin City Council proposes addressing the deficit in Artists Workspaces.  This can be accessed at the following link: <i>www.dublincity.ie/ga/node/8052</i></p></reply>

As such, current restrictions under the Government&rsquo;s plan state that organisers of indoor and outdoor group activities should ensure that appropriate protective measures are in place. For indoor sports, this means:  </p><p>- Where individuals have mixed immunity status, pods of up to 6 participants will be permitted (excluding adult coaches/instructors).  </p><p>- Multiple pods will be permissible subject to protective measures. </p><p>- The overall number of pods will have regard to the size of venue and there should be substantial social distance between individual pods. </p><p>- For Vaccinated individuals no fixed capacity limits apply to these activities. </p><p>- For spectators, the use of the EU Digital COVID Certificate (vaccine or recovery certificate) will be required for accessing indoor sporting activities and events.  </p><p>- Vaccinated spectators attending indoor sporting events should be fully seated.</p><p>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that Government agreed last week to widen the range of sporting opportunities for young people which enables under 18 indoor sports games and competitions in sports such as basketball to go ahead. On foot of this, updated guidance has been provided by Sport Ireland to sporting organisations to allow children under 18 years of age to participate in indoor games and competition activities according to the ordinary rules and limits of the sport concerned.  The full guidance can be accessed on the Sport Ireland website at:</p><p><i>www.sportireland.ie/covid19/return-to-sport-and-physical-activity</i></p></reply>

While our domestic tourism market has helped sustain the industry, it now needs international visitors to return in significant numbers in order to facilitate a meaningful recovery. Since the easing of restrictions on the 19th of July overseas visitors have started to return to our shores but at a much lower level than prior to the pandemic. </p>  <p>  The global competition to attract tourism will be more challenging than ever and I am more than confident that Tourism Ireland is equipped and up for the challenge. To this end, Tourism Ireland has started to &lsquo;roll out the green carpet&rsquo; and welcome back our international visitors as it works to encourage as many overseas holidaymakers as possible to book Ireland as their next holiday destination. The new campaign revolves around creating a commitment to travel, by &lsquo;pressing the Green Button&rsquo;; green being the universal colour of &lsquo;go&rsquo; and instinctively connected with the island of Ireland. I was happy to help Tourism Ireland launch this campaign in both the UK and the United States recently when I travelled to both markets to engage with our industry partners to reassure them that Ireland was open and waiting to welcome back visitors.</p>  <p>  Last year, a Tourism Recovery Taskforce was put in place to prepare a Tourism Recovery Plan with recommendations on how best the Irish Tourism sector can adapt and recover in a changed tourism environment as a result of the crisis.  One of its recommendations was an increase in the overseas Tourism Marketing Fund to help protect Ireland's existing brand position and kick-start the recovery in inbound tourism. Within the context of the recently announced Budget 2022, I was happy to be able to secure additional resources to support tourism next year, including a substantial &euro;35 million increase in our overseas marketing fund and a provision of &euro;50 million for further business continuity supports for tourism businesses. </p>  <p>  The Recovery Oversight Group continues to oversee the implementation of the Tourism Recovery Plan and to report to me on a regular basis with updates on implementation of the plan and the wider recovery of the sector. </p>  <p>  There is increasing recognition that tourism growth must be sustainable, as well as being consistent with our sectoral climate change targets and commitments. In that regard, I know that Tourism Ireland will be working towards the longer term goal of ensuring that we are successfully marketed as a sustainable tourism destination.</p></reply>

Implementation of these in Ireland is overseen by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland under the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. </p>  <p>  Further to this, standards regarding advertising of infant formula products are reflected in the advertising codes of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI).  As a matter of practice, the BAI seeks to reflect medical and health advertising policy developed by the relevant Departments and public bodies in its advertising codes.  This will also be the case with the advertising related media codes and online safety codes to be developed by the Media Commission, which is to be established under the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill.</p></reply>

As Minister with responsibility for Arts and Culture, I am conscious of the value that this sector brings to all Irish citizens.  The importance of Irish culture, Irish art and Irish productions as a whole cannot be understated - it contributes to individual and societal well-being, as well as contributing to Ireland's reputation as a country with a rich cultural history and output.  The intrinsic value of culture and the arts to society was particularly evident during the pandemic. </p><p>Against this backdrop, and my own experience of the arts, funding for the Basic Income Guarantee Pilot Scheme was a key priority of mine for Budget 2022 and I secured &euro;25m to realise the pilot scheme next year.  </p><p>In relation to the timeline for the launch of the pilot the Deputy will appreciate that this is a major policy intervention requiring significant resources to develop a coherent policy and to operationalise.  This work is ongoing and my ambition is to open the scheme for applications early in Q1 2022.The Oversight Group continues to meet regularly and met yesterday with a representative from SIPTU.</p><p>The selection process for recipients of the basic Income will be finalised following the stakeholder engagement early next month, however, I can confirm the following:</p><p>- Participation in the scheme will not be based on a means test. </p><p>- It will be a non-competitive process, therefore once a person satisfies the eligibility criteria they will be included in a randomised selection process. </p><p>- A number of unsuccessful applicants will be invited to participate in a control group to facilitate a comprehensive ex post appraisal of the pilot in due course.  </p><p>- Proposals for the parameters of the scheme will be finalised in light of the stakeholder engagement.</p><p>I believe the Basic Income Guarantee pilot scheme will bring new life and support to the Arts and Cultural Sector and I hope it will provide an important legacy for our artists and creatives.</p></reply>

As such, current restrictions under the Government&rsquo;s plan state that organisers of indoor and outdoor group activities should ensure that appropriate protective measures are in place. For indoor sports, this means: </p><p>- Where individuals have mixed  immunity status, pods of up to 6 participants will be permitted (excluding adult coaches/instructors). </p><p>- Multiple pods will be permissible subject to protective measures. </p><p>- The overall number of pods will have regard to the size of venue and there should be substantial social distance between individual pods. </p><p>- For Vaccinated individuals no fixed capacity limits apply to these activities. </p><p>- For spectators, the use of  the EU Digital COVID Certificate (vaccine or recovery certificate) will be required for accessing indoor sporting activities and events. </p><p>- Vaccinated spectators attending indoor sporting events should be fully seated.</p><p>Minister Martin and I have ongoing engagement with stakeholders in the sports sector, as do the officials in my Department.

The revised Audiovisual Media Services Directive provides the option to introduce a levy on providers of television broadcasting and video on-demand services available in Ireland to fund the production of European audiovisual content. My Department is currently in the process of transposing this measure through the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill.</p>  <p>  That Bill provides that a levy will not be put in place until the Media Commission has assessed whether the introduction of such a levy is a fair and viable source of funding for Irish content. This will ensure that the Commission, as the independent regulator and the body to be responsible for its implementation, has a role in teasing out all the potential impacts involved and ensuring there are no unintended consequences arising from the introduction of such a levy.  Preparatory work for the establishment of the Media Commission is ongoing with a view to the efficient and timely commencement of the Commission&rsquo;s functions. Consideration of the content levy will be among the Commission&rsquo;s priorities on establishment.</p>  <p>  I wish to stress that the proposals set out in the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill do not amount to a direct charge on consumers. Should a levy be imposed by the Media Commission, it would be on the providers of audiovisual media services themselves and not the end-user/consumer/household.  </p></reply>

This includes the matters referred to by the Deputy.  A comprehensive list of government Departments and state agencies which are subject to its provisions is contained in the First Schedule to that Act. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the Official Languages (Amendment) Bill 2019 was before the Seanad at Second Stage yesterday. It is hoped that Committee Stage will commence on 24 November and Report Stage in early December. The primary purpose of the Bill is to amend the Official Languages Act 2003 with a view to increasing and improving the provision of public services through the Irish language. In this regard, I proposed additional amendments to strengthen the Bill when it was before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann which address many of the concerns and issues that have been raised following extensive consultation with stakeholders and some 25 hours of debate at Committee Stage. These amendments are consistent with the State&rsquo;s wider policy ambition to support and promote the use of the Irish language.  The amendments will improve the overall operation of the Official Languages Act 2003, ensuring that the relevant legislation continues to act as an effective mechanism to reflect the Constitutional position of the Irish language as the first official language of the State and to ensure that public services in Irish are available to meet the needs of Irish speakers. Among the proposals currently included in the Bill are new provisions obliging public bodies issuing marketing material to the public to do so in Irish as well as English and requiring each public body to carry out at least 20% of its annual advertising in the Irish language and 5% in the Irish language media. </p>  <p>  I am confident that these measures will improve the use of the Irish language in the provision of State services in the years to come.</p></reply>

The 2020 round of the SCEP closed for applications on Monday 1st March 2021. By the closing date, over 3,100 applications were submitted seeking over &euro;200m in funding. This is the highest number of applications ever received.</p>  <p>  The scoring system and assessment procedures were published earlier this year and all applications are being assessed accordingly. Approximately one thousand of the submitted applications were for 'equipment-only' projects. These applications were assessed first and grants with a total value of &euro;16.6m were announced on the 6th August.</p>  <p>  In relation to the remaining capital applications, assessment work is continuing and every effort is being made to have it completed as quickly as possible. Given the record number of applications received, however, it is likely to take a further number of weeks to have these assessments complete .Once these allocations are finalised an announcement on the timing of the next round of the Programme will be made. </p>  <p>  It is not anticipated that the next round of the SCEP will contain a Large Scale Sport Infrastructure Fund (LSSIF) element as the LSSIF is a distinct Programme with its own terms, conditions and goals. The LSSIF is designed for projects where the grant sought is greater than the maximum available under the SCEP. The first allocations under the LSSIF were announced in January 2020 and thus far, approximately &euro;86.4m has been awarded to 33 different proposals.  The priority in the short term is to advance all of those projects. As it is now over 18 months since the first allocations were made, and in view of the issues faced by grantees as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is timely to review progress on all projects. My Department is engaging with all grantees in this regard. The timing of any new call for proposals is also being considered and it is expected that the review will be completed shortly.</p></reply>

Increasing participation amongst these groups is a core objective of the National Sports Policy 2018-2027.</p>  <p>  I will soon be launching a Sports Action Plan covering the period to end-2023, which will include a series of actions and initiatives aimed at increasing participation levels across the board. The plan's emphasis will be geared towards increasing inclusion, diversity and equality in sport.</p>  <p>  My Department is also funding a wide range of projects from the Dormant Accounts funds that are specifically aimed at increasing participation levels amongst disadvantaged communities and people with a disability. The total amount of funding being allocated for such projects this year is &euro;10M, twice the amount that prevailed a number of years ago.  In the recent budget, the government agreed a further increase of &euro;2m in Dormant Accounts funding for sport bringing the total allocation up to &euro;12m in 2022. </p>  <p>  Finally, I would also like to emphasise the important contribution that Sport Ireland makes in this area. Sport Ireland, which is funded by my Department, is the statutory body with responsibility for the development of sport, increasing participation at all levels and raising standards. The Deputy will be interested to note that Sport Ireland is in the process of developing a specific Diversity and Inclusion policy which is expected to be launched by the end of this year. </p></reply>

Its core proposition is that participation in arts, cultural and heritage-based activities drives personal and collective creativity, with significant implications for individual and societal wellbeing and achievement. Under the Creative Communities initiative in the Creative Ireland Programme, my Department and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage provide funding to each of the 31 local authorities to enable them to implement their individual Culture and Creativity Strategies 2018-2022. These Strategies were developed in 2017 following extensive local public consultation and are unique to each local authority, reflecting the breadth of cultural and creative work being undertaken in each area as well as the strategic priorities identified by the local community.  Within this context many music groups as referred to by the Deputy have received support from their local authorities. Further information is available on <i>www.creativeireland.gov.ie/en/creative-communities.</i></p><p>The Department also provides funding to support Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann (CC&Eacute;), which is the largest group involved in the preservation and promotion of Irish traditional music both at community and national level. Annual funding is provided to CC&Eacute; for its work in the protection and promotion of Irish traditional music and culture.</p><p>Thousands of children and young people develop their musical performance (instrumentation and vocal) skills and appreciation skills at these mentored weekly classes, where the emphasis is oral transmission in an appropriate context.  Pre- Covid there were over 1,500 Classes are delivered weekly in community settings. </p><p>With over 400 branches, 18 centres, 7 Regional centres and 11 Outreach centres, a wide variety of formal and informal performance opportunities are provided through the Comhaltas structures and Centres. Each Centre has a local performance group which provides appropriate opportunities for young traditional artists (aged 16 upwards) to participate in formal stage performances.</p><p>Many of the groups referred to by the Deputy partake in festivals and events nationwide and there are a number of initiatives in place in my Department to support such activities. </p><p>The Fleadh Cheoil na h&Eacute;ireann which is run by CC&Eacute; as referred to earlier, has record attendance of 500,000 annually with over 6,000 participating in its competition pre Covid. </p><p>My Department this year again ran a Small Scale Local Festivals and Summer Schools Scheme. The Scheme is designed to support local cultural festivals and summer schools which are not in receipt of other central Government monies, and which may not be eligible under funding criteria for larger scale events supported by F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the Arts Council and similar bodies. The maximum funding available under this scheme is capped at &euro;5,000.Up to 28 small festival projects were allocated a total of &euro;96,391 in 2021.  Details of this allocation may be found at <i>merrionstreet.ie/en/news-room/releases/minister_martin_announces_funding_for_small_scale_local_festivals_and_summer_schools.html</i>. It is currently envisaged that this funding scheme will run again in 2022 and will launch in the first quarter of the year.  Festivals and participative events are also an important part of Irish tourism activities and in this context, F&aacute;ilte Ireland operate the Festival Innovation Programme Fund, which can be found at this link: www.failteireland.ie/Identify-Available-Funding/Festivals-Innovation-Programme.aspx </p><p>Primary support for the arts including music in Ireland is delivered by the Arts Council and it is independent in its funding decisions under the Arts Act 2003. The Arts Council&rsquo;s strategy recognises the distinctive role of amateur arts practice, its important contribution to the vitality of the arts in Ireland, including music, theatre and musical theatre, and it&rsquo;s many personal, social and artistic benefits. Earlier this year the Arts Council ran a pilot scheme as a once-off, action-research opportunity, and seeks enhanced engagement, mentorship and advocacy between the amateur and professional theatre, music and musical-theatre sector. Please see link here to the pilot scheme which was designed to enhance engagement between voluntary and professional arts sectors:  <i>www.artscouncil.ie/Funds/Amateur-and-Voluntary-Practice-Pilot-Scheme/</i></p><p>For over a decade, my Department has provided funding for the purchase of musical instruments and equipment by way of the Music Capital Scheme.  Funding is provided to a wide range of performing groups and talented musicians. Recipients have in the past included brass bands, pipe bands and marching bands as well as community organisations. The Scheme is managed by Music Network on behalf of my Department.  I hope to make an announcement on a new iteration of the scheme over the coming months.</p></reply>

As such, current restrictions under the Government&rsquo;s plan state that organisers of indoor and outdoor group activities should ensure that appropriate protective measures are in place.For indoor sports, this means:  </p><p>- Where individuals have mixed immunity status, pods of up to 6 participants will be permitted (excluding adult coaches/instructors).  </p><p>- Multiple pods will be permissible subject to protective measures. </p><p>- The overall number of pods will have regard to the size of venue and there should be substantial social distance between individual pods. </p><p>- For Vaccinated individuals no fixed capacity limits apply to these activities. </p><p>- For spectators, the use of the EU Digital COVID Certificate (vaccine or recovery certificate) will be required for accessing indoor sporting activities and events. </p><p>- Vaccinated spectators attending indoor sporting events should be fully seated.</p><p>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that Government agreed last week to widen the range of sporting opportunities for young people which enables under 18 indoor sports games and competitions in sports such as basketball to go ahead. On foot of this, updated guidance has been provided by Sport Ireland to sporting organisations to allow children under 18 years of age to participate in indoor games and competition activities according to the ordinary rules and limits of the sport concerned.  The full guidance can be accessed on the Sport Ireland website at:</p><p><i>www.sportireland.ie/covid19/return-to-sport-and-physical-activity  </i></p></reply>

Central to developing a more resilient and sustainable tourism sector will be an increased focus on the promotion and development of sustainable tourism practices such as ecotourism. I recently brought a report to Government which identifies a suite of actions that will promote sustainable tourism practices which can be implemented prior to the development of a new national tourism policy. The successful implementation of these actions will shine a light on areas and destinations that are striving to be best in class in terms of sustainability and provide better access to information and tools for the tourism industry and visitors to practice responsible tourism. </p>  <p>  I am very aware of the important role that tourism plays as a driver of rural economies and I am committed to a continued focus on the potential of tourism to facilitate the development of our rural areas. As we rebuild our tourism sector we will seek to realise Ireland&rsquo;s ambition to be amongst the world-leaders in sustainable tourism practices and set out a path for a green transition of the tourism industry and for our destinations to become leading sustainable tourism destinations. </p>  <p>  Our overall tourism product offering has led to Ireland being recognised internationally as a year-round, high-quality tourism destination in both urban and rural settings.  The further development of our tourism product offering, including any specific plans relating to environmentally sustainable tourism or eco-tourism, are operational matters for F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  Accordingly, I have referred this question to the agency for direct response to the Deputy.  Please advise my private office if you do not receive a reply within ten working days.</p></reply>

The Scheme is designed to support local cultural festivals and summer schools which are not in receipt of other central Government monies, and which may not be eligible under funding criteria for larger scale events supported by F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the Arts Council and similar bodies. Events which are funded by the Arts Council and/or F&aacute;ilte Ireland are not eligible. The maximum funding available under this scheme is capped at &euro;5,000.Full details of this year&rsquo;s scheme, including the application criteria, are available at: <i>www.gov.ie/en/publication/89595-small-scale-local-festivals-and-summer-schools</i>/  </p><p>28 small festival projects were allocated a total of &euro;96,391 in 2021.  Details of this allocation may be found at:<i>merrionstreet.ie/en/news-room/releases/minister_martin_announces_funding_for_small_scale_local_festivals_and_summer_schools.html</i>. It is currently envisaged that this funding scheme will run again in 2022 and will launch in the first quarter of the year.  Further, it is expected that the eligibility criteria will be broadly the same as the 2021 scheme.  Applicants are typically given 4 weeks to apply under the scheme and all applications are subject to a competitive evaluation process.</p><p>The all-of-government Creative Ireland Programme 2017-2022, led by my Department, seeks to enable each citizen to realise their full creative potential.  Under its Creative Communities initiative, annual funding is provided to the 31 local authorities to enable them implement their individual Culture and Creativity Strategies 2018-2022.  In implementing their respective 5-year strategies, some local authorities have utilised their funding allocation to deliver small-scale festivals.  To date since 2017, over &euro;843,000 has been invested delivering 144 festivals.  My Department and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage will continue to allocate funding to support local authority implementation of their individual Culture and Creativity Strategies during 2022.  Also under the Creative Ireland Programme&rsquo;s Creative Climate Action, my Department in collaboration with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, will provide funding to a number of festivals in 2022 to engage the public on the need for climate action and lifestyle and behavioural change.</p><p>The Arts Council also offer a wide range of financial supports across art forms and arts practices, including festivals. The Arts Council sees festivals as key producers and presenters of the arts and are critical to engaging large and diverse audiences. </p><p>The Arts Council also provides financial support to a number of single art form festivals (e.g. theatre, dance, film) and such festivals are supported within the policy context of those art forms. The Council also supports many multidisciplinary arts festivals, meaning those festivals that programme across different art forms, including literature, music, street arts, theatre, visual arts and different areas of arts practice. Their Festivals Investment Scheme, for example, is specifically designed to offer support to local/voluntary organisations to develop arts festivals. The larger festivals regularly supported by the Council include the Wexford Festival Opera and the Galway Arts Festival.</p><p>F&aacute;ilte Ireland supports local authorities in the development of tourism in their area including funding for capital investment, festivals and events. Such supports are an operational matter for F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  Accordingly, I have asked the agency to provide further information directly to the Deputy.  Please advise my private office if you do not receive a reply within ten working days.</p></reply>

As Minister with responsibility for Arts and Culture, I am conscious of the value that this sector brings to all Irish citizens.  The importance of Irish culture, Irish art and Irish productions as a whole cannot be understated - it contributes to individual and societal well-being, as well as contributing to Ireland's reputation as a country with a rich cultural history and output.  The intrinsic value of culture and the arts to society was particularly evident during the pandemic. </p><p>Against this backdrop, and my own experience of the arts, funding for the Basic Income Guarantee Pilot Scheme was a key priority of mine for Budget 2022 and I secured &euro;25m to realise the pilot scheme next year.  </p><p>In relation to the timeline for the launch of the pilot the Deputy will appreciate that this is a major policy intervention requiring significant resources to develop a coherent policy and to operationalise.  This work is ongoing and my ambition is to open the scheme for applications early in Q1 2022. The Oversight Group continues to meet regularly and met yesterday with a representative from SIPTU.</p><p>The selection process for recipients of the basic Income will be finalised following the stakeholder engagement early next month, however, I can confirm the following:</p><p>- Participation in the scheme will not be based on a means test. </p><p>- It will be a non-competitive process, therefore once a person satisfies the eligibility criteria they will be included in a randomised selection process. </p><p>- A number of unsuccessful applicants will be invited to participate in a control group to facilitate a comprehensive ex post appraisal of the pilot in due course.  </p><p>- Proposals for the parameters of the scheme will be finalised in light of the stakeholder engagement.</p><p>I believe the Basic Income Guarantee pilot scheme will bring new life and support to the Arts and Cultural Sector and I hope it will provide an important legacy for our artists and creatives.</p></reply>

The purpose of this scheme is to facilitate the display of pieces from the National Collections, with specific local and regional interest, direct to those communities, and to facilitate the display of cultural artefacts and relating exhibitions outside urban centres into rural areas. The Scheme provides funding towards the transport, cost of insurance and exhibiting costs.</p><p>This Scheme is demand driven and the lending institution must satisfy itself that the criteria of their loan policies are met by the borrowing body to ensure safe display of any objects and artefacts loaned.  Once agreement has been reached between the lending institution and the borrowing body, an application to the Scheme can be made.  Of course, like many areas, the COVID pandemic has had a significant impact on this demand over the last two years.</p><p>Projects previously funded under the Mobility of Collections Scheme include the following:  </p><p>- In 2019 over &euro;10,000 was allocated under the Scheme to facilitate the display of the Tullydonell Hoard of gold rings in Donegal County Museum and 15 artefacts from the National Museum of Ireland to Galway City Museum for an exhibition entitled &ldquo;Keepers of the Gael: Gaelic Ireland 1200-1600A1.&rdquo;  - In 2018 a total of &euro;9,122 was allocated to some of Ireland's museums in order to facilitate important exhibitions , including the loan on a 1790 glass chandelier from the National Museum to the Waterford Museum of Treasures, and several works from the Crawford Art Gallery in Cork to the Hunt Museum in Limerick.</p><p>A full list of all projects funded under this Scheme are available to view on my Departments website, www.gov.ie/en/publication/6acdc-cultural-projects-funding/ </p><p>In addition to the Mobility of Collections Scheme, my Department provides funding to the digitisation of national and significant collections to provide an online offering to the public outside location challenges.  An initial allocation of &euro;2.339 million was awarded in October 2017 to support a range of digitisation projects in Ireland&rsquo;s national cultural institutions and organisations with collections of national significance.  Of this &euro;2.119 million was awarded to 7 of Ireland's National Cultural Institutions.</p><p>The funding was granted to applications that related to some or all of the following funding objectives:  </p><p>- ensure collections are correctly catalogued and digitally captured;  </p><p>- develop the software required to provide access on-line to their Digital Collections; - ensure that the on-line data is of the highest quality using international metadata standards;  </p><p>- allow for the display and discoverability on-line of more of collections; </p><p>- enhance the Institutions outreach and education programmes through greater access to the collections held; </p><p>- increase the potential for tourists to gain greater knowledge of the collections held in Ireland and in particular the National Cultural Institutions;  </p><p>- increase the quality and quantity of metadata that Ireland shared on the Europeana platform;</p><p>- provide for the re-use of digital material; </p><p>- work in partnership with other organisations to support digitisation projects of collections of national significance; &amp;amp; </p><p>- leverage philanthropic support.</p><p>Nearly all of the projects funded have been completed and the results are available to view on my Department website at:<i>www.gov.ie/en/publication/b1eab-creative-arts-grants-and-funding-previous-schemes/</i></p></reply>

It should be noted, that this college is recognised as one of seven residential summer colleges for the purposes of funding under my Department's Sc&eacute;im na bhFoghlaoimeoir&iacute; Gaeilge.</p>  <p>  I understand that the college authorities are in the process of undertaking a feasibility study with a view to making a formal application for capital funding under my Department's  Cl&aacute;r Taca&iacute;ochta&iacute; Pobail agus Teanga and that the college authorities were also in communication with a number of other potential funding organisations.</p>  <p>  While my Department has not received a funding application to date, the Deputy may be assured that any such application for assistance under the aforementioned programme - encompassing a business plan which aligns with the requirements set out in the Public Spending Code - will receive careful consideration in the context of competing priorities and available resources.</p></reply>

As such, current restrictions under the Government&rsquo;s plan state that organisers of indoor and outdoor group activities should ensure that appropriate protective measures are in place. For indoor sports, this means:  </p><p>- Where individuals have mixed immunity status, pods of up to 6 participants will be permitted (excluding adult coaches/instructors).  </p><p>- Multiple pods will be permissible subject to protective measures. </p><p>- The overall number of pods will have regard to the size of venue and there should be substantial social distance between individual pods. </p><p>- For Vaccinated individuals no fixed capacity limits apply to these activities. </p><p>- For spectators, the use of the EU Digital COVID Certificate (vaccine or recovery certificate) will be required for accessing indoor sporting activities and events. </p><p>- Vaccinated spectators attending indoor sporting events should be fully seated.</p><p>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that Government agreed last week to widen the range of sporting opportunities for young people which enables under 18 indoor sports games and competitions in sports such as basketball to go ahead. On foot of this, updated guidance has been provided by Sport Ireland to sporting organisations to allow children under 18 years of age to participate in indoor games and competition activities according to the ordinary rules and limits of the sport concerned.  The full guidance can be accessed on the Sport Ireland website at:</p><p><i>www.sportireland.ie/covid19/return-to-sport-and-physical-activity  </i></p></reply>

There are no Exchequer funds allocated for this purpose. Renewable electricity projects such as onshore wind and solar can currently benefit from participation in the Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS). The RESS, and similar previous support schemes, are supported by the Public Service Obligation (PSO) levy, which is collected from all electricity customers in Ireland through their energy bills.</p>  <p>  The proceeds of the levy are used to contribute to the additional costs incurred by PSO-supported electricity generation which are not recovered in the electricity market, typically via contracts that suppliers have in place with electricity generators. The PSO is a vital policy support for the development of renewable electricity and to enable Ireland reach national and EU renewable energy and climate targets. The money raised from the levy is paid to qualifying generators.</p>  <p>  The legal basis for the PSO levy and its method of calculation are set out in regulations made under the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 and the Public Service Obligations Order 2002 (S.I. 217 of 2002). Under this legislation, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) is assigned responsibility for the calculation of the levy each year and the calculation of the Levy is strictly a CRU matter. </p>  <p>  The CRU is accountable for the performance of its functions to a Committee of the Oireachtas. It provides a dedicated email address for Oireachtas members - oireachtas@cru.ie - to raise questions with CRU on electricity and gas regulatory matters for timely direct reply.  </p></reply>

Of this amount, &euro;109 million will be used to provide free energy efficiency upgrades to households that are in, or at risk of, energy poverty.</p>  <p>  The Better Energy Warmer Homes Scheme delivers a range of energy efficiency measures free of charge to low-income households vulnerable to energy poverty. To date, over 143,000 homes have received free upgrades under the scheme.  In the first six months of 2021, the average value of the energy efficiency measures provided per household was approximately &euro;17,100.  In addition to the significant capital allocation for the Warmer Homes Scheme next year, resources have been provided to expand the capacity of the SEAI to deliver the scheme. In addition, delivery capacity in the supply chain has increased due to a new, broader contractor panel that commenced at the end of 2020.</p>  <p>  Window replacement was introduced as a measure under the Warmer Homes Scheme in 2018. Window replacement can be recommended in limited circumstances, subject to a technical survey by SEAI. This recommendation is typically where only single glaze windows exist and where wall insulation is also being installed. </p>  <p>  The measures available under the scheme were selected as the most likely to deliver significant energy savings to homeowners as well as the best value for money for the Exchequer. Currently, there are no plans to make solar panels available under the Scheme. Separately, the SEAI operates a grant scheme since July 20218 to help domestic customers who install rooftop solar photovoltaic equipment on homes built and occupied before 2011. In addition, the National Retrofit Plan includes a commitment to review ways to improve how current energy poverty schemes target those most in need. Recommendations in relation to the implementation of changes to the scheme to better target those most in need will be finalised shortly. A BER grant is currently available under the SEAI Better Energy Homes Scheme.</p></reply>

Since 2000, over 450,000 homeowners have upgraded their homes with support from these schemes, representing nearly one home in four across the country. This has resulted in warmer, healthier and more comfortable homes that are easier to heat and light.</p>  <p>  &euro;221.5 million in capital funding has been provided this year for SEAI residential and community retrofit programmes. This represents an 82% increase on the 2020 allocation and is the largest amount ever for the schemes. This allocation has facilitated the expansion and improvement of existing SEAI grant schemes and the introduction of new initiatives. </p>  <p>  Extensive COVID-19 related restrictions on construction activity in the residential sector between January and April have had a significant impact on activity and expenditure this year.  Over 9,800 retrofits have been delivered to date in 2021 and the SEAI estimate that the numbers will rise to over 16,000 by the end of the year. The request for the additional specific information sought by the Deputy has been forwarded to the SEAI and available data will be sent to the Deputy as soon as possible. </p>  <p>  In addition to the schemes funded by my Department and operated by the SEAI, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage funds the Local Authority Retrofit Scheme.

Analysis carried out in 2016 for the Strategy to Combat Energy Poverty found that 28% of households in Ireland could be in energy poverty i.e. would need to spend more than 10% of their income on their energy needs. The ESRI carried out an analysis of the number of households at risk of experiencing energy poverty in 2019 and again in 2020. This showed that the share of households needing to spend more than 10% of their income on their energy needs was 17.5% in 2020. The Survey on Income and Living Conditions supports this, indicating that the proportion of people who report that they are unable to afford to keep the home adequately warm, has fallen from 9% in 2015 to 4.9% in 2019.</p>  <p>  A review of the implementation of the Strategy to Combat Energy Poverty will be completed early next year and will inform next steps in relation to the development of a new strategy. Measures to support those least able to afford to retrofit their homes have also been included in the new National Retrofit Plan, which was published as part of Climate Action Plan 2021.</p></reply>

Cork City Council received an allocation of &euro;29.6m and Cork County Council received an allocation of &euro;15.78m under this funding programme. </p>  <p>  To reflect the Government&rsquo;s commitment to Active Travel and the increased funding allocations to walking and cycling, I communicated to the County and City Management Association (CCMA) in January 2021 that extra resources for local authorities and the National Roads Offices (NROs) would be funded by my Department to support and progress the delivery of Active Travel projects around the country. Up to 218 staff have been allocated to local authorities and an additional 30 staff to the NROs under this resourcing initiative. It is anticipated that Cork City Council will receive 11 additional staff and Cork County Council 6 additional staff over the course of the year as recruitment processes have begun and will continue. </p>  <p>  In addition to the increased funding for walking and cycling infrastructure, a number of smaller-scale initiatives are being progressed by my Department to support and promote efforts to increase Active Travel. The Department of Transport funds the delivery of CycleRight training through Cycling Ireland, which delivers cycling training to school-children around the country. In partnership with the Department of Education we also launched the Safe Routes to Schools Programme (SRTS) earlier this year, which aims to accelerate the delivery of walking, scooting and cycling infrastructure on key access routes to schools. 170 schools were notified on 21 June that they have been selected for inclusion in the first round of the SRTS Programme to support walking and cycling infrastructure for primary and post-primary schools including 6 in Cork City Council area and 10 in Cork County Council area. &euro;15 million will be allocated to the schools selected in Round 1 of this Programme.</p>  <p>  Progress is also being made on the Midleton to Youghal Greenway to which nearly &euro;20m has been allocated. This Greenway is expected to open in 2023, whilst pre-construction funding has also been allocated to examine potential Greenway options between Mallow and Dungarvan.</p>  <p>  The step-change in funding committed in Budget 2021 and the introduction of numerous innovative measures to encourage Active Travel shows the Government's commitment to this area, and I look forward to the delivery of the numerous projects and programmes in Cork City and County and around the country. </p></reply>

This year, and each successive year up to 2025 at least, we will see approximately &euro;360 million per annum, 20% of our total transport budget, invested in Ireland&rsquo;s walking and cycling infrastructure to provide a safe and connected network to those who wish to commute to work or school via healthy and sustainable transport modes.</p>  <p>  Active travel, such as walking, cycling and scooting, will play a key role in the decarbonisation of the transport sector. Encouraging a modal shift away from traditionally fossil-fuelled vehicles and towards active modes of travel also has the additional benefit of improving mental and physical health, something which has come into sharp focus in the past year with COVID-19.</p>  <p>  Action 106 the Deputy referred to had been delayed awaiting publication of the Climate Action Plan before the final 5-Year Cycling and Walking Infrastructure Delivery Plan is published to ensure coherence between both documents in terms of active travel actions and targets.</p>  <p>  With the recent publication of the Climate Action Plan 2021 and the commitment therein to reallocate road space to pedestrians and cyclists I expect to receive a revised 5 Year Cycling and Walking Plan shortly from the National Transport Authority and will aim to publish it shortly thereafter.</p></reply>

Total electricity demand over the next ten years is forecast to grow by between 19% and 50%, largely driven by large new energy users, which include transport electricity demand (estimated at circa 23% per annum) as a result of accelerated uptake of EV charging. It is evident therefore that additional electricity generation and enhanced demand management is needed to support the decarbonisation of our economy and society, including the transport sector, and to achieve our emission reduction targets.</p>  <p>  While the supply and provision of electricity to the country is a policy matter for the Department of Energy, Climate and Communications (DECC), and detailed queries on this matter should be directed to that Department rather than the Department of Transport , I can inform the Deputy that under the Climate Action Plan the electricity sector commits to expanding electricity output and refining the grid to meet this additional demand, including the extra demand from electric vehicles. The Plan commits to increasing the share of electricity supply from renewable sources to up to 80%, delivering three new transmission grid connections/interconnectors to Northern Ireland, Great Britain, and the EU, as well as exploring further interconnections to other countries. A range of supporting measures will also be needed to enable this transformation of the electricity generation sector. These will include providing the conventional capacity that will be essential to ensure the security of the system, grid investments, interconnectors, and storage facilities. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Climate Action Plan outlines a number of measures to deliver on increased electricity demand management including:</p>  <p>  - The Commission for the Regulation of Utilities (CRU) will deliver a new Demand Side Strategy      which will aim to have industrial, commercial and residential demand fully participating in supporting system needs with high levels of renewable generation, and seek to facilitate active participation by consumers and communities in the energy market.</p>  <p>  - The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), the CRU and the system operators, will work      with large energy users and enterprise development agencies, to develop approaches to enhance reporting and usage of lower carbon energy sources, including increased transparency of electricity emissions data to enable large energy users to address their electricity emissions across time (hourly) and geographic locations.</p>  <p>  - EirGrid and ESB Networks will undertake an in-depth analysis of local, regional and system level flexibility requirements, and modify their own approaches and procedures to facilitate demand flexibility, to drive down costs to the consumer and provide the necessary flexibility to meet the needs of the energy transition to 2030.</p>  <p>  The Commission for Regulation of Utilities (the CRU) has statutory responsibility, under S.I. 60 of 2005, to monitor and take measures necessary to ensure the security of electricity supply in Ireland.  The CRU is assisted in its statutory role by EirGrid, the electricity transmission system operator. The CRU is an independent statutory body and solely accountable to a committee of the Oireachtas for the performance of its functions.</p>  <p>  EirGrid&rsquo;s Generation Capacity Statement which was published on Wednesday 29 September and covers the period 2021 to 2030 sets out a medium term need to develop 1,850 MW of generation capacity by 2025. On the same day, the CRU published an information note, setting out the programme of actions being progressed to deliver the required generation capacity. The actions include: increasing the availability of existing generators; developing of new generation capacity &ndash; including temporary generation capacity in advance of winter 2022; extending the operational life of some existing generators; new rules for the grid connection of data centres; and actions to enhance demand-side response, including large consumers reducing demand when the system margin is low.</p>  <p>  The Deputy should note that the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) has statutory responsibility to monitor and take measures necessary to ensure the security of electricity supply in Ireland.  In this regard, the CRU recently published a programme of actions to deliver 1,850 MW of generation capacity by 2025. Such actions will help power our future electric fleet. </p></reply>

The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority. </p>  <p>  The extent of the cutbacks in grant funding during the post 2008 recession meant that grant funding for road improvement schemes had to be curtailed because expenditure on protection/renewal was falling well short of what was required to adequately maintain the regional and local road network.</p>  <p>  Funding is not yet at the level needed for the adequate protection and renewal of regional and local roads and so for this reason, the primary focus for capital investment continues to be the protection and renewal of the network with some limited investment in road improvement projects.</p>  <p>  Any road improvement projects proposed by local authorities for consideration for funding are assessed by the Department on a case-by-case basis.

Once funding arrangements have been put in place with Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII), under the Roads Acts 1993-2015 and in line with the National Development Plan (NDP), the operation, management and upgrading of individual national roads is a matter for TII, in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.

The increase in sustainable journeys does not equate to a straight line reduction in car journeys. Based on the modelling done by the National Transport Authority, the abatement potential from the bundle of measures that would achieve these targets is 1.4 MtCO2 emissions. The increased number of daily journeys will be achieved by providing more attractive active travel and public transport options to promote a radical modal shift away car usage.  In addition, the reduced use of fossil-fuelled cars over that time will be achieved through various demand management and behavioural change measures.  </p>  <p>  It is important to highlight that reducing overall car kilometres is not about cancelling trips, but rather it is about reducing the need for, and length of, certain trips. That said achieving this level of reduction in the timeframe envisaged presents a significant challenge given that technology advances can only achieve so much and the heavy reliance on the car among certain cohorts of the population and in certain parts of the country where more sustainable alternatives are limited. For this reason, a suite of potential demand management will need to be delivered in a way that achieves a just transition and supports economic wellbeing. As such, I am committed to providing a wide range of sustainable transport options across the country and undertaking further work to determine how best to pursue our targets in a fair and equitable manner.</p></reply>

I understand that the Authority decided to temporarily close public toilet and waiting facilities in the interests of public safety and as part of its overall Covid-19 resumption of service protocols and in line with health and safety risk assessment procedures, which had to be adopted as part of the RSA's resumption plans. It took account of guidance issued by the Health and Safety Authority and the return to work safely protocol agreed by the Labour and Employer Economic Forum, LEEF. </p>  <p>  In response to a formal request to review these arrangements, the Authority wrote to my Department outlining the absolute necessity of retaining these safety measures. While the Authority recognises that this may be inconvenient for partners, family members and indeed driving instructors who accompany learner drivers to their tests, the fact remains that the more people who enter a building, the greater the risk of Covid spreading. The safety of staff and the public in general must remain the Road Safety Authority's number one priority at this time.</p>  <p>  I would also note that if accompanying persons were allowed to enter test centres, it would mean a potential doubling of the numbers entering centres, and this could be accommodated only by a significant reduction in the numbers of tests offered, with inevitable increases in waiting times for the test.</p></reply>

Pursuant to this key requirement, Article 4 of the Regulation specifies that a Transport Manager designated by a road transport operator must hold a Transport Manager Certificate of Professional Competence (TM CPC) issued by a competent authority of the EU. </p>  <p>  As outlined by the European Commission (notification available at ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/brexit_files/info_site/road_transport_en.pdf), following the end of the Brexit transition period on 31 December 2020 a TM CPC issued by a competent authority in the UK, including Northern Ireland, is no longer valid in the EU.  This means that a Transport Manager holding a UK-issued TM CPC can no longer act as Transport Manager for an EU-based road transport operator. </p>  <p>  My Department received clarification in late November 2020 from the European Commission that holders of a UK TM CPC could request and be granted a corresponding certificate from the competent authority in the Member State where they live or where the road transport operator employing them is established, as long as their request was submitted before the end of the Brexit transition period on 31 December 2020.  My Department wrote to all UK (including Northern Ireland) TM CPC holders working for Irish road transport operators to inform them of this position, urging them to apply for a corresponding Irish (EU) certificate. </p>  <p>  As a result, a total of 284 corresponding Irish TM CPCs in road haulage and 49 Irish TM CPCs in road passenger transport were issued.  It is not possible to quantify the number of UK/NI TM CPC holders who did not avail of the facility to obtain a corresponding Irish certificate, as the number of such individuals who are unidentified to the Department is not known. </p>  <p>  As the deadline has now passed for applying for a corresponding Irish TM CPC, any persons holding a UK-issued TM CPC who wish to act as Transport Manager for an Irish/EU operator must obtain a TM CPC issued by an EU Member State. Obtaining an Irish TM CPC requires passing the examination administered by the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport (CILT) on behalf of my Department.  </p>  <p>  Candidates who already hold a UK-issued TM CPC will not be required to undertake the training course of 100 hours that is normally mandatory before taking the CILT TM CPC examination.  The next date for the examination is 24 November 2021 and candidates can register online with CILT for the examination (contact info@cilt.ie).</p></reply>

This position is reinforced by the EU legislative framework for insurance (the <i>Solvency II</i>Directive). </p><p>Having said that, the Government is acutely aware of the concerns felt by many sectors, including the ones highlighted by the Deputy, regarding the cost and availability of insurance. It has therefore prioritised the implementation of the <i>Action Plan for Insurance Reform</i>. As the Deputy may be aware, the first Action Plan Implementation Report, which was published in July, shows that significant progress has been made, with 34 of the 66 actions contained therein now completed. </p><p>One of the key achievements in the first half of this year was the implementation of the Personal Injuries Guidelines some six months ahead of schedule. Early data from the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB) shows that since the commencement of the new Guidelines award levels have reduced by an average of 40%. This is an encouraging development; it is my hope that this trend will continue and result in lower costs for businesses.  As the insurance reform agenda progresses, we will continue to hold the industry to account on its commitments to pass on savings from the Guidelines, and other elements of the reforms, to customers. Minister of State Fleming, in his ongoing engagement with the sector, has emphasised the need for insurance providers to reduce premiums and increase their risk appetite to provide cover in new areas. A further element of the Action Plan with particular relevance to these types of activities involves reviewing the Duty of Care. The Minister for Justice, who is leading on this action, has noted to Government the intention to bring forward legislative proposals to reform the law in this area. My officials understand from their Department of Justice colleagues that these proposals are at an advanced stage. </p><p>I would like to take this opportunity to assure the Deputy that securing a more sustainable and competitive market through deepening and widening the supply of insurance in Ireland remains a key policy priority for this Government.  In this regard, it is my intention to work with my Government colleagues to ensure that the implementation of the Action Plan can continue to have a positive impact on the affordability and availability of insurance for all individuals, businesses and community groups across the country, including for hunts, other leisure, sporting and charity businesses. </p></reply>

Therefore, meeting the target of an average of 33,000 homes per year will clearly require a significant increase in delivery. This increase in delivery will also require an increase in investment to support the building of new homes - in particular in the form of development finance. </p>  <p>  This development finance will be needed by all those involved in developing homes across all regions of our country, from small and medium sized builders and developers, to larger operators, and this finance must come from a range of sources.</p>  <p>  The Housing for All plan has clearly set out that public monies alone will not account for all of the funding for housing development in the State. External sources of finance will be needed to bridge the gap between the overall funding requirement to build an average of 33,000 homes each year, and that provided via direct Exchequer funding, State borrowing, Home Building Finance Ireland and the domestic banking sector. </p>  <p>  Housing for All committed to the establishment of three dedicated work streams to drive the delivery of key aspects of the plan. This includes an investment work stream, which is chaired by the Department of Finance and includes membership from the Department of Housing Local Government and Heritage, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment and the NTMA.  </p>  <p>  Through the Housing for All investment work stream, there will be ongoing stakeholder engagement with a wide range of public and private bodies with a role in financing housing development. This will include engagement with public bodies involved in home delivery such as Home Building Finance Ireland, the Land Development Agency, the Housing Finance Agency, the Irish Strategic Investment Fund, the European Investment Bank and the Council of Europe Development Bank, amongst others. It will also include engagement with domestic banks and private entities including institutional investors who also play an important role in funding the supply of additional property in Ireland, as is the case in most other property markets. The forward investment provided by investors provides capital to construct additional properties and many of these homes would not be available without the investment provided. </p>  <p>  This engagement with stakeholders across the broad spectrum of funding for residential development is an important means of understanding the funding landscape and supporting the availability of the right type of finance for the wide variety of home developers and development schemes nationwide. </p>  <p>  Currently, consideration is being given to the nature and type of this engagement.</p>  <p>  Any engagement with institutional investors is not undertaken with a view to encouraging the bulk buying of residential houses. Rather, it is one part of a broader targeted engagement with all public and private bodies with a role in financing housing development, to ensure an adequate supply of appropriate finance to support the development of additional homes across the State. </p>  <p>  Ensuring that people have access to home ownership in this country is a priority for this Government. Building up supply, after a period during which construction was forced to close for a significant period of time, is key to delivering on the ambitious targets set in Housing for All and making sure that those who wish to develop homes have access to a range of appropriate funding sources, both public and private, is central to the delivery of additional homes across the country. Engagement with key stakeholders is an important and legitimate means of gathering information on the funding landscape for residential housing development.</p></reply>

As such, current restrictions under the Government&rsquo;s plan state that organisers of indoor and outdoor group activities should ensure that appropriate protective measures are in place. For indoor sports, this means:</p><p>- The use of the EU Digital COVID Certificate (vaccine or recovery certificate) will be required for accessing indoor sporting activities and events. </p><p>- Where individuals have mixed immunity status, pods of up to 6 participants will be permitted (excluding adult coaches/instructors).</p><p>- Multiple pods will be permissible subject to protective measures.</p><p>- The overall number of pods will have regard to the size of venue and there should be substantial social distance between individual pods.</p><p>- For Vaccinated individuals no fixed capacity limits apply to these activities.</p><p>- For spectators, the use of the EU Digital COVID Certificate (vaccine or recovery certificate) will be required for accessing indoor sporting activities and events.</p><p>- Vaccinated spectators attending indoor sporting events should be fully seated.</p><p>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that Government agreed last week to widen the range of sporting opportunities for young people which enables under 18 indoor sports games and competitions in sports such as basketball to go ahead. On foot of this, updated guidance has been provided by Sport Ireland to sporting organisations to allow children under 18 years of age to participate in indoor games and competition activities according to the ordinary rules and limits of the sport concerned.  The full guidance can be accessed on the Sport Ireland website at:</p><p>www.sportireland.ie/covid19/return-to-sport-and-physical-activity</p></reply>

The original closing date for applications was 12 February 2021 but in view of difficulties some applicants were encountering as a result of Covid restrictions, this deadline was extended until 1 March 2021.  By this closing date, 3,106 applications had been submitted seeking over &euro;200m in funding.  This is the highest number of applications ever received.</p>  <p>  The scoring system and assessment procedures were finalised and published earlier this year and all applications are being assessed in accordance with these procedures. </p>  <p>  Approximately one thousand of the submitted applications were for 'equipment-only' projects. These applications were assessed first and grants with a total value of &euro;16.6m were announced on 6 August 2021. The letter of provisional allocation encouraged all grantees to draw down this funding before year-end if possible and in recent weeks my Department has been prioritising the payments of all existing grants. Ensuring that as many older grants as possible are paid before year-end will maximise the funding available to allocate for the 2020 capital SCEP applications.</p>  <p>  In relation to these 2020 capital SCEP applications, assessment work is continuing and every effort is being made to have it complete as quickly as possible. Given the record number of applications received however, it is likely to take a further number of weeks to have these assessments complete. </p>  <p>  In relation to the funding available to allocate, as already stated, the payment of as many older grants as possible before the end of this year will help increase the potential allocation amount for these remaining capital applications. I am pleased that following completion of the 2022 budget discussions, at least &euro;34.535m has been provided for the SCEP in 2022. This represents an increase of &euro;6.6m on the 2021 allocation. This will cover all existing allocations under older rounds of the Programme plus significant new allocations for the 2020 Capital applications. Every effort will be made to fund as many worthwhile projects as possible while providing a sufficient level of grant to ensure the projects are viable.  </p></reply>

The future of local media and local print media fell within its remit.</p>  <p>  The Commission engaged comprehensively with stakeholders, including broadcasters, journalists, publishers, regional media and the wider public. The first phase of the Future of Media Commission public consultation, which ran from December 12th 2020 to January 8th 2021, resulted in over 800 written submissions from stakeholder groups and the general public on a wide range of themes, including many submissions from local media organisations.</p>  <p>  At the end of January 2021, the Commission began a series of thematic dialogues through online webinars in which panels of experts explored key themes in more depth and answered follow-up questions from the virtual audience and the Commission members.  Local Media played an active part in these dialogues. </p>  <p>  The work of the Future of Media Commission has now been completed.  The report of the Commission has been submitted to An Taoiseach and myself and we are currently considering its contents in advance of bringing the matter to Government., after which the report will be published.  </p></reply>

The GAA and its county boards are entitled to apply directly for Sports Capital and Equipment Programme funding up to a value of &euro;300,000 for assistance to upgrade and improve county grounds and stadiums.</p>  <p>  The latest (2020) round of the SCEP closed for applications on Monday 1st March 2021. By the closing date, over 3,100 applications were submitted seeking over &euro;200m in funding. This is the highest number of applications ever received. Approximately one thousand of the submitted applications were for 'equipment-only' projects. These applications were assessed first and grants with a total value of &euro;16.6m were announced on the 6th August. The remaining applications for capital works are now being assessed. This work is ongoing with allocations for all successful applications expected to be announced in the coming months. Once these allocations are finalised an announcement will be made in relation to the next call for applications.</p>  <p>  The Large Scale Sport Infrastructure Fund (LSSIF) is designed for projects where the grant sought is greater than the maximum available under the SCEP. The first allocations under the LSSIF were announced in January 2020 and, thus far, approximately &euro;86.4m has been awarded to 33 different proposals.  Of those 33 proposals, 5 were identified by the GAA, LGFA and Camogie Association as being consistent with their national strategies for the development of their sport. Of those 5 grants,  3 are for improvements to county grounds.</p>  <p>  The priority in the short term is to advance all of these projects. As it is now over 18 months since the first allocations were made, and in view of the issues faced by grantees as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is timely to review progress on all projects. My Department is engaging with all grantees in this regard. The timing of any new call for proposals is also being considered and it is expected that the Review will be completed shortly.</p>  <p>  Details of all allocations, including those made for county grounds, under the SCEP since 2000 are published at ww.gov.ie/en/collection/471ed5-sports-capital-allocations/.

A Tourism Recovery Taskforce was appointed in 2020 to prepare a Tourism Recovery Plan with recommendations on how best the Irish tourism sector can adapt and recover in a changed tourism environment as a result of the crisis. The Taskforce undertook a public consultation process that garnered over 800 responses, including submissions from 60 organisations. This input helped guide and influence the key pillars of the report and informed the recommendations in terms of the survival and recovery phases for the sector.</p>  <p>  The Taskforce presented the Tourism Recovery Plan 2020 &ndash; 2023 to me in September 2020. The Plan makes a number of recommendations to help tourism businesses to survive, stabilise and recover from the COVID pandemic. In December 2020, I appointed a Recovery Oversight Group, who report to me on a regular basis with updates on the implementation of the recommendations set out in the Recovery Plan and on the recovery of the sector.</p>  <p>  I regularly meet with and remain open to engaging with, a wide variety of tourism stakeholders and representative bodies. The Hospitality and Tourism Forum, which the T&aacute;naiste and I established, continues to provide a platform for structured engagement between the Hospitality and Tourism sectors, the tourism agencies and relevant Government Departments. The purpose of the Forum is to allow key issues to be discussed, with a view to identifying practical actions which could be taken by Government or by industry itself, to support the sectors.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2022, I secured a record level of funding for tourism that will address short-term survival-related concerns and also enable recovery across industry as we reopen to international tourism and begin to transition to a more sustainable future. This includes a &euro;35 million increase in the Tourism Marketing Fund in 2022, to accelerate the return of international tourism to Ireland.  Budget 2022 also included a provision of &euro;50 million for further business continuity support for strategic tourism businesses that can help drive the sustainable recovery of our tourism sector; and an additional provision for skills development and staff retention.</p>  <p>  There is increasing recognition that tourism growth must be sustainable, as well as being consistent with our sectoral climate change targets and commitments. In that regard, I know that Tourism Ireland and F&aacute;ilte Ireland are working towards the longer term goal of ensuring that we are successfully marketed as a sustainable tourism destination.</p>  <p>  The work of the Recovery Oversight Group, in addition to my on-going engagement with industry stakeholders and representatives, will inform future policy considerations as I continue to work, alongside my Government colleagues, to support the tourism sector over the coming year and beyond.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-11-11a.693.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1471" speakername="Catherine Martin" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021111100082#WRP02400"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 259 and 261 to 263, inclusive, together.</p><p>The all-of Government Creative Ireland Programme 2017-2022, led by my Department, seeks to enable each citizen to realise their full creative potential. Under its Creative Communities initiative, annual funding is provided to the 31 local authorities to enable them implement their individual Culture and Creativity Strategies 2018-2022 and to support the delivery of Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g, the national day of free creative activities for children and young people.</p><p>During 2020, funding to local authorities by the Programme substantially increased to support the delivery of the strategies, including responding to COVID-19. This higher level of funding was maintained in 2021, including the continuation of the Creativity in Older Age Scheme. The scheme invited local authorities, directly and/or through partnerships with creative operators or organisations in the community, to deliver initiatives that supported positive aging, mitigated the negative impact of social cocooning and social distancing, and developed new forms of creative engagement for older people that accommodated prevailing public health guidance in the community and for residential care facilities.  Funding allocated to the Local Authorities through Creative Communities from January 2020 to date will be sent directly to the Deputy.</p><p>The Culture and Creativity Team in Kildare County Council delivered a wide range of community based initiatives that engaged cultural and arts groups. These included the Lockdown Art Exhibition 2020 at the John Sullivan Day Centre in Clane and the Kildare Covid-19 Notebook project which engaged older people and those who were cocooning. Building on a very successful public art intervention, two artworks (murals) exploring local fauna, flora and biodiversity were delivered in Monasterevin Town with additional support provided by my department in 2021 to continue the initiative.</p><p>My Department has funded a wide range of activities in the cultural sphere, many of which involve the online presentation of events that would normally have taken place live and in-person. These include a myriad of online performances, events such as Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g and a wide range of activities presented by Ireland's National Cultural Institutions.</p><p>I am acutely aware of the devastating impact the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the arts/culture and live entertainment sectors. To support the industry through this difficult period I have to date allocated funding for a suite of measures designed to sustain and support live performance and employment opportunities in the sector, including the following schemes detailed below. <table>    <tr>       <th>Scheme</th>       <th>Allocation</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Live Performance Support Scheme 2021 (LPSS2021)</td>       <td>&euro;25m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Music and Entertainment Business Assistance Scheme (MEBAS I, II &amp;amp;amp; MEBAS Phase 2)</td>       <td>&euro;4m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Event Sector Covid Support Scheme (&euro;11.5m of which was funded via transfer from D/ETE) and ESCSS Phase 2</td>       <td>&euro;16.5m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Local Live Performance Programming Scheme (LLPPS)</td>       <td>&euro;5m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Commercial Entertainment Capital Grant Scheme</td>       <td>&euro;5m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Patrick's Day Festival</td>       <td>&euro;1m</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>In July 2020, my Department opened up a new funding scheme, Stream D of the Cultural Capital Scheme 2019-2022 as a direct response to the COVID 19 crisis. The primary focus of the scheme is the capital adaptations, renovations or supply of equipment necessary for arts and culture facilities to help them reopen safely and to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in these facilities. The theatre to which the Deputy refers applied under this scheme in November 2020 and was awarded &euro;10,000 towards the cost of live streaming equipment including cameras, network, video production system and its associated installation<b>. </b>This funding was fully drawn down in June 2021.</p><p>The Arts Council is the agency through which Government support for the arts sector is delivered. In 2021, I allocated a record &euro;130m to the Arts Council to provide for the arts sector including those in the performing arts. Details of Arts Council funding of arts organisations is  published on its website.</p></reply>

I allocated over &euro;60m to support the sector and drive employment opportunities through the introduction of the following schemes:</p><p>- &euro;25m Live Performance Support Scheme (LPSS)</p><p>- &euro;16.5m Events Sector Covid Support Scheme (ESCSS)</p><p>- &euro;10m Local Live Performance Support Scheme (LLPSS)</p><p>- &euro;4m Music and Entertainment Support Scheme (MEBAS)</p><p>- &euro;5m Commercial Entertainment Capital Grant Scheme (CECGS) and</p><p>- &euro;1m St. Patricks Festival.</p><p>I have allocated &euro;25m for the live entertainment sector as part of Budget 2022 and I am examining the supports in place for the sector to ensure that available resources are best deployed to meet the needs of the sector to ensure a full recovery is possible.</p><p>As part of Budget 2022, I have maintained the Arts Council allocation at the record-level of &euro;130m. This allocation will allow the Arts Council to continue to protect jobs and livelihoods of artists, and assist arts organisations through financial difficulties.</p><p>Other priorities for Budget 2022 was to secure &euro;25m in funding for a pilot Basic Income Guarantee Scheme for artists and arts workers. I plan to launch this pilot scheme early in 2022.</p><p>Culture Ireland, which operates under the aegis of my Department, promotes Irish arts worldwide. While traditionally funding was being offered towards travel and travel related costs only, owing to COVID-19, since early 2020 support is also offered towards presentation by Irish artists online.  In response to the quickly changing situation over the past 19 months, Culture Ireland has increased the frequency of its grant rounds from 3 to 6 per year.</p><p>The global pandemic also gave rise to Culture Ireland&rsquo;s Ireland Performs initiative which was an early direct response allowing Irish artists to connect from their locality with global audiences online. It was followed by SEODA online festival celebrating St Patrick's Day which was curated and delivered on Culture Ireland&rsquo;s YouTube channel.</p><p>In late 2020,  Music Industry Stimulus Package with  a fund of &euro;1.7m was put in place to stimulate areas of work usually funded with income from artists' own sources, including live event fees. The music stimulus schemes was targeted at professional musicians and their teams and supported song writing camps, recording and album releases.</p><p>To date almost &euro;1.9m was spent by Culture Ireland on support for individual artists, art organisations and annually funded initiatives in 2021.</p></reply>

The Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport, Gaeltacht and Media is responsible for coordinating its implementation.</p>  <p>  The Action Plan and the second annual progress report published recently, covering the 18 month period from 1 July 2019 to 31 December 2020, present a clear overview of the 180 or so actions being advanced by c. 60 stakeholders in support of the language and Gaeltacht regions.  </p>  <p>  A copy of the Action Plan, together with the aforementioned progress report, can be found on the Department's website at www.gov.ie.</p>  <p>  I might also point out that an additional exchequer allocation of &euro;7m has been provided in Budget 2022 for the Irish language and Gaeltacht sectors, ultimately meaning that total funding in excess of &euro;85m is being deployed in support of the Irish language via my Department alone next year.</p>  <p>  A budget allocation of &euro;5.8m will be made available in 2022 to support the Language Planning Process.  This will enable my Department to fund both &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and Foras na Gaeilge who are tasked under the Gaeltacht Act 2012 with supporting the language planning process.  It will also enable my Department to support, at a central level, organisations which operate in the Early Years and Childhood, Family and Traditional Arts sectors as an additional support to the language planning process.  </p>  <p>  I should also add that my Department provides significant co-funding to Foras na Gaeilge to carry out its statutory mandate under the British-Irish Agreement Act 1999, to promote the Irish language on an all-island basis. This funding, along with funding from the Department for Communities in Northern Ireland, enables Foras na Gaeilge to provide support, advice and financial assistance to many community language groups and to its six lead organisations, who are working to promote the Irish language on an all-island basis.</p>  <p>  Finally, as the Deputy may be aware, the Official Languages (Amendment) Bill 2019 is progressing through the Oireachtas at present.  The primary purpose of the Bill is to amend the Official Languages Act 2003 with a view to increasing and improving the provision of public services through the Irish language. </p>  <p>  I am confident that these measures will improve the use of the Irish language in the provision of State services in the years to come. </p></reply>

Current expenditure funding for Sport Ireland for 2022 will be &euro;96 million, an increase of over &euro;4m from 2021. This funding will enable Sport Ireland to continue to support the sport sector as it recovers from the challenges of Covid.

As part of the framework, the Commissioner will devise binding online safety codes that will set out how regulated online services, including social media services, are expected to deal with certain defined categories of harmful online content on their platforms. The defined categories of harmful online content include criminal material, serious cyber-bullying material and material promoting self-harm, suicide and eating disorders.</p>  <p>  Under the measures proposed in the OSMR Bill, in the event of a failure to comply with a relevant online safety code, and subject to Court approval, the Media Commission will have the power to sanction non-compliant online services, including through financial sanctions of up to &euro;20m or 10% of turnover.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note also that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will remain the appropriate authority to investigate individual instances of criminal material online and refer alleged perpetrators for prosecution by the Director of Public Prosecutions. The OSMR Bill is focussed on ensuring that there is appropriate oversight of the systems that designated online services have in place to deal with such content.</p>  <p>  In terms of progress, the Joint Oireachtas Committee (JOC) for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media recently published its pre-legislative scrutiny report in relation to the General Scheme of the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill.  The 33 recommendations contained in the report raise a wide range of important issues and highlight the scale and complexity of the matters to be addressed in the Bill. These recommendations are now being given careful consideration, following which the detailed drafting process being undertaken by the Office of the Attorney General will be finalised.  The next steps will be publication of the Bill and it will then be brought forward for passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to note also that &euro;5.5 million was allocated in Budget 2022 to establish a new regulator, the Media Commission, under the OSMR Bill, including an Online Safety Commissioner.  While the Commission will ultimately be funded by an industry levy, this start-up funding will enable the Commission to begin work on key issues and to hit the ground running following the enactment of the Bill in 2022.</p></reply>

In May this year, I announced funding to extend this project to schools, as well as voluntary and community groups, in other areas of Dublin City, Cork City, Limerick City, Bray, and Drogheda. </p>  <p>  - Furthermore under the DEIS Gaeltachta initiative, the Department provides funding for 50 scholarships annually worth c. &euro;850 each to qualifying students attending DEIS post-primary schools to cover the cost of attending an Irish Language Summer College in the Gaeltacht, thus making the Gaeltacht experience available to students from all socio-economic backgrounds.</p>  <p>  I welcome the Deputy&rsquo;s interest in this matter and trust that the above is of assistance to him in appreciating the contribution of my Department to the promotion of social inclusion and cohesion across the country.</p></reply>

The OPW has no role whatsoever in the management of car parking at this site. </p><p>At no point during 2021 has the National Park had to close as a result of the carpark being full. The car park itself, however, reached full capacity on 24 occasions during 2021, meaning for a limited period (usually less than 2 hours and generally between 12.30-2.30 pm) no further vehicular access was possible to the site, which remained open. Plenty of advance warnings were given through use of road signs and information on social media and our website.</p><p>My Department is well aware of the value of Glenveagh National park to the economy of the North West via tourism and it attracts more than 200,000 visitors to the region per annum. As the Deputy will appreciate, the National Park is first and foremost an area of high ecological natural heritage value and beauty. Capacity challenges in National Parks, nature reserves and scenic protected areas cannot simply be addressed through expanding car-parking alone. Any measures to reduce such pressures on habitats and natural amenities must be sensitive to their protected status and to the carrying capacity of the site itself.</p><p>In this regard, my Department has developed a draft Visitor Experience Development and Management Plan (VEDMP) for Glenveagh National Park  in conjunction with F&aacute;ilte Ireland, working with a multi-disciplinary team at Consarc Design Group. The Plan will facilitate improved visitor access and address visitor capacity issues. The key objective of the VEDMP is to create a sustainable balance between enhancing Glenveagh as a major visitor destination based on outdoor recreation, trail networks, and direct experiences with nature, and conserving its natural, built and cultural heritage.  The VEDMP plan has been designed to be rolled out in interconnected phases over a number of years.</p><p>The range of features within the Plan is truly ambitious. They include, to name just a few:</p><p>- a new visitor Gateway Hub and trailhead at the entrance to the Park; </p><p>- repurposing of the existing visitor centre and of several historic estate service buildings;</p><p>- construction of a new contemporary restaurant, shop and visitor services building;</p><p>- enhancement and extension of trail network; </p><p>- conservation and restoration of historic rooms at Glenveagh Castle;</p><p>- expanded parking capacity.</p></reply>

The 2011 Regulations do not provide local authorities with any discretion to exceed the limits that apply to their administrative areas.</p>  <p>  Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI, Universal Social Charge and Additional Superannuation Contribution. The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once-off in nature. </p>  <p>  The income bands are expressed in terms of a maximum net income threshold for a single-person household, with an allowance of 5% for each additional adult household member, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10% and separately a 2.5% allowance for each child.</p>  <p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced in 2011 also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.</p>  <p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support. The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources.</p>  <p>  As part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is underway. As set out in Housing for All - a New Housing Plan for Ireland, the efficiency of the banding model and its application to local authorities will be considered. Equivalisation as between singles and families will also be considered. The review will also have regard to new initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and Cost Rental housing. I intend that the review will be completed this year.</p></reply>

Therefore, in order to avail of the loan, applicants must have a deposit equivalent to 10% of the market value of the property. </p><p>Further information is available on the dedicated website <i>www.rebuildingirelandhomeloan.ie</i></p><p>For prospective purchasers of newly-built properties, the availability, through the Revenue Commissioners, of the Help to Buy Initiative for first-time buyers may provide additional assistance to prospective applicants for the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan.</p><p><i>www.revenue.ie/en/property/help-to-buy-incentive/index.aspx</i></p><p>As part of Housing for All, I announced a reformed successor to the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan Scheme, the 'Local Authority Home Loan'.  The Local Authority Home Loan will include an increase in the income ceiling for single applicants which will increase home ownership in areas where house prices are higher. </p><p>For counties where the scheme&rsquo;s house price limit is &euro;320,000 (Cork, Dublin, Galway, Kildare, Louth, Meath and Wicklow), the income ceiling for a single applicant will be &euro;65,000. This will be an increase of &euro;15,000 on the &euro;50,000 income ceiling under the current Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan scheme. In the rest of the country where the scheme&rsquo;s house price limit is &euro;250,000, the income ceiling for a single applicant will remain &euro;50,000. The income ceiling for joint applicants is &euro;75,000. This measure will have a significant impact on a single person&rsquo;s borrowing capacity and supports the policy objective of supporting home ownership.</p><p>I have already implemented a reduction of the mortgage interest rate for new borrowers by 0.25% under the existing Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan (RIHL), as from 10 September 2021. This reduction has helped make repayments more affordable for all borrowers and increases their borrowing capacity. This lower rate will be retained for mortgages issued under the forthcoming Local Authority Home Loan scheme.</p><p>I look forward to announcing further details in respect of the Local Authority Home Loan in the coming months.</p></reply>

A budget of &euro;85 million in 2022 will see approximately 2,400 units delivered under the programme.</p>  <p>  - The National Planning Framework has embedded the policy of compact growth into the overall strategy for the country. </p>  <p>  - Maximising the use of our existing housing stock, especially in our towns and cities, through the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe (Towns) Fund to support the refurbishment of vacant homes and a new Local Authority-led programme for the CPO of vacant properties for resale on the open market. </p>  <p>  The transition to an energy efficient and fossil fuel free built environment will provide extensive social, economic and environmental benefits in the short as well as long-term. This process will bring about reduced energy costs and more comfortable, healthier, safer, and less costly to heat and cool, homes enhancing our living standards, improving our air quality and helping to address energy poverty. It will also improve energy security and reduce Ireland&rsquo;s dependence on fossil fuels in addition to other significant co-benefits for the environment and socio-economic development.   </p>  <p>  My colleague, the Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications has committed to the retrofitting of 500,000 homes to BER B2 standard by 2030, and installing 600,000 renewable energy heating sources in both new and existing residential buildings.</p>  <p>  My Department has committed to actions across diverse areas such as planning systems, wind energy, climate science, climate services, social housing retrofitting and peatlands restoration to deliver the Climate Action Plan for the years ahead. </p>  <p>  This Government is committed to the transformational shift of our economies and societies towards climate resilient and sustainable development.  Ireland is supporting and driving many climate related actions across a local and a national level and we will continue with this work while also working with our international partners to drive the climate change agenda. </p></reply>

This funding is being provided through local authorities and will largely support infrastructure improvements for Group Water Schemes in rural areas. Details of these projects/schemes that received an allocation can be found on my Department's website at this address:www.gov.ie/en/circular/cf807-circular-l219-approval-of-schemesprojects-under-the-multi-annual-rural-water-programme-2019-2021-and-grant-allocations-to-local-authorities-for-2019/</p>  <p> My Department monitors progress under the Programme based on the expenditure of each local authority. However, it does not hold a data base which would include information in the manner requested in the question. Each local authority has a dedicated Rural Water Liaison Officer and further queries in relation to specific schemes/projects can be addressed to the Officer in the relevant local authority.</p>  <p>  My Department, under the oversight of the Rural Water Working Group, is currently reviewing the Framework for the upcoming Multi-annual Rural Water Programme 2022-2024. In reviewing the Framework the Working Group is also considering emerging demands within the Rural Water Sector, to expand and improve on the previous multi-annual programme. </p>  <p>  Under the National Development Plan 2021-2030 funding has been allocated over the period 2021 to 2025 for (non-Irish Water) investment in rural water infrastructure. This includes &euro;175 million for the Rural Water Programme to be delivered through the multi-annual programme.</p>  <p>  I expect to receive a submission on the Framework in the coming weeks for my consideration with, subject to my approval, the bids process for the upcoming multi-annual programme to take place early in the new-year. The process will allow, projects/schemes in the Rural Water Sector requiring capital works, an opportunity to bid for funding.  </p></reply>

The first local authority affordable purchase homes delivered under the Serviced Sites Fund will be delivered in December 2021.</p>  <p>  Delivery of affordable housing in accordance with the Local Authority Affordable Purchase Scheme established in Part 2 of the Affordable Housing Act 2021 will be underpinned by the preparation by each local authority's Housing Delivery Action Plan.  All homes made available under affordable housing schemes must adhere to eligibility criteria prescribed under the Act. </p>  <p>  Local authorities will be submitting their Plans to me, to include social and affordable housing, before the end of December 2021. This will allow each Local Authority, to determine any affordability constraint in their area based on the Housing Need and Demand Assessment and plan the provision of affordable homes accordingly.</p>  <p>  Part 4 of the Affordable Housing Act provides for the &lsquo;First Home&rsquo; scheme to primarily support affordability-constrained first-time buyers to purchase privately developed new homes. This scheme will commence in 2022 and will be available at a national level.</p>  <p>  Part 3 of the Affordable Housing Act provides for the establishment of a Cost Rental sector in Ireland, through the Ministerial designation of Cost Rental dwellings. Budget 2021 allocated &euro;35 million to the Cost Rental Equity Loan (CREL) scheme which enabled the first Cost Rental homes to be delivered this year by the Cl&uacute;id AHB at Taylor Hill, Balbriggan. The tenanting processes for further Cost Rental homes at Enniskerry Road in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown and Barnhall, Leixlip, County Kildare, are currently underway. In total, 390 Cost Rental units will be delivered through this funding, with the initial focus being in the Greater Dublin Area and Cork. A further &euro;75 million was allocated in Budget 2022 to help meet the Housing for All target of 750 Cost Rental homes in 2022.</p>  <p>  The Land Development Agency will deliver homes for both affordable purchase and Cost Rental.  The Housing for All strategy outlines how the Land Development Agency through Project Tosaigh will seek to unlock stalled developments and accelerate the delivery of affordable homes.</p>  <p>  In addition the Help to Buy Scheme and the Local Authority Home loan scheme remain available nationally and make housing more affordable to purchasers.</p>  <p>  In relation to the question posed regarding the number of social houses allocated in the past six weeks to date, information of this exact type is not held by my Department. Information relating to allocation of housing is available from individual local authorities.</p>  <p>  The recently published Housing for All strategy is the Government&rsquo;s plan to increase the supply of housing to an average of 33,000 per year over the next decade, including an average of 10,000 social homes per annum from 2022-2030. Housing for All is supported by an investment package of over &euro;4b per annum, through an overall combination of &euro;12bn in direct Exchequer funding, &euro;3.5bn in funding through the Land Development Agency and &euro;5bn in funding through the Housing Finance Agency over a five year period. </p>  <p>  Under Housing for All, the Government will deliver 47,600 new build social homes and 3,500 social homes through long-term leasing in the period 2022-2026. Individual targets for the delivery of housing have been provided to each local authority and their Housing Delivery Action Plans will set out details on how and when local authorities will deliver their housing targets, including the delivery of affordable homes.</p></reply>

My Department is fully committed to allocating resources over the coming weeks to assist with the high volume of applications, with a focus on reducing turnaround times.</p>  <p>  People may apply for Irish citizenship through Foreign Birth Registration if one of their grandparents was born in Ireland or if one of their parents was an Irish citizen at the time of their birth, even if their parent was not born in Ireland. Once a person is entered onto the Foreign Births Register, they are an Irish citizen and are entitled to apply for an Irish passport.</p>  <p>  In order to protect the integrity of the citizenship process, Foreign Birth Registration applications require very careful analysis in order to validate both the identity of the applicant and their entitlement to Irish citizenship. Accordingly, such applications undergo rigorous checking by experienced staff at the Passport Service.</p>  <p>  Demand for Foreign Birth Registration services reached unprecedented levels following the Brexit referendum in 2016, resulting in a peak of 32,000 online applications received in 2019. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the processing time for Foreign Birth Registration applications stood at 18 months. This processing time is due to the unprecedented peak in applications as a result of Brexit and the aforementioned rigorous validation which citizenship applications undergo. </p>  <p>  Operations at the Passport Service were severely disrupted by public health restrictions brought about by the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. During this period, unfortunately, it was necessary to pause Foreign Birth Registration processing in order to focus also on the provision of urgent passport services. When Passport services were scaled up in May 2021 to more normal operational levels, in line with the phased easing of restrictions, Foreign Birth Registration staff were redeployed to assist with the delivery of our expanded essential passport services operation. Throughout the pandemic, the Foreign Birth Registration Service continued to consider urgent requests to expedite an application on a case by case basis, in cases such as expectant parents, or stateless persons. Over 5,000 emergency Foreign Birth Registration applications have been processed in 2021. </p>  <p>  In the context of the National Development Plan, the Government is making a major investment in the future of the Passport Service.  Over the next couple of years, the Department will replace the core technology underpinning the service, which will deliver efficiencies to the Foreign Birth Registration and passport services. Budget 2022 also included an investment of an additional &euro;10m for the Passport Service in response to the increasing demand for passports and Foreign Birth Registration.</p></reply>

Changes have also been made to the job sharing scheme to permit job sharing teachers carry out substitute work on the days they are rostered off, including in schools other than those in which they normally teach.</p>  <p>  A number of measures have been put in place to increase the supply of teachers of priority subjects at post primary level. Following engagement with the Higher Education Authority (HEA), HEIs have, since 2019, put in place new post primary initial teacher education undergraduate programmes in priority subject areas, including mathematics, modern foreign languages and Irish.  The HEA, on behalf of my Department, also issued a call to HEIs for proposals for programmes to upskill teachers in targeted post-primary subjects (Spanish, mathematics and physics).  Following this call, three upskilling programmes commenced in these subjects in January 2021.  As I announced earlier this year, my Department intends to approve increased places on these programmes for their second intake of teachers in January 2022.</p></reply>

Increasing this to &euro;7.60 will bring the  weekly means disregard for Disability Allowance in line with Blind Pension, One Parent Family and Carer&rsquo;s Allowance. The effect of this measure will be to increase the weekly rate of payment by up to &euro;5 per week for Disability Allowance recipients who have means.</p>  <p>  -The Wage Subsidy Scheme base subsidy paid to employers who employ people with a disability will increase from &euro;5.30 to &euro;6.30 per hour from January 2022. </p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The new model does not exclude existing service providers from tendering. Both I and my Department have consistently encouraged existing providers to work collaboratively together to submit joint tenders for the Regional Employment Services. I am confident that where existing providers work collaboratively their strong track record and previous experience will enable them to submit high quality bids for the provision of the new Regional Employment Services.</p></reply>

It is a requirement for recipients of the payment to engage with the Department's Intreo service.</p>  <p>  JST recipients may participate in a course of education.  Customers engaging in a course of education should contact their local Intreo Centre or Branch Office as they will advise if Back to Education Allowance is a better option for the person.  </p>  <p>  Where a person moves to Back to Education allowance it will be paid at the same rate as the JST payment.  It will continue to be paid, regardless of the age of the person's child as long as the person continues to meet the qualifying conditions for that scheme.</p>  <p>  The number of JST recipients whose youngest child turns 14 while they are in education is not known and the Department has not undertaken research into completion rates in these circumstances.  However, as it is possible for such a person to move to another payment in order to complete their course of study, regardless of the youngest child&rsquo;s age there should be no negative impact on course completions.</p>  <p>  Extending the Jobseeker's Transition Payment beyond the 14th birthday of the child would have the effect of delaying the interaction of affected customers with the Department&rsquo;s Intreo services.  The primary aim of the current system is to reduce long-term welfare dependency, and associated poverty, among lone parents, and to improve their access to education, training, and employment support services.  Improved access to these services will enhance their skills-set and job-readiness, thereby assisting with their transition into the workforce, and with their subsequent attainment of financial independence.  For these reasons, I have no proposals to change the position at this time.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Menus must include a vegetarian option and all food products provided must have a traceability system that complies with food safety requirements. All accommodation centres that offer catered options must provide three meals per day and must have a range of snacks and non-alcoholic beverages readily available.</p><p>IPAS is always available to deal with any complaints from residents and residents are encouraged to engage with IPAS if they are unhappy with any aspect of their accommodation.

To satisfy the terms and conditions of the student grant scheme in relation to progression, a student must be moving from year to year within a course, having successfully completed the previous year or be transferring from one course to another where the award for the subsequent course is of a higher level than the previous course. </p>  <p>  Generally speaking, a grant will not be paid to a student for a repeat period of study on the same course, or for a different course at the same level, irrespective of whether or not a grant was paid previously.  The objective of this policy is to help as many students as possible to obtain one qualification at each level of study. However, once a student progresses to a course at a higher level or completes the equivalent period of study on a new course, the student may be eligible for student grant assistance for the remainder of the course. Article 15(7) of the Student Grant Scheme 2021 refers.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, under Article 15(8) of the Student Grant Scheme 2021, the awarding authority SUSI has discretion to award a grant for a repeat period of study in exceptional circumstances, such as serious certified illness, which impacted on a student completing a particular period of study or undertaking exams in line with guidelines drawn up by the Minister.</p>  <p>  SUSI treats each application for repeat funding on a case by case basis and it is it is a matter for the individual student to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the awarding authority that there were exceptional circumstances.</p>  <p>  The Student Grant Scheme also contains a &ldquo;second chance&rdquo; provision whereby mature students who previously attended but did not successfully complete a course who are returning in order to pursue an approved course at PLC, undergraduate or postgraduate level in the relevant academic year following a break in studies of at least five years may be assessed for grant assistance. Article 13(6) of the Student Grant Scheme 2021 refers. </p>  <p>  Also the &euro;200 PLC Participant Contribution was abolished for all students under Budget 2022, effective from the 2022/23 academic year. </p></reply>

Student grant applications are means tested on gross income from all sources earned inside and outside the State within a specified reference period. In the case of both employed and self-employed applicants, gross income, before deduction of income tax or universal social charge, is assessed with certain specified social welfare and health service executive payments excluded.</p><p>The assessment of means under the Student Grant Scheme is based on gross income from all sources. Therefore, all income is assessed from the same starting point, eliminating any distortion which might arise from different spending decisions.</p><p>Article 23 of the Student Grant Scheme 2021 deals with the determination of reckonable income. In calculating reckonable income no account is taken of capital assets. Therefore no deduction is given for capital expenditure, regardless of how it is treated for income tax purposes.</p><p>Apart from the Student Grant Scheme, students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Information on the fund is available through the Access Officer in the third level institution attended. The fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis. </p><p>In addition, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education. Further information on this tax relief is available from a student's local Tax Office or from the Revenue Commissioners website, <i>www.revenue.ie</i>.</p></reply>

The HSE reports that emergency department attendances have now reached 2019 levels, exceeding them at some sites, and the numbers of patients waiting on trolleys for hospital admission have been increasing steadily over the past several months. This winter is expected to be particularly challenging with the continued need to manage Covid-19 in our hospitals while facing the high winter demand for ED services, particularly by older persons.</p>  <p>  The Winter Plan 2021/22 is in active development by the HSE and a revised plan has just been submitted on foot of a request by the Department of Health. The revised Plan will reflect the funding available and set out the measures to be implemented and the expected impacts. My Department is continuing to engage intensively with the HSE on the issue, and a finalised Winter Plan will be published in due course.</p>  <p>  As part of the Winter Plan 2021/22, the HSE are preparing for the volume of both unscheduled and scheduled activity to return to previous levels. In order to accommodate this demand the HSE will implement new ways of working, open additional capacity, and continue to enhance infection prevention and control measures in our healthcare facilities.</p>  <p>  In line with the Sl&aacute;intecare 'right care, right time, right place' approach, the Winter Plan will be targeted at optimising and creating capacity at three critical stages in the patient pathway: avoidance of hospital admittance unless absolutely essential, patient flow through our hospitals, and safe and timely egress of patients from hospital. As in previous years, Winter Plan initiatives will aim to reduce demand on emergency care by providing additional acute bed capacity, alternative care pathways in the primary care and community care sectors, and additional discharge supports in the community.</p>  <p>  The Government is continuing to invest in the development of primary and community services through the Enhanced Community Care programme. Some &euro;195m was allocated in Budget 2022 to build on the progress made this year and to ensure the continued rollout of 96 Community Healthcare Networks across the country as well as the establishment of specialist community teams for older persons and those with chronic conditions.  </p>  <p>  The development of these networks and teams, alongside other initiatives such as improved GP access to diagnostics, expanded Community Intervention Teams and the development of Primary Care Centres, will enhance capacity in community services and ease pressure on hospital EDs. </p></reply>

Scalp cooling is an example of one such supportive care measure. </p>  <p>  There are 26 public hospitals providing SACT in Ireland. A patient&rsquo;s consultant will consider each patient&rsquo;s supportive care requirements, taking into account the individual patient, their treatment, and the evidence relating to the supportive care measure. </p>  <p>  There is no clinical consensus on the use of scalp cooling as a supportive care measure for patients with cancer undergoing SACT.  It is made available in some of these hospitals, based on suitability of the patient, local availability of equipment, service needs and capacity. </p>  <p>  However, the availability of scalp cooling is currently curtailed on infection control advice, considering the public health measures in place in hospitals related to Covid-19. This is because scalp cooling is associated with additional time in the hospital environment, as well as social distancing and additional cleaning requirements.</p>  <p>  The NCCP advises that discussions are on-going in relation to setting up a scalp cooling service in the Mater Hospital.  However, any decision will have to take account of advice on public health and infection prevention and control measures in relation to Covid-19.</p></reply>

My Department is continuing to engage intensively with the HSE on the issue, and a finalised Winter Plan will be published in due course.</p>  <p>  As part of the Winter Plan 2021/22, the HSE are preparing for the volume of both unscheduled and scheduled activity to return to previous levels. In order to accommodate this demand the HSE will implement new ways of working, open additional capacity, and continue to enhance infection prevention and control measures in our healthcare facilities.</p>  <p>  In line with the Sl&aacute;intecare 'right care, right time, right place' approach, the Winter Plan will be targeted at optimising and creating capacity at three critical stages in the patient pathway: avoidance of hospital admittance unless absolutely essential, patient flow through our hospitals, and safe and timely egress of patients from hospital. As in previous years, Winter Plan initiatives will aim to reduce demand on emergency care by providing additional acute bed capacity, alternative care pathways outside the acute sector, and additional discharge supports in the community.</p>  <p>  The 2021/2022 Influenza Vaccination Programme, which is an important part of winter preparation, was launched on 4 October 2021. Vaccinations are available free of charge to adults in specified at-risk groups and children aged from 2 to 17 years of age.</p></reply>

This &euro;250 million will be used to fund additional activity in both the public and private sectors. I have already published an Acute Waiting List Action Plan which runs until December 2021 and has a series of targeted measures that are designed to address the growth in waiting lists.  In addition, my Department, the HSE and the NTPF are working on a Multi Annual Waiting List Plan to bring waiting lists in line with Sl&aacute;intecare targets over the coming years.  </p>  <p>  In relation to the Winter Plan specifically, the Plan will provide for appropriate, safe and timely care for patients by ensuring, insofar as possible, that effective levels of capacity and resources are in place to meet the expected growth in activity levels.  The Plan is in active development by the HSE and a revised Plan is expected to be submitted to my Department shortly. The revised Plan will reflect the funding available and set out the measures to be implemented and the expected impacts. The Department of Health is continuing to engage intensively with the HSE on the issue.  </p></reply>

This legislation encompasses the regulation for the first time of a wide range of practices undertaken in this jurisdiction, including domestic surrogacy.</p>  <p>  The surrogacy provisions of the Bill outline the specific conditions under which surrogacy in Ireland will be permitted, including a requirement for all surrogacy agreements to be altruistic and pre-authorised by the new AHR Regulatory Authority. The legislation sets out a court-based mechanism through which the parentage of a child born through surrogacy may be transferred from the surrogate to the intending parent(s).</p>  <p>  The draft Bill does not contain provisions to provide for retrospective declarations of parentage. Issues which arise from the assignment of retrospective parentage concern areas of law that intersect across the remits of several Government Departments and require detailed examination. My Department is engaging with the Department of Justice and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth in respect of these matters.</p>  <p>  Publication of the AHR Bill is a priority for my Department and the Government, and a commitment to enact this legislation is included in the Programme for Government, &ldquo;Our Shared Future&rdquo;. This Department will continue to engage intensively with the Office of the Attorney General in order to finalise this complex legislation.</p>  <p>  The AHR legislation aims to promote and ensure the health and safety of parents and others involved in the process (such as donors and surrogate mothers), while, most importantly, consideration of the welfare and best interests of children born as a result of AHR is a key principle underpinning all legislative measures in this area.</p></reply>

The NIAC makes recommendations on vaccination policy to my Department based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practices in relation to immunisation.</p>  <p>  More than 7.6 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine have now been administered since the programme began in December last year.  As the first phase of vaccination nears completion, the NIAC has been examining evidence regarding booster vaccines.</p>  <p>  The NIAC has recommended that a booster dose of an mRNA vaccine (irrespective of whether the primary vaccination course was of an mRNA or adenoviral vector) be offered to those aged 60 years and older and healthcare workers. The booster dose should be given after an interval of six months (or at least five months) following the last dose of any authorised COVID-19 vaccine. I have accepted this advice and the HSE has made the necessary arrangements to operationalise these recommendations with the booster rollout now underway.</p>  <p>  The NIAC has also recommended an additional mRNA dose should be given to those aged 12 years and older with immunocompromise associated with a suboptimal response to vaccination who have completed their primary vaccination course. The third dose of an mRNA vaccine should be given a minimum of two months after the last dose of the primary vaccination schedule.</p>  <p>  You can view the NIAC recommendations regarding those with immunocompromise associated with a suboptimal response at the below link: rcpi-live-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Recommendations-re-additional-COVID-19-vaccine-dose-for-those-with-Immunocompromise-FINAL-30082021.pdf.</p>  <p>  The NIAC continues to examine emerging evidence regarding booster vaccines for those with waning immunity and reduced effectiveness in other groups, such as those with co-morbidities (under 60 years of age) and will make further recommendations if required.</p></reply>

The Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without due hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself and his or her family, having regard to his or her overall financial position and reasonable expenditure.</p>  <p>  The issue of granting medical cards based on having a particular disease or illness was previously examined in 2014 by the HSE Expert Panel on Medical Need and Medical Card Eligibility. The Group concluded that it was not feasible, desirable, nor ethically justifiable to list medical conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility. In following the Expert Group&rsquo;s advice, a person&rsquo;s means remains the main qualifier for a medical card.</p>  <p>  However, every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines. The HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income threshold where they face difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness. Social and medical issues are also considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the HSE also has a system in place for the efficient provision of medical cards in response to emergency situations i.e. in circumstances where persons are in need of urgent ongoing medical care or are receiving end of life care.  In these cases, a medical card is issued within 24 hours of receipt of the required patient details and completed medical report by a healthcare professional.  Additionally, patients with a terminal illness and who have been certified by their treating Consultant as having  a prognosis of 24 months or less to live are also now eligible for a medical card without a means assessment.</p>  <p>  Finally, it should be noted that since 2015 medical cards are awarded without the need of a financial assessment to all children under 18 years of age with a diagnosis of cancer, for a period of five years.</p></reply>

To advance this, the Government is committed to establishing a new, statutory scheme for the financing and regulation of home-support services, which the Department of Health is currently developing.</p>  <p>  It is envisaged that the new scheme will provide equitable and transparent access to high-quality services for people aged 18 years and above based on their assessed care-needs. Work is on-going within the Department to progress the development of the new scheme within the broader context of the Sl&aacute;intecare reforms. This work encompasses the development of the regulatory framework for the new scheme; the examination of the options for the financing model for the scheme; and the development of a reformed model of service-delivery for home support services.</p>  <p>  With the aim of ensuring that all service-users are provided with a standard, high-quality level of care which is safe, effective, and person-centred, it is envisaged that the regulatory framework will comprise: (i) primary legislation for the licensing of public and private home-support providers; (ii) minimum requirements (i.e., regulations); and (iii) HIQA National Standards for Home Support Services. </p>  <p>  Earlier this year, Government gave approval to draft a General Scheme and Heads of a Bill to establish a licensing framework for home-support providers. This is being progressed by the Department with a view to bringing it through the Houses of the Oireachtas at the earliest opportunity. It is expected that the primary legislation will give the Minister for Health the power to make regulations in respect of minimum requirements which will form the criteria against which a provider&rsquo;s eligibility to hold a licence will be determined. The Department recently commenced a targeted stakeholder consultation on these draft minimum requirements. In addition, HIQA recently ran a public scoping consultation to inform the development of their National Standards for Home Support Services.  </p>  <p>  In relation to the development of a statutory scheme for the financing of home support, the Department is undertaking work on the potential demand for and cost of the introduction of a such a scheme.  </p>  <p>  In parallel to this, work is ongoing in relation to the development of a reformed model of service delivery for home support. Within this context, funding was provided in 2021 for the HSE to progress the roll-out of interRAI as the standard assessment tool for care-needs in the community; the pilot of a reformed model of service-delivery for home-support; and the establishment of a National Office for Home Support Services. </p>  <p>  The testing of the reformed model of service delivery for home support commenced this month in the first of the four pilot sites: CHO 8. It is envisaged that the three other sites, CHOs 2, 4 and 7 will be fully  operational by January 2022.  A National Home Support Office will be established before the end of the year and recruitment of the 130 posts funded for the national rollout of interRAI as the standard assessment tool for care-needs is scheduled to commence in this quarter. A comprehensive and robust operational model for the roll-out of the interRAI has been developed which will facilitate effective, efficient, fair and transparent care needs assessment and planning and appropriate service delivery. The interRAI outputs and pilot site evaluation will be critical to the development of the new home support scheme. </p>  <p>  The Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy and Action Plan 2021&ndash;2023 commits to the advancement of the development of the new home-support scheme in 2021 and to the commencement of its implementation in 2022.</p></reply>

Accordingly, consideration is being given, as I have said, to how best to ensure this commitment is addressed, taking account of existing arrangements already in place. While this remains ongoing, I can advise the Deputy that the HSE has previously advised that hospitals that currently charge car parking fees are very cognisant of the financial implications of parking costs and many hospitals have introduced maximum daily fixed parking charges and reduced rate parking for long-term patients and visitors for whom the payment of the full rate would cause hardship. </p></reply>

HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). </p>  <p>  The HSE Drugs Group is the national committee which the HSE has in place to make recommendations on the pricing and reimbursement of medicines. The role of the Drugs Group is to make a recommendation to the HSE Executive Management Team (EMT) in relation to each individual application having considered the criteria under the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013. </p>  <p>  The Drugs Group considers the NCPE assessment, the outputs from commercial engagements, patient interest group submissions, and any other pertinent information in advance of providing its recommendation to the HSE EMT.  </p>  <p>  As the decision-making authority within the HSE, the HSE EMT decides on the basis of all the demands with which it is faced (across all services) whether it can fund a new medicine, or new uses of an existing medicine, from the resources that have been provided to it in line with the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013. </p>  <p>  While the 2013 Health Act does not include provision for a different ruleset when assessing orphan medicines, the criteria that apply to the evaluation process allow the HSE to take account of evidence of the benefits associated with each given medicine. The budget allocation of &euro;30m funding for new medicines in Budget 2022 will provide for the reimbursement of both orphan and non-orphan medicines. </p>  <p>  The number of orphan drugs approved across the past 12 months is an operational issue. I have therefore referred this matter to the HSE for their attention and direct reply to the Deputy. </p></reply>

Each year, a National Inventory Report is prepared in compliance with United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) reporting guidelines, that outlines the level of emissions and the methods used to derive these estimates.</p>  <p>  Forest areas that are 0.1 ha in size or more are included in the inventory report, which includes small blocks of scrub that are comprised of tree species. The national forest estate is still expanding and has now reached 11% of the total land area, with a wide variety of forest types present. Ireland&rsquo;s forests are an important store of carbon, estimated stocks at over 312 million tonnes. In our recent greenhouse gas reporting to the UNFCCC, Ireland reported a removal by forests of circa 5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent from the atmosphere in 2019, which includes the carbon stored in harvested wood products. </p>  <p>  My Department recognises the significant role that our hedgerows provide to the natural landscape of our countryside. Not only do our hedgerows contribute to the sequestration of carbon from the atmosphere but they are also vital as a habitat for wildlife, a resource for biodiversity and a unique heritage feature that must be managed and protected. Hedgerows are not considered forest and they are not currently included as part of the land use sector for national greenhouse gas reporting purposes.</p>  <p>  To address the lack of data on sequestration of carbon by hedgerows, Teagasc are undertaking a research project called &ldquo;Farm-Carbon &ndash; Farm Hedgerows and Non-forest Woodland Carbon&rdquo;. The overall objective of this project is to &ldquo;advance the understanding of the contribution of hedgerows and non-forest woodland to carbon stocks in agricultural landscapes, and to identify approaches to maintain and enhance this contribution&rdquo;. I am confident that the final results will provide the necessary data required for the inclusion of hedgerows in the national inventory calculations.</p></reply>

This means that licences are issuing at nearly double the rate of applications received and every week means a net reduction in the number of licences on hand. I remain confident that we will reach our target of 4,000 licences this year.</p><p>As to additional measures to assist with improving our process, Project Woodland is the framework introduced earlier this year to help with the effectiveness and efficiency of the licensing system.</p><p>I am pleased to report that substantial work has been undertaken by all Working Groups and the Project Board of Project Woodland, with regular meetings held resulting in a high level of output in both terms of quality and quantity.  The Project Board, published its second interim report on the 29th October, which updates on progress to date and  is available at www.gov.ie/en/publication/642e6-forestry/#project-woodland</p><p>Of particular relevance to licensing is the external regulatory review. My Department has placed a contract for the regulatory review with report due by end February, 2022.  It will review the existing statutory framework for the licensing of forestry activities in relation to environmental and public participation obligations in order that practical advice can be provided to the Department on how to work more efficiently within the existing legal framework.  </p><p>In addition, an independent Systems Analyst is conducting an end-to-end process review with a view to licensing process improvement and an interim report on this work has recently been submitted to the Project Board.</p><p>There has been significant work carried out on all other aspects of Project Woodland too and some of these, along with the process and regulatory review, will inform the setting of definitive timelines for the delivery of forestry licences. These include:</p><p>- A pilot project for pre-application discussions.</p><p>- Payment of an Environmental Planning Grant.</p><p>- A new Customer Charter for forestry.</p><p>- A Communication Plan that assists in conveying the multi-functional benefits of forestry.</p><p>- A review of the organisational structure of forestry within my Department.</p><p>- Commission of a Training Needs analysis.</p><p>- Definition of the backlog and associated dashboards.</p><p>- Actions relating to reduction of the backlog.</p><p>Alongside Project Woodland, my Department continues to address the licensing issue, and we have invested significant resources to deal with the backlog, which I know is impacting the sector.  We now have 27 ecologists, and additional forestry inspectors and administrative staff have been put in place.  Furthermore, improved processes have been introduced to allow ecologists focus on the ecological aspects of files referred to them.  </p><p>In conclusion, I would like to recognise the momentum and progress made under Project Woodland and the increased momentum in terms of licences issued. I would also like to reiterate my commitment and that of Minister Hackett, who has overall responsibility for the sector, to ensuring that that we maintain and improve on our licence delivery for the benefit of the sector, as well as society as a whole.</p></reply>

This &euro;9m fund is being provided by the Government to support community and voluntary groups impacted by Covid-19.  This once-off funding will be allocated under the Department&rsquo;s Community Enhancement Programme and in order to ensure there is sufficient flexibility to allow funding to be targeted to where it is needed in each Local Authority area, it will be administered locally by the Local Community Development Committees (LCDCs).</p>  <p>  The Community Activities Fund will support groups, particularly in disadvantaged areas, with their running costs such as utility (Electricity, Heating charges) or insurance bills, as well as with improvements to their facilities. Groups will also be able to use the funding to carry out necessary repairs and to purchase equipment such as tables and chairs, tools and signage, laptops and printers, lawnmowers, canopies and training equipment.</p>  <p>  My Department currently supports over 420 community organisations under the Community Services Programme (CSP) to provide local services through a social enterprise model. In response to the difficulties faced by organisations due to COVID-19, my Department developed a &euro;7.95m CSP Support Fund which assists CSP supported organisations to continue to retain their CSP supported employees on their payroll and also provides assistance for the employers PRSI contribution, during this crisis period up to June 2021.  This additional funding also assisted those organisations most in need to meet their ongoing operational costs such as insurance, light and heat and audit fees.</p>  <p>  In 2020, my Department supported close to 600 organisations to continue to deliver vital services to the most vulnerable in our communities, through the &euro;45m COVID-19 Stability Fund for Community and Voluntary Organisations, Charities and Social Enterprises. A further allocation of &euro;10m was provided to the Stability Fund for 2021 as part of the revised Resilience and Recovery Plan announced on Tuesday 23rd February by the Taoiseach.</p>  <p>  The COVID-19 Stability Fund 2021 was launched in May, and was targeted at organisations which deliver critical services to vulnerable people within their community but which faced closure or a loss of service due to the impact of the pandemic. 244 organisations have been supported under the 2021 Stability Fund. The Stability Fund is now closed. All allocations are published on the Gov.ie website. There are no plans for any further rounds of the Stability Fund.</p>  <p>  In general, I would encourage all organisations to continue to engage with their Local Authority and Local Development Company, and to check on the Gov.ie website in order to be aware of funding opportunities as they become available.</p></reply>
