    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-09-29a.9.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1471" speakername="Catherine Martin" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022092900044#WRA00800"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5, 36 and 40 together.</p>  <p>  Regional development and the promotion of areas all over the country as great places to visit are at the heart of F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s remit.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland created the four regional brands of the Wild Atlantic Way, Ireland&rsquo;s Ancient East, Dublin and Ireland&rsquo;s Hidden Heartlands as a way to bring to life the richness and diversity of experiences available to visitors across the country.</p>  <p>  To guide medium to longer term development, I understand that F&aacute;ilte Ireland aims to deliver four new Regional Tourism Strategies in 2022 which will set out a 10-year vision and 5-year action plan for each region.</p>  <p>  At the more local level, these four Regional Tourism Strategies will be activated through a series of coordinated local Destination and Experience Development Plans (DEDPs), developed by F&aacute;ilte Ireland in collaboration with a wide range of stakeholders.   </p>  <p>  The domestic visitor is critical to tourism business, especially regional businesses, as domestic consumers will travel all year round and to a much wider breadth of destinations than the typical overseas visitor.   </p>  <p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s focus on promoting the regions has included significant investment into brand building through individual &lsquo;Keep Discovering&rsquo; campaigns for the each of the four regional experience brands, as well as media publicity, digital channels, and online sales platforms.  All four regional brands are being promoted across a mix of TV, press, radio, digital and social and there is a new press campaign also showcasing the regions.   </p>  <p>  In addition, through its &lsquo;Keep Discovering&rsquo; campaign, F&aacute;ilte Ireland promotes individual destinations from Donegal to Wexford and Cork to Louth.  Many of these destinations have been featured on their new Weather broadcast sponsorship, as well as in the national press.</p>  <p>  Looking forward to 2023, F&aacute;ilte Ireland will continue to focus on building the regional brand.  It will encourage domestic travellers to visit destinations across the country and, through online booking and sales and marketing supports, work with local industry to help them convert this interest into increased sales for their business. </p>  <p>  I understand that F&aacute;ilte Ireland's priorities for 2023 in terms of domestic marketing (and supporting the international marketing effort) include:</p>  <p>  - RT&Eacute; Weather Sponsorship</p>  <p>  - Year-round marketing campaign &lsquo;Keep Discovering&rsquo;</p>  <p>  - Media partnerships to showcase Ireland and drive domestic demand to take short breaks across Irish media</p>  <p>  - Further investment in marketing websites including the launch of new VisitDublin.com and ongoing optimisation of DiscoverIreland.ie website to drive domestic bookings</p>  <p>  - Strong domestic sales promotion campaigns across multiple distribution partners&rsquo; platforms, supporting regions and key festivals and events</p>  <p>  - Hosting International Media to showcase all that Ireland has to offer.</p>  <p>  With regard to the development of specific other tourism product offerings, such as the proposed Irish Sea Way or Wild Atlantic Walkway, these are operational matters for F&aacute;ilte Ireland in line with its tourism development functions. My Department's role in relation to tourism lies primarily in the area of national tourism policy and implementation of that policy is a matter for the tourism agencies, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland, as well as certain other bodies.  </p>  <p>  However, I understand that F&aacute;ilte Ireland has commenced work on the Irish Sea Way and the Wild Atlantic Way Coast Path projects.  After an initial review by F&aacute;ilte Ireland of trail development along the East Coast and in particular the geography from Carlingford to Cobh, the optimal proposition for the Irish Seaway initiative is to link current and planned Greenway and Cycle Trails to deliver a contiguous cycle route from Carlingford to Cobh.  The progression of this work, which will be developed in partnership with Transport Infrastructure Ireland, will be a key part of F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s operational plans for 2023. </p>  <p>  The development of the Wild Atlantic Way Coast Path remains a priority for F&aacute;ilte Ireland. In 2018, F&aacute;ilte Ireland conducted research into a variety of visitor attraction concepts and found that the highest performing experience was the Wild Atlantic Way coastal path.  The procurement process to tender for consultants for the Wild Atlantic Way Coast Path to develop a framework for delivery is due to commence in October 2022. The objective of this process is to have consultants on board by end of this year, with a 12 to 18 month timeframe for the delivery of such a framework.</p>  <p>  In relation to the specific regional brand, Ireland's Hidden Heartland, since the launch of the brand in 2018 F&aacute;ilte Ireland has been working in association with the Local Authorities, other State agencies, such as Tourism Ireland, and the wider tourism industry to raise awareness of the new Hidden Heartlands brand and to grow the visitor economy therein. Tourism Ireland promotes the Hidden Heartlands directly to overseas visitors, and the region now features prominently on the Ireland.com website.</p>  <p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland has been building partnerships with the local authorities, Waterways Ireland, Coillte, Bord na Mona and the Office of Public Works, in order to optimise the tourism potential of their natural and heritage assets in a sustainable manner. Recent highlights include the launch of the Shannon Tourism Masterplan, which has already seen &euro;2.3 million invested by F&aacute;ilte Ireland in new projects last year alone, and &euro;3.9 million invested in the revamped National Famine Museum at Strokestown Park.</p>  <p>  At F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s flagship tradeshow, Meitheal, in 2022, the number of tourism businesses who signed up from Ireland&rsquo;s Hidden Heartland&rsquo;s increased from 8 to almost 40 during the period from 2018 &ndash; 2022. This means that more and more tour operators are aware of the region and are including it on their tours.</p>  <p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland has established a Steering Group for the region comprising eleven relevant Local Authorities together with State Agencies and industry members, which advises on the future strategic direction for tourism in the region.</p>  <p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland also established three Destination Recovery Task Forces throughout the region in response to the crisis in tourism caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. These Task Forces ensured businesses in the region could be sustained and primed for continued growth as tourism recovers.</p>  <p>  Later this year, F&aacute;ilte Ireland will publish a Regional Tourism Strategy for Ireland&rsquo;s Hidden Heartlands 2023-2027.  While this will be a five-year strategy, it will set out an exciting 10-year vision for the sustainable development of tourism in the region. The strategy will focus on regenerative tourism and sustainability, ensuring that tourism works to create sustainable jobs in local communities and protects the environment.</p>  <p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland, in conjunction with all its partners, is working to transform what is a non-traditional tourism region into a destination with a unique identity and distinctive reasons to visit.</p></reply>

In pursuit of that objective, at the end of November 2021, I launched the Sports Action Plan, which specifically includes a series of actions and initiatives aimed at increasing participation levels across the board. </p>  <p>  The plan's emphasis is heavily orientated towards increasing inclusion, diversity and equality in sport, an emphasis that is reflected in the specific commitment to establish an Inclusion, Diversity and Equality Fund to promote increased and sustainable participation in sport among children, adolescents and young adults, those from lower socio-economic groups, persons with a disability, the LGBTI+ community, the Traveller community and other ethnic minorities. </p>  <p>  The total amount of funding allocated from Dormant Accounts for such disadvantage-related projects this year is &euro;12 million, more than twice the amount available a number of years ago. </p>  <p>  In relation to participation in sport by women and girls, in 2021 Sport Ireland launched the Girls Get Active Research Report. Following on from that report, Sport Ireland created a new funding strand to support Local Sports Partnerships (LSPs) in the creation of physical activity programmes targeting teenage girls.</p>  <p>  At present, Sport Ireland is working to establish a brand identity for teenage girls&rsquo; programmes rolled out by LSPs and NGBs. Sport Ireland is also tendering for the roll out of a communication and activation campaign targeting inactive teenage girls in Ireland. This will be the first time a dedicated national physical activity campaign has ever been created for this target group and highlights our commitment to motivate teenage girls to be more active.</p></reply>

This is most recently evidenced by the Government&rsquo;s decision to support an expression of interest by the Football Association of Ireland (FAI) in bidding, with the UK, for the right to host the UEFA Euro 2028 championships as well as the upcoming hosting of the following events:</p>  <p>  - US College Football matches every August from 2022 to 2026</p>  <p>  - The UEFA Europa League final in 2024, and</p>  <p>  - The Ryder Cup in 2027 in Limerick</p>  <p>  In line with the commitment in the Programme for Government, a Major International Sports Events Policy is currently being developed by my Department. The aim is to establish whether and how Government should support major international sports events, the benefits it should seek to derive from such events, the supports it could offer and the kind of events it would prioritise for support.   This will provide the basis for a Strategy to support and attract major international sports events and an assessment model based on the identified priorities.  Mechanisms and channels to support events will also need to be developed.</p>  <p>  While progress on the development of the policy was delayed by the pandemic, focused consultations have taken place this year with key stakeholders and a public consultation process closed on 26 May 2022. Following analysis of the consultation responses, further detailed follow-up and in-depth discussions with stakeholders will be required. Research, including consideration of the policies and strategies in place in other countries, has been undertaken and is continuing. </p>  <p>  My Department is now working towards the development of a high level policy green paper by December of this year; this will outline the likely key issues and courses of action for the new policy prior to the development of the finalised policy in the first half of 2023.</p></reply>

Under past rounds, including the latest 2020 round which saw a record-breaking allocation of &euro;166.6 million to almost 2,900 organisations, many clubs were successful in receiving allocations towards projects featuring sustainable improvements. </p>  <p>  My Department has undertaken a full review of all aspects of the 2020 round of the SCEP and any recommendations arising will be reflected in the terms and conditions of the next round.  Following the completion of the review, the Department will announce the exact timing of the next round but it is hoped to have it open for applications early in the new year. In advance of the closing date for applications under the new round, my Department will publicise the relevant terms and conditions and emphasise the various energy-efficiency promoting grants available to sporting clubs and facilities. Further details of these supports can be found currently on the website of the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland at www.seai.ie.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-09-29a.23.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1475" speakername="Jack Chambers" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022092900044#WRA02200"><p>The very real cost of living challenges that are impacting on households and businesses are also of major concern to sports organisations and sports facilities, including those located within hotels and other private venues. Increased energy costs are a particular concern as we enter winter and there is increased demand for indoor facilities, heat, light etc. This is particularly true in the case of the swimming sector.  Erratic price fluctuations by power suppliers also exacerbate an already difficult situation in terms of budget forecasting, setting rates etc.   </p>  <p>  Whilst my Department does not provide funding for the day to day operation of swimming pools or leisure centres, as this is a matter for the operators of the facilities themselves, significant assistance has been provided to sports bodies and to the tourism and hospitality sectors over the past two years to cope with the impacts of Covid. As part of Budget 2023, I am continuing to engage with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in terms of supports to alleviate the impact of increased energy costs for swimming pools, as part of an overall package of measures to support sports clubs with energy intensive activities. The framework for this assistance programme, which will also encompass arts/culture and voluntary sectors, will be put in place in the coming weeks and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has announced that a fund of &euro;60 million will be made available for this programme.</p>  <p>  I recognise the very positive impact that swimming has on the nation&rsquo;s physical health and mental wellbeing and continue to support my Department&rsquo;s direct role in relation to providing capital support for the development of swimming facilities.</p></reply>

Over 8,200 eligible applicants were included in the anonymised randomised selection to select the 2,000 BIA recipients and the control group of 1,000 participants.</p><p>The 2,000 recipients includes representatives from all art forms, age groups, ethnicities and counties.  This includes 707 visual artists, 584 musicians, composers and songwriters, 204 artists working in film including actors, screenwriters, directors and cinematographers, 184 writers and poets, 173 actors, writers and directors working in theatre, 32 dancers and choreographers, 13 circus artists and 10 architects.  3% or 54 of those selected work through the Irish language.</p><p>This is a research project and the main element of the research programme is a longitudinal study with the same survey being delivered every 6 months for 3 years.

Within this, the vision for Kildare is to augment and nurture a valued network of partners that collaborate to achieve shared outcomes for culture and creativity in County Kildare. </p>  <p>  I understand that Co Kildare has strong traditions in choral, orchestral and traditional music, amateur drama, youth theatre and musical societies, with a large cohort of professional artists, arts collectives and creatives residing in, working in and enriching the county. Local history and Irish language initiatives are set against the natural and archaeological heritage. </p>  <p>  Programmes and events such as Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g, Culture Night, Kildare Readers Festival, the Library Service annual programme and Play Day punctuate the cultural calendar, alongside a vibrant year-round festival programme. Initiatives such as the &lsquo;Kildare Short Grass Films&rsquo; commission support creatives and highlight the county&rsquo;s offerings.</p></reply>

Prior to Covid, the sector had registered consistent increases in the numbers employed in Ireland&rsquo;s regions and was an important driver of greater regional balance and dispersed economic activity. A sustained, and sustainable, rebuild is essential as tourism supports communities and drives regional development in a manner unlike other sectors.   </p>  <p>  However, the sector faces a range of challenges, in common with the wider economy, such as sizable increases in the costs of key inputs and, as the Deputy has raised, difficulty in recruiting and retaining key skills. These challenges are not unique to Ireland; indeed, they are shared by many countries around the world.   </p>  <p>  I have worked with colleagues across Government to secure funding supports to keep the tourism sector alive during Covid-19 and then to support this initial rebuild phase in 2022 and beyond.   </p>  <p>  The Hospitality and Tourism Forum, which was established during the pandemic and is co-chaired by the T&aacute;naiste and myself, provides a valuable opportunity for the sectors to communicate their priorities. The Forum met as recently as 12 September to discuss key priorities in the context of Budget 2023.   </p>  <p>  My Department also participates on the Tourism and Hospitality Careers Oversight Group which brings together industry representatives, state agencies, Government Departments and the education sector. The Group has pivoted to focus on supporting the industry to address some of its immediate recruitment challenges this year. My Department and F&aacute;ilte Ireland are also working with industry and across Government Departments to ensure a co-ordinated approach to addressing the labour and skills shortages in the sector across all roles.   </p>  <p>  Earlier in the year delays in the processing of work permits for chefs was a particular challenge for the sector. My Department and F&aacute;ilte Ireland worked closely with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (DETE) to seek to have those employment permit applications for chef positions that were already in the system processed as quickly as possible given the pressure that existed to recruit staff for the season. All flexible resources were redeployed by DETE to address processing times for General Employment permit applications in this context and this has resulted in 1,345 permit applications for chefs being processed since May with processing times reduced significantly to 5 weeks. My Department and F&aacute;ilte Ireland are currently working with DETE to increase work permit application success rates via training.   </p>  <p>  My Department also continues to engage with the Department of Further Education, Research, Innovation and Science regarding the Tourism Recovery Taskforce&rsquo;s recommendations which were to:</p>  <p>  (a) Strengthen F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s Careers Oversight Group and formalise a relationship with the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science to ensure programme development and coordination of tourism education and training; </p>  <p>  (b) Develop a National Tourism Education Gateway as a one-stop education access shop for all tourism employees; and, </p>  <p>  (c) ensure consistency in terms of quality and content of education and training provided by education providers in the tourism sector in consultation with industry to meet adapting needs and trends.</p>  <p>  With regard to working conditions in the sector, F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s research indicates that 70% of people within the sector see tourism as a long-term career option. While this is a good proportion, to improve on this, F&aacute;ilte Ireland has developed a range of programmes to build skills and capability for businesses and individual employees including a suite of online self-directed professional development courses.   </p>  <p>  Latest F&aacute;ilte Ireland research shows that while recruitment is still a significant challenge for businesses, the situation is improving and employers are making positive strides. Around 70% of businesses that are recruiting are increasing their pay and offering flexible work patterns, more stable work schedules and other perks. However, it is clear from an employee&rsquo;s perspective that more still needs to be done to make working in the industry as appealing as possible.   </p>  <p>  As part of the drive to promote tourism as an attractive sector within which to work, F&aacute;ilte Ireland has launched a new &ldquo;Employer Excellence&rdquo; programme to help all participating businesses to improve their employer practices, and enhance their reputation as excellent employers. This will help employers to drive great employee engagement, build the appeal of their workplace and unlock greater levels of performance across their business. This new programme should lead to greater retention of staff and improve the view of the industry as career of choice.   </p>  <p>  A Transition Year Work Placement Programme to give TY students a high-quality work placement to motivate them to consider a course or career in the industry has also been launched, along with a major recruitment awareness campaign called &ldquo;Works For Me&rdquo; to encourage more people of all ages to consider a career in the industry.   </p>  <p>  When we look at the wider economy and the particular set of challenges facing the tourism industry it is clear that a collective and concerted multi-stakeholder approach to tackling these challenges is required and that is the approach that I and my Department will continue to pursue.</p></reply>

This allocation will allow the Arts Council to continue to protect jobs and livelihoods of artists, and assist arts organisations through the cost of living crisis.  With such assistance and the support of the public, the core infrastructure of the arts in Ireland has survived. This ongoing public funding in 2023 allows the Arts Council to continue its support for artists and arts organisations.</p>  <p>  In relation to the current cost of living challenges, additional funding is also being provided in 2022 for the impact of increased energy bills on the not-for-profit and voluntary organisations, which includes &euro;15m for the arts and culture sector.   </p>  <p>  In parallel with these direct supports, businesses which are impacted by rising energy costs will also be able to avail of the Government&rsquo;s newly announced Temporary Business Energy Support scheme, with grants of up to &euro;10,000 a month. </p>  <p>  Budget 2023  and the cost of living package  delivers a range of  supports to the tourism, culture, arts Gaeltacht, sport and media sectors, right across Ireland. These measures announced under the Budget last Tuesday resulted from ongoing dialogue and engagement between the officials in my department and the sectors and communities which come under our remit. </p>  <p>  Budget 2023 is unprecedented compared to recent years and one of increasing uncertainty in the face of rising energy costs, inflation and economic uncertainty. Supporting the householders and work organisations through fiscal measures in an effective way, while simultaneously ensuring the sustainability of public finances, is a key priority of the Government.</p>  <p>  Together, we have provided supports to help these important sectors survive through the rapidly increasing energy and operating costs that they are facing.  In the case of the Arts Council funding this Budget will no doubt assist the Council to address significant cost of living increases for artists, arts workers and arts organisations</p>  <p>  For the arts, creative and culture sectors, the Department and its agencies are working on a broad range of initiatives ranging from income and grant supports, to individual artists, to energy efficiency and structural enhancements for our arts and culture infrastructure.  Some examples of these initiatives include:</p>  <p>  - The Basic Income for Artists Scheme &ndash; a scheme to support 2,000 artists by providing a guaranteed basic income to support their continued practice; </p>  <p>  - The Green Arts Initiative &ndash; a project supported by the Arts Council to reduce the carbon footprint and enhance the sustainability of arts centres and venues; and;</p>  <p>  - Capital grant funding schemes for retrofitting and other enhancements to the arts and culture infrastructure.</p>  <p>  I understand that the Council&rsquo;s ambition for 2023  is to develop the arts sector in particular to support a Recovery from Covid  and to help organisations re-build audiences and arrest their losses due to falling income from box office and increased production costs.   </p></reply>

Eligibility for income support payments other than the BIA, such as social welfare supports including payment to people with disabilities, is a matter for the Minister for Social Protection and I do not have any function in that regard.</p></reply>

This work encompasses not only the collection, preservation and display of heritage objects and artworks, but also educational activities that facilitate the public&rsquo;s understanding of items in the collections and the broader context in which they were produced.</p>  <p>  Conscious that it is not possible for the NCIs to display their full collection at any one time, I welcome and support initiatives that provide greater regional and local access to material held in the national collections.  Of course, in facilitating wider access to cultural artefacts, I acknowledge the importance of safeguarding these precious objects by ensuring that they are displayed in sites that are sufficiently secure and have appropriate environmental controls.</p>  <p>  Within these parameters, I am particularly keen to facilitate the display of cultural artefacts with specific local and regional interest in appropriate publicly-accessible settings, outside the main urban centres, where they can be more easily seen and enjoyed by the local community.  Accordingly, my Department operates a Mobility of Collections Scheme, which is designed to fund transport, insurance and exhibition-related costs associated with moving pieces from the national collections for display in appropriate institutions around the country.</p>  <p>  Separately, I know that the NCIs are equally committed to increasing broader access to the national collections through bilateral arrangements with local exhibitions and also through various innovative online programmes, which became particularly important during the recent COVID pandemic and related restrictions.  In this regard, although the NCIs under the aegis of my Department are operationally independent, the lending and dissemination of items from the national collection under their care is actively encouraged.</p>  <p>  I welcome the commitment of the NCIs to increase access to the national collections through enhanced online exhibitions and the lending of artefacts for regional and local exhibitions.  For its part, my Department will continue to encourage and provide support for the mobility of national collections.</p></reply>

That includes women in leadership position such as board members of National Governing Bodies (NGBs).  I want to acknowledge the significant efforts that sporting bodies are now making around gender diversity on their boards. It is evident, however, that more work needs to be done.</p>  <p>  The Sports Action Plan sets a target for all NGBs to achieve 40% gender representation on their boards by the end of 2023. It is a particular priority for me to enable women to take more leadership positions in sport and the 40% target reflects this prioritisation. The most recent Board Composition Snapshot, which was published by Sport Ireland in December 2021, shows that the overall percentage of women on boards of NGBs has increased from 24% in 2019 to 32% in 2021. The Snapshot also highlights that 39 NGBs have now achieved representation of 30% or more women on their board, up from 19 NGBs in 2019. </p>  <p>  Sport Ireland will continue to provide support to NGBs towards achieving the target of 40% and will monitor and report on progress.</p>  <p>  Sport Ireland recently outlined their funding priorities for NGBs for 2023 onwards. From next year, Sport Ireland&rsquo;s grant funding to sporting organisations will be more closely aligned with the Government&rsquo;s key policies for sport with four funding priorities being prioritised within Sport Ireland&rsquo;s grant funding criteria. One of the priority funding areas for 2023 is the achievement of 40% gender balance on Boards of NGBs. This will ensure that the State&rsquo;s investment in sport is delivering on this key policy objective. Failure by sporting organisations to achieve 40% gender balance on their boards will impact on future funding.</p></reply>

However, given the importance of An Coimisi&uacute;n, the Government has approved its establishment on an administrative basis prior to the enactment and commencement of the Bill. An extensive programme of work is being undertaken by the BAI and the Department to ensure the continuity of existing regulatory functions, the recruitment of key staff for An Coimisi&uacute;n and an effective transition of corporate functions from the BAI to Coimisi&uacute;n na Me&aacute;n.</p>  <p>  An Coimisi&uacute;n will be led initially by four Commissioners: an Executive Chairperson; a Broadcasting Commissioner; an Online Safety Commissioner; and a Media Development Commissioner. The posts of Executive Chairperson, Online Safety Commissioner and Media Development Commissioner were advertised by the Public Appointments Service (PAS) on 15 July, 22 July, and 29 July respectively. In addition to advertising the posts, and in light of the international reach of An Coimisi&uacute;n's remit, an Executive Search procured by the Public Appointments Service was also undertaken to ensure that an experienced panel of candidates with the necessary expertise to fulfil these posts could be brought forward for interview.</p>  <p>  Following the completion of the shortlisting and interview process for the posts, the most appropriate candidate for each role will be recommended for appointment. In accordance with section 11(7) of the Broadcasting Act 2009 (as substituted by the OSMR Bill 2022), the current chief executive officer of the BAI will be appointed as Broadcasting Commissioner for a period of up to one year following the formal establishment of An Coimisi&uacute;n. </p>  <p>  In Budget 2023, I secured &euro;7.5 million to resource Coimisi&uacute;n na Me&aacute;n in its first year of operation. These funds will be used to recruit staff and for other administrative costs arising from the new duties and functions being assigned to An Coimisi&uacute;n through the OSMR Bill in relation to online safety and video-on-demand. I expect that one of the priorities of An Coimisi&uacute;n will be to prepare and impose a levy on those newly regulated services to ensure that it becomes a self-financing regulatory body as soon as is feasible. </p></reply>

A total of 52 pools has been completed under the LASPP and three swimming pool projects (Lucan, Buncrana and Edenderry) remain in the programme with the Lucan project currently under construction. </p><p>My Department's capital support for any new swimming pools is now being provided through the Large Scale Sport Infrastructure Fund (LSSIF). The National Development Plan provided a capital allocation of at least &euro;100 million for the Fund over the period to 2027. </p><p>The first call for proposals under the LSSIF closed in 2019 with applications confined to local authorities and National Governing Bodies (NGBs) of Sport. All applications were assessed in accordance with the published Evaluation Procedures and Guidelines and the first allocations were announced in January 2020. Thus far, approximately &euro;86.4 million has been awarded to 33 different proposals. These initial allocations include funding for 8 swimming pool projects as follows:</p><p>1.

As part of this review, my Department is also considering the timing of any new call for proposals. The review work is at an advanced stage and is expected to be finalised shortly.</p><p>Furthermore, the National Sports Policy commits to the development of a National Swimming Strategy. As part of this, there will be a review of swimming pool provision to identify where gaps exist and how these can be met. A working group has been established and is meeting on a regular basis with a view to drafting the new Strategy.  </p><p>The outcome of the LSSIF Review and the National Swimming Strategy will be important considerations when deciding how funding will be provided for any new swimming pool proposals.</p></reply>

(not elsewhere classified)</p><p>While Class 8 as a whole is too broad to give any useful comparisons, the second and third sub-classes  - 08.2 Cultural Services and 08.3 Broadcasting and publishing services -  are of interest when comparing expenditure on the arts. New COFOG figures are published once a year in Spring for the penultimate complete calendar year.  Eurostat published figures for 2020 on 22 February 2022.  In each Sub-class, three sets of data are provided for each Member state and the EU average; amount of public expenditure, its percentage of total public expenditure and its percentage of GDP.  The table below give the 2020 figures for Ireland along with the EU average. <table>    <tr>       <th>08 Recreation Culture &amp;amp; Religion</th>       <th>Expenditure</th>       <th>% of GDP</th>       <th>% of GDP</th>       <th>% of total</th>       <th>expenditure</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Subclass 2020</td>       <td>Ireland</td>       <td>Ireland</td>       <td>EU</td>       <td>Ireland</td>       <td>EU</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>08.2 Cultural Services</td>       <td>&euro;793m</td>       <td>0.2</td>       <td>0.5</td>       <td>0.8</td>       <td>1.0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>08.3 Broadcasting &amp;amp; Publishing Services</td>       <td>&euro;683m</td>       <td>0.2</td>       <td>0.2</td>       <td>0.7</td>       <td>0.4</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>In 2020, Ireland's expenditure on cultural services totalled 0.8% of total public expenditure compared with the EU average of 1%, while expenditure on broadcasting and publishing services at 0.7% exceeded the EU average of 0.4%.  International comparisons based on GDP are complex in the case of the Irish economy.</p><p>The following table is of expenditure on a per capita basis based on Eurostat data (General Government expenditure by function (CoFoG) (online data code: GOV_10A_EXP). <table>    <tr>       <th>Country</th>       <th>General Government Expenditure on Cultural Services 2020 (&euro; Million)</th>       <th>Population 2020</th>       <th>General Government Expenditure on Cultural Service per capita spending 2020 (&euro;)</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Spain</td>       <td>5,549.0</td>       <td>47,332,614</td>       <td>117</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>European Union   - 27 countries</td>       <td>69,404.5</td>       <td>447,485,231</td>       <td>155</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Ireland</td>       <td>793.5</td>       <td>4,964,440</td>       <td>160</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>France</td>       <td>16,642.0</td>       <td>67,485,231</td>       <td>247</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Denmark</td>       <td>1,933.3</td>       <td>5,822,763</td>       <td>332</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Per capita General Government Expenditure on cultural services in Ireland in 2020 therefore was higher than the EU average.  In this context, it should be noted that expenditure on Arts and Culture by my Department in 2023 will over 82% higher than it was in 2020 due to a range of measures including the significant increase in funding for the Arts Council to its current record level of &euro;130m, the introduction of the Basic Income for the Arts pilot scheme, and higher levels of investment in Screen Ireland and cultural infrastructure. </p></reply>

The Programme for Government includes a commitment to develop a new tourism initiative to aid recovery in the sector. This new initiative will seek to promote and build on the warmth of our welcome, the beauty of our landscape and the richness of our culture. </p>  <p>  Similarly, the Tourism Recovery Plan 2020-2023 includes a recommendation to develop a Global Invitation programme to stimulate international demand. There is no doubt that a project of this nature will provide a much needed boost in overseas visitors and strong reconnections with diaspora groups.</p>  <p>  To that end, my officials, in consultation with the tourism agencies, began this year the conceptual development process and consideration is also being given as to the most opportune timeframe for delivery to ensure that this initiative will help to galvanise the tourism response overseas and boost resilience in the sector.</p>  <p>  &euro;5 million in additional funding was secured in Budget 2022 to begin preparations for this project. This funding has been utilised by the tourism agencies for a range of preparatory work including concept development, consumer/trade/industry research, creative development, content capture and enhanced programme development.</p>  <p>  A further &euro;5 million has been secured in Budget 2023 to continue the development of this initiative and to bring it to life in as effective a manner as a possible. I hope to bring proposals to Government in the coming weeks outlining my ambition for this project and providing further detail on the work underway. I firmly believe that this project will provide an excellent opportunity to aid the recovery in multiple sectors that have been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 crisis.</p></reply>

We are doing this through a programme of specific actions under the Climate Action Plan that will promote sustainable practices across all of our sectors. </p>  <p>  Under the Climate Action Plan, Sport Ireland is supporting Leave No Trace, which is an Outdoor Ethics Education Programme designed to promote and inspire responsible outdoor recreation through education, research and partnerships which will help to improve our outdoor recreation facilities and provide new opportunities for people to connect with nature. This action will be enhanced in 2023, when Sport Ireland will launch its interactive map of outdoor sports facilities. </p>  <p>  Sport Ireland is currently undertaking a research project to map the National Sports Policy 2018-2027 to the United Nations Agenda 2030 Sustainable Development Goals, in order to capture and highlight the contribution of the National Sports Policy towards the Sustainable Development Goals. Sport Ireland expects to complete this project later in 2022.  </p>  <p>  Sport Ireland has also developed a comprehensive sustainability strategy for the National Sports Campus which will enable the campus to become an exemplar for sustainability. </p>  <p>  The Department is currently developing a new Major Sports Events Policy, which was recently the subject of a public consultation process.  The policy is still in development and it is envisaged that improving the sustainability of major sports events and exploring the use of high profile events as platforms to promote key Government priorities including sustainability, will be considered as part of that policy development process. </p>  <p>  Capital funding for energy efficiency measures is provided as part of the Department&rsquo;s Sports Capital and Equipment Programme (SCEP) and Large Scale Sports Infrastructure Fund (LSSIF). A review of the SCEP is underway and consideration is being given to expanding those sustainability supports under future rounds of the Programme. </p>  <p>At grassroots level, individual sports clubs and organisations can play a critical role in embedding positive climate actions within their communities. The GAA&rsquo;s Green Clubs Programme, for instance, has been recognised as a Sustainable Development Goals Champions Programme.  </p></reply>

Under past rounds, including the latest 2020 round, many clubs were successful in receiving allocations towards sustainable improvements such as conversion to LED lights. Under the latest round, &euro;150 million was awarded to capital projects, many of which entailed the development of floodlighting. At least &euro;11 million has been allocated to projects which sought to, inter alia, install or improve floodlighting under the 2020 round alone.</p>  <p>  Energy-efficiency promoting grants are also available to sporting clubs and facilities via the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI).

Last year, Sport Ireland announced an investment of &euro;4 million in the Women in Sport Programme for the 2021 - 2022 period.  45 National Governing Bodies (NGBs) are receiving funding under this investment.  A further &euro;265,000 was invested last year in the Local Sports Partnerships under the Programme. </p>  <p>  Sport Ireland continues to promote women&rsquo;s participation in sport. For example, recognising the importance that campaigns can play in encouraging and supporting women and girls to be active, the first ever HER Outdoors Week was held in August 2021. Due to the success of the campaign, Sport Ireland ran the event again this August.  Over 350 events took place nationwide with over 7000 females participating across the 7 days. HER Outdoors week aims to celebrate and encourage more females to get out and enjoy the benefits of being in the outdoors while bringing visibility to the opportunities for females to get involved in outdoor physical activity. The campaign targets all females including females with a disability, females from diverse ethnic groups, older females, teenage girls, and females from disadvantaged areas, etc.</p>  <p>  The Sports Action Plan sets a target for all NGBs to achieve 40% gender representation on their boards by the end of 2023. It is a particular priority for me to enable women to take more leadership positions in sport and the 40% target reflects this prioritisation. The most recent Board Composition Snapshot, which was published by Sport Ireland in December 2021, shows that the overall percentage of women on boards of NGBs has increased from 24% in 2019 to 32% in 2021. The Snapshot also highlights that 39 NGBs have now achieved representation of 30% or more women on their board, up from 19 NGBs in 2019.</p>  <p>  Sport Ireland recently outlined their funding priorities for NGBs for 2023 onwards. From next year, Sport Ireland&rsquo;s grant funding to sporting organisations will be more closely aligned to the Government&rsquo;s key policies for sport with four specific funding priorities being included as an important element of Sport Ireland&rsquo;s grant funding criteria. One of these priority funding areas for 2023 is the achievement of 40% gender balance on Boards of NGBs. This will ensure that the State&rsquo;s investment in sport is delivering on this key policy objective. Failure by sporting organisations to achieve 40% gender balance on their boards will impact on future funding.</p></reply>

The project roadmap for this is now completed and it includes a delivery action plan. Timelines for the project are currently under consideration but it is hoped it will be initiated in 2023 and completed by 2025.

This has involved the identification, prioritisation, and development of a range of strategic complementary projects within each identified cluster using time as the conduit that roots the visitor in the destination creating a consistent sense of place.</p>  <p>  Loughcrew Cairns and Slieve na Calliagh collectively comprise the highest point in County Meath. This, along with the importance of the cairns, offers visitors an important connection to the landscape and the 5000-years of history. Protecting the monuments and managing visitors&rsquo; experience of this elevated landscape is key to any development of this cluster.</p>  <p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland aims to capitalise on the potential of existing sites like Slieve na Calliagh. In this context, specific to Loughcrew Cairns and Slieve na Calliagh, DEDP project 2, in partnership with the Office of Public Works (OPW), will:</p>  <p>  - Undertake an examination of existing site review documents to establish areas of prioritisation in addressing visitor management requirements for the site and future inclusion in strategic projects between OPW and F&aacute;ilte Ireland.</p>  <p>  - Provide experience development support for the identification of a range of management options for the site, accounting for the current archaeological management requirements of the site.</p></reply>

Increasing participation amongst these groups is a core objective of the National Sports Policy 2018-2027, and will be an essential action if we are to achieve the target of 60% of the population participating in sport and physical activity.  </p>  <p>  At the end of November 2021, I launched a new Sports Action Plan covering the period up to the end of 2023; this includes a series of actions and initiatives aimed at increasing participation levels across the board including an Innovation Fund to promote innovative collaborative projects aimed at increasing sustainable participation in sport, an Inclusion, Diversity and Equality Fund, and a youth-centred stakeholder forum to guide the adoption of the strategic framework recommended in the Children&rsquo;s Sport Participation and Physical Activity Study 2018.  </p>  <p>  In May 2022, my Department held a Youth Stakeholder Forum on sport where we gathered young people together at the Sport Ireland Campus in order to identify the barriers that are keeping young people from sport, and to gain some insight into how those barriers could be addressed. A report on that forum has been drafted and will help inform and direct the measures my Department takes to address youth participation in sport.</p>  <p>  In May 2021, Sport Ireland published its Participation Plan 2021-2024 - Increasing Participation in Changing Ireland. The Participation Plan outlines how Sport Ireland will continue to help people to get active by removing barriers to participation in sport and physical activity in the coming years. Sport Ireland is undertaking several initiatives for children and young people under its Participation Plan.  The Sport Ireland Participation Plan actions will be delivered through Local Sports Partnerships, National Governing Bodies, strategic partners, clubs, communities and individuals.</p>  <p>  The Sport Ireland Participation Plan is built on, and guided by, the National Sports Policy 2018-2027 (NSP) and the Sport Ireland Strategy 2018-2022. The Participation Plan takes into consideration Healthy Ireland &ndash; A Framework for Improved Health and Wellbeing 2013&ndash;2025 and the National Physical Activity Plan as well as global and national developments.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, a current funding allocation of &euro;89.4 million has been announced for Sport Ireland in Budget 2023.

They will introduce minimum standards that will apply across all solid fuels, to ensure that the most polluting can no longer be made available on the Irish market and to assist the public in transitioning to less polluting alternatives. There are no financial supports planned for any sector distributing solid fuels which are subject to the standards and provisions provided for in the new regulations.Enhanced measures are required to improve air quality and protect public health. It is estimated that each year, some 1,300 people die prematurely in Ireland due to air pollution from solid fuel burning and that there are over 16,200 life years lost. In addition, many people also experience a poor quality of life due to the associated short-term and long-term health impacts of this form of pollution. The regulations are a critical element of addressing this public health and environmental challenge and will serve to improve the quality of the air that we breathe, and the health of the public that we serve.</p><p>  People with turbary rights and all other customary practices in respect of turf will be unaffected by the regulations. They will continue to be able to cut turf for their own use and will retain the ability to gift or sell turf provided this is not done by way of the internet or other media, or from a retail premises (including shops, garages and filling stations, fuel yards, and public houses and other public places). All other channels will remain open to them.</p></reply>

It coordinates work connected to energy security across the electricity, gas and oil sectors and sets out a &lsquo;whole-of-Government&rsquo; response to the challenges posed to energy security and energy affordability. The Framework takes into account the need to decarbonise our society and economy as set out in recent reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and Ireland&rsquo;s targets to reduce emissions by 51% over the decade to 2030 and reach net zero emissions by 2050 as set out in the Climate Action Plan 2021.</p>  <p>  Under Response 17 of the NESF, the Government committed to building on the detailed sectoral analysis of the National Heat Study to develop proposals for regulatory options to accelerate the phase-out of fossil fuels for space and water heating in all new buildings, with limited exemptions such as industrial processes.  This reflects the ambitions already set out Action 183 of the Climate Action Plan 2021.</p>  <p>  The National Heat Study, published by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) in February 2022, is a comprehensive analysis of the options for reaching net zero emissions from the heating sector by 2050 and contains the detailed analysis that will inform the development of options, policies and measures to decarbonise the heating and cooling sectors to 2050. All options are currently under consideration, including the requirement to ensure a just transition to any alternative heat sources. As a consequence, there has been no commitment made thus far by Government to phase out oil and gas boilers in existing homes by 2025.</p></reply>

VRT on Category A vehicles (generally passenger cars and certain Special Utility Vehicles) is assessed based on the value of the vehicle and its emissions levels for carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) and nitrogen oxides (NOx).  The VRT on Category B vehicles (generally light commercial vehicles and motor caravans) is assessed at 13.3% of the value of the vehicle. In all cases, a vehicle&rsquo;s value is determined in accordance with particular provisions in the law. The ownership of the vehicle does not affect the VRT calculation, and the tax law does not restrict company owners from purchasing vehicles.</p><p>The appropriate category for a particular vehicle is decided at the time of its registration based on the vehicle&rsquo;s technical categorisation under EU type approval law, taking account of the documentation presented at the time of registration including its EU Classification.</p><p>A category B vehicle is defined in the Finance Act based, in large part, on EU type approval classification N1. It is defined as meaning:</p><p>&quot;- a category N1 vehicle that has three seats or less,</p><p>- a category N1 vehicle to which a BE bodywork code has been assigned, or</p><p>- a motor caravan&rdquo;</p><p>As the Deputy&rsquo;s query relates to a new five-seater vehicle, the vehicle concerned is unlikely to fulfil the criteria of a Category B vehicle and so, under the legislation would be a category A vehicle.</p><p>If the taxpayer concerned wishes to contact Revenue regarding the specific vehicle, they can contact the National VRT Service on the Revenue website via My Enquiries.</p><p>Finally, the Deputy&rsquo;s query also involves Motor Tax. Policy relating to Motor Tax is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Transport.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-09-29a.233.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022092900047#WRE01300"><p>All vehicles in the State must be registered here, and Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT) is generally payable when a vehicle is being registered.  For passenger cars, the amount of VRT is based on the vehicle&rsquo;s value and its CO<sub>2</sub>and NOx<sub></sub>emissions.  The VRT calculation is not affected by whether the vehicle has been imported, or by the place of origin of the vehicle. </p><p>Since the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union, an import of a vehicle from Great Britain is treated as an import from a third country, i.e. a non-EU country.  If a vehicle is imported from Great Britain into Ireland, the importer is required to complete a customs declaration and pay customs duty, if applicable, and VAT at 23%, prior to presenting the vehicle for registration. </p><p>Under EU customs law, VAT at import is chargeable on the customs value of the goods. The Customs value consists of the purchase price, plus the cost of transport and insurance, any handling charges and the Customs duty amount payable on the vehicle. Where it can be proved that a vehicle was owned and operated from Northern Ireland prior to Brexit, or has been imported inclusive of a VAT payment in Northern Ireland after that date, VAT is not due unless the vehicle is determined to be a New Means of Transport.</p><p>Customs is an EU competence and applies in all Member States, and it is not possible for me, as Minister for Finance, to implement any measures or suspend any measures that are not in compliance with EU Customs legislation. The EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA), eliminated tariff duties for trade between the EU and Great Britain where the relevant rules of origin are met. If the vehicles are of UK origin, then a 0% tariff rate applies. Tariffs of 10% will apply to vehicles which are not of UK origin. However, in certain instances Returned Goods Relief may apply. This relief applies where the vehicles were originally exported from the EU, have not been altered and are re-imported within three years of export from the EU. In very specific circumstances, relief from Value-Added Tax (VAT) may also apply where the goods are re-imported into the EU by the same economic entity that originally exported the goods out of the EU. Further information on Return Goods Relief is available on the Revenue website at www.revenue.ie/en/customs-traders-and-agents/relief-from-customs-duty-and-vat/goods-reimported-into-the-european-union/index.aspx</p><p>Where Returned Goods Relief does not apply, the following vehicles imported from GB will have tariffs applied as they will not qualify as UK origin under the rules of origin set out in the TCA: </p><p>- vehicles of EU origin used in the UK</p><p>- vehicles of other third country origin used in the UK. This applies even if the EU has a Free Trade Agreement with the relevant third country such as Japan.</p><p>See the table below for further information on Customs Duty and VAT payable depending on the origin of vehicles imported from GB. <table>    <tr>       <th colspan="3">Customs Duty and VAT payable </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Origin of vehicle </td>       <td>Customs Duty payable </td>       <td>VAT payable Customs Duty and VAT payable </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>UK Origin of vehicle </td>       <td>0% Customs Duty payable </td>       <td>23% VAT payable</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Third country (such as the USA or Japan)   UK</td>       <td>10% 0% </td>       <td>23%  23%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>EU (such as   Germany or France)   Third country (such as the USA or Japan)</td>       <td>10% 10% </td>       <td>23%  23%</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Additional information can be found on the Revenue website at the following link: revenue.ie/en/importing-vehicles-duty-free-allowances/guide-to-vrt/registration-of-imported-used-vehicles/index.aspx.</p><p>It is important to note that the preferential tariff treatment or Returned Goods Relief must be claimed on import on the Customs declaration. Details on how to do this are available on the Revenue website at the following links: www.revenue.ie/en/customs-traders-and-agents/customs-electronic-systems/aep/ecustoms-notifications/2021/ecustoms-notification-04-2021.pdf and www.revenue.ie/en/customs-traders-and-agents/documents/returned-goods-relief-movement-vehicles.pdf  . </p></reply>

In respect of goods coming through the postal system, the data required to complete the electronic import declaration is normally supplied by the postal operator in the country of export and the Irish postal operator submits an electronic import declaration on behalf of the relevant Irish importer, in each instance. The postal operator in the country of export does not have to register in Ireland and does not have to lodge customs declarations in Ireland. Their role is to gather the necessary data about each package or parcel and provide this electronically to the Irish postal operator.</p>  <p>  I am further advised by Revenue that where the Irish postal operator does not have the necessary information to complete an electronic import declaration, it may contact the exporting party in the relevant third country or the importer in Ireland for the necessary information to complete the declaration. Alternatively, where sufficient information to complete the customs declaration in not available, the Irish postal operator may choose to return the goods to the sender. It is entirely a commercial decision for the Irish postal operator to determine, based on its business model, how to deal with instances where it does not have the data or perhaps cannot acquire the data needed to complete the necessary customs declaration.</p>  <p>  In the foregoing context, individuals and businesses located in non-EU countries wishing to send items via the postal network should ensure they provide all the relevant data required by the exporting postal operator. This includes, but is not limited to, a detailed and concise description of the goods, the relevant Customs commodity code, if known, of the items within the consignment as well as the value of each item. Some exporting postal operators provide electronic tools to assist the exporter in providing this information.</p>  <p>  The Deputy should be aware that the rules relating to parcel and postal operators are common across the EU and apply in all Member States. I am advised by Revenue that postal operators worldwide are aware of the EU Customs requirements and of the importance of providing to EU postal operators, including the Irish postal operator, the necessary information so that EU citizens, including Irish citizens, can receive parcels conveyed via the global postal system.</p>  <p>  Finally, I am advised by Revenue that the statistics the Deputy requested relating to parcels received without a valid electronic customs declaration are not available to Revenue. Such data is a matter for the Irish postal operator.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-09-29a.250.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022092900047#WRE03000"><p>At the outset, it is important to note that neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can direct the pricing or provision of insurance products, as this is a commercial matter which individual companies assess on a case-by-case basis. This position is reinforced by the EU Single Market framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive).</p>  <p>  The Government is keenly aware of the impact that insurance costs can have on many groups &ndash; including homeowners - and has therefore prioritised insurance reform via the Action Plan for Insurance Reform, applying a whole-of-Government approach to its implementation. Work is progressing well to implement these important reforms, with the focus now on implementing the outstanding actions to increase both the affordability and availability of insurance for all groups, including consumers.</p>  <p>  In terms of delivering the Action Plan, the Central Bank&rsquo;s ban on price-walking in July has been a key development in terms of helping to tackle consumer insurance costs, including those for the home market. This is a form of dual pricing whereby customers are charged higher premiums relative to the expected costs the longer they remain with a provider. This pro-consumer ban is a balanced approach that will now protect customers who prefer to stay with their current home insurer from being subject to a &lsquo;loyalty penalty&rsquo;, while still allowing others to benefit from &lsquo;switcher&rsquo; discounts from providers who may also seek to compete on price.</p>  <p>  Nevertheless, I am aware that home insurance costs may be rising for some consumers. Data from the CSO for August 2022 shows that the price of &lsquo;insurance connected with the dwelling&rsquo; rose 4.2 per cent month-on-month and 9.8 per cent year-on-year. This compares with an annual decline of 11 per cent for motor insurance over the same period. </p>  <p>  A key driver of home insurance is the property rebuild cost (or reinstatement value), which is based on the total cost to reconstruct the property. Based on the July 2022 &lsquo;Tender Price Index&rsquo; from Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland &ndash; the rate of construction price inflation?was 14.0 per cent in the 12 months to June 2022. In addition to increasing labour costs, over the past year the cost of construction has risen substantially, driven primarily by a confluence of external factors impacting upon the supply and cost of input materials including: Brexit; COVID-19 and the war in Ukraine. As construction costs generally increase, rising rebuild and repair costs can also be expected to impact upon home insurance premiums.</p>  <p>  According to the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, many insurance companies automatically index the amount of buildings and contents cover when they renew a home insurance policy each year, thus helping a policyholder to avoid being under-insured. Linked to this, the Central Bank of Ireland last week published the findings of a Thematic Review into the issue of under-insurance in the home insurance market. It noted that under-insurance in this area has increased from 6.5 per cent in 2017 up to 16.5 per cent in 2022. The Central Bank has issues a "Dear CEO" letter to the industry and will be engaging with providers to ensure consumers are well informed and protected in this regard. The advice is policyholders should regularly check the amount of cover they have to make sure they are adequately insured.</p>  <p>  Finally, even though home insurance prices may currently be impacted by construction inflation, it is still important for policy holders to compare with other provider to ascertain if they can get a better consumer-focused deal by switching.</p></reply>

In general, the EU VAT Directive provides that all goods and services are liable to VAT at the standard rate, unless they fall within categories of goods and services specified in Annex III of the VAT Directive, in respect of which Member States may apply a lower rate from VAT. The EU VAT Directive also allows for historic VAT treatment to be maintained under certain conditions on certain goods and services not provided for in Annex III. Currently Ireland has a standard VAT rate of 23% and two reduced rates of 13.5% and 9%. Ireland is also permitted to retain some historic VAT arrangements, under strict conditions.</p>  <p>  On this basis, the supply of solar equipment, including rooftop solar photovoltaic, has been liable to VAT at the standard rate, currently 23%.  However, if these goods are supplied as part of a &ldquo;supply and install&rdquo; contract, they may be subject to VAT at the reduced rate of 13.5%.  A &ldquo;supply and install&rdquo; contract is where building services are provided in conjunction with the goods required for that building contract for example, solar panels.  Where the value of the goods supplied does not exceed two thirds of the total value of the contract, the full amount payable under the building contract will be subject to the rate at which the building services are supplied, being 13.5%.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that traders are not required to identify the VAT yield generated from the supply of specific goods or services in their periodic VAT returns. Therefore, it is not possible to provide an estimate of the amount of VAT raised from the supply of solar equipment.</p>  <p>Under the EU VAT directive, a Member State may decide to apply a reduced or zero-rate of VAT to certain activities, including the supply and installation of solar panels on and adjacent to private dwellings, housing, and public and other buildings used for activities in the public interest.    </p></reply>

The purpose of the Framework is to ensure the correct alignment of structures with business strategies and direction, mitigate risk, and provide accountability and assurance that the organisation is operating efficiently and effectively. A number of core elements underpin Revenue&rsquo;s strategies, processes, and structures and are designed, for example: </p><p>- to seek to collect no more than the correct amount of tax or duty at the right time; </p><p>- to act with integrity, honesty and consistency, and within the law, in all Revenue&rsquo;s dealings;</p><p>- to ensure impartiality, equality, fairness and respect. </p><p>Further, Revenue&rsquo;s Code of Ethics is an important part of this Framework and applies to all management and staff in the exercise of their functions.</p><p>Revenue&rsquo;s approach to enforcement of the law relating to Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT) is that in each instance where a failure to comply with the relevant legal requirements is detected, the matter is dealt with in a manner that is fair and proportionate to the circumstances of the particular case. Further, Revenue complies and conforms with its public sector equality and human rights duty pursuant to Section 42 of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act, 2014.</p><p>Revenue Officers authorised to carry out customs and excise functions carry out their duties in accordance with law. When an Officer forms the view that a person is a resident of the State, and in possession of an unregistered vehicle contrary to section 139 of the Finance Act 1992, and further that the person has had the vehicle in the State after a 30-day period, this entitles the Officer to lawfully seize the vehicle under Section 141 of the Finance Act 2001.  Depending on the circumstances of the particular case, Officers may offer release of the vehicle on payment, whether by cash or card, of the compromised sum. </p><p>Revenue&rsquo;s VRT Section 5 Enforcement Manual has recently been reviewed and is available on its website. It provides clear guidelines and protocols in relation to the payment of a compromise sum in local release situations, including: </p><p>- the presence of at least two Revenue officers in any instance where terms are being offered or payments are accepted for the local release of a vehicle for a breach of VRT</p><p>- checking procedures to ensure amounts calculated are correct and in line with Revenue&rsquo;s guidelines which are publicly available</p><p>- the issuing of receipts in respect of payments received</p><p>- the requirement for a second Revenue officer to countersign the Receipt Book to certify </p><p>- the receipt of payment and </p><p>- the issue of a receipt for that payment.</p><p>In addition to the above, I am advised that Revenue has a robust audit procedure in place for line managers responsible for officers engaged in VRT enforcement work. This procedure is outlined in detail in the VRT Enforcement Manual previously referred to. I think it is important that the Deputy is aware that these procedures continued to be in place while the manual was offline.</p><p>I am aware that Revenue&rsquo;s approach to confronting non-compliance, including in relation to VRT, is informed by risk. Each year Revenue focuses its compliance resources on areas that pose risk to the tax system as determined by Revenue&rsquo;s data holdings, data analytics and risk assessment systems. In confronting non-compliance including non-compliance with VRT obligations, Revenue takes actions in response to the level of risk and tax behaviour at any given time including the compliance behaviour displayed either generally or by specific taxpayers. The focus is to support maximum voluntary tax compliance and to provide an effective and appropriate response to non-compliance. </p><p>I am assured by Revenue that in line with its strong focus on effective performance and the proper and effective discharge of its functions and responsibilities, including proper governance, Revenue carefully considers any allegations of abuse of its statutory powers on a case-by-case basis. Any party may invoke Revenue&rsquo;s complaints procedures, internal appeals mechanisms, statutory rights of appeal, and have access to the Courts as is appropriate to the particular issue that arises or claim that is made. Revenue engages fully with whichever process a party chooses to avail of to vindicate his or her rights.</p></reply>

Roscommon on Sunday, 15th May 2022.</p>  <p>  My Department hosts the National Famine Commemoration Day each year. The Government, on 1st May 2018, approved the designation of the third Sunday of May each year as the National Famine Commemoration Day, with the arrangements for the holding of the State commemoration on this day or the preceding Saturday to be decided each year following consultation with the relevant local authority and host community.</p>  <p>  The location of the annual national commemoration is usually announced in early spring each year. However, the planning and preparation with the relevant stakeholders begins some time before the official announcement.</p>  <p>  Owing to the uncertainties surrounding public health matters, due to Covid 19, over the last number of years it was more difficult to plan for the event in the typical manner.  Consequently, the 2020 &amp;amp; 2021 commemorations were held in Dublin with limited attendance. The 2022 event in Strokestown was hosted with a slightly larger attendance of invited guests.</p>  <p>  In addition, arrangements for an international Famine Commemoration was also significantly affected by Covid-19 in recent years.  This resulted in the cancellation of the international Famine Commemoration events in 2020 and 2021.  Due to the ongoing uncertainty regarding Covid-19 and other international developments, it was not considered practicable to recommence the holding of the international Famine Commemoration in 2022.  </p>  <p>  My Department will be giving consideration to the arrangements for the Famine Commemoration, both at home and abroad over the coming months.  The National Famine Commemoration Committee has responsibility for considering arrangements for the National Famine Commemoration Day and will reflect on the experience of the last two years in putting forward proposals for 2023.</p></reply>

The most recent meeting was held on 12 September 2022 and the forum offers a very important opportunity to discuss and address the many issues facing the tourism sector.  The feedback from the industry stakeholders is a good barometer of the trends in the industry.</p>  <p>  My officials have engaged with many stakeholders, including the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation and the Irish Hotels Federation, in order to further understand the underlying issues impacting the recovery of the tourism sector and to emphasise the importance of maintaining a strong value proposition at the core of tourism. </p>  <p>  The Recovery Oversight Group, responsible for overseeing the implementation of the Tourism Recovery Plan, submitted its fourth report to me in July 2022. The report notes that much headway has been made in implementing the recovery plan presented in September 2020.  I have used this report from the Recovery Oversight Group as an important policy consideration as I continue to work, alongside my Government colleagues, towards the recovery of the tourism sector.</p></reply>

An additional &euro;2 million was announced in Budget 2023 for capital supports for night-time economy stakeholders.</p><p>My department provided &euro;5 million this year in additional funding for the national cultural institutions to ensure they continue to provide high-quality programming, to promote learning and engagement opportunities and to safeguard National Collections.  An additional &euro;2.5 million has been allocated in Budget 2023 to help with this.</p><p>My role as Minister with responsibility for leading the co-ordination of the Decade of Centenaries Programme (2012-2023) is to help ensure that the challenging events of this important and formative period in our history and related themes, are meaningfully, proportionately and sensitively remembered.  I have allocated &euro;5 million to support the 2022 commemorative programme which will deliver rich and diverse national and local programmes marking the significant centenaries arising in 2022.  Many of these investment programmes will be delivered through the local authorities.An allocation of &euro;3 million has also been announced in Budget 2023 to develop, oversee and manage a new archive and exhibition space as part of the overall National Centre for Research and Remembrance.  This is being developed in partnership with a number of agencies over the coming years including the National Archives and the National Museum of Ireland.  </p><p>Earlier this year, I announced the Government&rsquo;s decision to extend the Creative Ireland Programme until 2027.  Creative Ireland was launched in 2017 as an all-of-Government culture and wellbeing programme committed to the vision that every person should have the opportunity to realise their full creative potential.  Creative Ireland collaborates across Government and with arts, community and voluntary organisations to deploy creativity as a strategy for wellbeing, social cohesion and economic success.  Alongside its very successful Creative Youth initiative, the programme&rsquo;s Creative Communities partnership with the 31 local authorities, and their delivery of thousands of creative projects, has been key to enabling community-led nationwide engagement.Earlier this month Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g 2022, took place on Saturday 11 June 2022 with events in every county.  This initiative<b></b>is being delivered through the network of Creative Ireland Coordinators and local authority Culture and Creativity Teams in each of the 31 local authorities and is supported by RT&Eacute;. </p><p>In response to Covid-19,  capital funding towards the pilot Outdoor Public Space Scheme 2021  by my Department funds local authorities to adapt, equip or otherwise improve public spaces for cultural and events activities, taking account of public health guidelines and of the needs of the local arts community. Outdoor public spaces can provide year-round use can improve well-being and contribute positively to the public realm.</p><p>Support is provided to arts centres by local authorities and the Arts Council is critical to ensuring that a stable and vibrant network can be maintained  both for arts organisations and arts workers.  </p><p>My Department's Tourism Services programme aims to support the tourism industry to recover and grow in a sustainable way.  Budget 2023 has secured continued additional funding of &euro;15 million for overseas marketing of Ireland as a leading holiday destination and the development of the Invitation project.</p><p>Domestically, continued additional funding of &euro;15 million will deliver a range of measures to support the sector including domestic marketing, transforming the digital capabilities of tourism businesses, boosting the industry's recruitment and retention efforts, sustainable tourism initiatives, long-term investment in the US College Football Classic series, and establishment of a register of short-term letting properties as part of the Government's &quot;Housing for All&quot; reforms.</p></reply>

The overarching goal is to ensure the &ldquo;sectors recover and grow in a manner that underpins social cohesion and supports strong, sustainable economic growth, with a focus on a number of cross cutting goals of equality, diversity, social inclusion, the Irish language and environmental sustainability&rdquo;.  The Strategy sets out the actions that my Department will take over the coming period, both nationally and regionally, to enrich the quality of life in Ireland through supporting the development of tourism, culture, arts, sports, media and Irish language. In addition to their immense inherent value, these are valued by all of our communities as important resources for social cohesion, individual and community wellbeing and for the presentation of Ireland as an attractive destination for tourism and sustainable inward investment.</p><p>I was pleased to be able to announce continued record funding of &euro;130m for the Arts Council for 2023 as well as significant support for the Night-Time Economy, Culture Ireland and Creative Ireland.</p><p>The Audio-visual Action Plan was launched in June 2018.  This is an industry-wide, long-term plan, under the Creative Ireland Programme, developed to support the Government&rsquo;s ambition to enable Ireland to become a global hub for the production of film, TV drama and animation.</p><p>The tax incentive for the Screen industries, Section 481, has been a cornerstone of the Irish screen industry in the creative and cultural value it has generated, both in terms of discovering and supporting new Irish voices, as well as showcasing Ireland&rsquo;s power as an international partner, a cultural force across film, television and animation, not to mention a breath-taking location offering historic and natural beauty making it an attractive base for film locations.</p><p>  Screen Ireland is the national development agency for Irish filmmaking and the Irish film, television and animation industry, investing in talent, creativity and enterprise. The agency supports writers, directors and production companies across these sectors by providing investment loans for the development, production and distribution of film, television and animation projects.</p><p>  Screen Ireland is doing great work in regional locations. Since April 2019, over 45 regional skills development plans have been submitted to Screen Ireland and over 500 regional skills development participants have been tracked on those productions. This has led to the development of a significant skills ecosystem in the regions. On the back of new skills opportunities on Section 481 productions in the regions, many regional Higher Education and Further Education and Training providers have developed new courses aimed at the screen industry including new Springboard and Traineeship programmes at institutions like Technological University of the Shannon, Atlantic Technological University, Limerick/Clare ETB and Kilkenny/Carlow ETB. </p><p>  To build on this growth within the regions, Screen Ireland announced an investment of over &euro;2,000,000 towards the establishment of five new National Talent Academies across Ireland in Wicklow, Limerick, Galway and Dublin for film and TV drama, animation and production crew. These Talent Academies will build on the success of the Section 481 skills model to develop and drive opportunities for diverse and regional talent on a national level. This along with the allocation of an additional &euro;1m for Screen Ireland in 2023 will encourage the growth of and further development of the film industry, both indigenous and international.</p></reply>

This is most recently evidenced by the Government&rsquo;s decision to support an expression of interest by the Football Association of Ireland (FAI) in bidding, with the UK, for the right to host the UEFA Euro 2028 championships as well as the upcoming hosting of the following events:</p>  <p>  - US College Football matches every August from 2022 to 2026</p>  <p>  - The UEFA Europa League final in 2024, and</p>  <p>  - The Ryder Cup in 2027 in Limerick</p>  <p>  In line with the commitment in the Programme for Government, a Major International Sports Events Policy is currently being developed for Ireland by my Department. The aim is to establish whether and how Government should support major international sports events, the benefits it should seek to derive from such events, the supports it could offer and the kind of events it would prioritise for support.   This will provide the basis for a Strategy to support and attract major international sports events and an assessment model based on the identified priorities.  Mechanisms and channels to support events will also need to be developed.</p>  <p>  While progress on the policy was delayed by the pandemic, focused consultations have taken place with key stakeholders and a public consultation closed on 26 May 2022. Following analysis of the consultation responses, further detailed follow-up and in-depth discussions with stakeholders will be required. Research, including considerations of the policies and strategies in place in other countries, has been undertaken and is continuing. </p>  <p>  My Department is now working towards the development of a high level policy green paper by December of this year; this will outline the likely key issues and courses of action for the new policy prior to the development of the finalised policy in the first half of 2023.</p></reply>

Many areas of cities, towns and villages of all sizes face the blight of vacant properties, which, if brought back into use, could add real vibrancy and provide new accommodation in those areas.  The Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe (Towns) Fund is a key initiative which underpins these policy objectives set out in Pathway Four of Housing for All. </p><p>  Schemes under the Fund, which are delivered by local authorities, will provide new choices for people to live in towns and villages in Ireland, through the provision of a grant to support the refurbishment of vacant properties and by providing serviced sites in towns and villages to people in order to build their own homes. </p><p>  On the 14 July, I launched the Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant as part of the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe (Towns) Fund. The grant will benefit those who wish to turn a formerly vacant house or building into their principal private residence. A grant of up to a maximum of &euro;30,000 is available for the refurbishment of vacant properties for occupation as a principal private residence, including the conversion of a property which has not previously been used as residential. Where the refurbishment costs are expected to exceed the standard grant of up to &euro;30,000, a maximum top-up grant amount of up to &euro;20,000 is available where the property is confirmed to be derelict, bringing the total grant available for a derelict property up to a maximum of &euro;50,000. </p><p>  On 21 September, I launched the Ready to Build Scheme, also funded by the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe (Towns) Fund.  Under the Ready to Build Scheme, local authorities will make serviced sites in towns and villages available to potential individual purchasers to build their homes. These sites will be available at a discount on the market value of the site for the building of a property for occupation as the principal private residence of the purchaser.  </p><p>  When the Fund was launched, I committed to ongoing review of the schemes under it. I am pleased to see that the feedback on the Vacant Property Refurbishment Scheme to date has been overwhelmingly positive, with 169 applications submitted by the start of September. </p><p>  Given that a key objective of Pathway 4 of Housing for All is to ensure that the houses we already have are being fully used, I have decided to extend the eligibility for the Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant to vacant properties in both our cities and rural areas. </p><p>Both schemes under the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe (Towns) Fund will continue to be only for those who intend to occupy the property as their principal private residence. Officials in my Department will work with the Vacant Homes Officers (VHO) in each local authority in the coming weeks to update the details of the Grant, with a view to the expanded scheme being available in November. </p><p>Vacant Homes Officers in each local authority will be available to provide advice and information on the schemes and the application process.</p></reply>

This allocation will ensure that local authorities will have the necessary resources, in terms of people, to perform their functions and provide essential public services to our citizens; in excess of one thousand services in fact.  Furthermore, as has happened in previous years, we will be engaging with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in respect of any additional pay increases that are confirmed for 2023.</p>  <p>  Across all schemes and funding sources, my Department provided &euro;3.98 billion in 2020, &euro;4.07 billion in 2021 and over &euro;2.03 billion so far in 2022 (as at end August) to all local authorities. Included in this is the unprecedented level of support provided by central Government to local authorities in 2020 and 2021 during the COVID -19 pandemic. A more targeted rates waiver scheme was in place for Q1 2022, and payments to local authorities in respect of this scheme will be an additional c &euro;61m.</p>  <p>  As committed to in the Programme for Government - Our Shared Future, the move to 100% retention of Local Property Tax (LPT) will take place in 2023. All Equalisation funding will now be met by the Exchequer, to ensure that all authorities receive, at a minimum, an amount equivalent to their Baseline.  This increased equalisation requirement will come to &euro;118m in 2023. In addition, a move to this model will lead to an increased surplus for those authorities with LPT income above their funding baseline. These authorities shall now retain a greater proportion of that surplus for their own use in 2023; an increase from 20% of the overall yield this year to 22.5% next year.  It is intended to commence a comprehensive review of the current LPT baselines in the coming months. This review could not commence in time for the 2023 LPT allocation process without reliable and up-to-date data primarily the detailed census data.</p>  <p>  I am very aware of the funding pressures facing all local authorities and the provision of additional support of &euro;60m is in recognition of those pressures. My Department will continue to engage with the sector on the issue. </p></reply>

Action 6 of the strategy sets out to &lsquo;enhance the protection and conservation of historic thatched roofs&rsquo;. Officials in my Department have established a specific steering group, the Built Vernacular Heritage (Thatch) Steering Group to oversee and assist with the implementation of this particular part of the strategy. Under Action 6, the Steering Group will examine all issues relevant to thatched buildings, including thatching standards, fire prevention guidance, and the availability of suitable thatching materials, and any other relevant matters. The action also seeks to accelerate the recording and protection of these buildings, and to establish a central database. At present my Department estimates that there are 2,000 older vernacular thatched houses, and the establishment of a central database will provide further clarity on this figure. </p>  <p>  My Department, in conjunction with the Steering Group, will also progress relevant parts of other actions of the strategy as they relate to thatch, including a review of grant assistance for such buildings.</p></reply>

This includes the delivery of 90,000 social homes by 2030. Housing for All is supported by an investment package of over &euro;4bn per annum, through an overall combination of &euro;12bn in direct Exchequer funding, &euro;3.5bn in funding through the Land Development Agency and &euro;5bn funding through the Housing Finance Agency. </p><p>Under Housing for All, the Government will deliver 47,600 new build social homes and 3,500 social homes through long-term leasing in the period 2022-2026. Our clear focus is to increase the stock of social housing through new build projects delivered by local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies (AHB) and, with this, to reduce the numbers of social homes delivered through acquisition programmes. However, acquisitions of second hand properties for social housing fall under a number of local authority and Approved Housing Body (AHB) acquisitions programmes. </p><p>On 19 January my Department issued a circular letter to local authorities advising that social housing acquisitions by local authorities and AHB CALF acquisitions in 2022 would be focussed on a number of priority areas, as follows:</p><p>- One-bedroom units to deliver on Housing First and meet the short supply in this category;</p><p>- Other properties that allow persons/families to exit homelessness; and</p><p>- Specific housing required for/suitable for individuals with a disability or other particular priority needs;</p><p>Local authorities were also advised that limited acquisitions through the Capital Assistance Scheme will also be approved, subject to the available budget for specific vulnerable cohorts, such as housing for older people, accommodation for individuals and families who are homeless and for people with a disability.</p><p>On 20 April, a further circular letter issued to local authorities in relation to social housing acquisitions. The key purpose of this circular was to advise local authorities that I had reinstated the delegated sanction to local authorities in respect of social housing acquisitions which are: </p><p>(i) in one of the priority categories set out in the January circular letter;</p><p>(ii) in line with acquisition cost guidelines; and</p><p>(iii) can be completed during 2022.</p><p>The reinstatement of delegated sanction will allow local authorities to respond more flexibility to secure acquisitions which support a household to exit or to prevent homelessness. I have requested local authorities to be proactive in acquiring properties which can prevent homelessness, including properties where a notice of termination has been issued to the tenant . </p><p>My Department publishes comprehensive programme level statistics on a quarterly basis on social housing delivery activity in all local authorities, including information on social housing acquisitions. This data is available until the end of Quarter 1 2022 and is published on the statistics page of my Department&rsquo;s website, at the following link: www.gov.ie/en/collection/6060e-overall-social-housing-provision/</p><p>Data for Quarter 2 is being finalised and will be published imminently.</p></reply>

TGD M is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at: www.gov.ie/en/publication/78e67-technical-guidance-document-m-access-and-use/#current-edition  </p>  <p>  While the Part M requirements may be regarded as a statutory minimum level of provision, the accompanying technical guidance encourages building owners and designers to have regard to the design philosophy of universal design and to consider making additional provisions where practicable and appropriate. </p>  <p>  Building Regulations and the associated TGDs are subject to ongoing review in the interests of safety and the well-being of persons in the built environment and to ensure that due regard is taken of changes in construction techniques, technological progress and innovation. A number of reviews are ongoing at present including Part B Fire Safety, Part M (Changing Places Toilet) etc.   </p>  <p>  In respect of wheelchair liveable housing, I launched a new joint National Housing Strategy for Disabled People (NHSDP) 2022-2027 on 14 January 2022, together with my colleagues Mr Peter Burke, Minister of State for Local Government and Panning and Ms. Anne Rabbitte, T.D., Minister of State with responsibility for Disability (available at www.gov.ie/en/publication/60d76-national-housing-strategy-for-disabled-people-2022-2027/). The new Strategy sets out the vision for the cooperation and collaboration of Government Departments, state agencies and others in delivering housing and the related supports for disabled people over the next five years. This new Strategy will operate within the framework of Housing for All &ndash; A New Housing Plan for Ireland which is committed to ensuring that affordable, quality housing with an appropriate mix of housing design types provided within social housing, including universally designed units, is available to everyone in Irish society, including those with disabilities. Preparation of an Implementation Plan for the Strategy is underway.   </p>  <p>  With regard to social housing delivery, a key action of Housing for All is that local authorities will prepare Housing Delivery Action Plans to include details of their anticipated delivery of social housing over the period 2022-2026 including housing for disabled people.  The Plans are informed by the targets for social housing delivery contained in Housing for All, and individual targets issued to each local authority in September 2021 for the same period. They set out details of local authority delivery in addition to other delivery partners, including Approved Housing Bodies. This is the first such multi-annual delivery planning undertaken by the sector and will be an iterative process throughout the 5 years. The Plans have been published by each local authority on their website. </p></reply>

This included the commissioning of work to scope and develop options for a revised or new social housing income eligibility model. This work will commence shortly under the aegis of the Housing Agency who have been tasked with commissioning it. It is expected that the work will be complete by the end of 2022.</p>  <p>  Pending completion of this work, I have also approved changes to the social housing income eligibility bands. Five local authorities - Carlow, Clare, Galway County, Laois and Westmeath - will be moved from Band 3 to Band 2. Accordingly, the baseline income eligibility threshold for these areas will increase from &euro;25,000 to &euro;30,000. The change reflects the movement in rents in recent years in these areas and will ensure local authority areas with similar accommodation costs continue to be grouped together in the respective bands. The changes will come into effect from 1 October 2022. </p>  <p>  It is now appropriate to await the report I referred to before considering the appropriate income threshold levels for all counties, and the potential impact of any changes that might arise.</p></reply>

The economic situation had been deteriorating for some time before the pandemic, the devastating explosions in Beirut on 4 August 2020 and the onset of war in Ukraine.  I have visited Lebanon on several occasions as Minister, most recently in May of this year, and have witnessed first-hand the scale of the challenges facing the country. </p>  <p>  It is positive that parliamentary elections went ahead as scheduled in May. It is vital that Presidential elections are held to schedule, and that a government is formed as soon as possible in order to enact reform.</p>  <p>  Ireland is committed to supporting Lebanon. Since 2014, we have provided over &euro;36 million in direct humanitarian funding to Lebanon, including &euro;3 million so far in 2022. The EU has moved quickly to respond to growing food insecurity in the country created by the war in Ukraine. It has allocated &euro;25 million to Lebanon as part of a regional Food and Resilience Facility to ensure access to basic goods and services in the context of food insecurity caused by the war. It has also allocated an additional &euro;20 million in humanitarian aid to Lebanon. </p>  <p>  Since 1978, we have supported Lebanon through our troop contribution to UNIFIL. We believe it has been playing a vital role in the stability of the region as well as in Lebanon. Last year, during negotiations on the renewal of the UNIFIL mandate, Ireland successfully advocated for the inclusion of a provision enabling UNIFIL to provide targeted support to the Lebanese Armed Forces in the form of fuel, medical supplies, food, and logistical support on a temporary basis. Last month, UNIFIL&rsquo;s mandate was extended, including a six-month extension of this non-lethal support.</p></reply>

I urge Iran to immediately conduct an independent investigation into the circumstances of Ms Amini&rsquo;s death.</p>  <p>  I commend the women and men of Iran who have exercised their fundamental right to assemble and protest. The response of the Iranian security and police forces to demonstrations has been disproportionate and resulted in the loss of lives as well as a large number of injuries. The use of force against nonviolent protestors is unjustifiable and unacceptable. People in Iran have the right to peaceful protest. That right must be ensured in all circumstances.</p>  <p>  The decision to severely restrict internet access by the relevant Iranian authorities and to block instant messaging platforms is a further cause for concern, as it blatantly violates freedom of expression.</p>  <p>  Iran is a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). We call on the Iranian authorities to strictly abide by the principles enshrined in the ICCPR, including the right of peaceful assembly.</p>  <p>  Ireland along with our fellow European Union member states will consider all options at our disposal to respond to the death of Masha Amini and to the actions of the Iranian authorities against the protestors. </p></reply>

The overall increase of &euro;177 million includes &euro;100 million for Irish Aid in the Department of Foreign Affairs.</p>  <p>  2022 was the first time Ireland&rsquo;s development assistance budget surpassed &euro;1 billion. The further large increase in the volumes of our ODA for 2023 is a demonstration of our commitment to reaching the ODA target of .7% of GNI.</p>  <p>  Continued and steady annual increases in ODA will be needed to reach the 2030 target. In the context of competing budgetary pressures, such increases are an important statement by the Government of Ireland's solidarity with the developing world.</p>  <p>  Ireland's development programme has a strong global reputation. This reputation was confirmed by the OECD in its 2020 Peer Review of Ireland&rsquo;s Development Assistance.  The need to continue to increase the allocation to ODA in GNI percentage terms will also take account of the need to manage responsibly the large increases required, so that the quality of Ireland's programme is maintained.</p></reply>

Schools will be navigated through an introduction to the Wellbeing Framework and how to use the School Self Evaluation (SSE) process in guiding wellbeing promotion in their schools. These seminars will be supported by two webinars and in-school visits.  </p>  <p>  Other supports available to schools include:</p>  <p>  - Following the publication by the National Education Psychological Service (NEPS)  of guidance for post primary schools on establishing a student support team or reviewing an existing team,  psychologists are currently facilitating post-primary schools to improve the Student Support Team process.  Student Support Teams are the structure through which key wellbeing and wellbeing-related policies are implemented in post-primary schools. </p>  <p>  - NEPS has developed training for school staff on the promotion of wellbeing and resilience in schools which include upskilling school staff on the use and implementation of therapeutically-informed approaches in schools.  These include trauma-informed approaches, approaches based on the principles of cognitive behaviour therapy, and attachment-aware approaches. The approaches outlined in the training are based on research findings, on the experience of experts in their fields and on the experience of practising psychologists working in schools. The training will build the capability of school staff in both primary and post-primary settings, including for school leaders, teachers and SNAs.</p>  <p>  - NEPS) will shortly resume the provision of training for school staff on the Friends for Life programmes to help reduce anxiety in children and also the Incredible Years Classroom Management System.  Priority will be given to schools new to DEIS.</p>  <p>  - NEPS has launched an eLearning course - Responding to Critical Incidents in Schools.  This course is aimed specifically at the school&rsquo;s Critical Incident Management Team, but open to all interested staff. </p>  <p>  - At post primary level, counselling is a key part of the role of the Guidance Counsellor, offered on an individual or group basis as part of a developmental learning process, at moments of personal crisis but also at key transition points. The Guidance Counsellor also identifies and supports the referral of students to external counselling agencies and professionals, as required. Each post primary school currently receives an allocation in respect of guidance provision, calculated by reference to the approved enrolment.  </p>  <p>  The programmes and initiatives set out above are in addition to the educational psychological support that NEPS provide to all primary and post-primary schools. This involves direct support in the event of a critical incident, access to national and regional support and development work to build school capacity to support students, access to individual pupil casework where there is need. NEPS works closely with the HSE and its agencies to ensure those who may require the provision of therapy or counselling are referred on to the appropriate clinical services for intervention and support.   </p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that in relation to Mica defective blocks, the current arrangement is that if a school suspects there is Mica present they should submit an Emergency Works Scheme application for funding to have testing carried out. If the test results show Mica is present, the school should employ a consultant to complete an Emergency Works Scheme application for funding to remediate the problem.</p></reply>

In the last school year over 121,400 children, including over 15,500 children with special educational needs, were transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;289m in 2021.</p><p>The purpose of my Department's School Transport Scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school.</p><p>In July 2022, Government announced funding for the waiving of school transport scheme fees for the coming school year as part of a wider package of cost of living measures. </p><p>School Transport ticket registration for the 2022/23 school year closed on 29 July by which time almost 130,000 applications/registrations were received for mainstream school transport. This figure includes 44,299 new applications as well as roll-overs from the previous school year.</p><p>The online account management system, known as the Family Portal, which had been closed since registrations shut on 29 July, reopened on Thursday 25 August, this closure  was necessary so that Bus &Eacute;ireann could adapt their IT and management systems. </p><p>Bus &Eacute;ireann are processing applications and issuing tickets to eligible pupils as soon as extra buses and drivers are sourced and become available to provide transport for the higher numbers qualifying for the service any additional capacity on these services will be offered to concessionary applicants.</p><p>The normal eligibility criteria of the scheme still apply and tickets continue to be allocated in line with this criteria.  Pupils at primary level are eligible where they live no less than 3.2 kilometres from and are attending their nearest primary school. At post primary level, students who live no less than 4.8 kilometres from and are attending their nearest post primary school/education centre are deemed eligible.</p><p>Any pupils/students who do not meet these criteria are deemed not eligible, or otherwise known as concessionary applicants, and are allocated a ticket based on the availability of a seat when all eligible children have been catered for.</p><p>In line with normal practice, all eligible children who completed the application and ticket registration process on time for the 2022/2023 school year will be accommodated on school transport services where such services are in operation.</p><p>In addition, pending completion of the outcome of the full review of the School Transport Scheme, Temporary Alleviation Measures at post-primary level will be continued for the 2022/2023 school year. Under these measures, which were initially introduced in 2019, transport will provided for post-primary pupils who are eligible for transport to their nearest school and are attending their second nearest school and who applied by the 29<sup>th</sup>April and registered for a ticket by the 29<sup>th</sup>July.</p><p>Because of the nature of concessionary transport for non-eligible children and the priority of providing places for eligible children, there may be an excess of demand over supply for concessionary places, in these cases Bus &Eacute;ireann will allocate tickets for spare seats using an agreed selection process.</p><p>Following discussions with Minister McGrath and officials in Department of Public Expenditure and Reform  as part of the budgetary process some additional funding has been approved for the scheme which will allow officials in consultation with Bus &Eacute;ireann to consider and evaluate where temporary additional capacity may be available.</p></reply>

This extensive packages includes measures in relation to the Working Family Payment.</p>  <p>  The Working Family Payment (WFP) is an in-work support which provides an income top-up for employees on low earnings. The WFP is designed to prevent in-work poverty for low paid workers with child dependents, and to offer a financial incentive to take-up employment. There are approximately 47,000 families with 103,000 children who are currently in receipt of the WFP. The estimated spend on the WFP in 2022 is &euro;349 million.</p>  <p>  To qualify for payment of WFP a person must be engaged as an employee in full time paid employment which is expected to last for at least 3 months and be working for a minimum of 38 hours per fortnight or 19 hours per week. A couple may combine their hours of employment to meet the qualification criteria. The applicant must also have at least one qualified child who normally resides with them or is part of a family supported by them. These criteria have not been changed in Budget 2023. </p>  <p>  The Budget package includes a range of measures that will assist people with the cost of living in one-off payments this Autumn. This includes a once-off payment of &euro;500 to recipients of the Working Family Payment. This payment will be made in November at an estimated cost of &euro;23 million.</p>  <p>  In addition, I have also provided for a &euro;40 per week increase in the Working Family Payment thresholds for all family sizes. This is the highest ever increase in the Working Family Payment thresholds. This will ensure that families on low incomes will receive more weekly income from the scheme - up to &euro;24 euro per week. It will also ensure that the increase of 80 cent per hour in the National Minimum Wage does not negatively impact on people's income from the WFP. It also means that more people will qualify for the payment. This measure will take effect from January at a cost of approximately &euro;16.8 million in 2023.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies matters for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This work is still ongoing. </p>  <p>  Finally, the Department of Social Protection provides Additional Needs Payments as part of the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme for people who have an urgent need which they cannot meet from their own resources.  These payments are available through our Community Welfare Officers and include help towards recurring travel costs that cannot be met from the person's own resources and are deemed to be necessary.  Every decision is based on consideration of the circumstances of the case, taking account of the nature and extent of the need and of the resources of the person concerned.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This settlement resolves this long-standing issue through the payment of a once off ex-gratia payment rather than a pension to eligible CE supervisors and assistant supervisors.  On the 23rd December 2021, both unions involved confirmed acceptance of this settlement which will benefit approximately 2,500 people employed by CE schemes going back to 2008. It is estimated to have a total cost of over &euro;24 million. </p>  <p>  Generally, under the terms of this settlement, on reaching retirement age, eligible CE supervisors and assistant supervisors will receive a once off ex-gratia payment in respect of time employed by CE schemes since 2008.  People who retired since 2008 and who have reached retirement age are now able to apply for this payment. </p>  <p>  Over the past number of months, an administrative and ICT system to accept applications and process payments was put in place within the Department of Social Protection. The first group of  ex-gratia applications have been received - these relate to persons who retired since 2008.  While I cannot comment on individual applications, I can confirm that my Department is processing applications  received to date.  Discussions are ongoing with the Department of Expenditure and Reform (DPER) as regards the timing of issuing of these payments. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter. </p></reply>

This is despite the increased overall investment in services. My Department cannot direct or determine the employment and staffing of third-party contractors.</p>  <p>  My Department is not the employer of contracted staff and therefore the responsibility for any redundancy payments rests solely with the employer. Where an employer is unable to pay statutory redundancy, they can make an application to the my Department&rsquo;s Redundancy and Insolvency service.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the position.</p></reply>

The Government has provided &euro;53.9 million for the scheme for 2022.  </p>  <p>  Further to the commitments in the Programme for Government and in the Rural Development Policy 2021-2025, my Department reviewed the means assessment disregards for the Farm Assist. One of the key recommendations of the report was to expand the list of agri-environmental schemes as provided by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I recently introduced this measure effective from June 2022. Under the Farm Assist means test, income from these schemes currently attract a disregard of &euro;2,540, with 50% of the balance assessed as means. The report is available on the Government's website. </p>  <p>  I have introduced another improvement to the Farm Assist means test as part of Budget 2023. From January 2023, the amount of income from agri-environmental schemes that is disregarded will rise to &euro;5,000. </p>  <p>  The Review of the Farm Assist disregards also recommended that the two Departments would work together to identify schemes in Ireland's upcoming CAP Strategic Plan 2023-2027 which may be considered for inclusion in the list of schemes which attract the disregard in the means test for the Farm Assist Scheme. I am committed to this and will consider any additional schemes in that context. </p>  <p>  Figures available on the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine's website indicate that the average level of payment under the Organic Farming Scheme is &euro;5,460.  The total cost of extending the disregard would depend on the number of farmers in receipt of Farm Assist who are receiving the Organic Farming Scheme and the level of payment being made.  This information is not currently to hand. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the position.</p></reply>

The latest data on the number of registrations of ELC services supplied by Tusla shows that there were 4,061 ELC services registered at the end of July 2022. Please note this figure does not include school age childcare services.</p>  <p>  Under the Regulations for ELC services, service providers are required to ensure that each child&rsquo;s learning, development and well-being is facilitated within the daily life of the pre-school service through the provision of the appropriate activities, interaction, materials and equipment, having regard to the age and stage of development of the child. The Regulations also require that children have access to a suitable outdoor space.</p>  <p>  ELC services are also guided by Aistear, the early childhood curriculum framework. One of the guiding principles for good practice as set out in Aistear is learning and developing through play. The adult in the ELC setting is expected to create an indoor and outdoor environment that provides a wide range of play possibilities. One of the characteristics of play is to be active, meaning children use their bodies and minds in their play, interacting with the environment, with materials and with other people.</p>  <p>  Aistear further notes that "Physical play involves children developing, practising and refining bodily movements and control. It includes whole body and limb movements, co-ordination and balance. These activities involve physical movements for their own sake and enjoyment. Children gain control over their gross motor skills first before refining their fine motor skills."</p></reply>

Our country has never experienced an influx of displaced persons like the one that we have seen over the past months.</p><p>My Department&rsquo;s role is focused on the immediate, short-term accommodation needs of those who have fled here. To date, more than 49,000 people have arrived in Ireland and in excess of 38,000 of those have been referred to us seeking accommodation from the State.</p><p>Overseeing provision of accommodation on this scale during this timeframe for all those who require it remains immensely challenging. Due to the urgent need to source accommodation, a broad range of accommodation types have been contracted, including emergency accommodation. </p><p>The priority is to place people fleeing the conflict in safe and secure accommodation.</p><p>The Government is committed to delivering a humanitarian response to welcome people seeking protection in Ireland as part of the European Union's overall response. The scale of response to this crisis has been unprecedented and Irish people have displayed an incredible level of generosity in their support and pledges of accommodation.</p><p>The Irish Red Cross (IRC) has put in place a national pledge as the mechanism for channelling the offers of accommodation which many members of the public wish to provide. The website through which offers of accommodation are pledged is registerofpledges.redcross.ie. Implementing partners include Local Authorities, IRC, International Organisation of Migration (IOM) and Peter McVerry Trust.</p><p>To date, 4,339 beneficiaries have moved to 1,585 properties and this figure increases on a weekly basis.</p><p>Placement of people in need into pledged properties also occurs outside the pledged process. </p><p>The process of placing people in pledged accommodation does take time, but it is a complex process and needs to be done correctly for the safety and security of those fleeing. </p><p>My Department is working to advance this process to the greatest extent possible.</p></reply>

The term &lsquo;Lead Educator&rsquo; is used to reflect the important pedagogical leadership role played by these individuals with a group of children and with other Early Years Educators who are also working with that group of children. For the purposes of Core Funding, each ELC room can only have one Lead Educator at any one time; even if the children are organised into groups within the room.</p>  <p>  The definition of a Manager is also taken from Nurturing Skills &ndash; The Workforce Plan for Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare, 2022-2028&rsquo;: &ldquo;The term Manager is used in the Workforce Plan to refer to the person in charge of a setting, as defined in the Early Years Regulations 2016 and SAC Regulations 2018, i.e. &lsquo;the person who has day-to-day charge of the service&rsquo;. This person may or may not be the Registered Provider. While ELC and SAC services vary considerably in their legal and organisational structures, every service must &ndash; as a condition of its registration &ndash; have a designated person in charge (here termed the &lsquo;Manager&rsquo;) who is responsible for the daily running of the service and &ndash; unless deputised by a named person &ndash; must be on the premises at all times when the service is being carried on.&rdquo; The Core Funding Graduate Manager premium can only be attracted by this designated person in charge, not by any of the other members of staff who may deputise when the manager is not present.</p>  <p>  Attached is a list of services contracted into Core Funding and the amount of funding they are expected to receive under the Graduate Premium and the Manager Premium, and the sum total of these two premiums.

The new funding model, Together for Better, including Core Funding, the National Childcare Scheme (NCS) and ECCE, incorporating the Access and Inclusion Model (AIM), will support delivery of ELC and SAC for the public good, for quality and affordability for children, parents and families. </p><p>Core Funding, which began in September, is the new funding stream with an allocation of &euro;266<b></b>million in 2023 to start this partnership for the public good between the State and providers. Its primary purpose is to improve pay and conditions in the sector as a whole and improve affordability for parents as well as ensuring a stable income to providers.  </p><p>A central condition of Core Funding is that providers agree not to increase fees above those which were charged last year. Providers who had increased their fees since September are required to revert to September 2021 levels under Core Funding from the point of coming into contract for the scheme. This gives parents greater certainty about what they will be charged and ensures that the significant increases to NCS subsidies are not absorbed by fee increases. The approach to fee management will be developed further over time.</p><p>Participation in the Core Funding is optional and, to date, 90% of services are signed-up and thereby agreeing to operating the fee conditions. The full list of participating Partner Services is available here: first5fundingmodel.gov.ie/together-for-better/ </p><p>The Core Funding Partner Service Funding Agreement outlines the terms and conditions of the Grant, including specific clauses on Fee Management. The Funding Agreement is publicly available here: first5fundingmodel.gov.ie/core-funding/ </p><p>The Funding Agreement states clearly that failure to comply with the terms of the Agreement may result in a service's exclusion from the Grant, suspension of the Grant, and/or a termination of the Agreement, including remedy of breaches or refund of any excess charges to families.<b></b></p><p>I encourage any parent or provider who has queries in relation to Core Funding to contact their local City/County Childcare Committee for support and guidance at: myccc.ie/</p></reply>

Such arrangements are however dependent on appropriate engagement with Ukrainian Medical Schools. While extensive efforts to establish relationships with Ukrainian Medical Schools have to date been unsuccessful, my officials are continuing in their efforts to make contact. Additionally, Ukrainian medical schools have made arrangements for international students to take their clinical placements in a number of third countries where they have academic medical links. My officials are engaging with colleagues in the Department of Health to see what flexibility, if any, can be provided within the Irish Health system. The vast majority of Irish students in Ukraine were studying Medicine or Dentistry and my Department has been in communication with them, both as a representative group and individually. </p></reply>

The assessment of eligibility under the FFI in individual cases is a matter for each higher education institution to determine within the terms of the scheme, exceptions to the criteria cannot be made in individual cases by the Department. </p>  <p>  A key principle of the scheme is to support students in progressing through a chosen course of study from year to year. The objective of the progression policy is to help as many students as possible to obtain one qualification at each level of study. To satisfy the terms and conditions of the FFI in relation to progression, a student must be moving from year to year within a course having successfully completed the previous year or, having successfully completed a course, is progressing to another related course where the award for the subsequent course is of a higher level than the previous course (for example added years to attain a level 8 having completed a level 7 course).</p>  <p>  A free fees eligible students that completed year one or year two of a free fees eligible course in 20/21 or 21/22, and departs the course of study without securing a qualification, is not normally eligible for free fees funding in year one of a new free fees course at the same qualification level in 22/23. However, once an equivalent period of study has been completed on the new course, the student may become eligible for free fees funding for the remainder of the course.</p>  <p>  Full details of the scheme including the repeat period of study criteria are available at the following location: hea.ie/funding-governance-performance/funding/student-finance/course-fees/</p>  <p>  Where undergraduate students do not meet the qualifying criteria of the FFI they are required to pay tuition fees in full to their higher education institution. It is a matter for the higher education institution as an autonomous body to determine the applicable fee rate for students.</p>  <p>  In general there is a real requirement to have a responsive approach to student needs wherever possible and it is important to acknowledge that HEIs have to date shown enormous willingness to be responsive in numerous ways where a student&rsquo;s study was impacted by COVID-19. I would encourage any student who is struggling with their course to contact their institution or access officer to be informed of the wide range of services which are available to them to support them on their journey, prior to making any decisions regarding the cessation of their studies.</p></reply>

These programmes aim to reduce morbidity and mortality in the population through early detection of disease and treatment, both of which greatly improve health outcomes.</p>  <p>  During the COVID-19 pandemic the HSE established a Community Pharmacy Contingency Planning working group with relevant stakeholders, including the Irish Pharmaceutical Union and the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, to support the implementation of all COVID-19 support measures. This group &ndash; now called the Community Pharmacy Planning Forum &ndash; had examined the operational and clinical challenges confronting community pharmacists during the COVID-19 emergency and played a key role in resolving them to the benefit of the people of Ireland.</p>  <p>  The work of the Forum has now transitioned to discussing the strategic direction of the community pharmacy profession. These discussions will bring clarity to the role to be played by community pharmacy in the context of Sl&aacute;intecare. The central objective of Sl&aacute;intecare is providing the right care, in the right place, at the right time. This means providing more care to patients in the communities in which they live. Community pharmacists will play a vital and increasing role in delivering this care. The ongoing work of the Community Pharmacy Planning Forum will also prove invaluable in the context of future contractual reform. Of course, any publicly funded pharmacy service expansion should address unmet public healthcare needs, improve access to existing public health services, and provide better value for money.</p>  <p>  Finally, it is important to note that any decisions about changes to screening programmes, will be made on the advice of our National Screening Advisory Committee (NSAC). This independent expert group considers and assesses evidence in a robust and transparent manner, and against internationally accepted criteria. It is important we have rigorous processes in place to ensure our screening programmes are effective, quality assured and operating to safe standards, and that the benefits of screening outweigh the harms.</p></reply>

I also acknowledge the vital role that community pharmacy will play in the development and implementation of future healthcare reform, especially in regard to the aims and vision of Sl&aacute;intecare.</p>  <p>  I understand that there are reports of a current acute workforce issue, particularly in relation to community pharmacy. The Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (PSI), the pharmacy regulator, has been liaising with stakeholders, including the Irish Pharmacy Union (IPU), on efforts being taken within the sector to understand and address the issue. This a complex problem with many contributing factors and multiple stakeholders. Workforce challenges are being experienced in other sectors nationally, and in the pharmacy sector in a range of other countries.

The Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (PSI), the pharmacy regulator, has been liaising with stakeholders, including the Irish Pharmacy Union (IPU), on efforts being taken within the sector to understand and address the issue.</p>  <p>  This is a complex problem with many contributing factors and multiple stakeholders, with workforce challenges being experienced in other sectors nationally, and in the pharmacy sector in a range of other countries. </p>  <p>  In February 2022, PSI met with a number of superintendent pharmacists and with the IPU. The PSI circulated a survey on behalf of the IPU to all registrants to support efforts to understand and address the issue in the short term with the fieldwork on the research undertaken between 22 March and 8 April 2022. The results of this have been finalised and a report generated, containing specific recommendations, and this has been drawn to the attention of my officials who are currently reviewing the content; they will continue to liaise with relevant stakeholders on this matter. </p>  <p>  In developing its Corporate Strategy 2021-2023, the PSI was aware of reports of an increasing risk to the continued availability of a pharmacist workforce. The PSI are currently undertaking a project, due to run across 2022-&rsquo;23,  titled &lsquo;Emerging Risks to the Future Pharmacy Workforce&rsquo;. This project is set to &ldquo;assess emerging risks to the continued availability of a professional pharmacy workforce within community and hospital pharmacy in Ireland&rdquo;. </p>  <p>  The European Commission is also currently supporting a health and social care workforce planning strategy and action plan, a health and social care workforce planning model, health and social care workforce projections and gap analysis project. Support includes recommendations for health and social care workforce reforms.</p>  <p>  As you will be aware there are currently three Schools of Pharmacy within universities in Ireland &ndash; TCD, RCSI and UCC who each provide an accredited five-year fully integrated Master&rsquo;s degree programme in pharmacy (MPharm).  On successful completion of the five-year programme, graduates are then eligible to apply to the PSI for registration through the National Route of registration.  As part of their Emerging Risks to the Future Pharmacy Workforce project, PSI have committed to share any relevant data emerging as part of that project with relevant Government departments, along with relevant first-time registration data with the relevant Government departments, particularly if trends are identified that indicate a future deficit. </p>  <p>  A number of agencies and stakeholders are now beginning to review this topic holistically and consider the impact, role, responsibility and accountability from their own perspectives, and the contributions they might make to mitigate the issue. The Department is engaging both internally,  and with external stakeholders, including the Department of Higher Education, Research, Science and Technology to fully assess the reported issue of shortages in the pharmacist workforce and to identify any necessary actions to be taken in the short, medium and longer term, and will continue to do so.</p>  <p>  Pharmacy is a clinical service provided by highly qualified health care professionals within the community and hospital sectors. I continue to recognise the key role played and the very significant contribution made by this sector to patients and the public in responding to their health needs during the course of the pandemic. There is in any clinical service a requirement for the robust retention of data, both from a clinical and administrative perspective. My department has responsibility for the legislative framework for medicines, while other entities have requirements for other records. The  department is committed to  working on enablers to facilitate enhanced methodologies of data management including the Individual Health Identifier (IHI) and Shared Care Record as well as eHealth infrastructure. In Ireland, the HSE ePharmacy Programme has initiated the National e-Prescribing Project to plan, resource and implement e-Prescribing. </p>  <p>  I will continue to engage as necessary with government colleagues, including with colleagues in the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science in addressing relevant issues as they arise.</p></reply>

The effect of these regulations is to designate the professions of counsellor and psychotherapist under the Act and to establish one registration board for both professions. Members were appointed to the Counsellors and Psychotherapists Registration Board in February 2019 and they held their inaugural meeting in May 2019. </p>  <p>  The work of a registration board includes consideration of the titles to be protected and the minimum qualifications to be required of existing practitioners and the qualifications that will be required for future graduates. The work of the Counsellors and Psychotherapists Registration Board is significantly more challenging than it is for registration boards for some of the more established professions owing to the different and complex pathways into these professions, the variety of titles used, and the variety and number of courses and course providers.</p>  <p>  Owing to the significant body of preparatory work that the Registration Board is required to undertake; it is not possible to say with any degree of accuracy when the professions will be fully regulated. I would anticipate that the Registration Board will require a number of years to complete its work.</p>  <p>  I hope that this information is of assistance to you.</p></reply>

The PSI is also the registering authority for retail pharmacies in Ireland in order that they may open and operate. Opening times are a commercial matter for each retail pharmacy based on the market demand in their respective local areas. The provision of late-night opening times is not a contractual obligation in respect of the operating times of individual pharmacies. </p>  <p>  I understand that there are reports of workforce issues facing community pharmacies which may also be impacting on their decisions in respect of opening times. The PSI has been liaising with stakeholders, including the Irish Pharmacy Union, on efforts being taken within the sector to address these issues. This a complex problem with many contributing factors and multiple stakeholders which re-enforces the need for robust data to be best able to determine the current landscape, assess future health system needs and understand existing sectoral challenges now and into the future. The PSI are currently undertaking a project, entitled &lsquo;Emerging Risks to the Future Pharmacy Workforce&rsquo;, which is set to &ldquo;assess emerging risks to the continued availability of a professional pharmacy workforce within community and hospital pharmacy in Ireland&rdquo;.  The PSI has also committed in its Service Plan 2022 to complete a review of the Third Country Qualification Route (TCQR) and propose changes to the Council.</p>  <p>  Given that some pharmacies do extend their opening hours, it would only be in rare circumstances that a person would be unable to access their medication at a community pharmacy and would need to present at their nearest Accident and Emergency Department for that purpose.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-09-29a.667.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022092900054#WRM01000"><p>Firstly, I would like to reiterate my recognition of the key role of Pharmacy in the Community, and the very significant contribution made by this sector to patients and the public in responding to their health needs during the course of the pandemic. I acknowledge the vital role that community pharmacy will play in the development and implementation of future healthcare reform, especially in regard to the aims and vision of Sl&aacute;intecare.</p>  <p>  The Submission referred to in your question has been received by my Department and the content will be given due consideration in the context of wider health priorities during the current budget discussions. Notwithstanding this however certain of the matters raised have been previously drawn to my attention and work is ongoing on examining particular issues. </p>  <p>  During the COVID-19 pandemic the Health Service Executive established a Community Pharmacy Contingency Planning working group with relevant stakeholders, including the IPU and the PSI, to support the implementation of all COVID-19 support measures in the context of pharmacy services and the contribution this sector could make. This group &ndash; now called the Community Pharmacy Planning Forum &ndash; had examined the operational and clinical challenges confronting community pharmacists during the COVID-19 emergency and played a key role in resolving them to the benefit of the people of Ireland. The work of the Forum has now transitioned to discussing the strategic direction of the community pharmacy profession. This will prove invaluable in the context of future contractual reform. Of course, any publicly funded pharmacy service expansion should address unmet public healthcare needs, improve access to existing public health services, and provide better value for money.</p>  <p>  In the interest of clarity, I would also point out that the regulations governing the pharmacy fee structure that were made under section 9 of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (FEMPI) Act 2009 expired at the end of 2019. Under the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017, these regulations had to be replaced by 1 January 2020 in order to maintain a statutory basis for contractor payments and to prescribe the fees payable from that date.  The Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 (Payments to Community Pharmacy Contractors) Regulations 2019 &ndash; S.I. No. 639 of 2019 &ndash; gave effect to the current pharmacy fees. Any future changes to the pharmacy fee structure will need to be made by regulations under the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017.</p>  <p>  I was delighted to announce the commencement of the free contraception scheme for women aged 17&ndash;25, which is a big milestone in the delivery of our commitments, under the Women&rsquo;s Health Action Plan 2022 &ndash; 2023 to improve all areas of women healthcare. Pharmacies who sign up to provide services under the scheme, are now further empowered to support women&rsquo;s health with the provision of prescription contraception free to 17&ndash;25-year-olds.</p>  <p>  Finally, the continued gathering of and analysis of up-to-date, robust and relevant data, will be a basis for recommendations that can be proposed to address Ireland&rsquo;s needs as our integrated healthcare system evolves, and in the context of Sl&aacute;intecare implementation. </p>  <p>  I will engage as necessary with government colleagues in addressing relevant issues as they arise.</p></reply>

It is imperative that nursing homes manage potential cost pressures in line with their regulatory and contractual responsibilities, maintaining their quality of care so that residents&rsquo; lived experience and comfort is not affected. </p>  <p>  The Government has provided substantial supports to the nursing homes sector over the course of the pandemic. Over &euro;144 million has been claimed by nursing homes under the Temporary Assistance Payments Scheme (TAPS) since spring 2020. TAPS continues in effect and the Government has now agreed to extend the scheme to the end of the year. The scheme will be refocused on addressing this year's inflationary pressures related to energy and heating. Details are being finalised and these will be communicated in the coming days.</p>  <p>  Substantial additional supports have been provided by the HSE in terms of serial testing, PPE, the deployment of specialist teams and other services. Many of these supports continue. </p>  <p>  Funding to support people to access services in the sector continues to be provided in line with the long-established statutory mechanisms under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009. This is the mechanism established by the Oireachtas to provide for the processes relating to funding under the NHSS and the negotiation of prices for services for private and voluntary providers with the designated State agency, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF). Maximum prices for individual Nursing Homes are agreed with the NTPF following negotiations and based on the NTPF&rsquo;s cost criteria. These criteria include:</p>  <p>  - Costs reasonably incurred by the nursing home</p>  <p>  - Local market prices</p>  <p>  - Historic prices</p>  <p>  - Overall budgetary capacity</p>  <p>  The NTPF carry out this role independently under the NHSS Act 2009 and there is no role for Ministers or the Department in these negotiations.  It should also be noted that the department continues to work with the NTPF to take forward the recommended actions that emerged from the review of the NTPF pricing system published in June 2021.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Department is also taking forward the nine recommendations of the Value for Money Review on Nursing Home costs published last December.</p></reply>

The context for this decision is provide additional quay side and greater depth to accommodate larger fishing vessels, and attract additional landings from both Irish and non-Irish fishing vessels.  </p>  <p>  In line with the Public Spending Code, a cost benefit analysis report which considered the costs involved in a number of options for delivering the new development formed an important basis for the decision to proceed with the project.  That report, which my Department published online contemporaneously, identified the option estimated to cost &euro;25m ex VAT at the time.  Since then, detailed design has been procured and a tender competition to deliver the works is underway.  The full costs of the project will not be known until that tender competition closes.  My Department is working hard to ensure that the project is delivered within the timeframe of the existing planning permission. </p>  <p>  Having regard to the size and scale of fishing vessels frequenting our Fishery Harbour Centres I am more than satisfied that the development which is being procured is appropriate to the needs of the sector.  In addition, the development will also be accessible to large vessels such as the Irish Naval fleet, Marine Institute Research Vessels, marine survey vessels, marine leisure craft and others.  </p>  <p>  In relation to the correspondence identified by the Deputy, I understand a reply issued last week. I myself met with some of the individuals concerned on my two visits to Ros an Mh&iacute;l late last year and in February this year and they very much welcomed the decision to proceed with the project.  My officials most recently met with some of the individuals concerned earlier this month at Ros an Mh&iacute;l.</p></reply>

I have also made changes to include the farm dwelling in solar panel investment applications and is now eligible for inclusion in TAMS. </p>  <p>  It is also proposed that support for renewable energy investments will continue under the new Capital Investment Scheme from 2023 onwards. </p>  <p>  There is &euro;404m available for grant aid under TAMS for 2023-2027 with an increase in funding to &euro;90 million in 2023 for TAMS. This will include funding for on-farm renewables for farmers subject to the approval of the European Commission. Monies will not be allocated to specific investments until the investment list is finalised. Changes to the support for capital investments including renewable energy and Solar investment are subject to a Rural Development Plan amendment and Commission approval.</p></reply>

National taxation measures, together with the support available under the CAP, represent a substantial commitment to young farmers. I was therefore pleased to secure the Minister for Finance's agreement in Budget 2023 to renew 100% Stamp Duty Relief for Young-Trained Farmers and Stock Relief Young-Trained Farmers and Partnerships.</p></reply>
