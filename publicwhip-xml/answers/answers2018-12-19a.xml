There was a strong shared concern by all parties in the Oireachtas about the level of progress achieved by the Commission to date, the timeframe now proposed for concluding the first module of the Commission&rsquo;s work, and the risks of further delays and cost escalations.</p>  <p>  As agreed at that meeting, I propose to request a Report from the Commission under Section 33 of the Commissions of Investigation Act before agreeing to the extended timeframe sought.  I wrote to the leaders of the Opposition parties about this proposal and will take account of their views before responding formally to the Commission.</p>  <p>  From the time of its establishment to the end of November this year the Commission spent &euro;4.8 million on direct costs, including salaries, administration, overheads and its own legal counsel.  </p>  <p>  The Commission has not provided any estimate of the third party legal costs incurred to date but they are likely to be substantial and it would be prudent to assume the final cost of the Commission will exceed &euro;30 million.</p></reply>

The provisions in Section 18 facilitate the implementation of the Youth Guarantee, which was agreed by the European Council on 22 April 2013 to tackle the challenge of youth joblessness. </p><p>My Department is nearing completion of the review of the operation, effectiveness and impact of Section 18, as required under subsection 3, and is considering its continued relevance given the improved economic situation for young unemployed. I expect to lay a report before the Houses of the Oireachtas by the end of Q2 2019. </p><p>Youth unemployment has fallen from a peak of over 32% in 2012 to its current rate of 12.3% in November 2018 ( below the EU average of 15%).  The actual number of young people unemployed, estimated to have peaked at 97,400 persons in late 2010, fell to 37,600 in November 2018. Ireland is on course to bring youth unemployment to below 12% in accordance with <i>Pathways to Work </i>targets for 2020. </p><p>The positive downward trend in the youth unemployment rate indicates that, together with improvements in the labour market, government policy to address youth unemployment, which focuses firstly on enhancing processes and policies for assisting young unemployed people to find secure sustainable jobs, has been successful.  Ensuring that as many of these jobs as possible are filled by unemployed people, particularly those on the Live Register, remains the overarching objective of the activation policies set out in <i>Pathways to Work.</i></p></reply>

Many of these are national schemes rather than oriented at a specific area or region.  </p><p>First of all, my Department provides the Intreo service whose role includes the provision of support for people with a disability in reaching their employment ambitions.  Training has been delivered to over 60 Intreo Case Officers to provide specialised support to people with disabilities presenting at DEASP Intreo Centres.</p><p>Working with the Intreo service, the nationwide EmployAbility service, delivered under contract on behalf of my department, is a specialist service designed to support persons with a disability in seeking and finding employment and this service is provided in the region.  EmployAbility Cavan / Monaghan has the highest number of full time equivalent staff across the 23 EmployAbility companies nationwide.</p><p>My department also operates a number of general schemes which persons with a disability can avail of:</p><p>- The Community Employment (CE) programme enhances employability by providing work experience and training opportunities for people within their communities.  There are currently 83 people with disabilities participating on Community Employment (CE) schemes in Cavan, Monaghan and Meath.</p><p>- The Youth Employment Support Scheme (YESS) is open to persons in receipt of Disability Allowance and Blind Pension.  This scheme was launched in October and there are currently 4 people with disabilities participating on the scheme.  </p><p>- The Rural Social Scheme (RSS) provides farmers and fishermen with income support while they also make a contribution to their communities.  The scheme is open to people in receipt of Disability Allowance.</p><p>My department also provides financial incentives for employers to employ people with disabilities under the Wage Subsidy Scheme.  In the North East region, which includes counties Cavan, Monaghan and Meath, more than 320 employers are receiving support through the subsidy, which in turn is supporting in excess of 470 people with disabilities in employment.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-12-19a.31.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018121900063#WRB01100"><p>Progressing legislation to protect the interests of workers has been one of my key objectives in 2018. I am very pleased therefore that the Employment Miscellaneous Provisions Bill will complete its passage this week and introduce important new protections - particularly for those workers in sectors where employment terms are perceived to be becoming more precarious.  </p>  <p>  As deputies will be aware, the issue of bogus or false self-employment was discussed during the debate on this Bill.  There exist legislative provisions prohibiting this practice.  For example, under sections 251 and 252 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, there are already offences specified in relation to misclassifying employment in order to avoid paying the correct social insurance contributions.  On conviction, fines of up to &euro;13,000 or imprisonment for a term of up to 3 years, or both, can ultimately be imposed.  </p>  <p>  Workers who have concerns in relation to their employment status also have recourse to the Department&rsquo;s SCOPE section.  This section determines employment status and the correct class of pay-related social insurance (PRSI).  The section applies a Code of Practice agreed with employers and trade unions in making its determinations.  Where misclassification of workers as self-employed is detected, the correct status and class is determined and social insurance arrears are collected as required. This collection of arrears due in itself can impose a significant penalty on employers.</p>  <p>  Given the concerns expressed in this house and elsewhere regarding a perceived increase in the incidence of self-employment, the Department conducted a communications campaign covering radio, print and social media,  in relation to the issue of false self-employment during 2018 and will repeat this campaign again during 2019.</p>  <p>  The Department has also increased the number of  employer inspections in recent months with a specific focus on detecting cases of false/bogus self-employment.  Inspections are also undertaken jointly with other agencies including the Revenue Commissioners and Workplace Relations Commission.  Where evidence of non-compliance is detected, it is pursued.  </p>  <p>  Our increased level of inspections are resulting, in general, in a very low level of false or bogus self-employment.  This is in line with data published by the CSO which indicates that the share of employment accounted for by self-employment is falling while that accounted for by permanent full-time employment is increasing. It also accords with recent research on contingent employment published by the ESRI. </p>  <p>  Given the ongoing concerns, I have, nevertheless, set up a working group to review the Code of Practice for Determining Employment Status.  As part of the review, we will consider the feasibility of putting the Code on a legislative basis. I expect the group to report its findings in the first half of 2019.</p></reply>

It enables eligible people to pursue approved education courses and to continue to receive income support for the duration of a course of study, subject to meeting certain conditions.  There are currently 9,200 students being supported through BTEA in 2018.</p>  <p>  The BTEA is not intended to provide a basis for a long-duration participation in extended education.  In this regard, it mirrors the approach to general education grants such as the Student Universal Support Ireland (SUSI).  This approach is informed by research evidence. Evidence from econometric studies shows that the 'lock-in' effect of long duration return to education programmes can exceed the 'progression effect' and reduce employment prospects. </p>  <p>  In limited cases, post-graduate courses can be supported via BTEA, in particular in circumstances where a postgraduate qualification is a pre-requisite to take up employment.  For example, BTEA can be approved where the jobseeker intends to undertake studies leading to a Higher Diploma (H.Dip) in any discipline, the Professional Masters in Education or a Masters degree based solely on life experience where the applicant holds no other third level qualification. </p>  <p>  The qualification referred to by the Deputy, a Professional Masters in Adult and Community Education, is not one of the courses covered under the BTEA as it is not a pre-requisite for employment in adult education services nor, according to our information, does it serve as an alternative to the Professional Masters in Education required to qualify for a general teaching role.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The &lsquo;Roadmap for Pensions Reform 2018-2023', which I launched in February this year, details specific time-lined actions Government will take to reform our pension system.  This includes the introduction, from 2022, of an &lsquo;Automatic Enrolment&rsquo; retirement savings system, for those without personal retirement savings.  This project timeframe reflects the scale of such a programme and its importance as being the most fundamental reform of the Irish supplementary pension system in generations.</p>  <p>  A new &lsquo;Automatic Enrolment Programme Management Office&rsquo; within my Department has started the work required to establish the evidence base which will inform future Government decisions regarding the design of the system.  An Interdepartmental Programme Board has also been established to provide strategic direction to automatic enrolment. </p>  <p>  In August, I launched a national consultation process and a &lsquo;Strawman Proposal for Automatic Enrolment&rsquo;.  This is intended to help the Government in relation to the operational structure and design decisions that will need to be made.  The Strawman is a high level draft intended to generate and prompt discussion and improve ideas and should not, in any way, be construed as a confirmation of what form AE will ultimately take.</p>  <p>  More than 100 submissions were received by the 4th November closing date from employer and employee representative organisations, industry bodies, advocacy groups and interested individuals. My officials have met with many of these groups.  I also chaired a number of public consultation seminars held in Dublin, Galway and Cork.  </p>  <p>  In addition, officials have provided a dedicated briefing session for members of the Oireachtas and also attended a special meeting of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection to discuss Automatic Enrolment.   </p>  <p>  It is my intention that the Government will continue to engage with all interested parties throughout the design and development process to ensure that the first members would be enrolled in the new system in 2022. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This approach is expected to significantly benefit many people, particularly women, whose work history includes an extended period of time outside the paid workplace, while raising families or in a caring role. The TCA will ensure that the totality of a person&rsquo;s social insurance contributions - as opposed to the timing of them - determines their final pension outcome.  The HomeCaring Periods can be claimed for any year in which they occurred - they are not limited to years since 1994.</p>  <p>  People whose pensions were decided under the 2000-2012 ratebands were subject to a significantly more generous regime than those who qualified before or afterwards, as a Yearly Average of only 20 contributions per year (out of a maximum of 52) could attract a 98% pension.  The effect of those changes, as it impacted upon those new pensioners since 2012, will be familiar to anyone who followed the debate on this matter over the last 6 years.  </p>  <p>  If pre-2012 pensioners were also allowed avail of HomeCaring Credits, their arrangements, as a group, would continue to be significantly more generous than those of post-2012 pensioners.  There would also be a very significant cost which would be expected to be of the order of several hundred millions of euros each year.  This in turn could significantly impact funds for future pension increases with consequential implications for pensioner poverty.</p>  <p>  For those with insufficient contributions to meet the requirements for a State pension (contributory), they may qualify for a means tested State pension (non-contributory), the maximum personal rate for which is &euro;232 (over 95% of the maximum rate of the contributory pension).  This rate of payment does not include rent allowance, household benefits or fuel allowance.  Alternatively, if their spouse is a State pensioner and they have significant household means, their most beneficial payment may be an Increase for a Qualified Adult, based on their personal means, and amounting up to 90% of a full contributory pension.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Changes to guidance issued by the Pensions Authority require the trustees of a pension scheme to notify groups representing the interest of scheme members of proposals to issue a direction under section 50 of the Pensions Act to restructure scheme benefits.

Social welfare legislation provides that the yearly value of property (not including the family home) is assessable for means testing purposes by way of a formula set out in the legislation.  In this regard, for most social assistance schemes, the first &euro;20,000 of capital is fully disregarded; the next &euro;10,000 assessed at &euro;1 per thousand, the next &euro;10,000 is assessed at &euro;2 per thousand, with the remainder assessed at &euro;4 per thousand.  The disability allowance means test disregards the first &euro;50,000 of capital.</p>  <p>  The capital assessment formula is not designed to reflect interest or annuity rates available to investors and no account is taken of interest or dividend payments received in the means assessment.

Although the system change has worked effectively for over 80% of IB customers, significant difficulties arose following implementation for a number of customers. </p>  <p>  My Department took three main steps to resolve the issues impacting on payments.  First, deployed additional staff to process works and respond to the customer enquiries.

Third, continue to review the design rules in the system to afford greater flexibility in processing of claims and certificates.</p>  <p>  Payment levels are now maintained at the expected norm, (over 50,000 customers paid each week) for the past two months.  People who are due a payment and whose certificates and claims are in order now receive their payment entitlement promptly.

Also, additional disregards for claimants with children were introduced with &euro;254 of income per annum disregarded for each of the first two children and &euro;381 for third and subsequent children.</p>  <p>  It may also be noted that farm assist customers continue to receive more beneficial treatment than other self-employed persons as payments received under the Agri-Environment Options Scheme (AEOS), Green Low-Carbon Agri-Environment Scheme (GLAS) or Special Area of Conservation (SAC) schemes are assessed separately from other farm income.  With regard to this income, the first &euro;2,540 is disregarded, and then 50% of the balance and related expenses are disregarded.</p>  <p>  A person may qualify for jobseeker's allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  Where self-employed people satisfy the appropriate means test and any other specific qualifying conditions, they may be eligible for jobseeker's allowance in the same manner as employees.  </p>  <p>  In assessing means from self-employment, income from the previous twelve months is used as an indicator of likely future earnings.  Given the variety of self-employment situations, the means assessment procedures are applied in a flexible manner to ensure that any circumstances that would be likely to lead to a significant variation, either upward or downward, in the level of a person&rsquo;s income from one year to the next are taken into consideration. </p>  <p>  People who were previously self-employed and are now in receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance have access to the full range of activation measures and supports available to other jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance recipients.  This includes referral to group information sessions, one to one interviews and subsequent case officer support.  It also includes access to training, temporary employment, work-experience and recruitment subsidy programmes.  Further, it should also be noted that Budget 2019 announced an extension of Jobseekers Benefit to the self-employed.  This is expected to be introduced towards the end of 2019.</p>  <p>  Any changes to the assessment of self-employment income for jobseeker's allowance and farm assist would have to be considered in the overall policy and budgetary context.  </p></reply>

The importance of maintaining the CTA was acknowledged in Prime Minister May&rsquo;s letter of 29 March 2017 triggering Article 50 of the Treaty of the European Union, the Joint EU / UK Progress report agreed at the European Council on 15 December 2017, and is provided for in the Draft Agreement on the withdrawal of the UK as endorsed by EU leaders on 25 November 2018. </p>  <p>  I met with the then UK Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, the Right Honourable Esther McVey, on 23 April 2018.

I introduced in Budget 2019 a &euro;5 increase for all Jobseekers including younger jobseekers which will come into effect during March. </p>  <p>  Reduced rates of Jobseekers do not apply to those aged 18-24 years who were in the care of TUSLA during the 12 months before they reached 18 and I am extending this to those reaching 25 years of age in the current social welfare bill.</p>  <p>  The Youth Employment Support Scheme (YESS) which I launched in September this year is a new work experience scheme targeted exclusively at young jobseekers.  All participants will receive a payment of &euro;229.20 per week.  Participants whose underlying entitlement is in excess of that amount will continue to receive their weekly payment with an additional top-up allowance of &euro;22.50 per week.</p>  <p>  The policies implemented have been effective in reducing youth and long-term unemployment.  The latest monthly unemployment figures report that the unemployment rate for persons aged 15-24 years was 12.3% which is a significant decrease of 4 percentage points, from 16.3% in November 2016. </p>  <p>  Any such changes could only be considered in a budgetary context.</p></reply>

Communities benefit from the skills and talents of local farmers and fishermen and participants have the opportunity to improve existing skills, or develop new skills, while performing this valuable work in their local communities.</p>  <p>  Since 1st February 2017, a 6 year overall participation limit on the work scheme applies.  It should be noted that almost 50% of participants were on the RSS for over 10 years.  As a result, opportunities for new people to go on the scheme were very limited.  It was in this context that a maximum six year participation limit on the scheme was introduced for participants commencing on or after 1st February 2017.  </p>  <p>  RSS participants who commenced on the scheme prior to 1st February 2017 will remain on the scheme, as long as they continue to remain eligible for the scheme.  The six year limit ensures that there will be a throughput of places available.  In addition income support continues to be available to eligible farmers and fishermen who are not on RSS in the form of Farm or Fish Assist.</p>  <p>  As the RSS is a supplementary income support scheme designed specifically for those whose income falls below a certain limit, an individual must continue  to satisfy the qualifying criteria for the scheme to be eligible to participate on the RSS.</p>  <p>  If a participant&rsquo;s circumstances change, a means test is undertaken to determine their new rate of payment.  The means assessment for RSS includes income that the participant and their spouse, civil partner or cohabitant has in addition to any capital or property (except their own home).  Payment of RSS is not taken into account when assessing the weekly means.  If changes were made to the conditions to allow all participants receive the full rate of payment regardless of their means, it would in effect change the nature of the scheme of supporting farmers and farm families with low incomes. </p>  <p>  The rate paid to a participant on the RSS is equivalent to the participants underlying social welfare payment plus a top-up of &euro;22.50 subject to a minimum payment of &euro;220.50.  RSS participants in receipt of a widow&rsquo;s pension or disability allowance retain their payment and also receive a top-up payment which will bring the minimum weekly payment equal to &euro;220.50. </p>  <p>  As part of the recent Social Welfare Budget package for 2019, I increased the weekly personal rate for participants by &euro;5.00 with proportionate increases in weekly payments for qualified adult dependants with effect from March 2019.</p>  <p>  If the Deputy has a particular case in mind that warrants a means review, the details should be forwarded to my Department along with supporting documentary evidence.  A further review will then be undertaken by my officials.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

It is intended that these measures will act to support existing provisions in the Pensions Act by providing for further protection for scheme members&rsquo; benefits and enhancing employer responsibilities for their schemes.  </p>  <p>  In July 2018, Government approval was obtained to draft additional provisions to be included in the Bill at Committee Stage including provisions relating to defined benefit schemes. </p>  <p>  In developing these provisions, it is essential to recognise the current pension landscape in Ireland so that a balanced, proportionate approach is developed and that unintended negative consequences do not arise. </p>  <p>  Under existing pensions law, there is no legislative obligation on the employer to make contributions to a scheme.  However, the provisions of this Bill will introduce a new regime into the Pensions Act 1990 which, amongst other things, will ensure that an employer cannot &ldquo;walk away&rdquo; at short notice from the pension scheme it is supporting by providing a 12 month notification, and will enable the Pensions Authority to make a funding obligation direction specifying payments to be made by a sponsoring employer to the pension scheme where no agreement is reached, within a specified time period, to resolve a funding deficit. </p>  <p>  The defined benefit pension provisions are very technical and involve complex policy issues.  In order to achieve a resilient solution it has been necessary to consult with and obtain numerous legal advices from the Office of the Attorney General on various aspects of this policy.  When these matters have been resolved and amendments approved by Government, an early date for Committee Stage will be requested. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

In this context, it should be noted that some cases of debt may have to be written off after a period of time if the estate proves to be insolvent. Similarly, in some cases, settlement of a lesser amount that the sum assessed as having been overpaid may be deemed to be the most effective course of action to take to secure partial recovery of any sum overpaid.  </p><p><b>Number and value of debts raised in Estate cases 2015-2018 and balance outstanding at end October 2018</b><table><tr><th>Year overpayment raised </th><th>No. of cases raised </th><th>Value raised</th><th>Balance outstanding as at end October 2018</th><th>Original value of debt settled</th></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>494</td><td>&euro;18,535,506</td><td>&euro;916,336</td><td>95%</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>649</td><td>&euro;20,525,410</td><td>&euro;1,498,347</td><td>93%</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>517</td><td>&euro;14,429,628</td><td>&euro;1,131,583</td><td>92%</td></tr><tr><td>2018 (to end October)</td><td>493</td><td>&euro;11,534,738</td><td>&euro;3,724,918</td><td>68%</td></tr></table></p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.  </p></reply>

The expected take up and costs for this scheme are reliant on the labour market as it evolves and the overall performance of the economy. </p>  <p>  It is estimated that some 1,000 could benefit from the scheme in 2019 and approximately 6,500 could benefit at any point in time in a full year.  It is intended that the scheme will be introduced in November 2019 with an estimated cost of approximately &euro;2 million.

The Department is committed, under Pathways to Work, to incentivise the take-up of activation opportunities, including implementing sanctions for failure to engage. </p>  <p>  The legislation underpinning the application of penalty rates is provided for in the Social Welfare Act, 2010.  Penalty rates can only be applied in specific circumstances and the decision to impose a penalty can only be made by a Deciding Officer of my Department.  Contracted providers cannot and do not apply penalty rates.  There has been no change in policy, or the implementation of penalty rate provisions in this respect.  Penalty rates are only applied as a last resort.  If dissatisfied with that decision it is open to the Jobseeker to appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office. </p>  <p>  The introduction of the JobPath service in mid-2015 has complemented my Department&rsquo;s existing activation services and has facilitated a very significant increase in the numbers of Jobseekers to whom activation services can be provided.  To date approximately 199,000 Jobseekers have engaged with the JobPath programme.  The increases in the numbers of penalty rates applied each year relates to the overall numbers of jobseekers brought into activation.  </p>  <p>  Significantly, of those jobseekers who are in activation at any given time, either within my Department's Intreo service, or the contracted services of JobPath and the LES, only approximately 1% have a penalty rate at any given time.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the deputy. </p></reply>

It is intended that these measures will act to support existing provisions in the Pensions Act by providing for further protection for scheme members&rsquo; benefits and enhancing employer responsibilities for their schemes.  </p>  <p>  In July 2018, Government approval was obtained to draft additional provisions to be included in the Bill at Committee Stage including provisions relating to defined benefit schemes. </p>  <p>  In developing these provisions, it is essential to recognise the current pension landscape in Ireland so that a balanced, proportionate approach is developed and that unintended negative consequences do not arise. </p>  <p>  Under existing pensions law, there is no legislative obligation on the employer to make contributions to a scheme.  However, the provisions of this Bill will introduce a new regime into the Pensions Act 1990 which, amongst other things, will ensure that an employer cannot &ldquo;walk away&rdquo; at short notice from the pension scheme it is supporting by providing a 12 month notification, and will enable the Pensions Authority to make a funding obligation direction specifying payments to be made by a sponsoring employer to the pension scheme where no agreement is reached, within a specified time period, to resolve a funding deficit. </p>  <p>  The defined benefit pension provisions are very technical and involve complex policy issues.  In order to achieve a resilient solution it has been necessary to consult with and obtain numerous legal advices from the Office of the Attorney General on various aspects of this policy.  When these matters have been resolved and amendments approved by Government, an early date for Committee Stage will be requested. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This engagement involves the identification of key strategic, operational and policy issues arising from Brexit.</p>  <p>  As I have outlined previously, the UK's decision to leave the EU does not of itself give rise to additional border control requirements.  Furthermore, the avoidance of a hard border on the island is fundamental to the Brexit agreement reached last month between the EU and the UK Government, and there can be no change to the commitments made in that agreement.  As such, there are no plans for a new Army barracks in counties Cavan and Monaghan or the greater Border region.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore, it is important to note that primary responsibility for the internal security of the State rests with the Minister for Justice and Equality and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Accordingly, responsibility for the security aspect of border control rests with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, while the Revenue Commissioners also have responsibilities relating to their particular mandate.</p>  <p>  Among the roles assigned to the Defence Forces in the White Paper on Defence is the provision of Aid to the Civil Power which, in practice, means to provide assistance and support to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when requested to do so.  The Defence Forces also provide support to the Revenue Commissioners, again, when requested to do so. </p>  <p>  There is ongoing close liaison between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces regarding security matters and regular coordination and liaison meetings take place. My Department continues to monitor the ongoing situation to ensure that both it and the Defence Forces are fully prepared to address any potential issues that might arise in the defence area as a consequence of Brexit.</p></reply>

Some examples of these campaigns have included the Online Passport Renewals Service and a &lsquo;Citizens Dialogue on the Future of Europe&rsquo; initiative.  A public information campaign to promote awareness of Government-wide supports and resources that are available to assist with Brexit preparedness is also currently being coordinated by my Department.</p><p>Details of relevant advertising campaigns carried out in 2018 are as follows:<i>2018</i></p><p>Online Passport Renewals Service</p><p>In 2018 we have concentrated on highlighting the Online Passport Renewal Service as a fast and secure way for adults to renew their passports.  Specific activities have included advertisements in local publications throughout the country and on social media platforms, press releases and attendance at relevant promotional events, as well as participation by the Director of the Passport Service in over 25 interviews on regional radio stations.  The direct costs of advertising to raise public awareness in this regard are set out in Table 1 below.</p><p>Citizens Dialogue on the Future of Europe </p><p>Against the background of debate which is underway at EU level and beyond about how best to address the challenges of a rapidly changing the world, and in cooperation with European Movement Ireland, my Department hosted a series of &lsquo;Citizens Dialogue on the Future of Europe&rsquo; events throughout spring 2018.  These events took place in Galway, Cork, Donegal, Kildare, Meath and Dublin and enabled citizens to share ideas and priorities on the future of Europe and on such themes as the economy, security, social responsibility and globalisation.</p><p>To raise awareness of these opportunities for citizens to engage with and attend these events, my Department undertook a communications campaign that included advertisements in local papers and on local radio in each of the locations concerned.  The direct costs of this advertising are set out in Table 1 below.</p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s Campaign for Election to the UN Security Council </p><p>On July 2<sup>nd</sup>2018, the Taoiseach and I publicly launched Ireland&rsquo;s campaign to secure a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council in June 2020 for the 2021-2022 term. Ireland&rsquo;s campaign is premised on three themes: Empathy, Partnership and Independence.  To coincide with this launch, my Department used social media platforms to promote public awareness of Ireland&rsquo;s campaign online and the direct costs incurred in this regard are set out in Table 1 below.</p><p>Public Consultations on International Development Policy</p><p>A public consultation process in relation to Ireland&rsquo;s new international development policy took place in 5 locations around the country over the period July &ndash; October 2018.  The goal of the process was to hear the views of the public on how Ireland&rsquo;s international development policy can contribute towards meeting the ambitious objectives of such initiatives as the 2030 Agenda Sustainable Development Goals agreed by the United Nations in 2015.  To raise awareness of these opportunities for the citizens to engage and attend these events, my Department undertook a communications campaign that included advertisements in local papers.  The direct costs of this advertising are set out in Table 1 below.</p><p>Government Brexit Update and &lsquo;Getting Ireland Brexit Ready&rsquo;</p><p>The Government Brexit Update email service and the Getting Ireland Brexit Ready public information campaign forms part of the Government&rsquo;s overall strategy to keep the Irish public fully informed and up-to date on the implications and challenges of Brexit. </p><p>The Update is issuing on a regular basis via a commercial provider (MailChimp) and provides information on latest developments in the ongoing Brexit negotiations, on the latest available research publications and on engagement at Government level.  It also highlights the range of business supports that are available through the various Government Departments and State agencies. </p><p>My Department is also coordinating a Government-wide &lsquo;Getting Ireland Brexit Ready Campaign&rsquo; which I and Ministers Humphreys and Creed launched together on 20 September.  This campaign has updated citizens, communities and businesses about Brexit preparedness and support measures that are available as well as public workshop events which were held over successive weeks throughout October and the last two weeks in November.  A programme of awareness raising via web and social media platforms and radio and print media advertising also took place.  </p><p>Table 1: Online Advertising and Public Awareness Campaigns Expenditure 2018<table><tr><th>Campaign / Theme</th><th>Supplier</th><th>Cost to date</th></tr><tr><td>Online Passport Renewals<br /><br />(March 2018-June 2018)</td><td>Mediavest</td><td>&euro;40,538.65</td></tr><tr><td>Citizens&rsquo; Dialogue on the Future of Europe -<br /><br />(Feb - May 2018)</td><td>Topic Media, Celtic, Media, Highland Radio, Connacht Tribune, River Media, Irish Examiner, LMFM Radio &amp;amp; Galway Advertiser</td><td>&euro;6,473</td></tr><tr><td>UN Security Council Campaign<br /><br />July 2018</td><td>Twitter and Facebook</td><td>&euro;461</td></tr><tr><td>Government Brexit Update <br /><br />(Jan 2018 &ndash; to date)</td><td>Twitter and MailChimp</td><td>&euro;1,351.69</td></tr><tr><td>Getting Ireland Brexit Ready <br /><br />(20 Sept 2018 &ndash; to date)</td><td>PhD Media / TBWA</td><td>37,729.75</td></tr><tr><td>Transforming Our World public consultations </td><td>Mediavest &amp;amp; Vermillion Design</td><td>&euro;6,653.53</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Results in the appraisal process have been released to candidates, along with information on the appeals process.  There are a number of remaining stages, as follows: security vetting; in certain cases, the verification of language levels; and, the training of the new roster members.  It is expected that the new roster will be established in January 2019.</p>  <p>  The process required an initial eligibility check of the 395 applications which were received by the application deadline.  Of these applications, 377 were deemed to have met the essential requirements listed in the Volunteer Information Booklet. </p>  <p>  The 377 applications went to stage 2 assessment, and were marked on the basis of the five competencies contained in the application form.  These were: Leadership and Team Work; Analysis and Decision-Making; Building Relationships and Communication Skills; Drive and Commitment; and, Knowledge and Expertise in the Area of Election Observation.</p>  <p>  Candidates were required to provide at least one relevant example under each competency, which demonstrated that the candidate would be suitable for membership of the roster.  The Election Observer Competency Framework attached to the application form provided guidance on the qualities the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade would expect to see in an international election observer.  The competencies and qualities were based on the Declaration of Principles for International Election Observation and associated Code of Conduct for International Election Observers, and also the roles and duties of EU and OSCE short and long term observers.</p>  <p>  Applications were assessed by a number of panels.  Panel members were provided with training in shortlisting best practice and in avoiding unconscious bias.  The marking process was calibrated by an independent external quality assurance service, ensuring cross-panel consistency in the marking approach. </p>  <p>  The process was run in accordance with the core principles contained in the Volunteer Information Booklet: probity; merit; best practice; fairness and consistency; and openness, accountability and transparency.  An appeals panel is available to meet in January if needed.  Should that need arise, the appeals process will be run in accordance with the same core principles.</p>  <p>  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade received a large number of very high quality applications.  As the total number of applications (395) almost twice exceeded the number of roster places, I regret that many of those who applied were not successful.  Among those disappointed are people who had previously been on the roster and, also, people who have served in elected office. </p>  <p>  I would like to thank all those who applied for the new roster.  The intense competition for places will ensure that the quality of Irish election observers will remain high.  I would also like to thank outgoing roster members for their contribution to the promotion of democracy, human rights and the rule of law.</p></reply>

This engagement involves the identification of key strategic, operational and policy issues arising from Brexit.</p>  <p>  As I have outlined previously, the UK's decision to leave the EU does not of itself give rise to additional border control requirements.  Furthermore, the avoidance of a hard border on the island is fundamental to the Brexit agreement reached last month between the EU and the UK Government, and there can be no change to the commitments made in that agreement.  As such, there are no plans for a new Army barracks in counties Cavan and Monaghan or the greater Border region.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore, it is important to note that primary responsibility for the internal security of the State rests with the Minister for Justice and Equality and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Accordingly, responsibility for the security aspect of border control rests with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, while the Revenue Commissioners also have responsibilities relating to their particular mandate.</p>  <p>  Among the roles assigned to the Defence Forces in the White Paper on Defence is the provision of Aid to the Civil Power which, in practice, means to provide assistance and support to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when requested to do so.  The Defence Forces also provide support to the Revenue Commissioners, again, when requested to do so. </p>  <p>  There is ongoing close liaison between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces regarding security matters and regular coordination and liaison meetings take place. My Department continues to monitor the ongoing situation to ensure that both it and the Defence Forces are fully prepared to address any potential issues that might arise in the defence area as a consequence of Brexit.</p></reply>

This encompassed two General Service recruit competitions, a Cadet competition, apprentice competition, instrumentalist competition and direct entry streams. </p><p>The most recent figures (as of 30 November 2018), provided by the military authorities, give the whole time equivalent strength of the PDF as 9,022 personnel.  Final figures for numbers inducted in 2018 and strength will not be available until year end. I recently met with senior civil and military officials to review recruitment plans for 2019.  Subject to further consideration, it is envisaged that similar recruitment competitions to those held this year will take place in 2019. </p><p>As of 18 December 2018, 610 personnel were inducted to the PDF as follows:</p><p>-  492 General Service Recruits (32 female)</p><p>-  20 Air Corps Apprentices</p><p>-  19 (7 female) School of Music Instrumentalists </p><p>-  73 Cadets (11 Female)</p><p>-  6 Direct Entry Officers</p><p>The White Paper on Defence provides for a combined establishment of 4,169 personnel for the Army Reserve and Naval Service Reserve (this is inclusive of the proposal to increase the Naval Service Reserve establishment from 200 to 300 personnel).  The current establishment of the Reserve Defence Force (RDF) is 4,069.</p><p>Given the competing recruitment demands at present, where PDF recruitment is and should remain a priority, recruitment to the RDF is continuing.  A total of 128 new recruits (14 female) were inducted into the RDF in 2018 (as of 18 December 2018).  It is intended to have a further recruitment campaign to the RDF in 2019, although the details have yet to be finalised.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-12-19a.207.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018121900065#WRD01000"><p>As Minister for Finance, I am responsible for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation.  Neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  These are considered by insurance companies on a case-by-case basis.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  Consequently, I am not in a position to direct insurance providers as to the pricing level which should apply in relation to specific categories of drivers.</p><p>I understand that motor insurers use a combination of rating factors in making their individual decisions on whether to offer cover and what terms to apply.  Factors include those such as the type of vehicle, how the vehicle is used and the relevant driving experience, as well as the age of the driver, the age of the vehicle, the claims record, and the number of drivers.  Insurers do not all use the same combination of rating factors, and as a result prices vary across the market.  In addition, insurance companies also price in accordance with their own past claims experience. </p><p>In the case of taxi drivers, I understand that insurers take into account the nature of the taxi business, which involves driving for hire or reward extensively and in their view this has a much higher risk of injury claims from passengers and other road-users as a result. </p><p>My officials were unable to source appropriate data to facilitate a reliable comparison between the costs of motor insurance for taxis here compared to that for taxis in other EU countries.  However, it is not clear how useful such information would be as it will never be possible to make direct like-for-like comparison with most other EU Member States because of differences in areas such as legal systems and claims environments. </p><p>One area, however, which is relevant to the cost of insurance where a comparative exercise has been carried out is in relation to award levels.  In this regard, the Personal Injuries Commission (PIC) has recently completed its second and final report which indicated that soft tissue (whiplash) injury award levels in this jurisdiction run at a multiple of 4.4 times to that of the UK.  This significantly higher level of awards is undoubtedly a contributory factor to why the cost of insurance in this State is high.  The PIC has recommended that the Judicial Council when established should compile guidelines to take account of, amongst other things, its benchmarking exercise and it is hoped that when this is implemented it should have a positive impact on pricing. </p><p>In addition you should note that the Cost of Insurance Working Group will continue to focus on putting into place the measures proposed in its <i>Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance</i>.  It is envisaged that the implementation of all the recommendations cumulatively, with the appropriate levels of commitment and cooperation from all relevant stakeholders, should achieve the objectives of delivering fairer premiums for consumers and attracting potential new entrants to the market.  In this regard, I have been informed by my officials that Insurance Ireland has stated that there has been some increase in market capacity in relation to the provision of motor insurance for taxi drivers recently. </p><p>Finally, it should be noted that the most recent Central Statistics Office data (for November 2018) indicates that private motor insurance premiums have decreased by 22.7% since peaking in July 2016.  While the CSO statistics indicate a greater degree of stability on an overall basis, these figures represent a broad average and therefore it is appreciated that many people may still be seeing increases.  However, it is hoped that the improved stability in pricing will be maintained and that motor insurance premiums should continue to fall from the very high levels of mid-2016. </p></reply>

The modernisation programme will bring improved accuracy and transparency for all stakeholders, including employers, employees and Revenue, while also significantly streamlining the entire administration process. </p><p>Since October 2016, when the then Minister for Finance launched the project, Revenue has worked extensively with all relevant stakeholders in a co-design approach, to ensure the new PAYE Modernisation reporting system reduces the administrative burden on employers to the greatest extent possible.  For example, one of Revenue&rsquo;s key design principles is that employer reporting should be seamlessly integrated into the business&rsquo; payroll process.  This will minimise the administrative burden on employers and allow their reporting obligations to Revenue to become a by-product of their payroll operation.  In addition, the project will lead to the abolition of the current employer reporting obligations via P30, P35, P45, P46 and P60 forms.  Revenue has advised me that employers have welcomed the abolition of these forms and the consequential reduction in the administrative burden. </p><p>All employers are currently obliged to calculate and make the correct statutory deductions from their employees&rsquo; salary payments each time they pay.  A significant number of employers, including small businesses, use payroll software to run their payroll and that will still be the case when PAYE Modernisation goes live on 1 January 2019.  I am aware that Revenue has engaged extensively with the payroll software industry to ensure, as far as possible, that the necessary changes to their systems will be ready on time.  Consequently, the processes for these employers before and after 1 January 2019 will be broadly similar.</p><p>For employers who do not use payroll software, Revenue is providing an easy-to-use process within the Revenue Online Service (ROS) to capture payroll data for each employee.  The process includes data screens that the employer will be obliged to complete for each employee every time a pay-run is completed (normally weekly, fortnightly or monthly).  The burden associated with this work will be offset to an extent by the abolition of the previously mentioned forms that operate under the current system.  In addition, the data required is in line with what employers are currently required to provide on an employee&rsquo;s payslip under employment law.  Also, it is also very important to note that there is no change to current PAYE payment dates under the Modernisation programme.</p><p>I know that Revenue is very conscious that some employers may experience difficulties in the early phases of PAYE Modernisation and has assured me that it will make every effort to assist where required.  For example, the Revenue Employer Helpdesk, which can be contacted at telephone number 01-7383638, will have significant additional resources available to meet customer demand and will operate for extended hours during the transitional period.  The details of the extended opening hours are set out at  <i>www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/ebrief/2018/no-2042018.aspx</i></p><p>Revenue has also confirmed that officials will be available to visit employers to assist with the transition should the need arise.  I am aware that Revenue has already carried out almost 80,000 customer service visits and phone calls to employers to support them in their preparation for PAYE Modernisation.  Revenue has also assured me that it is not the intention to impose sanctions such as interest and penalties during the early transitional months where employers do their best to comply.  However, Revenue always reserves the right to impose sanctions where there is clear non-engagement with the law. </p><p>Finally, while it is a matter for each employer to consider the impact that PAYE Modernisation will have on payroll arrangements and to put steps in place to ensure compliance with the new requirements, I would strongly encourage that they pro-actively engage with the changeover. I would particularly recommend that they review the very detailed PAYE Modernisation material that is available on the Revenue website at <i>www.revenue.ie/pmod174</i>or the recently published <i>Employer&rsquo;s Guide to PAYE</i>at <i>www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/ebrief/2018/no-2102018.aspx.</i>The new Guide is a comprehensive manual, effective from 1 January 2019, covering all aspects of employer&rsquo;s obligations relating to the operation of PAYE and the new reporting requirements.</p></reply>

Performance testing is well advanced and I am assured by Revenue that based on the work completed to date they are confident that the various IT systems will support the expected additional work load arising from Brexit, ensuring customs processes can continue to operate effectively and efficiently upon the UK&rsquo;s departure.</p>  <p>  Allied to this upgrading of IT systems, I am advised by Revenue that it continues to highlight the range of authorisations and simplifications provided for within the Union Customs Code (UCC) to trade.  Such authorisations and simplifications facilitate legitimate trade to operate in the most efficient way possible.  I am aware that Revenue is meeting with trade and business representative groups and attending industry seminars to discuss the supply chain challenges that can arise for business from Brexit and how the authorisations or simplifications available under the UCC could potentially contribute to meeting those challenges. </p>  <p>  Comprehensive information and assistance on customs processes is available on the Revenue website.  In addition to this, Revenue is supporting businesses that trade with the UK in their preparations for Brexit and a number of trader engagement seminars were held in Dublin and Cork during December 2018.  Additional seminars will take place in January and February 2019 in locations countrywide. Contingency planning to accelerate this engagement with and support for business in a 'no deal ' scenario is underway. </p>  <p>  Revenue have determined that they will require an additional 600 staff for Brexit and are planning to recruit 270 of these in 2019.  Revenue&rsquo;s plans are well advanced to have a total of 200 additional staff, across a number of functions, trained and in place by 29 March 2019.  In addition, Revenue is considering the various measures that may need to deployed should additional staff be required in a no-deal scenario.  Such measures would include an acceleration of interdepartmental and open recruitment, and the redeployment of existing staff on an interim basis. </p></reply>

As the Deputy may be aware, tax relief in respect of rent paid, was abolished for new applicants in Budget 2011.  This followed a recommendation in the 2009 report by the Commission on Taxation that rent relief should be discontinued.  The view of this independent commission was that, in the same manner in which mortgage interest relief increases the cost of housing, rent relief increases the cost of private rented accommodation.  Furthermore, I must be mindful of the public finances and the many demands on the Exchequer.  Tax reliefs, no matter how worthwhile in themselves, reduce the tax base and make general reform of the tax system that much more difficult. </p><p>While there is no specific provision for tax relief in relation to the living costs associated with attending college, the rent-a-room scheme supports the accommodation need of third level students and others by providing significant levels of relief to the providers of accommodation within their own home to persons on both a seven day a week and &quot;digs&quot; basis.</p><p>In addition, section 473A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides for tax relief at the standard rate of income tax (20%) in respect of qualifying fees paid by an individual for a third level education course, subject to the terms and conditions set out in that section.  Qualifying fees mean tuition fees in respect of an approved course at an approved college, reduced by the amount of the &quot;student contribution&quot; which, in the case of a full-time course, is currently &euro;3,000.  Full details of the relief, including the terms and conditions that apply, are set out on the Revenue website at <i>www.revenue.ie/en/personal-tax-credits-reliefs-and-exemptions/education/tuition-fees-paid-for-third-level-education/index.aspx.</i></p><p>Finally, as with all such reliefs, my Department regularly reviews tax expenditure measures.  Proposals for change are dealt with in the context of the annual Budget and Finance Bill process.</p></reply>

I have therefore consulted with the Central Bank on the matters raised by the Deputy.</p><p>Latent defect insurance is a form of insurance taken out in respect of specific new-build premises to provide cover in the event of an inherent defect in the design, workmanship or materials becoming apparent after practical completion.  It is commonly sold to developers when constructing housing developments and is generally valid for an extended period of time after completion, typically ten years.  The Central Bank has advised me that the prudential returns of insurers do not provide a breakdown of information at this product level, and therefore it is not possible to ascertain the number of companies providing latent defects insurance in Ireland.</p><p>In relation to number of actual properties covered by the 1,595 latent defect and structural warranty insurance policies sold by Alpha, the Central Bank has informed me that the exact breakdown of properties covered by the policies is not currently known.  The Central Bank continues to work closely with the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority (DFSA) and the insolvency administrator in respect of Alpha Insurance DAC (Alpha). </p><p>The Central Bank has advised that the claims handler (BCR Legal Group Limited) confirmed in September that it had written to the developers who had purchased these latent defects policies.  The Bank also indicated that BCR were due to write to all homeowners affected by the liquidation of Alpha by the end of September 2018. </p><p>The Danish Guarantee Fund continues to provide country-specific updates of the latent defects policies on <i>.</i></p><p>The Central Bank of Ireland has also published information in relation to Alpha, which it will update if further information becomes available.</p></reply>

This success has been underpinned by various periodic relevant changes in the legislative landscape that have made Ireland an attractive domicile for promoters in Asia, across Europe, the U.S., and further afield.  This success has also benefitted from the fact that we have a regulatory regime which provides a robust and consistent approach to the supervision that promotes confidence in Ireland as a location for investment funds. </p>  <p>  Due to changes in the global private equity market in both structure and relevant European legislation, it has been decided that there is a case to update the Investment Limited Partnership Act 1994.  The IFS2020 Action Plan commits to updating the Investment Limited Partnership Act 1994 so as to make the structure more attractive to fund managers. </p>  <p>  My Department sought and obtained approval from the Government for the preparation of the necessary "Heads" for legislation in 2017.

However it is important to note that this surplus has yet to fully crystallise. Its realisation depends on the success of NAMA's ongoing deleveraging, its Dublin Docklands SDZ programme and residential funding programme.  These activities must be completed for the expected surplus to be earned.</p>  <p>  In 2014, the NAMA Board approved an Entity Return on Investment (&lsquo;EROI&rsquo;) target benchmark of 20%. The projected return as at end-2017 was 35%. The EROI benchmark is calculated based on the comparison of NAMA&rsquo;s projected terminal surplus position with NAMA&rsquo;s initial investment, as adjusted to exclude the &euro;5.6 billion in State Aid which NAMA was required to pay to the Participating Institutions as part of the loan acquisition price.</p>  <p>  As per section 60(2) of the NAMA Act 2009, NAMA may use surplus funds to redeem and cancel its senior and subordinated debt. Surplus funds may only be returned to the Exchequer once NAMA's debt has been redeemed in full in 2020.</p>  <p>  Any NAMA surplus paid, while Exchequer positive, will not impact the general government balance, in line with EUROSTAT rules. It will be a decision for the Government as to how any surplus returned by NAMA will be utilised within the framework of the fiscal rules. However, the intention has always been to use such receipts from the resolution of the financial sector crisis to pay down our national debt and reduce our debt servicing costs.</p></reply>

As the Deputy will be aware, it is a voluntary code. </p><p>That said, the enactment of the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) 2015 means that the protections which a borrower had before a loan was sold were not lost on the sale. Credit servicing firms are now regulated entities and are required as a matter of law to comply with the Central Bank Codes.  </p><p>Of particular relevance, is paragraph 3.11 of the Consumer Protection Code which provides:</p><p>&quot;Where a regulated entity intends to cease operating, merge with another, or to transfer all or part of its regulated activities to another regulated entity it must:</p><p>a) notify the Central Bank immediately;</p><p>b) provide at least two months' notice to affected consumers to enable them to make alternative arrangements;</p><p>c) ensure all outstanding business is properly completed prior to the transfer, merger or cessation of operations or, alternatively in the case of a transfer or merger, inform the consumer of how continuity of service will be provided following the transfer or merger; and</p><p>d) in the case of a merger or transfer of regulated activities, inform the consumer that their details are being transferred to the other regulated entity, if that is the case.&quot;</p><p>Therefore, consumers are fully protected and I have no plans to put this Code on a statutory basis at present. </p></reply>

VAT is a tax on the value added to a supply, and the collection and recovery of VAT takes place at each stage of the chain of supply from manufacturing to retailer.  Under EU and domestic VAT rules, traders who are registered for VAT collect VAT on the goods and services that they sell.  In turn such traders are entitled to recover the VAT they incur on their business inputs used in the purchase or production of goods or delivery of services.  Consequently, if there is a decrease in value at any stage in the process the trader is entitled to a refund of the excess of VAT incurred over that collected.  </p>  <p>  In this case, where a retailer is in a situation of net VAT gain as a result of below cost selling, this is not a loss to the Exchequer or an additional benefit to the retailer, it is merely how VAT is charged. </p></reply>

There is no exemption or relief from USC and PRSI is payable where the individual is not liable to social insurance contributions in the home country. </p><p>The 2016 annual Revenue report on SARP shows that for the years 2012 to 2016 (the most recent year for which data are available) the annual cost of the measure was as follows: <table><tr><th>Tax Cost 2012 </th><th>Tax Cost 2013 </th><th>Tax Cost 2014 </th><th>Tax Cost 2015 </th><th>Tax Cost 2016 </th></tr><tr><td>&euro;0.1 million</td><td>&euro;1.9 million</td><td>&euro;5.9 million</td><td>&euro;9.5 million</td><td>&euro;18.1 million</td></tr></table></p><p>Regarding the Deputy's question as to the number of companies that have availed of the scheme in each of these years by multinational companies and SME companies, Revenue have advised me that a breakdown of company types, whether SME or multinationals, is not available.

I am advised by Revenue that details of the costs and numbers availing of this programme will only be available once the relevant employer tax returns for 2018 have been received and processed. The first KEEP return is due on 31 March 2019. </p>  <p>  Regarding the Deputy's question as to the breakdown of the number of companies by multinational and SME sector, it should be noted that a company whose shares are the subject of KEEP share options must, at the date of grant, be a micro, small or medium-sized enterprise. In practical terms, this refers to companies which employ fewer than 250 persons, and which have an annual turnover not exceeding &euro;50 million or an annual balance sheet total not exceeding &euro;43 million.</p>  <p>  Over the past year, I have become aware that take-up has been less than expected and I took early action in relation to KEEP in the context of Finance Bill 2018.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, Finance Bill 2018 provided for a number of changes to the incentive as follows:</p>  <p>  -  the maximum annual market value of share options that may be granted to a qualifying employee has increased to equal to 100% of annual emoluments in the year of assessment (from 50% of annual emoluments);</p>  <p>  -  the overall value of options that may be awarded per employee has increased from the limit of &euro;250,000 in any 3 year period to a lifetime limit of &euro;300,000. </p>  <p>  The &euro;3,000,000 overall KEEP limit remains for companies and employees are not restricted in entering into future KEEP arrangements with future employers. </p>  <p>  I expect that these changes will help support SMEs to compete for skilled staff.  However, my Department also intends to further review KEEP in 2019 once the 2018 data on the scheme become available. It is envisaged that this exercise will include a consultation process with all relevant stakeholders. </p></reply>

Before this date taxpayers sent their appeals directly to Revenue who then transferred cases to the Appeal Commissioners when they were ready for a hearing. Since that date, taxpayers send their appeals directly to the TAC which then notifies Revenue of the appeals.  The TAC has full control over the processing and hearing of appeals.</p><p>I am advised by the TAC that the number of appeals before it fluctuates, depending on a number of factors, including the number of additional appeals received each day; the numbers closed each day; how many appeals are part-settled and how many that will settle based on the outcome of a &lsquo;leader-follower&rsquo; appeal. The Commission can also be informed, by an appellant(s) or the Revenue Commissioners, that an appeal has settled or been withdrawn which might indicate a reduction in the number of appeals on hand; however, until this is confirmed by both parties, the TAC cannot deem the matter closed.</p><p>I am further advised by the TAC that it is not possible, for the most part, to provide the age of tax appeals before it, as many of them were transmitted to the Commission in large tranches during 2016 by the Office of the Revenue Commissioners. In relation to those &lsquo;legacy&rsquo; appeals, some were submitted by the appellant in 2016 to Revenue, but many had been with Revenue for some time before that. Therefore, it is only possible to advise of when the TAC received appeals in 2016, 2017 and 2018. An analysis on this basis is set out below.</p><p>Following its establishment in 2016, I am informed that approximately 3,331 appeals transferred to the TAC, at various stages during 2016, from both the Office of the Revenue Commissioners and the Office of the Appeal Commissioners.

Qudos has published a Q&amp;amp;A for policyholders on its website - www.qudosinsurance.dk/qa/.  The Central Bank advise that the vast majority of these have now been re-broked / transferred to new providers and have provided the following breakdown of the type of policies:<table><tr><th>Product Name</th><th>Number of Policies</th></tr><tr><td>Van </td><td>37,948</td></tr><tr><td>Fleet </td><td>311</td></tr><tr><td>Haulage   Fleet</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>Haulage   non Fleet</td><td>29</td></tr><tr><td>Non-standard   Evolve</td><td>397</td></tr><tr><td>Private   Car</td><td>1,366</td></tr><tr><td>Household</td><td>10,940</td></tr><tr><td>Total </td><td>51,012</td></tr></table></p><p>The Central Bank has also indicated that as of 14 December 2018, there was 1,544 open Qudos claims broken down by: Household 155 and Private Car 1,389.  However until the solvency or otherwise of Qudos is determined it is not possible to say which compensation scheme may cover eligible claims (i.e. the Danish or Irish scheme). </p><p>In relation to the rules of the Irish Insurance Compensation Fund (ICF), the Deputy will be aware that its fundamental purpose is to provide a certain minimum level of protection for policyholders where an insurance company goes into liquidation. Under the scheme, as a general rule a claimant is entitled to a payment up to 65% of their claim or &euro;825,000 whichever is the less.  However the Insurance (Amendment) Act 2018 has increased the level of ICF coverage for all future third party motor claims from the 65% level to 100% with the additional 35% coverage financed through an ex-ante industry contribution.</p></reply>

However in the case of Qudos because of its rather unique circumstances, my officials have been in touch with their counterparts in the Danish Ministry of Finance.</p>  <p>  The Danish Finance Ministry officials advised that as Qudos was in solvent liquidation (as at 10 December), all claims would  be met. However, he also indicated that if ultimately Qudos is placed into bankruptcy, and this happens after 1 January 2019, that the Danish Insurance Guarantee Scheme will not be liable to meet these claims due to a legislative change in May 2018.  They noted that the decision as to if and when Qudos is placed into bankruptcy is not one for the Finance Ministry and that they have no role in this matter.  The Danish officials did indicate that there are no plans to amend the legislation in relation to the Danish Insurance Guarantee Scheme.</p>  <p>  It should also be noted that my officials have also been in contact with the UK Treasury and the EU Commission, to set out the impact and importance of this issue for Ireland. UK customers have also been impacted by the failure of Qudos.  My colleague Minister of State D&rsquo;Arcy has met with Insurance Ireland who outlined their serious concerns about the additional cost that Qudos could place on the Irish insurance sector if it is liquidated on or after 1 January 2019. </p>  <p>  My officials also continue to liaise with the Central Bank who advise that they are in very frequent contact with its Danish counterpart (DFSA), the supervisory authorities of other affected member states though an EIOPA established Collaboration Platform for Qudos.</p>  <p>  I understand that the Danish liquidators are currently continuing their review of the company with a view to determining its underlying financial position. Once this exercise is concluded they will be in a better position to determine whether the company can pay existing claims.

For instance, I understand, based on reports published from various sources including the European Insurance and Occupational Pension Authority (EIOPA) and EU Commission, that there are, 26 Insurance Guarantee Schemes (IGSs) (or similar schemes) established in 20 Member States: eight IGSs operating on the basis of the host-country principle, eight operating on the home-country principle and eight schemes with a combination of both.  The remaining two schemes are undefined.  In addition, IGSs do not exist in the following EEA Member States: Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Slovakia, Slovenia and Sweden. </p><p>These differences in national Insurance Guarantee Schemes (IGSs), together with differences in insolvency laws, have led to a situation where policyholders across or even within the same Member States are not protected to the same extent in liquidation.  Therefore it has been difficult to arrive at a common EU position in relation to IGSs.  However, there has been considerable efforts on the issue, including a number of reports and initiatives in recent years: </p><p>- A 2010 Commission white paper on the introduction of an EU wide framework of Insurance Guarantee Systems.  No significant progress was made on this framework subsequently as the development of Solvency II was the priority piece of work at the time.</p><p>- A 2015 Commission discussion paper on the possibility of introducing a recovery and resolution regime for insurance undertakings which could include an Insurance Guarantee Scheme.</p><p>- In 2017 the Commission issued a questionnaire to all Member States seeking information on Recovery and Resolution including experiences with failures and near-failures of insurers.</p><p>- The European Systemic Risk Board published a report &ldquo;Recovery and Resolution for the EU insurance sector: a macro prudential perspective&rdquo; in August 2017. The Central Bank of Ireland was represented on the drafting team.</p><p>- EIOPA published an Opinion to Institutions of the European Union on the Harmonisation of Recovery and Resolution Frameworks for (Re) Insurers (July 2017).</p><p>- Work is also underway at an EIOPA level, where a project group has been set up to examine more broadly recovery and resolution within insurance and in relation to Insurance Guarantee Schemes, a discussion paper was published on this topic.</p><p>In addition, the Deputy should note that the European Commission proposed an amendment to the Motor Insurance Directive which would oblige member states to set up Insurance Guarantee Schemes to cover the cost of insolvent motor insurers.  I support this measure and my officials are actively participating to ensure that the legislation is strong and in the best interests of Ireland, given the large insurance industry here and our previous experience with insolvent inward-Freedom of Services (FoS) insurers.</p><p>Finally, while the provision of cross-border insurance is an essential part of the Single market, and it is acknowledged that there are obvious difficulties which arise when an insurer fails, it should be noted that Solvency II is not a 'no-failure' regime as it would not be possible to build a viable system that provides a cast iron guarantee that no insurer will ever fail.  Consequently it is important that EU supervisors properly and consistently supervise the insurers that they authorise, and that there is greater communications between supervisors across the EU about their respective companies conducting cross-border business.  You should also be aware that as part of the ongoing review of the European Supervisory architecture, there is a proposal to further improve cross-border co-operation and communication through the strengthening of Cross-Border Collaboration Platforms.  These already operate on an ad-hoc basis, however this proposal would ensure a more formal structure is put in place where an insurer is doing a lot of cross border business.  This would therefore give the supervisors of countries into which insurance is written a greater insight into how the business is being conducted.</p></reply>

Member States have adopted their own approach to such schemes, which show noticeable differences in design features, such as scope, coverage and funding.</p><p>I understand that the Danish scheme for non life companies (<i>Garantifonden for skadesforsikringsselskaber</i>) was established on 1 October 2003 and comes under the remit of the Consolidated Act on the Guarantee Fund for Non-life Insurance.  This Act was most recently amended by Act No. 375 of 1 May 2018, which changed the scope of the Fund from a home-country principle to a host-country principle, with effect from 1 January 2019, and requires all insurers writing business in Denmark to be a member of the Danish Insurance Guarantee Fund.</p><p>The difference between a host based insurance guarantee scheme and a home based one is that the former only covers policies or risks in that state no matter where they are written from, whereas the latter covers all policies issued by domestically authorised insurers whether sold in that state or in other member states via branches or Freedom of Services (FoS).</p><p>It should be noted that the Irish Insurance Compensation Fund (ICF) is a host-based scheme.</p><p>In conclusion, while the provision of cross-border insurance is an essential part of the Single market, it is acknowledged that there are obvious difficulties which arise when an insurer fails.  It is important therefore that EU supervisors properly and consistently supervise the insurers that they authorise, and that there is greater communications between supervisors across the EU about their respective companies conducting cross-border business. </p></reply>

In response, Insurance Ireland provided statistics on the number of cases it dealt with in the first half of 2018.

On foot of this recommendation, Insurance Ireland agreed to submit an annual report on the operation of the Agreement to my Department.  In the first such report, Insurance Ireland stated that it &ldquo;<i>believes that the time may be correct for a review of elements</i>&rdquo; of the Agreement.  My Department accepted this proposal and has since hosted a number of workshops with relevant stakeholders who are examining what elements of the Agreement need to be amended or refined.  I understand that the next such workshop is scheduled to take place in early 2019.

If enacted, this Bill will provide the legislative underpinning for the Rainy Day Fund, which will formally be known as the "National Surplus (Exceptional Contingencies) Reserve Fund".  However, the timing of commencement is contingent on the Bill's passage through the Oireachtas.</p>  <p>  The Rainy Day Fund is part of a suite of measures to help increase the State's resilience to external economic shocks.  In particular, it will provide an economic buffer which can be drawn on in the event of a sharp downturn and mitigate its effects.</p>  <p>  My intention, as outlined in Budget 2019, is to seed the Fund with an initial transfer of &euro;1.5 billion from the assets of the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund. I have provided for Exchequer transfers of &euro;500 million per annum from 2019 to 2023.  This will see the Fund grow to around &euro;4 billion by end 2023. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Bill will provide the possibility of placing windfall tax or other receipts in the Fund, where the D&aacute;il by resolution so authorises.  The projection of &euro;4 billion by the end of 2023 is contingent on a number of assumptions such as that there is no event requiring a draw-down over the period; that there are no windfall receipts placed in the Fund over the period; and that there is no significant event during the period requiring use of the in-year contingency reserve. </p>  <p>  I should explain that the in-year contingency reserve is intended to operate as a potential carve-out from the annual &euro;500 million allocation to the Fund. Where, as a result of a natural or other disaster, Government incurs unforeseeable additional expenditure to mitigate the effects of that event, the payment into the Rainy Day Fund in that year may be reduced by an amount of up to that additional expenditure.  This is not intended to replace or substitute for prudent budgeting by central and local government and their agencies: it is an additional facility to provide flexibility to mitigate a significant event or consequences in excess of those which can be dealt with under prudent contingency planning and budgeting.</p>  <p>  Subject to D&aacute;il and Seanad scheduling, I hope it will be possible to establish the Fund as early as possible in 2019, and to make the initial transfer from the assets of the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund shortly thereafter. In order to ensure meaningful availability of the in-year contingency reserve, I intend that the annual transfers to the Fund will not as a rule be made until close to the end of the financial year.  This will ensure that the transfer is not made until after the in-year financial consequences of a serious event have crystallised.</p>  <p>  I look forward to debating my detailed proposals at Second Stage in the D&aacute;il in the coming months.</p></reply>

However some locations dictate a different approach.  In the case of Carrigafoyle, access is facilitated from the beginning of May until the end of September when the vast majority of visitors come to the site.  The underfoot conditions at Carrigafoyle combined with the low light conditions during winter months elevates the risk of accidents and it is not considered advisable to maintain the site fully open throughout the year.   </p></reply>

The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform databank, , sets out  appropriations-in-aid for each Vote broken down into non-pay, pay, pensions, and capital. </p><p>In the databank appropriations-in-aid represent the difference between gross and net voted expenditure. The data in the databank is updated to reflect the latest published Estimates structure. Table 1 in the attached document sets out the position with regard to appropriations-in-aid for each of the years 2011 to 2017 on a Vote group basis. The Revised Estimates Volume includes within the gross expenditure amounts for the Employment Affairs and Social Protection Group, and the Education and Skills Group, expenditure respectively of the Social Insurance Fund and the National Training Fund. For consistency, this expenditure is also reflected within the overall appropriations-in-aid figures on the databank and in the table attached. For information, this expenditure is also set out separately in Table 2. </p><p>Table 3 sets out the position for 2018, showing the initial allocation made in REV 2018, the end-November outturn and the forecast outturn for the year as notified by Departments and Offices. The forecast outturn includes anticipated additional EU receipts in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and European Social Fund receipts in the Department of Education and Skills. </p><p><b>Table 1: Total Appropriations-in-Aid by Vote Group 2011 &ndash;

Consequently, the number of apprentices being registered is determined by employers within each sector. My Department is committed to supporting the increased registration of apprentices and the expansion of the apprenticeship model into new sectors of the economy. The 2019 budget allocation for apprenticeship training is &euro;142m which represents an increase of over 16% on the 2018 allocation of &euro;122m. </p>  <p>  This Government is committed to expanding the apprenticeship model into new sectors of the economy. Arising from two calls for apprenticeship proposals issued by the Apprenticeship Council in 2015 and 2017, 17 new apprenticeships have now been developed in a range of new occupations, including financial services, engineering, ICT, hospitality, logistics and accounting.  Further new apprenticeships will get underway throughout 2019 in a variety of sectors including construction, engineering, horticulture and agriculture.  These new programmes, once developed, will add to and complement the range of apprenticeships currently on offer in developing the skill needs of our economy.  All of these apprenticeships are national programmes that can be delivered on a nationwide basis.</p>  <p>  As well as developments in new apprenticeships we have seen strong growth in registrations across the craft trades nationally during 2017 with 4,508 at year end, which represents a 20% increase on 2016.  </p>  <p>  In addition, education and training providers are also engaging positively with the Regional Skills Fora in order to address skills deficits in their regions. This engagement informs the planning for education and training programmes, including apprenticeship.</p>  <p>  Apprenticeships have a balanced regional spread and the delivery of Action Plan to Expand Apprenticeship and Traineeship will bring real opportunities for learners and employers throughout the country.</p> from DBEI and <b>&euro;9</b> <b>million</b> from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the   Marine.

Through the 6 year Capital Programme, the investment plan is about looking to the future and ensuring that our school infrastructure is well prepared to accommodate our growing school population.  The programme also addresses the requirements of many schools which are in need of upgrading and refurbishment, although they may not be experiencing significant demographic pressure.</p>  <p>  The projects under the capital programme will provide 19,000 new primary schools places and 43,000 new post-primary places.  While the Programme relates to major projects capital funding for smaller projects, such as the addition of a classroom etc., is dealt with on an ongoing basis through the Additional School Accommodation (ASA) scheme.</p>  <p>  Details of large-scale projects being delivered under the school building programme may be viewed on my Department's website, www.education.ie, and this information is updated regularly.  In addition, a list of large-scale projects completed from 2010 to date may be viewed on the website.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Summer Works Scheme (SWS) is designed to allow schools, on a devolved funding basis, to carry out necessary improvement and refurbishment works that will upgrade existing school facilities.  Under 2016-2017 almost &euro;117 million has been approved to date under the Summer Works Scheme, in respect of over 940 school projects in categories 1 - 9.  Details of the successful school applicants are published on my Department's website www.education.ie.</p>  <p>  In regard to the remaining applications under Category 10, which relate to external works such as upgrade and resurfacing of yards and car parking, these applications require more detailed analysis. It is intended to undertake this analysis in 2019 with a view to enabling approved applications proceed in 2020.</p>  <p>  Finally, for primary schools, the Minor Works grant allows schools to undertake improvement works in full or in part, as the grant allows, without prior application to my Department.</p>  <p>  The recent launch of Project Ireland 2040 included an announcement of a major package of investment in education for the next decade with the school building budget increasing by 70%.  This investment will provide for the continued increase in demographics while also allowing for a greater focus on refurbishment and upgrading of existing school stock.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, my Department is committed to putting in place a grant scheme similar to the Minor Works Grant in place at post-primary level over the lifetime of Project Ireland 2040.</p></reply>

A key factor is that teachers make up the vast numbers of retirements in the education sector, but only a very small percentage retire on compulsory age grounds.  </p><p>Notwithstanding these issues, it is important to say that the Department's approach has been robust and has provided a good indication of the scale of likely retirements and the expenditure implications.  </p><p>Apart from the increases made to allocations as a result of pay agreements, for a number of years prior to Budget 2019 there had been no significant increase in the expenditure base to cover the costs of increased pensions expenditure.  In that context, it was necessary to seek supplementary estimates to cover additional pension costs above what could be provided for from the Department's original budgetary allocation.</p><p>My Department, and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, have worked closely to resolve this issue.</p><p>In Budget 2019, the Government allocated an additional &euro;147 million in funding for pensions in the education sector. This was calculated on the basis of actuarial work undertaken by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform using data provided by the Department of Education and Skills. </p><p>More widely, as part of this year's Spending Review process, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform published an actuarial review (Public Service Occupational Pensions in Ireland - Cash Flow Analysis) setting out the medium and long term expenditure implications of occupational pensions in the public sector, including the education sector.  This is available at: .</p><p>The additional allocation of &euro;147 million will be added to the Department's expenditure base and will mitigate the need for a supplementary estimate for pensions expenditure in the education sector next year. </p><p>Alongside additional funding from pay deals, this will bring the pensions allocation in the Department of Education and Skills to c. &euro;1.35 billion in 2019 compared to a pre-supplementary allocation of c. &euro;1.19 billion in 2018.</p></reply>

The Programme includes over &euro;60 million of Exchequer funding as well as a major Public Private Partnership (PPP). This is in addition to the provision of over &euro;100 million for delivery of 3 new Divisional and Regional Headquarters in Wexford, Galway and Kevin Street, Dublin, each of which, I am pleased to confirm, have been completed and are now operational.  The clear goal of this investment is to address deficiencies in the Garda estate and provide fit-for-purpose facilities for Garda members and staff as well as the public interacting with them.</p><p>The Public Private Partnership<b></b>arrangement included in the Building and Refurbishment Programme is intended to deliver new stations at Clonmel, Macroom and Sligo as well as a new custody suite at the Garda Station at Anglesea Street, Cork.  </p><p>I am informed by the OPW and the Garda authorities that the OPW has acquired sites for the development of the new stations in Macroom and Sligo. The site for the new Garda Station in Clonmel is already in State ownership and work is now being finalised on its transfer from the Council to the OPW.  On completion, ownership of all three sites will be vested in the OPW.</p><p>The development of PPP projects is progressed under the auspices of the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA).  My Department is engaging with the NDFA with a view to progressing the matter further.  </p><p>It is not possible to provide a timeframe for the completion of these projects at this point, however I can assure the Deputy that delivery of the new stations at Clonmel, Macroom and Sligo through this PPP arrangement is being pursued as a priority.</p></reply>

Further, the allocation of Garda resources across all Divisions, including Cavan/Monaghan and Meath Divisions, is a matter for the Commissioner, in light of the availability of resources and his identified operational demands. As Minister I have no direct role in these matters.  However I am informed by the Garda authorities that the distribution of resources is kept under continual review to ensure their optimum use.</p>  <p>  Regarding the Garda estate, I would first note that the Office of Public Works (OPW) has responsibility for the provision and maintenance of Garda accommodation. Accordingly, the programme of replacement and refurbishment of Garda accommodation is progressed by the Garda authorities working in close co-operation with the OPW.  </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities capital investment in the Garda estate in the Cavan/Monaghan Division includes the following:  A new Garda station will be provided in Bailieborough, County Cavan in the context of the Garda Building and Refurbishment Programme 2016-2021.  I am informed that the relevant planning application was lodged in August 2018 and that the OPW is currently examining the submissions received.

I am informed that the OPW and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are continuing to engage in relation to the works required to permit reopening of Bawnboy station. I am informed that implementation of the programme and reopening of all 6 stations is being pursued as a priority and the OPW expects works should be completed in each case in 2019.</p>  <p>  With regard to Meath Division, provision is made in the Garda Building and Refurbishment Programme 2016-2021 for construction of an extension to Navan Garda Station.  The proposed works consist of demolishing the existing cell block and erection of a two storey extension comprising a new cell block on the ground floor and additional offices overhead. I am informed that the Part 9 Planning notices in this respect have been issued. </p>  <p>  In addition, Kells Garda Station has been provisionally identified for inclusion in the National Cell Refurbishment Programme in 2020.  Initial design proposals are now being prepared. </p>  <p>  More generally, I am informed that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na seeks to address minor maintenance issues and refurbishment works across all Divisions as they arise, liaising closely with the OPW and having regard to overall Garda accommodation priorities. </p>  <p>  Finally, I am advised by the Garda authorities that as of 14 December 2018  the strength of the Garda fleet in the Cavan/Monaghan Division is 56 vehicles and the strength of the Garda fleet in Meath Division is 58 vehicles.</p></reply>

I understand that an additional Inspector has recently been assigned to the Division and will take up their appointment early in the New Year. </p>  <p>  I am pleased that the recent Budget provided resources to increase the number of Sergeants by 110 and the number of Inspectors by 81.

It is carried out by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na primarily in accordance with the provisions of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012-2016 and is, as I am sure you will agree, a very important task which must be done thoroughly and correctly. My Department has no role in the processing of individual vetting applications.</p>  <p>  I have been informed by the Garda Authorities that the Vetting Bureau works to ensure that the processing time for vetting applications is kept to the minimum necessary in order to ensure that the statutory obligation to receive a vetting disclosure prior to permitting any person to undertake relevant work or activities on behalf of an organisation can be facilitated without undue delay.</p>  <p>  All Garda vetting applications are processed on a first come, first served basis in chronological order from date of receipt. This is with a view to observing equity and fairness in respect of all vetting subjects. </p>  <p>  In respect of certain applications, it is necessary for the Vetting Bureau to conduct further inquiries; for example to confirm information provided by the applicant with external bodies. The time required to receive such information may be outside of the control of the Vetting Bureau. In such instances, processing times may be significantly longer than the average.</p>  <p>  However, in general, the vetting process is working well and I understand that there are no backlogs or delays in Garda vetting at present. </p>  <p>  This efficiency has been achieved by the deployment of the e-vetting system which facilitates the on-line processing of applications for vetting from registered organisations. The current turnaround time for vetting applications submitted by organisations utilising the e-vetting system is 5 working days for over 85% of applications received.</p>  <p>  Individual applicants can also track the process of their application online using the e-vetting tracking system, details of which are contained in the email received by applicants when completing their application online.</p></reply>

The manager of the centre concerned met with and apologised to the family and RIA undertook to provide additional training to staff in the centre in question. </p>  <p>  RIA requires that all direct provision centre staff and management have regard to the best interests of the child in service delivery.</p>  <p>  All centres under contract to RIA are required to uphold the principles of Children First and to adhere to RIA's Child Protection and Welfare Policy. The Policy states that "The safety and wellbeing of all residents, but particularly children, is our paramount concern.

The numbers of the cases on hands will always include a cohort of cases where a decision has been made and the applicant has been notified of same, but where the applicant has yet to swear their oath of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State and be granted their certificate of naturalisation at a citizenship ceremony arranged for the purpose.</p><p>It is recognised that all applicants for citizenship would wish to have a decision on their application without delay.  While INIS endeavours that most straightforward cases are processed to a decision within six months, this target has to be seen in the context of the work involved in dealing with volumes of applications, some of which can be very complex in nature, and the need to ensure that each applicant fulfils the statutory conditions for naturalisation. The nature of the naturalisation process is such that, for a broad range of reasons, some cases can take longer than others to process.  In some instances, completing the necessary checks may take a considerable period of time.  As outlined, even where a decision may be made, the certificate cannot be issued until the applicant attends a citizenship ceremony arranged for the purpose of swearing the oath of allegiance before a judge.  In the circumstances it is not possible to give any meaningful average processing time per application.</p><p>Processing timescales can often be impacted due to further documentation being required from the applicant, or payment of the required certificate fee being awaited, or the applicant not engaging with the office.  In some instances the applicant themselves may request that a hold be put on their application, for example, where they may have returned to their country of origin for a prolonged period, to facilitate them in making arrangements to return to reside in the State, or where they have difficulty in obtaining satisfactory evidence of their identity or nationality.  In other instances issues can arise at the final stage of the naturalisation process, for example, where additional information comes to light which requires to be considered before a final decision is taken.  </p><p>The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements, not only within the State but also at European Union as well as international level.  It is therefore important that appropriate procedures are in place to ensure that the integrity of the regime for granting Irish citizenship through the naturalisation process is held in high regard both at home and internationally.</p><p>INIS devotes a considerable amount of its overall resources to the processing of these cases. It also operates a dedicated phone helpline and email helpdesk available for all applicants to enable queries to be dealt with, including the progress of their application.

While they have become somewhat factionalised over time, they still present a real and persistent threat.  The shared assessment of the threat in Northern Ireland is that it remains 'Severe' (that is to say, a terrorist attack is highly likely).  The dissident paramilitary groups continue to focus their efforts primarily on targeting members of the security forces in Northern Ireland, as evidenced tragically in recent years by the murders of NI Prison Officers Alan Black and Adrian Ismay, and a number of attempts to murder PSNI constables, including in July in Derry when a number of shots were fired at the PSNI.   </p>  <p>  Garda activities to disrupt and prevent actions by republican paramilitary groups continue without cease.  There have been notable successes and disruptions of activity in this regard &ndash; many seizures of arms and material, and notable arrests and convictions.</p>  <p>  The Garda&iacute; maintain a high level of on-going, close co-operation with their counterparts in Northern Ireland and in Britain in responding to this threat.  This operational relationship is absolutely central to bearing down on and disrupting the activities of these groups and, therefore, to maintaining security on the island.</p></reply>

The fact that people are staying in the centres for some time after they receive permission to remain is a situation that is putting increased pressure on the system as new arrivals have to be accommodated.</p><p>Where an individual or family has permission to remain in Ireland they can access the mainstream housing supports and services on the same basis as nationals/European Economic Area nationals.  </p><p>Considerable work continues to be done to support residents with status to move out of accommodation centres and to secure permanent accommodation in the community.</p><p>A number of NGOs have been awarded monies under the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF) specifically to assist and support residents with international protection status move out of accommodation centres into longer term accommodation.</p><p>In particular, funding was granted to the Jesuit Refugee Service and the Peter McVerry Trust under the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund Ireland 2017 - 2019 for the PATHS project (Providing Asylum-seekers in Transition with Housing and Support). </p><p>Further information on funding provided by AMIF can be found on the Department's website. </p><p>My Department has also provided funding to South Dublin County Partnership for a two year housing and integration programme, a key part of which is to assist residents, who have received permission to remain, to access housing supports.  The amount of funding provided in 2018 was &euro;100,000.</p><p>Additionally, under a pilot project, the Department of Justice and Equality has provided funding and is working with DePaul Ireland who provide supports in a number of accommodation centres to residents with permission to remain.  Part of their role is to assist residents to access accommodation in the wider community and offer resettlement support to ensure there is a decrease in tenancy breakdown.  The amount of funding provided in 2018 was &euro;45,034.</p><p>The statistical data the Deputy has requested is compiled on an annual basis and has not yet been finalised for 2018. However, as of 9th December 2018, there were a total of 5997 persons staying in accommodation provided by the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA), Department of Justice and Equality.  My Department has attached a document which details the duration of stay per centre for end of December 2017. </p><p>Historical information is available from the Annual Reports of the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) of my Department which are available on their website.</p></reply>

Westmeath</td><td>300</td></tr><tr><td>Ballyhaunis, Co. Mayo</td><td>245</td></tr><tr><td>Bridgewater, Carrick-on-Suir, Co. Tipperary</td><td>161</td></tr><tr><td>Carroll Village, Dundalk, Co.

Monaghan</td><td>175</td></tr><tr><td>Mosney</td><td>600</td></tr><tr><td>Total </td><td>2,097</td></tr></table></p><p>In addition to the above, a number of centres provide cooking facilities for residents who provide their own ingredients.

This means that nearly 54% of residents have access to cooking facilities and 35% access to the independent living model where residents are provided ingredients and access to cooking facilities.</p><p>In order to meet the accommodation needs in the longer term, the Department has recently commenced a public procurement exercise under which public tenders for the provision of accommodation and ancillary services to persons in the protection process, by way of the independent living model, will be advertised. This process is scheduled to continue throughout 2019 and is due for completion in 2020. This will be delivered via a series of regional competitions to cover the entire State. Under this competition, all successful bids must provide residents with the option of preparing their own meals as part of their proposal.</p></reply>

The staff of that Office (the Chief International Protection Officer and International Protection Officers) are independent in the performance of their protection functions. The International Protection Appeals Tribunal, (IPAT), considers appeals against IPO refusals of international protection and the Tribunal is also independent in the performance of its functions </p>  <p>  The IPO was established on 31 December 2016 following the commencement of the International Protection Act 2015 providing for the introduction of a single application procedure for people seeking international protection. The 2015 Act replaced the previous sequential application system with a single application process, for asylum, subsidiary protection and permission to remain in the State, bringing Ireland into line with the processing arrangements applicable in other EU Member States. </p>  <p>  When the 2015 Act was commenced, the IPO inherited a substantial backlog of over 3500 cases from the former system - some 2000 from the former Refugee Appeals Tribunal plus 1500 from the former Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner.  All IPO resources to date have been concentrated on scheduling and processing the backlog of legacy cases and prioritised cases (unaccompanied minors, and cases from refugee generating countries such as Syria, for example).</p>  <p>  In total, the IPO will issue over 2,900 first instance recommendations/decisions by the end of November this year, compared to 1,781 in 2017. There were 3324 first-time applications for international protection received by the International Protection Office (IPO) in 2018 up to the end of November. This figure includes 17 reapplications. Of these 3324 applications, 271 have received a first instance decision from the Minister based on the recommendations of the International Protection Office. </p>  <p>  Of these 271 first instance decisions, 266 were granted international protection by the Minister (refugee status or subsidiary protection status). 256 of these grant decisions relate to international protection applications made under the EU Relocation Programme under which applications, mostly from Syrian nationals, were prioritised by the IPO for fast-track decisions. The remaining 5 decisions were refusals of international protection by the Minister (both refugee status and subsidiary protection status).  </p>  <p>   Of the 3324 applications for protection received in 2018 up to the end of November, there were 4 decisions made by the International Protection Appeals Tribunal, (IPAT ) on appeal. Of these, 3 decisions were to grant international protection (refugee status or subsidiary protection status) and 1 decision was to affirm the recommendation of the International Protection Office to refuse international protection. In total, 488 decisions were issued by the Minister on foot of appeal decisions made by the IPAT up to 30th November 2018.</p></reply>

This follows three months of detailed consideration by my Department of the report's findings and recommendations and consultations with the Garda Commissioner, the policing oversight bodies , other Government Departments and agencies. </p>  <p>  The Commission's vision as endorsed by Government is for a modern, highly professional, human rights-based police service, working closely and collaboratively with communities and other agencies to keep communities safe and prevent harm. I and my Government colleagues are convinced that this is the right vision to maintain and enhance public trust in policing, to address current challenges and to enable An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to meet future challenges.  </p>  <p>  I was also pleased to launch, with the Garda Commissioner, a high level implementation plan "A Policing Service for the Future" which sets out the approach to implementation. It will be overseen by the Implementation Group on Policing Reform (IGPR) which has Ms Helen Ryan, former member of the Commission, as its independent Chair. The IGPR is supported by a dedicated Programme Office in the Department of the Taoiseach. </p>  <p>  The Plan, which was prepared with the input of the IGPR sets out an ambitious but realistic four year work programme for the implementation of the recommendations. This timescale is in line with the Commission's own recommendations.  I would refer the Deputy to www.gov.ie/policingreform for a copy of the Plan. </p>  <p>  My Department along with the Commissioner will be centrally involved in the implementation work.  </p>  <p>  The Plan includes the preparation by my Department  of a Policing and Community Safety Bill to provide, amongst other matters, for a new coherent governance, oversight and accountability framework for policing as recommended by the Commission. </p>  <p>  I am conscious of some concern that the proposals risk diluting the current level of external scrutiny.  Following detailed consideration of the concerns, including the dissenting views of the two members of the Commission to whom the Deputy refers, I am satisfied that the proposals are a coherent response to what is currently a complex system of external oversight that acts to the detriment of accountability on the part of individuals and the Garda organisation itself.  Taken as a whole, the suite of proposals will ensure the achievement of the complementary objectives of effective external oversight of policing and strong internal governance in line with best practice.</p>  <p>  I am also satisfied that it is appropriate that the Commissioner and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Board be given responsibility for senior appointments, subject to normal public service recruitment and promotion standards being applied.  I accept the Commission&rsquo;s strong view that the Commissioner must be empowered to act as the CEO of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and responsibility for appointments is clearly within the remit of the Board and CEO of any large organisation.

Where a suitable post is not available, or where the staff member is unlikely to be fit for full duties within 3 months, the staff member is required to remain on sick leave.</p></reply>

A taskforce including officials from the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department and the Department of Education and Science developed a joint policy and operational response to tackle this issue and concerns relating to immigration abuse. </p>  <p>  This response included the Interim List of Eligible Programmes (ILEP) as a means of identifying the educational programmes that meet eligibility criteria under Ireland's immigration policy for a non-EEA national coming to Ireland for the purpose of study.   </p>  <p>  I am advised by INIS that the joint arrangements put in place are designed to protect current and prospective students.  The joint policy specifies the mandatory provision of learner protection insurance by providers to allow for the placement of affected students in another school to finish their studies or, where this is not possible, that students are refunded fees via the insurance policy.  </p>  <p>  In addition, there is a requirement for providers to operate an 'escrow' type account with a bank or financial institution regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland.   Providers are required to hold funds on behalf of prospective students pending the outcome of their application for a visa.  Where the visa decision is positive the funds are transferred to the provider.  If the visa application is refused the funds (less any pre-agreed charges) are refunded to the student.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that any suggestion that an educational institution misused funds in respect of prospective students, should be reported to the relevant statutory authorities such an An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Director of Corporate Enforcement.</p>  <p>  More broadly, the Deputy may wish to note that the Government is taking further steps to strengthen regulation of the English language sector. </p>  <p>  The Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) (Amendment) Bill 2018, which comes under the auspices of my colleague the Minister for Education and Skills, is currently before the Seanad.  The new Bill will establish the International Education Mark (IEM) and a Protection for Enrolled Learners (PEL) Fund. </p>  <p>  The IEM is a core component of the Government's policy for the English language sector and will provide a full quality framework for the provision of education to international learners in the future.  Only those providers who meet the robust quality assurance procedures of Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) will be allowed to carry the Mark.  </p>  <p>  The Bill also contains provisions to provide QQI with additional statutory powers to examine a provider&rsquo;s financial sustainability.  Providers will have to satisfy QQI in relation to issues such as the legal personality, ownership and corporate governance arrangements in addition to examining that adequate financial resources are in place to ensure the viability of these businesses. </p>  <p>  Upon enactment, the Bill will also empower QQI to establish a fund for the protection of enrolled learners (PEL).  The fund will be used to &lsquo;teach out&rsquo; a programme in the event that a provider fails to provide a programme. Should this not be possible, the fund will be used to reimburse students for the most recent fees that have been paid.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-12-19a.610.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1249" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018121900073#WRM01800"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 277 and 281 together.</p>  <p>  On 26 June 2018, the European Council authorised the European Commission to open formal negotiations within the World Trade Organisation (WTO) on how to divide up existing EU Tariff Rate Quotas (TRQs) between the EU-27 Member States and the United Kingdom (UK) in the context of the UK's exiting the European Union. The European Commission leads on these matters as competence on trade issues is vested in the Commission under the Common Commercial Policy of the EU Treaties.  </p>  <p>  TRQs reflect the maximum quantity of the imports of a given category of goods on which a country member of the WTO - the EU in our case - pledges to charge low import duties rates.</p>  <p>  The UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU has implications beyond the bilateral relationship between the EU and the UK, in particular with regard to their commitments under the Agreement establishing the WTO.  When the EU accepted the WTO Agreement and the Multilateral Trade Agreements in 1994, the schedule of concessions and commitments that was Annexed to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1994 for the European Communities was thereby simultaneously annexed for the UK.  As a consequence of the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU, the EU&rsquo;s existing quantitative commitments, notably the TRQs, require adjustment. </p>  <p>  Given the time limits imposed on this process by the negotiations on the United Kingdom&rsquo;s withdrawal from the Union, it is possible that agreements may not be concluded with all WTO Members concerned in relation to all of the Tariff Rate Quotas before Regulation (EC) No 32/2000 (which provides and administers the EU&rsquo;s TRQs) ceases to apply to the United Kingdom.  In view of the need to ensure legal certainty and the continuous smooth operation of imports under the TRQs to the Union and the United Kingdom it is necessary for the EU to be able to proceed unilaterally to the apportionment of the TRQs.</p>  <p>  To this end, the European Commission published a proposal for a Regulation - COM (2018) 312 &ndash; on 22 May 2018 - which seeks to ensure that in the absence of such agreement, the EU can nevertheless proceed with the apportionment of the TRQs by modifying the WTO tariff concessions and that the Commission is given the necessary powers to consequently amend the relevant EU provisions on the opening and implementation of the relevant TRQs. Following its formal adoption by the European Parliament and the Council, the Regulation will enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union. The new TRQs will apply to the UK as and from the day after the UK's withdrawal from the EU. However, the existing TRQ regime (Council Regulation No 32/2000) will apply to the UK during the transition period in the event that the EU-UK Withdrawal Agreement is ratified by all parties and enters into force. </p>  <p>  The products which have TRQs attached are primarily agricultural and fishery products (including specific beef, swine, sheep, poultry, dairy, fruit, vegetables, wheat, maize, rice and fish products), and a small number of industrial products (including specific wood, silicon, glass, flax and fructose products). </p>  <p>  The methodology applied was to first determine the United Kingdom&rsquo;s usage share for each individual tariff rate quota over a recent representative three year period (2013-2015). This usage is then applied to the entire scheduled tariff rate quota volume, taking into account any under fill, to arrive at the UK's share of a given TRQ. The EU&rsquo;s share then consists of the remainder of the TRQ in question. This means the total volume of a given tariff rate quota is not changed (that is EU-27 volume = current EU-28 volume minus United Kingdom volume). The full product list including the EU share in quota is contained in the Regulation Annex.</p>  <p>  Ireland has actively engaged with the discussions to date on this matter at EU level and has supported the Commission&rsquo;s approach on the basis that it aims to maintain as close as possible to the status quo regarding the level of market access to the EU-27 after the UK's withdrawal.  In this regard, we have prioritised the need to minimise disruption to trade as the UK leaves the EU and the importance of maintaining the existing levels of market access, which is the intention of the European Commission, insofar as the TRQ regime is concerned.  Ireland was one of a number of Member States who sought to enhance the consultation requirements for the European Commission with Member States in the apportionment process and we were successful in that regard. This gave us assurances that any unintended consequences of the proposed approach, given the fluidity of the overall Brexit process, would be discussed by Member States at the relevant Committee, in particular, the Trade Policy Committee, where Ireland's representative is an official of my Department.

The Agency has a dedicated regional manager for the North East/North West Region and an office in the Cavan Innovation and Technology Centre. As part of its strategy to encourage investment in the area, the Agency is focusing, in particular, on new investors from key target sectors such as manufacturing. </p><p>The IDA also regularly engages with stakeholders on the ground in Cavan and Monaghan. This includes local authorities, the education sector and companies from both its own client base and the indigenous sector. IDA Ireland also owns sites in all three counties that are being actively marketed to its clients. As part of Budget 2019, I was pleased to announce an allocation of &euro;10m for the next phase of the IDA&rsquo;s Regional Property Programme to start building advanced facilities in a number of regional locations including Monaghan.</p><p>It is important to remember that foreign direct investment (FDI) forms only one part of the enterprise base in regional locations, such as Cavan and Monaghan. Indigenous business is responsible for a significant portion of employment growth, especially outside Dublin. My Department and all its agencies, including Enterprise Ireland and the LEOs, work together constantly to ensure that jobs and investment are spread as fairly as possible across the country.  </p><p>As regards site visits, they do represent an important tool through which investors can be encouraged to invest in regional areas. However, the final decision as to where to invest always rests with the company concerned. It is also the case that site visit activity does not necessarily reflect investment potential, as almost 70% of all new FDI comes from existing IDA client companies. </p><p>Site visits are collated by the IDA on a county-by-county basis only and are released every quarter. Details on site visits to specific locations, such as towns or individual sites, is therefore unavailable. </p><p>The table below outlines the number of IDA site visits to Counties Cavan and Monaghan that have taken place from 2013 to Q3 2018.<table><tr><th>County</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th><th>2017</th><th>Q1-Q3 2018</th></tr><tr><td>Cavan </td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan </td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The general consumer protection legislation for which my Department has responsibility does not, with one exception, contain provisions on the means by which contracts are to be terminated or rescinded.  That exception relates to the exercise by consumers of the right to cancel distance or off-premises contracts within a fourteen-day cancellation period under the European Union (Consumer Information, Cancellation and Other Rights) Regulations 2013 (S.I. No. 484 of 2013).  Regulation 14 of the Regulations provides that consumers must inform the trader of their decision to cancel the contract by using the model withdrawal form set out in the Regulations or by making any other unequivocal statement setting out the consumer's decision to cancel the contract. Contracts, particularly longer-term contracts, may contain terms on the means by which notice of termination is to be given. Any non-negotiated term of this kind is subject to assessment for fairness under the European Communities (Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts) Regulations 1995 (S.I. No. 27 of 1995). The indicative list of contract terms considered unfair in Schedule 3 of the Regulations includes a number of terms as follows that are relevant to the termination of contracts:</p>  <p> - inappropriately excluding or limiting the legal rights of the consumer vis-&agrave;-vis the seller or supplier or another party in the event of total or partial non-performance or inadequate performance by the seller or supplier of any of the contractual obligations, including the option of offsetting a debt owed to the seller or supplier against any claim which the consumer may have against him;</p>  <p> - authorising the seller or supplier to dissolve the contract on a discretionary basis where the same facility is not granted to the consumer, or permitting the seller to retain the sums paid for services not yet supplied by him where it is the seller or supplier himself who dissolves the contract; </p>  <p> - enabling the seller or supplier to terminate a contract of indeterminate duration without reasonable notice except where there are serious grounds for doing so;</p>  <p> - automatically extending a contract of fixed duration where the consumer does not indicate otherwise, when the deadline for the consumer to express this desire not to extend the contract is unreasonably early. </p>  <p>  There may also be provisions on matters relating to contract termination in sectoral legislation for which my Department does not have responsibility, such as the legislation on electronic communications networks and services.</p></reply>

My Department continues to plan and prepare for both the &lsquo;central case&rsquo; scenario and a disorderly Brexit scenario and updated Departmental Action Plans have evolved and developed based on the changing situation. It is not possible to eliminate all risk but the Government is working at home and at EU level to mitigate damage to the greatest extent possible. </p>  <p>  The underlying strength and resilience of our economy is critical in ensuring that Ireland is in the best possible position to respond to the challenges that Brexit will bring.</p>  <p>  Given that in a number of key areas for Ireland, the appropriate response and mitigation will be at the EU level, we are continuing to engage actively with the Commission on areas of priority for Ireland, including through a series of expert level meetings with the Commission and the EU27 on key issues on a weekly basis until mid-January. </p>  <p>  The EU Commission acknowledged the particular impact of Brexit on Ireland and Irish business in its contingency planning communication of 13 November. This communication also outlined some of the EU&rsquo;s plans for a no deal scenario, including in the areas of financial services, citizens&rsquo; rights, air transport, road transport, and customs / SPS requirements. This has further informed our own domestic planning.</p>  <p>  Ireland is also working closely with the EU and fellow Member States to discuss and progress areas of key concern, including facilitating the use of the UK as a landbridge post Brexit.</p>  <p>  Informed by detailed research, my Department is putting in place a package of measures that will allow us to respond to the needs of businesses including a number of schemes which have been developed to mitigate against the effects of Brexit.

This is operated within State aid rules under the de Minimis regulation.</p>  <p>  In May 2018, the Rescue and Restructuring scheme was extended to include temporary restructuring aid for enterprises experiencing acute liquidity needs.  The aid is granted in the form of loans repayable over a period of 18 months.  Together with the Brexit Loan Scheme, this temporary restructuring aid will provide valuable stabilisation to businesses as they respond to the immediate and long-term impacts of the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU.</p>  <p>  The Future Growth Loan Scheme was announced in Budget 2019. The scheme will be available to eligible Irish businesses, including those in the primary agriculture and seafood sectors, to support strategic, long-term investment in a post-Brexit environment.

Firms should look at these notices with their representative bodies to better understand the possible impacts. </p><p>My Department has also participated in relevant expert level meetings organised by the European Commission with participation by the EU27 Member States in November/December 2018 on key issues.  </p><p>Government's focus is to plan for an orderly Brexit based on the Withdrawal Agreement which provides for the backstop and a future partnership which is ambitious and wide ranging. Given the current uncertainty, Government will continue to work on Brexit preparedness for the central case scenario but is now giving immediate priority to preparations for a disorderly Brexit. My Department and its agencies, are working on a cross-government basis to help prepare for all Brexit scenarios</p><p>The Government has already taken actions to get Ireland Brexit ready, with dedicated measures announced in Budgets 2017, 2018 and 2019. </p><p>My Department, in particular, has developed a package of measures that allow us to respond to the needs of businesses affected by Brexit-related uncertainty, including in a worst-case scenario. Over the past two years, we have substantially increased the resources available to the Enterprise Agencies within my Department's remit and we have put in place a number of schemes to assist firms address the challenges posed by Brexit. Some of the main supports I have put in place include:  </p><p>- Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s &lsquo;Be Prepared Grant&rsquo; which offers up to &euro;5,000 in funding to support exporting client companies to prepare a Brexit Action Plan. </p><p>- Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s &lsquo;Act On&rsquo; Initiative to help Brexit-exposed client companies to strengthen their capabilities in key areas of Financial and Currency Management, Strategic Sourcing, Customs and Logistics. This is delivered at no cost to the company. </p><p>- The Local Enterprise Office&rsquo;s (LEOs) &lsquo;Lean for Micro Programme&rsquo; which offers clients the opportunity to incorporate Lean business principles to improve performance and effectiveness. </p><p>- The LEO&rsquo;s &lsquo;Technical Assistance for Micro Enterprises&rsquo;, to support businesses to diversify into new markets, enabling them to develop new market opportunities outside of the EU.</p><p>- InterTrade Ireland&rsquo;s &lsquo;Start to Plan&rsquo; vouchers &ndash; worth &euro;2,250 - to enable SMEs to purchase specialist advice on customs, tax, tariff and non-tariff barriers, legal and labour mobility issues, specifically in relation to Brexit.</p><p>- On 28 March this year, I, along with Minister Donohoe and Minister Creed, launched the &euro;300 million Brexit Loan Scheme with the European Investment Bank Group and the SBCI. This scheme provides affordable working capital to eligible businesses. </p><p>In allocating my Department&rsquo;s budget for 2019, I stepped up our response to Brexit, basing my decisions on both an extensive body of research and direct feedback from the sector. </p><p>In addition to the above measures, the longer-term Future Growth Loan Scheme will help businesses invest strategically in a post-Brexit environment and will be available early in 2019. The scheme, which is<b></b>jointly funded by my Department and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine provides up to &euro;300m to support capital investment by business and offers loan terms of 8 to 10 years. </p><p>In the 2019 budget I have allocated &euro;8m extra for Brexit staffing &amp;amp; supports across enterprise and regulatory agencies in order to prepare Irish businesses for Brexit; the roll-out of customs training through Local Enterprise Offices and Enterprise Ireland; and, &euro;1m additional funding for InterTrade Ireland. </p><p>At the beginning of this month, Enterprise Ireland, working with the Revenue Commissioners, launched an online &ldquo;Customs Insights&rdquo; course designed for Irish businesses dealing with customs for the first time. The course will give learners a firm understanding of customs, the implications for their business and the options from Revenue that are available to make the customs process more efficient.</p><p>Notwithstanding the uncertainty of Brexit, there are several areas where firms can take immediate action to prepare. I would ask firms now to take heed and to take action.  My advice to businesses is to:</p><p>- Be alert to your supply chains and any possible disruption that might arise. </p><p>- Be alert to the potential for new customs procedures that might be required and the possible application of new tariffs and quotas in certain areas</p><p>- Be alert to certification, standards and licensing issues. </p><p>- Be alert to currency fluctuations. </p><p>- Be alert to the State supports and loans schemes available from Government, including through Enterprise Ireland, the LEOs and InterTrade Ireland.</p><p>The European Commission and Government have also made known their intention imminently to set out additional information relating to Brexit contingency planning for a no-deal scenario, including as regards necessary legislation that will be required.</p></reply>

The &euro;23 million exchequer funding announced in the 2018 Budget (&euro;14 million from my Department and &euro;9 million from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine) has been leveraged to provide a fund of up to &euro;300 million over the lifetime of the scheme. </p><p>The scheme features a two-stage application process. First, businesses must apply to the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) to confirm their eligibility for the scheme. Businesses can use guidelines provided on the SBCI website to determine if they are eligible, and if so, to complete the eligibility form.  As part of the process, businesses must submit a business plan, demonstrating the means by which they intend to innovate, change or adapt to meet their Brexit challenges. The SBCI assesses the applications and successful applicants receive an eligibility reference number.</p><p>Successful applicants can then apply for a loan under the scheme with one of the participating finance providers using their eligibility reference number.  Participating finance providers are the Bank of Ireland, Ulster Bank and Allied Irish Bank.  Approval of loans is subject to the finance providers' own credit policies and procedures.  </p><p>The figures in the table below are those as to 10th December 2018. The Department will receive a report each quarter from the SBCI on the uptake of the scheme. A number of requested figures have not been included in this table as they pertain to the relationship between banks and their client SMEs and so are beyond the remit of these reports.

We are asking businesses to carefully consider what they need to do to successfully address their Brexit challenge through innovating, changing or adapting their business model in some capacity.  These responses may include strengthening their product offerings, developing new markets to diversify their trade footprint, changing their organisational structure or developing new capabilities.</p>  <p>  As part of the process, businesses are requested to complete a business plan displaying how they are going to innovate, change or adapt.

It is important to remember, however, that the final decision as to where to invest always rests with the company concerned. It is also the case that site visit activity does not necessarily reflect investment potential, as almost 70% of all new foreign direct investment (FDI) comes from existing IDA client companies. Site visits nevertheless do represent an important tool through which investors can be encouraged to invest in regional areas and the IDA always does its utmost to ensure that investors consider all potential locations when visiting Ireland.</p>  <p>  Site visits are collated by the IDA on a county-by-county basis only and are released every quarter. Information on the number of site visits to specific locations and buildings is therefore unavailable. </p>  <p>  In 2017, there were seven site visits to County Mayo by IDA client companies. In the first three quarters of 2018, there were a further seven such visits by prospective investors.  </p>  <p>  The IDA has constructed an Advanced Technology Building in Mayo, located in Castlebar. The building is complete and the Agency has been working hard, through its offices in Ireland and abroad, to secure an investor for the facility.  Those efforts are continuing. </p>  <p>  More broadly, the overall outlook for FDI in Mayo remains positive. There are 16 IDA client companies employing approximately 4,500 people in the County. Mayo has experienced a 26% increase in FDI employment from 2012 to 2017 with job numbers increasing from 3,537 in 2012 to 4,462 at the end of last year. IDA Ireland continues to engage with its existing client base there to support them in growing their business and footprint further.</p></reply>

Members of the Traveller community are recognised in this strategy as being one of the priority groupings most vulnerable to suicide. </p>  <p>  To address this issue, targeted mental health and stigma reduction campaigns are in development for the Travelling community. To date, this has involved focus group testing of the national mental health Little Things campaign messaging with traveller groups. Based on this process, the National Office for Suicide Prevention will further develop the communication campaigns using appropriate messaging and media channels for this target population group. The Samaritans (funded under the Connecting for Life strategy) are also working at a local level to promote their service to this priority group. </p>  <p>  In addition, the HSE and Primary Care Social Inclusion currently funds Exchange House Ireland to deliver targeted health programmes. This includes two suicide prevention projects targeting the Traveller Community; the National Traveller Suicide Prevention Service and Travelling to Wellbeing.</p>  <p>  Exchange House Ireland provides a range of services and supports to approximately 8,000 Travellers annually. The National Office for Suicide Prevention commissioned a review of the projects (2016-2017) in line with its goal to build the evidence base in support of targeted initiatives for priority groups, and to further inform its role in funding suicide prevention initiatives and establish how the existing projects align with the Connecting for Life strategy.</p>  <p>  The Department of Justice and Equality led on the development of the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy. The strategy provides a set of specific actions that need to be taken to bring about a real improvement in quality of life for Travellers and Roma. A number of cross&ndash;cutting themes emerged in the consultation process for the strategy such as accommodation, employment, health and education. The strategy, published in June 2017, includes agreed actions aiming to improve the health of travellers.</p>  <p>  The Oversight Group working on the refresh of the Vision for Change national mental health policy proposes that policy changes will benefit all those engaging with mental health services. The Terms of Reference for the Group place a particular emphasis on social inclusion and the needs of vulnerable groups, including the Traveller community, which will be incorporated into the final report with a focus on reducing stigma and discrimination. Therefore, it is not proposed to have a separate traveller specific mental health strategy report. </p></reply>

There is no provision under the GMS GP contract for persons who hold a medical card or GP visit card to be charged for routine phlebotomy services provided by their GP which are required to either assist in the diagnosis of illness or the treatment of a condition.</p>  <p>  The HSE has advised GPs that where a blood test forms part of the investigation or necessary treatment of a patient&rsquo;s symptoms or conditions, this should be free of charge for patients who hold a medical card or GP visit card. Notwithstanding this, I am aware that some GPs are charging GMS patients for phlebotomy services in some circumstances. </p>  <p>  This is a matter of concern for me as it has long been the position, under successive Governments, that no user charges should apply to GP services provided to GMS and GP visit card patients. If a patient who holds a medical card or GP visit card believes he or she has been incorrectly charged for routine phlebotomy services by his or her GP, then that patient should report the matter to their HSE Local Health Office.</p></reply>

The General Scheme is published on my Department&rsquo;s website. This comprehensive piece of legislation encompasses the regulation of a range of practices, including: gamete (sperm or egg) and embryo donation for AHR and research; surrogacy; pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) of embryos; posthumous assisted reproduction; and embryo and stem cell research. The General Scheme also provides for an independent regulatory authority for AHR.  </p>  <p>  The Joint Committee on Health is currently conducting a review of the General Scheme of the Assisted Human Reproduction Bill 2017 as part of the pre-legislative scrutiny process, which began in January of this year. The review is on-going, and the Committee intends to publish its report early in 2019. The introduction of legislation in relation to AHR and associated research is a priority for me and the process of drafting this Bill will be completed in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General. As part of this process officials in my Department will ensure that there is coherent interaction between the AHR Bill and Parts 2 &amp;amp; 3 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015.  However, it is not possible at this time to give a definitive timeline for the completion of the draft Bill and its subsequent passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p></reply>

Additional investment in eHealth and ICT for the period 2018-2021 was secured by my Department as part of the Mid-Term Capital Review and supported through the National Development Plan. The capital provision for eHealth and ICT for 2018 to 2021 is set out below and will allow for a multi-annual rolling programme of work on multiple projects:</p><p><table><tr><th><b>2018 </b></th><th><b> 2019</b></th><th><b> 2020</b></th><th><b> 2021</b></th></tr><tr><td>&euro;60m</td><td>&euro;85m </td><td>&euro;100m</td><td>&euro;120m</td></tr></table></p><p>The planned Capital provision will fund a large range of projects that support my Departments eHealth strategy as well as the HSE Knowledge &amp;amp; Information Plan as part of a rolling annual programme of work. The planned funding is for important systems such as the Electronic Health Record, the National Financial Management System, Individual Health Identifier, the Maternal and Newborn Information System and others. </p><p>A significant portion of the capital provided for ICT each year is required simply to replace and upgrade the existing ICT infrastructure and systems already deployed and necessary to support patient care and an organisations the size of the HSE. The  balance of capital is allocated to the development and implementation of projects. Whilst the majority of these projects are for eHealth, there are also others e.g. corporate systems, that also need to funded from the same capital envelope.  </p><p>Full development and implementation of the eHealth strategy will be over many years on a rolling basis with programme reviews, cost planning and annual expenditure commitments being made accordingly.  It will ensure that Ireland can benefit from the potential of ICT and eHealth to improve health and wellbeing through improved efficiencies and the effectiveness of its health delivery services. </p></reply>

A range of recommendations for action by the HSE in collaboration with other stakeholders is identified, to provide assurance that the use of mesh implants and the care of women requiring aftercare in Irish hospitals is in line with emerging evidence and best practice internationally, based on expert advice received and review of international experience. </p><p><b>Methodology:</b></p><p>Preparation of the report has involved consultation and engagement with national and international bodies, including the Health Products Regulatory Agency (HPRA); the relevant professional training bodies, the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecology (IOG) and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI); the Continence Foundation of Ireland (CFI) and the Health Service Executive (HSE), as well as colleagues in other jurisdictions.  The report has been informed by review of international reports and safety reviews of mesh surgery which have been published in recent years. The report has also been informed by the personal experiences of women who have suffered complications following mesh surgery.</p><p>I wish to acknowledge the bravery, commitment and dignity shown, by the women that met with me and by those women who have written to me concerning this issue, in sharing what were harrowing, deeply personal experiences. </p><p>It is important to note that the views of the many women who have undergone mesh procedures and have had satisfactory outcomes, with minor or no complications, have not been formally sought and so are not reflected in this report. Also, following the implementation of a pause in mesh procedures by the HSE in July 2018, as described in Section 2, a number of women whose procedures were postponed made representations to the Department expressing concern at the impact that this has on them personally as they await treatment for the distressing symptoms of SUI, reflecting another important group of women affected directly by this issue.</p><p><b>Report Findings:</b></p><p>The report makes a number of overall findings, in addition findings are presented which relate to informed consent, aftercare of women with complications, clinical and professional issues and information issues. The findings are:</p><p><b>Overall Findings:</b></p><p>Mesh implant devices are certified as compliant with relevant European Union (EU) legislation and no market action against mesh devices for the treatment of SUI or POP has been taken by any of the European device regulatory competent authorities.  </p><p>There is an extensive evidence base supporting (i) the use of the mid-urethral sling (MUS) devices in the treatment of SUI and (ii) the use of abdominally placed mesh in the management of POP. A significant majority of patients benefit greatly from these procedures, with reduced long-term complications and improved functional outcomes compared to non-mesh procedures. </p><p>Mesh procedures should be performed by trained personnel, in patients who are appropriately selected and counselled and when appropriate multidisciplinary expertise and clinical governance mechanisms are in place.</p><p>Transvaginal placement of mesh for the treatment of POP is no longer regarded as appropriate first line treatment. Its use is restricted by clinical guidance in some jurisdictions. Regulatory restrictions on its use are in place in Australia and New Zealand.</p><p>Mesh devices are associated with significant and severe complications in a minority of women, which are of concern given the difficulties of mesh implant removal.</p><p>Many other health systems, including the United Kingdom (UK), Australia and the Netherlands have implemented specific measures in recent years to ensure appropriate use of mesh procedures in the treatment of SUI and POP and to ensure appropriate aftercare for women suffering mesh complications.</p><p><b>Informed Consent:</b></p><p>As would be usual with many surgical conditions, standardised information resources were not available at national level to ensure that all patients receive consistent information about the benefits and risks of mesh devices, to advise of other treatment options and to support informed consent processes.</p><p>Many women reported that they were not informed of other treatment options; they had not been informed that their surgeries involved the use of mesh; they were not informed of mesh complications; and they were not made aware of the difficulties associated with mesh removal or with the treatment of long-term mesh complications. </p><p>Aftercare of Women with Complications</p><p>Structured treatment or referral pathways were not evidently in place for the minority of women requiring specialist, multidisciplinary care for serious complications following mesh surgery. </p><p>Some women reported considerable difficulty in accessing timely, compassionate and appropriate specialist aftercare for complications. </p><p>Some women reported that individual clinicians responded to their personal concerns in an inappropriate manner which greatly added to their distress. Women also reported feeling that they were not believed, or that their clinicians minimised or did not understand the severity of their complications.  </p><p>Clinical and Professional Issues </p><p>Governance mechanisms are not in place at national level to provide assurance that mesh surgeries are carried out in accordance with agreed international best practice and clinical guidance. </p><p>There is no mandated professional clinical guidance at national level to guide the use of mesh implants in the management of SUI or POP or to guide the management of women with complications. </p><p>Communication mechanisms currently in place at national level between the HPRA, healthcare providers and professional bodies do not provide assurance that the findings and recommendations of safety reviews such as those circulated by the HPRA in recent years regarding mesh implants are systematically analysed and acted upon where appropriate.</p><p>Information</p><p>There are significant gaps in knowledge about current practice in Ireland regarding the use of urogynaecological mesh implants. </p><p>Routinely collected clinical information at national level does not provide the capacity for monitoring or audit of mesh surgeries for the treatment of SUI and POP.</p><p>Based on international experience, there is under-reporting of adverse events relating to mesh surgeries by clinicians to both the HPRA and to the National Incident Management System (NIMS) operated by the State Claims Agency (SCA). </p><p>Recommendations</p><p>Nineteen recommendations in total are identified throughout the report in response to the findings above:</p><p>Patient Information and Consent &ndash; 2 recommendations</p><p>Aftercare for Women Suffering Complications &ndash; 5 recommendations</p><p>Clinical and Professional Recommendations &ndash; 8 recommendations</p><p>Information Recommendations &ndash; 5 recommendations</p><p>These include recommendations about the development of patient information and informed consent materials to ensure appropriate patient selection and counselling, ensuring clinical and professional standards of practice are met by ensuring that all surgeons have undergone appropriate surgical professional training and ensuring that appropriate multidisciplinary expertise is available in units carrying out mesh procedures, the development of clinical guidance for the management of SUI and POP, the development of information resources to monitor the ongoing use of mesh devices and to permit long-term research and audit of practice, ensuring the reporting of mesh related complications, and ensuring timely, appropriate and accessible care pathways for the management of women with complications. </p><p>Full implementation of the report&rsquo;s recommendations will provide significant assurance that all patients presenting for treatment for SUI and POP and all women who develop mesh-related complications receive high quality, patient centred care in accordance with accepted evidence and supported by robust clinical governance mechanisms. </p><p>Actions to date</p><p>A number of important interim system actions to address the safety and effectiveness of mesh implant use have been progressed in advance of completion of the report.</p><p>1.Pause on all uro-gynaecological mesh procedures</p><p>On July 24th, 2018, the HSE was requested by the CMO to pause all uro-gynaecological mesh procedures, in cases where it is clinically appropriate and safe to do so, pending confirmation by the HSE of the implementation of recommendations relating to (i) professional training requirements, (ii) patient information and consent and (iii) the development and maintenance of a national data set for all mesh procedures carried out in HSE funded hospitals.  The request to institute a pause in vaginal mesh procedures was considered proportionate and necessary to address public and patient concern about the ongoing safety of mesh devices as comprehensively as possible. </p><p>2.Development of patient information and consent materials</p><p>Prior to this request, in May 2018, the HSE had been requested to begin work immediately on the development of national standardised patient information and informed consent materials and the clarification and development of treatment pathways and appropriate referral services for women suffering serious complications.</p><p>3.Learning Notice on mesh devices </p><p>A Learning Notice concerning mesh devices in uro-gynaecological procedures was circulated by the National Women and Infants&rsquo; Health Programme (NWIHP) on 26th June 2018 to all maternity hospitals and acute hospitals with gynaecological services to highlight the importance of appropriate patient selection, adequate information and consent and also to inform the service providers that a Response Group has been convened to propose remedies for and address the provision of aftercare for complications. This learning notice has been posted on the NWIHP website. </p><p>4.Synthetic Mesh Devices Group</p><p>A Synthetic Mesh Devices Advisory Group has been convened by the NWIHP which includes three patient representatives, as well as representatives of the HPRA, the IOG, the RCSI, the CFI and all Hospital Groups, to advise on and progress all the interim recommendations as advised to the HSE in May 2018 and in July 2018.  To ensure that the spectrum of views of women affected by mesh safety concerns is represented, the three patient representatives include Ms Melanie Power, representative of Mesh Survivors Ireland; as well as a woman who has had a successful outcome of mesh surgery for the treatment of SUI and a woman who is on the waiting list for surgery (currently paused).</p><p>I am informed that a work programme for the development of appropriate patient information resources and consent materials, the clarification and development of treatment pathways and appropriate referral services for women suffering from mesh-related complications including access to specialist diagnostic facilities such as translabial scanning is being progressed through this Group.  The work being progressed by the HSE will include identifying the appropriate specialist clinical expertise and facilities required at hospital group level and nationally to provide comprehensive aftercare services. Pending the completion of this, the HSE will also examine the need to look at sourcing services from abroad to address any immediate shortfalls identified, either through utilisation of the treatment abroad scheme or by commissioning services from abroad. </p><p>Next Steps</p><p>As requested by the CMO in July 2018, the pause in the use of mesh procedures for the management of SUI and POP in HSE-funded hospitals is ongoing, in cases where it is clinically appropriate and safe to do so, pending confirmation by the HSE of the implementation of recommendations.  </p><p>The Department of Health has written to the HSE to request that it prepare a detailed Implementation Plan for the complete set of recommendations set out in the CMO&rsquo;s Report, working in conjunction with other stakeholders. </p><p>As promised at my meeting with Mesh Survivors Ireland on June 14th 2018, I provided the group with a copy of the CMO&rsquo;s Report on the date of publication and a date will be arranged for a further meeting with the group in the near future.</p></reply>

Considerable work has been undertaken on the project since April 2017 when Government gave the green light for the construction of the hospital. Enabling works on the main hospital site are complete and Phase A construction works (substructure works on the main site), which commenced in October 2017, are also now nearing completion.  Following yesterday's decision, the Phase B 7-storey above ground works will begin early next year. Development is also well advanced on the paediatric outpatients and urgent care centres.  Works at Connolly are on target for practical completion of the building in Spring 2019 with the opening scheduled for July 2019.  Works at Tallaght are underway with a target handover date of July 2020, and the main hospital to be completed in 2022. The hospital will facilitate the implementation of a new model of care that will have a profound impact on all paediatric services once the new hospital is open. </p>  <p>  At an early stage in the process, it was determined that the traditional method of procurement was not suitable or realistic for a project of this size and complexity. Accordingly, the contract is subject to a two-stage process with stage one consisting of a scope refinement and value engineering process, based upon tendered rates, to finalise the Phase B works (above ground). This approach allowed the early phases of work to commence on site while also allowing for the detail of later phases to be finalised and agreed.  This approach brings issues on cost to the fore much earlier in the life of the project than is the case where traditional procurement approaches are deployed.  </p>  <p>  Following the evaluation by the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board in early 2017 of main construction tenders and the selection of preferred contractors, the final cost of the design, build and equipment programme for which the NPHDB is responsible was &euro;983m.  Following the completion of the second stage of the two-stage tender procurement process, the project cost is now at &euro;1,433 million, an increase of &euro;450 million.  </p>  <p>  Of the &euro;450m additional costs, construction costs account for &euro;319m. The balance of &euro;131m, which includes &euro;50m in VAT, relates to costs associated with staff, consultants, planning, design team fees, risk/contingency, and Management Equipment Service. </p>  <p>  As I have already stated the increased cost is a matter of great concern and I have made it clear that Phase B of the construction project must be delivered within budget and timescale.   Accordingly, there will be an independent review of the escalation in cost in determining the adjusted contract sum, the contributory factors and associated responsibilities so that any potential weaknesses are identified and comprehensively and speedily resolved in the interests of the successful completion of the project and the effective management of public funds. The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board will be required to provide on-going assurance to the HSE, Department of Health and Government that Phase B of the project is being delivered within budget and timescale.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-12-19a.999.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018121900080#WRT04900"><p>As the Deputy is aware, 2018 presented the agriculture community with some very challenging conditions in terms of a prolonged wet Spring period followed almost immediately by a period of exceptionally dry, hot weather.  Notwithstanding these events there was a return in the third quarter of the year to more normal climatic conditions which benefitted the agriculture sector in terms of a late season grass growth. </p>  <p>  My priority throughout the year has been to support measures to assist in the conservation of as much fodder for this Winter as possible from within our own resources and to supplement this with necessary imports as required. To this end I introduced a number of targeted measures including:</p>  <p>  - a &euro;2.75 million Fodder Production Incentive for Tillage Farmers to encourage tillage growers to actively engage in the fodder market and there has been positive engagement with this measure</p>  <p>  - a &euro;4.25 million Fodder Import Support Measure for Autumn 2018. The measure seeks to reduce the cost to farmers of imported forage. The measure operates through the Co-operatives/registered importers and will cover forage imported from 12th August 2018 to 31st December 2018. </p>  <p>  In July I secured agreement from EU Commissioner Hogan to pay higher advance Pillar 1 and 2 payments, increased to 70% and 85% respectively. In excess of &euro;1.5 billion has been paid to farmers to date under Pillar 1 and 2 since mid September. </p>  <p>  Following consultation with the EU Commission, my Department made some temporary adjustments to the GLAS scheme for this year which have the potential to add to the quantities of winter fodder available by bringing over 260,000 additional hectares into production. In addition, in consultation with my ministerial colleague Mr. Eoghan Murphy T.D., a two week extension of the closed period for the spreading of chemical and organic fertilisers was implemented that allowed farmers capitalise on autumn grass growth for fodder production. </p>  <p>  The most recent national fodder survey conducted on my behalf by Teagasc last October indicated that the national fodder shortfall has been reduced to 1% nationally.  It is clear that the various support interventions I have introduced have worked and continue to help alleviate what was a very serious fodder conservation issue on many farms during the dry summer period.</p>  <p>  It is important to stress that while the deficit nationally has been reduced significantly there still remains a  fodder deficit on some farms and there is a need for farmers to remain vigilant and avoid complacency. I have urged Teagasc and the other Stakeholders to continue their individual efforts in support of those farmers worst affected and in need of help. </p>  <p>  Whilst it is not possible to predict the duration or severity of the coming winter and its resultant impact on the farming community,  I can assure the Deputy that I together my officials will continue to closely monitor the fodder situation.</p></reply>

For instance, since 2015 my Department has delivered almost all of its CAP reform schemes online with end to end automated processing.  This has allowed Ireland to be among the first in Europe to launch schemes and to make payments to farmers at the earliest possible opportunity.  Since 2015 Ireland has been the second fastest country to draw down and disperse funds to the rural community from the CAP schemes.</p>  <p>  In line with my Department's Statement of Strategy 2016-2019 and IMT Statement of Strategy 2017-2020 my Department is constantly seeking to make the best use of new and emerging technologies.  My Department previously launched a mobile phone app that allowed farmers to get up to date details of the prices being paid by different Meat Processors for the different classifications of carcases.  </p>  <p>  In addition my Department is at an advanced stage of development to provide a calf birth registration application that will be accessible on mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. This will allow farmers to register calf birth details directly with the Department&rsquo;s Animal Identification and Movement (AIM) system in remote locations such as farm sheds using the their smart mobile phone.  This app will help to minimise errors in calf birth details submitted and avoid duplication of records on the farm.  An enhancement to allow farmers process farm to farm movements for cattle will be included in a subsequent phase which will be available later in 2019.   Further enhancements will be released on an on-going basis.</p>  <p>  As part of its on-going commitment to providing an efficient and effective customer service to its clients, my Department is seeking to develop a new customer engagement contact system. This new contact centre will build on the current telephony system with the creation of a new single point of contact for each customer. The contact centre will be further enhanced by the provision of a single view of each customer, thereby facilitating a more enhanced and holistic approach to customer interactions. </p>  <p>  Under EU regulations, 2018 was the first year that all applications for the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) had to be submitted online. I was aware that for some people, this was the first year that they engaged with the online applications process and they may have found this process daunting.  To help farmers to submit their applications online in 2018, I ensured that the BPS application facility was open over a month earlier than in 2017.  This provided more time for farmers to familiarise themselves with the online application facility and to submit their applications. My Department contacted these farmers at an early date advising them of the requirement to submit online in 2018. A number of additional supports as follows were also put in place:</p>  <p>  - How-to booklets</p>  <p>  - How-to videos</p>  <p>  - Lo-call telephone support</p>  <p>  - Targeted letters, texts and phone calls</p>  <p>  - 1-to-1 Clinics </p>  <p>  These supports ensured that all farmers were able to access these important payments.</p></reply>

This follows consultation with the stakeholder representative Consultative Committee, earlier this year, which generated considerable feedback regarding, among other issues, proposals for limited afforestation within the SPAs. </p>  <p>  The timeline for the release of the draft Plan is a matter for the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. However, it should be noted that any afforestation within a Natura site must satisfy Article 6(3) of the Habitats Directive, and must also be agreed to by National Parks &amp;amp; Wildlife Service. Until the Threat Response Plan is completed, my Department will not be in a position to approve afforestation projects within the SPAs. </p>  <p>  The European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011, stipulates that any Minister considering a plan or project in a Special Protection Area (SPA) shall give consent for such a plan or project only after having determined that the plan or project shall not adversely affect the integrity of a European site. A series of judgements issued by the Court of Justice of the EU have stressed that there must be no doubt about possible adverse impacts in such decisions. In addition, under the European Union guidelines for State aid in the agricultural and forestry sectors and in rural areas, within Natura sites (i.e. SPAs and Special Areas of Conservation, or SACs), only afforestation consistent with the management objectives of the sites concerned, and agreed with the Member State&rsquo;s authority in charge of implementing Natura 2000 (in Ireland&rsquo;s case, the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht), shall be allowed.</p>  <p>  I fully recognise the importance of the preservation and conservation of the Hen Harrier and other protected bird species. My Department gives priority access to GLAS applicants with land in SPAs and supports them in adopting farming systems suitable to the protected species. Over 2,650 farmers currently have Hen Harrier actions under GLAS, covering in excess of 42,200 hectares of habitat. My Department is also funding a Hen Harrier Programme under the European Innovation Partnerships (EIP) measure. This particular programme, which has a budget of some &euro;25 million, focuses specifically on farmers managing habitat in the six Hen Harrier SPAs.</p></reply>

The focus has been on the staffing, infrastructural and information technology requirements that will arise in the context of the implementation of import controls at ports and airports on an East-West basis under the Central Case Scenario. </p>  <p>  These requirements are significant, and will arise in respect of the import of live animals, plants, and products of animal and plant origin from the UK into Ireland and the EU once the UK has become a third country, the conditions for which are set out in EU legislation.</p>  <p>  Budget 2019 included an allocation of &euro;3.75 million for the first phase in a process of recruitment of the necessary staff that will run until 2021. This will facilitate the recruitment of up to 116 staff across a range of work streams in 2019. This allocation forms part of a larger allocation of &euro;7 million in 2019 which will also address IT hardware and software requirements.  The Department is also continuing to engage with the Office of Public Works and with other Departments and agencies, including the Revenue Commissioners, on the additional physical infrastructure that will be required at ports and airports.</p>  <p>  More recently, the Department has been sharpening its focus on the potential response that may be necessary in the event of a disorderly Brexit at the end of March 2019.  The focus in this regard is on the arrangements that will be necessary in order to fulfil our legal obligations as efficiently as possible while also ensuring the minimum possible disruption to trading arrangements.</p>  <p>  As has been the case with planning for the central case scenario, the Department is focussing on staffing, infrastructural and IT aspects. It is also continuing its close co-operation with other Government departments and agencies, and is engaging in particular with the OPW in relation to the temporary physical infrastructure that may be required at port and airport locations in the event of a hard Brexit.</p></reply>

Such consignments will require SPS checks to be carried out at a designated border control post, following the departure of the United Kingdom from the European Union. In the event that a transition period is agreed between the UK and the EU as part of a withdrawal agreement, these checks will not apply until the end of the transition period. </p>  <p>  Rosslare has been identified as a port where SPS checks will need to be carried out and as such it will be required to have a designated border control post (BCP) in compliance with EU rules. Work is underway, in conjunction with the Office of Public Works (OPW), to identify a suitable site for the construction of a BCP at Rosslare Port. The BCP will be part of a multi-agency central compound. My Department will continue to liaise with the OPW and the other State bodies who will be sharing this facility, with a view to ensuring that the design meets all legislative requirements, works as efficiently and effectively as possible and maximises value for money, in particular through the sharing of facilities where this is provided for by the legislation.</p></reply>

This is a key part of our response to the challenges and uncertainty posed by Brexit, and in line with the market development theme of the Food Wise 2025 strategy. </p>  <p>  The opening of the Chinese market for Irish beef earlier this year was the culmination of significant work, over a number of years, and I am delighted that six Irish beef plants are currently approved to export beef to China.  Exports of Irish beef to China have already commenced.</p>  <p>  My officials are currently working towards progressing applications for additional beef plants approvals, in order to increase Ireland's ability to supply the market, and this was the subject of a bilateral technical meeting at Senior Official level in Beijing at the start of November. </p>  <p>  Although Ireland does not currently have access to the Chinese market for sheepmeat, this has also been discussed in recent months at both Ministerial and technical meetings. An invitation has been extended to the relevant Chinese authorities (GACC) to include a sheepmeat audit of Ireland in their 2019 schedule of audits. While the exact timelines for gaining sheepmeat access remain a matter for the Chinese authorities, DAFM hopes to progress this further in 2019.</p>  <p>  Last month, my colleague, Minister of State Andrew Doyle TD, had a series of political and promotional engagements at the China International Import Expo (CIIE) in Shanghai and at the Seafood Expo in Qingdao.  This follows the trade mission I led to China in May and an inward visit by the Chinese Minister for Agriculture in October, underlining our commitment to progressing key political and trade relationships with China.

Following consultations with stakeholders, Statutory Instrument (SI) No. 49 of 2016 was signed into law, establishing the legal basis for recognition in Ireland of Producer Organisations in the beef sector.</p>  <p>  In early January 2018, following a public procurement process, I announced the awarding of service contracts to seven different facilitators to provide advisory services to prospective Producer Organisations on their establishment and recognition as legal entities. The names and contact details of the approved facilitators can be found on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  My Department has also made provision under the Rural Development Programme for the funding of startup activities for beef Producer Organisations.  </p>  <p>  While producer organisations are part of the landscape in other beef-producing countries, particularly in France, the concept is novel to the Irish beef sector. However, I firmly believe that Producer Organisations could have a very positive role to play in the future development of the sector in Ireland. My Department is continuing in its efforts to drive the potential of this scheme through engagement with an array of stakeholders across different forums.</p></reply>

They play a significant role in stimulating price competition and provide an alternative market outlet for farmers. </p><p>During 1 January to 1 December 2018 live exports totalled 235,000 head of cattle, up 32% from 179,000 for the same period in 2017. This change was driven by a significant increase in exports to other EU countries.</p><p>Exports to third countries decreased in 2018 &ndash; due in part to currency fluctuations in the Turkish Lira. Nevertheless, nearly 13, 000 head of cattle were exported to Turkey to date this year.</p><p>The on-going search for new markets is a priority for my Department. In November my Department reached agreement with the Libyan authorities on veterinary health certificates for the export of breeding, fattening and slaughter cattle.  A new certificate for breeding cattle and an amended veterinary certificate for the export of fattening and slaughter cattle were agreed. Having an agreed health cert for breeding cattle provides much more clarity for exporters, as previously exports of breeding cattle to Libya had to be agreed on a load by load basis. The age of cattle that can be exported to Libya increased, from 24 to 30 months &ndash; this increases opportunities for exporters to export a wider range of cattle.  Live exports to Libya more than doubled this year to date compared to last year (from 1, 830 to 4,489).</p><p>Earlier this month, Minister of State for Trade, Employment, Business, EU Digital Single Market and Data Protection, Pat Breen TD, discussed the issue of animal health certificates with the Egyptian Deputy Minister for Agriculture. The Egyptian authorities indicated willingness to consider amending existing health certificates and putting a new certificate for breeding stock in place. My Department will continue to work with the Egyptian authorities on re-establishing live exports as soon as possible.</p><p>The prospects for live cattle exports remain good and my Department continues to engage with third countries and to seek out new markets for live exports.</p><p>Live Cattle Exports</p><p>Irish Live Cattle Exports, By Selected Country<table><tr><th></th><th>Week Ending</th><th></th><th>% Change</th><th></th><th>Overall To Date</th><th></th><th>% Change</th><th>Change (Head)</th></tr><tr><td>Country</td><td>02.12.2017</td><td>01.12.2018</td><td>Prev.

Salmon stocks are, therefore, managed on an individual river basis with each river having a Conservation Limit (CL) which is scientifically assessed on an annual basis by the independent Standing Scientific Committee for Salmon.</p>  <p>  River stocks can be harvested only where a sufficient surplus over the CL has been identified. where commercial fisheries exist, such surpluses are shared between stakeholders (anglers and commercial fishermen) via the representative District Fishery Committee.  Commercial fishing in estuaries is only permitted where all rivers contributing to the estuary are exceeding their individual CL so as to avoid indiscriminate exploitation.   </p>  <p>  Commercial fishing for salmon is by way of public licence. Licences are applied for and issued annually.  An annual public licence does not confer property or other rights on the holder and consequently licences are not transferable.  In that regard also, the issue of compensation does not arise. The Commercial fishing season generally opens in May of each year and notice of statutory provisions governing the application for, and issue of, licences and other conditions for 2019 will be notified in the first quarter of next year.</p>  <p>  The Salmon Hardship Scheme was introduced following the decision to cease, for conservation reasons, the commercial salmon mixed stock fishery in the sea. In excess of &euro;25 million was allocated to the scheme to facilitate payments to fishermen with a further &euro;5 million provided for community development projects. Under the scheme, fishermen active in the fishery could opt to voluntarily cease fishing in the commercial drift net and draft net sectors and undertake not to seek a licence in the future.</p>  <p>  I am advised that the average payment under the scheme was almost &euro;23,000.  The scheme closed for applications on 31 December 2007 and ceased in 2008 and I understand that all funds were expended and there are currently no plans to revisit such a scheme.</p>  <p>  The international dimension to the protection and conservation of Atlantic salmon is important. In that context, the Atlantic salmon resource is managed through the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organisation (NASCO) with which Ireland is aligned through the European Union.   </p>  <p>  Concerted international co-operation has ensured that restrictions in Greenland and Faroese waters, to where salmon from Irish rivers migrate to feed before returning in adulthood to their natal river, have been in place for a number of years.  In June this year, my officials and those of IFI joined delegates from the EU, USA, Canada, Norway, the Russian Federation, Greenland and the Faroes in securing a continuation of restrictions in these waters to offer a level of protection to Irish and other stocks.</p>  <p>  Ireland chaired the discussions on Faroese waters to where the majority of migrating fish originate in European, including Irish waters. Agreement was secured that there will be no commercial fishing in these waters.  The challenge of asserting and securing the conservation and protection imperatives for salmon stocks when they are migrating in international waters would be significantly harder if we were not managing towards those imperatives at home.</p></reply>

Investment in further renewable generation will be incentivised.</p>  <p>  The new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme, approved by government in July 2018, will provide for a renewable electricity ambition of 55% by 2030. Currently, 30% of our electricity is generated from renewables. </p>  <p>  I have secured Government approval to develop an all of Government plan which will set out the actions which must be taken to make Ireland a leader in responding to climate change. This Plan will include the steps which we must take in order to reach this target. I will work with colleagues across Government to develop new initiatives across electricity, transport and heat, as well as a range of other sectors.</p>  <p>  In all projected transitions to a low carbon economy by 2050, gas will continue to play a role. It plays an important role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the power generation, industrial and commercial, residential and transport sectors by replacing more Co2-intensive fossil fuels. In Ireland gas powered generation also provides an important back-up for intermittent renewable wind generation. </p>  <p>  So while gas usage will reduce significantly in the years ahead, Ireland will still need secure sources of gas. At present this is provided by both gas piped on shore from Irish gas fields and imports through gas pipelines from the UK. I have no plans to impose a ban on the use of natural gas derived from any particular source. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s energy policy is fully aligned with the EU&rsquo;s climate and energy objectives on the transition to decarbonisation, which includes continuous and on-going review of policies to reduce harmful emissions, improve energy efficiency, incentivise efficient and sustainable infrastructure investment, integrate markets, and promote research and innovation while ensuring our energy security of supply is maintained and enhanced.</p>  <p>  In relation to the production, sourcing, buying and selling of natural gas produced outside this jurisdiction, this is an operational matter for the undertakings involved.  Any undertaking would be required to comply with EU law in this area.</p></reply>

By 2020 it is expected that over 700 million smart meters will be installed globally. These new generation meters are being rolled out across Europe and internationally and when the upgrade completes in Ireland in 2024, all domestic and business premises will have a new, modern meter installed.</p>  <p>  The Smart Meter Programme is being coordinated by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities. ESB Networks are responsible for rolling out smart electricity meters and Gas Networks Ireland will be responsible for rolling out smart gas meters. </p>  <p>  Smart meters are considered safe. Health authorities around the world, including the World Health Organisation (WHO), have assessed the scientific evidence and there are no established health effects from smart meters. In the delivery of smart meters, ESB Networks and Gas Networks Ireland are required to ensure that any meters procured would, at a minimum, meet Irish and EU product health and safety legislation and standards which require manufacturers to ensure that any product placed on the market is safe. ESB Networks are currently in the process of procuring the necessary technical solutions to deliver smart electricity metering and more information about the type of technology will be available when this process concludes. The Commission for Regulation of Utilities will be monitoring this to ensure full compliance.</p></reply>

Since December 2015, the number of premises with access to high-speed broadband in Kildare has increased by 9,470, a 7% increase. In total, the number of premises in Kildare with access to high speed broadband is now 77,481, 84% of the total premises in the county. Another 741 will be served by eir under that company&rsquo;s ongoing rural deployment. </p>  <p>  The remaining 13,801 homes, schools and business in Kildare will be provided with access to this vital service under the Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan. </p>  <p>  In April 2017 my Department published an updated High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie. This map shows the areas targeted by commercial operators to provide high speed broadband services and the areas that will be included in the State Intervention Area under the National Broadband Plan. The Map is colour coded and searchable by address or Eircode.  </p>  <p>  The procurement process to appoint a bidder for the State intervention network is now at the final stage.  My priority is to bring the procurement process to a fair and impartial conclusion as quickly as possible.  My Department will conclude its assessment of the final tender submission received from the bidder on 18 September 2018 and I will bring a recommendation to Government in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

The demonstration project is developing and evaluating a model for the delivery of in-school and early years therapy support (both speech and language therapy and also occupational therapy), in a defined regional area (HSE CHO 7), across 75 schools and 75 early learning and care settings in conjunction with the Health Service Executive. The support provided by the project supplements and does not replace existing and/or planned additional or new HSE therapy services. Any existing HSE provision which is provided in pilot schools, or to pupils who attend the pilot schools, remains in place and is not being withdrawn during the project.</p>  <p>  Budget 2018 provided an additional &euro;2 million to the Department of Education/National Council for Special Education in 2018 to introduce a demonstration project for an in-school speech and language therapy service which is taking place over the course of the 2018/2019 school year. DES/NCSE funding for 2019 will be agreed as part of the 2019 estimates process. </p>  <p>  The pilot also seeks to focus on early intervention in order to support the greater inclusion of children with special educational needs in early education settings.  Additional funding of &euro;250,000 was allocated to the project by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs (DCYA) in 2018 through the Dormant Accounts Fund.  This funding is to allow the pilot to include early learning and care settings.  Funding of up to &euro;500,000 will be provided by DCYA in 2019 again from the Dormant Accounts Fund.</p></reply>

I take part in all cabinet discussions on homelessness and actively contribute across all policy responsibilities with my lens as the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs. </p>  <p>  I have had 8 bi-lateral discussions with the Ministers with responsibility for Housing, Planning and Local Government since my appointment as Minister to discuss child and family homelessness and the overall housing policy relating to legislative proposals and policy developments in this area. In addition, my advisers and the Department officials have engaged regularly with their counterparts from the Department of Housing on these matters. These interactions continue on an on-going basis. </p>  <p>  My focus in this area has been twofold; firstly, to ensure that all the additional supports children living in temporary accommodation need are in place, and secondly, to work with my Government colleagues to progress measures that prevent families becoming homeless. </p>  <p>  I am delighted to have led the establishment of the free childcare scheme for children living in emergency accommodation. It is a key priority for me to ensure that all children are accessing high-quality early childhood education and care during this formative time in their lives in order to avoid any long-term disadvantage on learning and education.  </p>  <p>  Children in emergency accommodation are also prioritised in the school completion programme.  This provides them with access to homework clubs, breakfast clubs, out of school activities such as sport, music and art, learning supports and therapeutic interventions. </p>  <p>  To combat educational disadvantage further, families in homelessness with school age children have free public transport to school.  </p>  <p>  Beyond my own Ministerial brief, I have contributed to Government policy on prevention of homelessness that is recognised as a key response to the on-going crisis. </p>  <p>  I have progressed a number of initiatives through my engagements with Minister Murphy which will help families to stay in their current homes in the private rented sector, including greater clarity as to what constitutes a Substantial Renovation, and further, the establishment of the forthcoming deposit protections scheme and providing greater powers to Residential Tenancies Board. Legislation on this effect is currently being drafted. </p>  <p>  I have also pursued other measures, in areas such as better regulation of the private rented sector, bringing vacant properties into social housing use and providing better protections to families in risk of homelessness through earlier access to Homeless HAP supports.  All of this work involves in-depth policy scrutiny and my advisers are engaging with advisers and officials from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government on these matters.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, I am committed to ensuring that we are building more social and affordable housing going forward.  This is the key element to reducing homelessness in the medium to long term. I have welcomed the establishment of the Land Development Agency which will ensure a more strategic State leadership in development of land going forward, which will contribute to a more stable and socially sustainable housing sector in Ireland.   I am engaging with Minister Murphy in ensuring the new Agency will deliver on housing affordability that will benefit all.</p></reply>

The initiative includes funding for the renovation and extension of production facilities, and the purchase of processing equipment. The initiative will also support participants in the artisan food and beverage sector in areas such as market development, competitiveness, and innovation.  </p>  <p>  The maximum amount of funding available is &euro;200,000 per project and funding will be provided for both capital investment and softer supports related to analysis and development or training. This includes support for collaborative proposals where food businesses jointly address common processing and marketing challenges.</p>  <p>  The initiative, which was launched in May this year, is managed by my Department with funding from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. The initiative is being delivered using the LEADER methodology. The LEADER Local Action Groups engage with potential applicants, evaluate applications and select projects which are then submitted for approval. The projects are jointly approved by my Department and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p>  <p>  A total of 15 projects have now been approved under the LEADER Food Initiative for funding of &euro;682,300. This funding will be drawn down as the projects are fully implemented. 12 of these projects were approved on 12th   December, and I understand that they will now be at the contracting stage with their LEADER Local Action Group.</p></reply>

It was put in place following a review of those two schemes, and consideration of a Value-for-Money review of the original RAPID programme that closed to new applications in 2011.</p><p>Combining these schemes makes for a more flexible, streamlined and targeted approach to providing funding to those communities most in need, while reducing the level of administration involved. </p><p>Under the new programme community groups in any area, regardless of its previous RAPID designation, can apply for funding. I have provided funding to each Local Authority (LA) area, taking into account levels of disadvantage and the overall population in each LA area.

The scheme is now funded by my Department and is administered through the Local Authorities.  </p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, there was no dedicated funding for this scheme for a number of years due to constraints on public expenditure.  However, I was very conscious of the underlying demand for the scheme in rural areas throughout the country. </p><p>I reintroduced the LIS in September 2017 and allocated a total of &euro;17.4 million to Local Authorities for LIS roads last year.</p><p>In February of this year, I allocated &euro;10.8 million to Local Authorities across the country under the 2018 LIS scheme, given the continuing level of demand for this funding in rural communities across Ireland.  I also asked the Local Authorities to prepare a secondary list of roads which they could complete if further funding became available for the scheme during the year. </p><p>Following on from this, on 26<sup>th </sup>October last, I announced a further round of almost &euro;10 million in funding to the Local Authorities.

At that point &euro;68.75 million had transferred into the fund from dormant accounts within relevant financial institutions for 2018.

The delivery of measures is a matter for each relevant Department, however, as part of our co-ordination of the fund and based on information provided by NTMA, the level of disbursement for 2018 is expected to amount to just over &euro;28 million.  Within my own Department the total voted allocation for Dormant Accounts measures in 2018 is &euro;10.08 million and expenditure of &euro;10.07 million has been incurred for 2018. </p>  <p>  Finally, at the end of November 2018 the balance in the fund was &euro;313.96 million and the reserve fund stood at &euro;86.64 million.  Commitments made in Dormant Accounts Action Plans have a total liability of &euro;82.37 million, of which &euro;4.87 million was met by end the November 2018.  Therefore, the amount of uncommitted funds at the end of November 2018 stood at &euro;149.82 million.

A significant level of support has been provided to Mountain Rescue Ireland and to the various mountain rescue teams throughout the country over the last number of years. </p>  <p>  I understand that the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport provides an average grant of approximately &euro;7,400 per annum for each individual MRI rescue team which helps defray their operational costs and with the provision of health and safety equipment. </p>  <p>  In 2016, through the former Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, a sum of &euro;66,245 was provided towards the insurance costs of Mountain Rescue Ireland for 2017.  In 2017, I provided &euro;88,816 towards the organisation's insurance costs for 2018 and, this year, I provided &euro;75,190 towards their insurance costs for 2019.</p>  <p>  As part of the CL&Aacute;R programme, in 2017 I introduced an initiative to support first-response organisations that provide much-needed emergency support services in rural areas in a voluntary capacity. Under this measure, and as part of a competitive process, &euro;361,116 was allocated to MRI teams towards the provision of 6 first-response vehicles. </p>  <p>  Under the 2018 CL&Aacute;R programme, MRI was approved &euro;200,000 in grant funding across 6 projects.</p>  <p>  Mountain rescue teams are staffed on a voluntary basis and provide an important service in rural Ireland.  In 2017, the 11 mountain rescue teams on the island of Ireland responded to 272 incidents.</p></reply>

Since then, I met with the members of Comhairle na Tuaithe on 13th February 2018, and Comhairle met on two further occasions, 16th May 2018 and 5th July 2018. </p>  <p>  My meeting with Comhairle on 13th February was to hear directly from the members their views on the recommendations of the independent review of Comhairle and the Countryside Recreation Strategy which was finalised in March 2016.  I also heard the members' views on the future direction of Comhairle and on the development of the outdoor recreation sector in Ireland generally. That meeting was very constructive in helping me to formulate proposals for the future development of the sector.</p>  <p>  My officials presented initial proposals to the Comhairle members at the meeting of 16th May 2018 and, through my officials, I received detailed feedback from the members on those proposals. I have considered that feedback in the context of a wider focus on the development of the rural recreation sector and I will make a final decision regarding the future mandate of Comhairle na Tuaithe shortly. </p>  <p>  Responsibility for the development of rural and outdoor recreation is shared across a number of Government Departments.  However, my Department supports rural recreation primarily through the Walks Scheme and the Outdoor Recreation Infrastructure Scheme.</p>  <p>  The Outdoor Recreation Infrastructure Scheme provides funding for the development of new outdoor recreation infrastructure and/or the maintenance, enhancement or promotion of existing outdoor recreation infrastructure in Ireland.  Over 500 projects around the country have been approved for funding of over &euro;20 million under this scheme since the end of 2016.</p>  <p>  The Programme for a Partnership Government includes a commitment to double the funding available for the Walks Scheme and to increase the number of trails covered.  Budget 2019 provided an increase in funding for the Walks Scheme, from &euro;2 million per annum, to &euro;4 million per annum from next year.  </p>  <p>  I will shortly be initiating a review of the operation of Walks Scheme which will inform decisions regarding the expansion of the scheme.  In order to be in a position to bring new trails on to the scheme as soon as possible, I will also be inviting Local Development Companies and Local Authorities to submit expressions of interest in respect of trails that meet specific qualifying criteria, to be considered for inclusion in the scheme. </p></reply>

The objective of the scheme is to provide regular, nutritious food to children who are unable, due to lack of good quality food, to take full advantage of the education provided to them.  The programme is an important component of policies to encourage school attendance and extra educational achievement.</p><p>The SMLPS provides funding directly from this Department to primary schools, post-primary schools, special schools, local groups and voluntary not-for-profit organisations operating their own school meals projects.</p><p>The USMS for primary schools is operated by the Local Authorities in some 300 schools and benefits approximately 74,000 children. It is part-financed by this Department with &euro;1.1m spent in 2017. Sixteen Local Authorities currently participate in the USMS providing &euro;1.1m in matching funding for food costs, as well as funding their own non-food administration costs. This scheme is administered and operated by the Local Authorities and provides meals to primary schools only. This Department accepts the recommendations of Local Authorities for the inclusion of schools in the scheme and reimburses the Local Authorities for up to 50% of the food costs. It is up to the Local Authorities/ Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government to monitor expenditure and carry out any audits of the scheme.</p><p>In relation to the SMLPS, in  recent years priority for new applications for funding had been given to schools which are part of the DEIS programme.</p><p>The Department commenced an inspection programme of schools participating in the SMLPS 2012 which involves on-site visits to the schools/organisations by Social Welfare Inspectors (SWIs).  The inspection programme has since been expanded and a three year programme is in place since September 2015 to cover all schools. Since 2012 a total of 1,564 inspections have been carried out. The number of individual schools inspected is higher because some organisations provide services to a number of schools, e.g. a School Completion Programme could support any number of schools but is treated as one organisation for inspection purposes. Details of the outcome of the inspection process are shared with the Department of Education and Skills (DES).</p><p>Some 300 organisations participate in both the USMS and the SMLPS.  Of those organisations inspected in 2016 and 2017, 31 and 47 respectively participated in both the USMS and SMLPS.  </p><p>Inspection results show a high rate of compliance with the terms and conditions of the Scheme.</p><p>Issues arising in &ldquo;Partially-Compliant&rdquo; and &ldquo;Non-Compliant&rdquo; organisations indicate non-compliance with specific scheme criteria e.g. unhealthy food items being supplied, inadequate  accounting procedures in place, poor record keeping.</p><p>Each organisation is contacted directly by School Meals Section and given detailed feedback on areas of non-compliance as well as the Department&rsquo;s follow-up actions. These organisations must provide evidence that issues raised have been addressed, within a timescale set by the Department. School Meals Scheme Section is informed of the issues and future applications for funding from these organisations are monitored for compliance with Scheme terms and conditions. Follow-up site visits are carried out by the Department&rsquo;s Inspectorate.

However, claims for means-tested payments, in particular, remain a challenge and given their nature can require more detailed engagement with the applicant, thereby lengthening the decision making process.  State pension non-contributory (SPNC) is a means tested pension with increasing complexity attached to the processing of applications.  These challenges can arise from the background and age of claimants, their possible multiple sources of income and savings which can also include stocks, shares and other assets.  In addition, an increasing number of claimants are born outside of Ireland and delays can occur while necessary supporting documentation for the pension application is being sourced either directly from the claimant or social security organisations in other jurisdictions.  In some instances, claimants do not provide the full information required at application stage.  This can slow down the processing of their claim and may result in the need for a visit by an inspector of the Department and perhaps multiple requests for further information before a final decision can be taken on the application.</p>  <p>  The SPNC scheme area has a performance target of 75% of new claims to be awarded within 12 weeks of receipt. I understand from my Department that in November 2018, the average time to award was 9 weeks and 80% of claims were awarded within the target timeframe.  I wish to assure the Deputy that prompt processing of claims remains a priority for me and that processing times are kept under constant review.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This is a reduction on the 2016 figure of 10.9%.  The 2017 at-risk-of-poverty rate for children was 18.4%, a slight reduction on the 2016 figure of 19.1% while the deprivation rate was 23.0%, down from 25.0% in 2016.  It should be noted that the SILC data from 2012 through to 2016 was revised by the CSO, resulting in some changes to previously published data.  However the CSO has stated that the revised estimates are not statistically significantly different from the pre-revision estimates </p><p>(<i>).</i></p><p>The National Policy Framework for Children and Young People (Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures), published by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in 2014, includes a target to reduce the number of children in consistent poverty by at least two-thirds of the 2011 level by 2020.  In 2011, the consistent poverty rate for children was 9.3%, equating to roughly 107,000 children.  By 2014, this had risen significantly to 12% (roughly 143,000 children).  The 2017 consistent poverty rate for children was 8.8%, equating to some 105,000 children. Therefore, meeting the 2020 target means lifting almost 68,000 children out of poverty by that date.  </p><p>Under the Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures Framework, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, in collaboration with my Department and other relevant Departments, is taking a whole-of-government approach to tackling child poverty.  This approach acknowledges that reducing child poverty is not just about income supports and welfare.  Rather it is also about supporting parents to make the transition into employment and assisting families through the provision of quality affordable services in areas such as education, health, housing and childcare.</p><p>Budget 2019, in line with budgets over the past 3 years, included measures specifically aimed at supporting families on low incomes through increases in qualified child rates (including the introduction of a higher rate for children over 12 years of age), increases in earnings disregards for One Parent Family and Jobseeker Transition payments, an increase in the Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance and the introduction of a hot meals pilot in the School Meals programme.</p><p>These increased supports along with increasing employment rates suggest that we can expect further decreases in the poverty rates once the 2018 figures become available. </p></reply>

This is defined as a &ldquo;<i>limitation in activities people usually do because of health problems for at least the past six months</i>&rdquo;.  The most recent available EU-SILC data from 2016 shows that the rate for people (aged 16 years and over) at risk of poverty or social exclusion, who are limited in their normal activities due to a health problem was 40.8% in Ireland, compared to the EU average of 30.1%.  </p><p>However, the CSO Survey on Income and Living Conditions provides data on people aged 16 years and over who are not at work due to illness or disability.  The most recent data from the 2017 Survey on Income and Living Conditions, published by the CSO this week, shows that the consistent poverty rate for people not at work due to illness or disability was 24%, a reduction on the 2016 figure of 25.9%.  The 2017 at-risk-of-poverty rate for people not at work due to illness or disability was 35.4%, down from 39.2% in 2016, while the 2017 deprivation rate was. 45.9% down from 47.0% in 2016.  It should be noted that the SILC data from 2012 through to 2016 was revised by the CSO, resulting in some changes to previously published data.  However the CSO has stated that the revised estimates are not statistically significantly different from the pre-revision estimates ).</p><p>It is recognised that the best route out of poverty and social exclusion is through paid employment and the Government is committed to increasing the employment opportunities for people with a disability which includes a range of specific income, activation and employment supports provided by my Department.  The Comprehensive Employment Strategy for people with disabilities adopts a cross-government approach that brings together various measures, to be taken by different Departments and State agencies, in a concerted effort to address the barriers and challenges that impact on the employment of people with disabilities.  These priorities are incorporated into the Pathways to Work Strategy and this ensures that there is an integrated focus on supports that enable people with disabilities to participate in employment where they have the capacity to do so.</p><p>The partial capacity benefit scheme enables recipients of invalidity pension and illness benefit to take-up employment, on a voluntary basis, while continuing to receive income support.  The Department manages a supported employment service (EmployAbility) which provides a dedicated job-coaching service for people with disabilities.  Intreo services are also available to provide employment support services for people with disabilities who wish to engage with the service on a voluntary basis.  There is also a focus on supports available to employers who employ people with disabilities such as the Wage Subsidy Scheme and the Workplace Equipment Adaption Grant Scheme.  In addition, &euro;300,000 has been allocated in Budget 2019, to commission research on the additional costs of living with a disability. </p><p>The improvement in the economy, together with the welfare measures referred to, are likely to have supported a further reduction in the rate of people at risk of poverty or social exclusion by limitation in activities in the period since 2016, including for people with disabilities.

The 2016 EU average was 15.7%.  The most recent national Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC) data for 2017, released by the CSO this week, reflects this.  The 2017 consistent poverty rate for households with one adult and children under 18 years of age is 20.7%, a reduction on the 2016 figure of 23.2% but still considerably above the national average.</p>  <p>  However, macro-economic and labour market indicators have shown continued economic and employment growth in the last number of years.  Unemployment has fallen from 6.8% in mid-2017 to 5.3% in November 2018.  The number of people in receipt of working-age income and employment supports has also continued to fall.  With the improvement in the fiscal situation, the Government was in a position to introduce a range of welfare increases from 2016 onwards.  This includes a package of measures to support lone parents, encouraging them into the workplace and into education and helping to reduce their childcare costs.  Budget 2019 increased the weekly rate by &euro;5 for core welfare payments, including the One Parent Family Payment and the Jobseekers Transition Payment; increased the income disregards for both these payments to &euro;150 per week and increased the qualified child rate with a higher rate introduced for children over 12 years of age.  The Back to Work Family Dividend and the Working Family Payment also helps people with families who are entering into employment.  In 2017, social transfers reduced the national at-risk-of-poverty rate from 32.3% to 15.7% after social transfers.  This equates to a poverty reduction effect of 51% in 2017; ensuring Ireland remains one of the best performing EU countries in reducing poverty through social transfers. </p>  <p>  The improvement in the economy, together with the welfare measures referred to, have contributed to the reduction in poverty levels that are evident in the recently released 2017 SILC data.  As the economy continues to improve and families on low incomes experience the benefits of the welfare increases announced in Budget 2018 and Budget 2019, I expect to see further reductions in poverty levels, including those of lone parent families and improvements in living standards.</p></reply>

The most recent CSO Survey on Income and Living Conditions data from 2017, released this week, show the at-risk-of-poverty rate was 5.4% for those aged 16 years or over with a principal economic status of &lsquo;at work&rsquo;, a reduction on the 2016 figure of 5.8%.  This is considerably lower than the 2017 national at-risk-of-poverty rate which was 15.7%, down from 16.2% in 2016.  The most recent available data from Eurostat is from 2016 and shows an EU average 'in-work poverty' rate of 9.6%.</p><p>It should be noted that the SILC data from 2012 through to 2016 was revised by the CSO, resulting in some changes to previously published data.

The Working Family Payment (WFP) (formerly known as Family Income Supplement) and the Back to Work Family Dividend (BTWFD) are important in-work supports for this group.  The WFP is an in-work support which provides an income top-up for employees on low earnings with children.  It is designed to prevent in-work poverty for low paid workers with child dependants and to offer a financial incentive to take-up employment.  The BTWFD is a targeted scheme designed to further improve the incentive to take-up employment or self-employment for welfare recipients with children.</p><p>The improvement in the economy, together with the welfare measures referred to, have contributed to the reduction in poverty levels that are evident in the recently released 2017 SILC data.

Although the system change has worked effectively for over 80% of IB customers, significant difficulties arose following implementation for a number of customers. </p>  <p>  My Department took three main steps to resolve the issues impacting on payments.  First, it deployed additional staff to process works and respond to the customer enquiries.  Second, it developed some new IT "workarounds" that address the payment gap issues and to ensure a faster flow-through to payments.  Third, it continued to review the design rules in the system to afford greater flexibility in processing of claims and certificates.</p>  <p>  I believe we have made good progress in this regard, with payment levels returned to and maintained at the expected norm, (over 50,000 customers paid each week) for the past two months.  Arrears payments have also been made to customers who were delayed payments.  Telephone helpline and call handling performance has also been addressed and is now back to normal levels. Currently, people who are due a payment and whose certificates and claims are in order now receive their payment entitlement promptly.  In stating this it is important to note that there are always cases, and were always such cases under the old system, where people's payments are legitimately stopped or paused for a variety of reasons. In addition there will always be cases where errors are made that impact payments to individual customers. While we endeavour to keep these to a minimum it is inevitable that some errors will be made in an Illness Benefit scheme that processes over 9,000 transactions per day.</p>  <p>  In order to ensure that we learn from the lessons of the transition of the IB system onto a new platform, I have arranged for an independent review into how the changes to IB were planned, implemented and &ndash; importantly &ndash; communicated to customers.  I expect this work to be completed early in 2019.  </p>  <p>  Finally, I would like to sincerely apologise again for the difficulties and burden experienced by customers earlier this year and believe the action taken to address these issues  has worked and is continuing to work  to ensure customers receive  a good standard of service.  </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

In any year about 85% of all claims are awarded by the Department and just 1% are appealed.  Nevertheless, the Department is concerned that these cases are dealt with as quickly as possible.</p><p>Accordingly, significant efforts and resources have been devoted to reforming the appeal process in recent years.  As a result, appeal processing times in respect of all schemes improved between 2011 and 2017 from 52.5 weeks for an oral hearing in 2011 to 26.4 weeks in 2017 and from 25.1 weeks for a summary decision in 2011 to 19.8 weeks in 2017. The corresponding processing times for the period January to November 2018 are 30.1 weeks for an oral hearing and 25.1 weeks for a summary decision.</p><p>The time taken to process an appeal reflects a number of factors including that the appeals process is a quasi-judicial process with appeals officers being required to decide all appeals on a &lsquo;de-novo&rsquo; basis.  In addition, appeals decisions are themselves subject to review by the High Court and decisions have to be formally written up to quasi-judicial standards.  Other factors that influence appeals processing times include the quality of the initial decision &ndash; in this respect the Department has changed the decisions process in respect of medical schemes, in order to provide more information to the claimant.  I expect that this will help to reduce the number of appeals over time.</p><p>In addition, a number of new Appeals Officers have joined the Appeals Office over the past 12-18 months, to replace staff leaving on retirement.  Given the complexity of the appeals process it takes some time for new staff to be trained up and develop expertise and this has led to somewhat longer processing times during this period.  The Chief Appeals Officer has advised me that appeal processing times continue to be a priority for her Office. </p><p>Finally, where a claimant has been refused a social welfare payment, regardless of the scheme involved, and is appealing that decision, if their means are insufficient to meet their needs it is open to them to apply for supplementary welfare allowance in the interim.  </p><p>If their application for supplementary welfare allowance is refused, they can also appeal that decision.  The supplementary welfare allowance appeal will be prioritised for attention within the Appeals Office as soon as the appeal file and submission is received from my Department.</p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p><p><b>Appeal Processing Times by Scheme 1 January 2018 &ndash; 30 November 2018</b><table><tr><th>-</th><th>Average processing times (weeks) Summary Decisions</th><th>Average processing times (weeks) Oral Hearings</th></tr><tr><td>Blind Person&rsquo;s Pension</td><td>34.2</td><td>24.1</td></tr><tr><td>Carer&rsquo;s Allowance</td><td>24.2</td><td>28.5</td></tr><tr><td>Carer&rsquo;s Benefit</td><td>22.3</td><td>25.5</td></tr><tr><td>Child Benefit</td><td>36.0</td><td>43.1</td></tr><tr><td>Disability Allowance</td><td>17.4</td><td>23.9</td></tr><tr><td>Illness Benefit</td><td>30.7</td><td>36.5</td></tr><tr><td>Partial Capacity Benefit</td><td>32.6</td><td>29.7</td></tr><tr><td>Domiciliary Care Allowance</td><td>31.7</td><td>36.4</td></tr><tr><td>Deserted Wife&rsquo;s Allowance</td><td>70.6 (1 case)</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Deserted Wife&rsquo;s Benefit</td><td>-</td><td>69.1 (5 cases)</td></tr><tr><td>Farm Assist</td><td>42.0</td><td>41.6</td></tr><tr><td>Bereavement Grant</td><td>36.1</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Working Family Payment </td><td>29.7</td><td>40.1</td></tr><tr><td>Invalidity Pension</td><td>24.4</td><td>30.1</td></tr><tr><td>Liable Relatives</td><td>44.0</td><td>30.7</td></tr><tr><td>Maternity Benefit</td><td>30.4</td><td>30.7</td></tr><tr><td>Paternity Benefit</td><td>32.7</td><td>23.0</td></tr><tr><td>One Parent Family Payment</td><td>32.0</td><td>36.8</td></tr><tr><td>State Pension (Contributory)</td><td>39.3</td><td>50.8</td></tr><tr><td>State Pension (Non-Contributory)</td><td>31.8</td><td>43.2</td></tr><tr><td>Occupational Injury Benefit</td><td>36.4</td><td>50.7</td></tr><tr><td>Disablement Pension</td><td>34.3</td><td>33.1</td></tr><tr><td>OIB-Medical Care</td><td>17.5</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Incapacity Supplement</td><td>38.7</td><td>29.7</td></tr><tr><td>Guardian's Payment (Contributory)</td><td>29.8</td><td>28.9</td></tr><tr><td>Guardian's Payment (Non-Con)</td><td>17.2</td><td>29.6</td></tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Allowance (Means)</td><td>32.1</td><td>37.2</td></tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Allowance (Payments)</td><td>25.2</td><td>31.3</td></tr><tr><td>BTW Family Dividend</td><td>30.8</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Transitional</td><td>30.7</td><td>30.8</td></tr><tr><td>Recoverable Benefits &amp;amp; Assistance</td><td>34.9</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Pre-Retirement Allowance</td><td>64.0 (1 case)</td><td>29.9</td></tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Benefit</td><td>25.1</td><td>28.9</td></tr><tr><td>Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant </td><td>28.3</td><td>32.8</td></tr><tr><td>Insurability of Employment</td><td>53.8</td><td>65.0</td></tr><tr><td>Supplementary Welfare Allowance</td><td>21.2</td><td>29.5</td></tr><tr><td>Widow/Widower's Pension (Contributory)</td><td>35.0</td><td>33.3</td></tr><tr><td>Widow/Widower's Pension (Non-Contributory)</td><td>29.9</td><td>25.7</td></tr><tr><td>Widowed Parent Grant</td><td>45.1</td><td>43.7</td></tr><tr><td>All Appeals</td><td>25.1</td><td>30.1</td></tr></table></p></reply>

First, through policies set out in the Action Plan for Jobs, to create an environment in which business can succeed and create jobs; and second, through Pathways to Work to ensure that as many of these new jobs and other vacancies that arise in our economy are filled by people taken from the Live Register, and in particular the long-term unemployed. </p><p>To date, these policies have been effective in reducing long-term unemployment.  For example, the most recent data from the Labour Force Survey shows that the rate of long-term unemployment in Ireland has fallen from a peak of 9.5% in 2012 to 2.1%. by the third quarter of 2018.  Ireland has thus already brought the long term unemployment rate below 2.5%, a target set out in <i>Pathways to Work</i>2016-2020.</p><p>Activation policy continues to focus on support measures for the long-term unemployed. The <i>Pathways to Work 2016-2020</i>strategy prioritises long-term unemployed people, most notably through the roll-out of JobPath to engage more systematically with this group; targeted wage subsidies under JobsPlus; and through reserved places for long-term unemployed jobseekers on employment and training programmes.  </p><p>The table below shows the most recent end of month statistics on the number of people availing of a range of programmes targeted primarily at the long-term unemployed.

The programme assists participants to enhance and develop both their technical and personal skills, which can then be used in the workplace.  Participation on CE is intended to be for a temporary fixed-term.  There are participation time limits in place to ensure that as many unemployed people as possible are able to benefit from the scheme.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that the welcome increase in the number of people at work and the continued reduction in Live Register numbers is a factor in recruitment to all work programmes.</p>  <p>  Nevertheless, it should be noted that I have implemented a number of changes to the terms and conditions of participation on CE.  The main purpose of these changes is to broaden the availability to a greater number of people on the Live Register and to standardise other conditions around the length of time a person can participate on a programme. </p>  <p>  The general qualifying age for CE for those on the Live Register was reduced from 25 to 21 years.  It is now easier for previous participants, who have exhausted their CE entitlement, to re-qualify as participation prior to the year 2007 is disregarded.  There is an overall limit of 6 years participation from 2007 (7 years if on a disability payment).  While participants between 21 and 55 years on CE are entitled to one year on the programme, this can be extended by up to 2 more years if they are engaged in a recognised training or education award that is helping them progress towards employment.  All CE participants age 55 and over can avail of 3 consecutive years on a CE scheme.  Since 1st June, I am also facilitating persons to take up a placement on CE while also attending their JobPath provider.</p>  <p>  Participants over age 62 are allowed to participate on a continuous basis up to the State Pension age on the CE Service Support Stream (SSS), subject to availability of places on the SSS, satisfactory performance on the scheme and to annual approval by the Department.  The places allocated for these participants within each individual CE scheme are subject to limitation criteria.  </p>  <p>  The Government is very mindful of the large number of work programme places involved in service delivery and other valuable services around the country.  In this regard if any scheme is experiencing particular recruitment difficulties, they should contact their local Department Intreo Centre for assistance.</p></reply>

First, through policies set out in the Action Plan for Jobs, to create an environment in which business can succeed and create jobs; and second, through the Pathways to Work Strategy 2016-2020, to ensure that as many of these new jobs and other vacancies that arise in our economy are filled by people taken from the Live Register, including young people. </p><p>To date, these policies have been effective in increasing the numbers of young people at work and reducing youth unemployment.  </p><p>The number of young people at work rose from an average of 197,000 in 2012 to 262,200 by the third quarter of 2018. </p><p>Latest available data from the CSO shows that Irish youth unemployment has fallen from a peak of 31.2% in 2012 to 12.3% in November 2018 and now lies below the EU average of 15%.

Under the Youth Guarantee process case officers engage with unemployed young people, on a monthly basis, to prepare and implement personal progression plans for employment. Where young people do not find work quickly, additional supports are offered through places on employment and training schemes, which are closely aligned to the needs of the labour market.  </p><p>For those who do not find employment, through the process just described, further education or training programmes such as; in existing community-based employment programmes/workplace based interventions such as Community Employment and T&uacute;s; or in subsidies to employers, through JobsPlus Youth.

In any year about 85% of all claims are awarded by the Department and just 1% are appealed.  Nevertheless, the Department is concerned that these cases are dealt with as quickly as possible.</p><p>Accordingly, significant efforts and resources have been devoted to reforming the appeal process in recent years.  As a result, appeal processing times in respect of all schemes improved between 2011 and 2017 from 52.5 weeks for an oral hearing in 2011 to 26.4 weeks in 2017 and from 25.1 weeks for a summary decision in 2011 to 19.8 weeks in 2017. The corresponding processing times for the period January to November 2018 are 30.1 weeks for an oral hearing and 25.1 weeks for a summary decision.</p><p>The time taken to process an appeal reflects a number of factors including that the appeals process is a quasi-judicial process with appeals officers being required to decide all appeals on a &lsquo;de-novo&rsquo; basis.  In addition, appeals decisions are themselves subject to review by the High Court and decisions have to be formally written up to quasi-judicial standards.  Other factors that influence appeals processing times include the quality of the initial decision &ndash; in this respect the Department has changed the decisions process in respect of medical schemes, in order to provide more information to the claimant.  I expect that this will help to reduce the number of appeals over time.</p><p>In addition, a number of new Appeals Officers have joined the Appeals Office over the past 12-18 months, to replace staff leaving on retirement.  Given the complexity of the appeals process it takes some time for new staff to be trained up and develop expertise and this has led to somewhat longer processing times during this period.  The Chief Appeals Officer has advised me that appeal processing times continue to be a priority for her Office. </p><p>Finally, it should be noted that an appellant can claim supplementary welfare allowance pending the outcome of their appeal.</p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p><p><b>Appeal Processing Times by Scheme 01 January 2017- 30 November 2017</b><table><tr><th>-</th><th>Average processing times (weeks) Summary Decisions</th><th>Average processing times (weeks) Oral Hearings</th></tr><tr><td>Adoptive Benefit</td><td>13.4</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Blind Person&rsquo;s Pension </td><td>20.2</td><td>24.4</td></tr><tr><td>Carer&rsquo;s Allowance</td><td>21.5</td><td>23.9</td></tr><tr><td>Carer&rsquo;s Benefit</td><td>16.9</td><td>21.3</td></tr><tr><td>Child Benefit</td><td>22.7</td><td>32.2</td></tr><tr><td>Disability Allowance</td><td>17.4</td><td>24.0</td></tr><tr><td>Illness Benefit</td><td>28.1</td><td>30.3</td></tr><tr><td>Partial Capacity Benefit</td><td>34.8</td><td>34.3</td></tr><tr><td>Domiciliary Care Allowance</td><td>26.5</td><td>33.6</td></tr><tr><td>Deserted Wife&rsquo;s Benefit</td><td>13.1</td><td>27.7</td></tr><tr><td>Farm Assist</td><td>20.7</td><td>25.7</td></tr><tr><td>Bereavement Grant</td><td>15.1</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Working Family Payment</td><td>21.7</td><td>32.8</td></tr><tr><td>Invalidity Pension</td><td>16.6</td><td>23.6</td></tr><tr><td>Liable Relatives</td><td>20.6</td><td>24.1</td></tr><tr><td>Maternity Benefit</td><td>18.8</td><td>20.1</td></tr><tr><td>Paternity Benefit</td><td>19.4</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>One Parent Family Payment</td><td>24.0</td><td>34.9</td></tr><tr><td>State Pension (Contributory)</td><td>31.9</td><td>46.4</td></tr><tr><td>State Pension (Non-Contributory)</td><td>25.9</td><td>35.5</td></tr><tr><td>State Pension (Transition)</td><td>81.1 (1 case)</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Occupational Injury Benefit</td><td>19.8</td><td>26.4</td></tr><tr><td>Disablement Pension</td><td>24.6</td><td>28.8</td></tr><tr><td>OIB-Medical Care</td><td>-</td><td>27.3</td></tr><tr><td>Incapacity Supplement</td><td>54.2 (1 case)</td><td>37.2</td></tr><tr><td>Guardian's Payment (Contributory)</td><td>24.4</td><td>26.1</td></tr><tr><td>Guardian's Payment (Non-Contributory)</td><td>16.0</td><td>23.4</td></tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Allowance (Means)</td><td>19.4</td><td>26.8</td></tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Allowance</td><td>17.7</td><td>25.0</td></tr><tr><td>BTW Family Dividend</td><td>19.7</td><td>27.5</td></tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Transitional</td><td>23.2</td><td>23.2</td></tr><tr><td>Recoverable Benefits &amp;amp;

The &lsquo;Roadmap for Pensions Reform 2018-2023', which I launched in February 2018, details specific time-lined actions Government will take to reform our pension system.  This includes the introduction, from 2022, of an &lsquo;Automatic Enrolment&rsquo; retirement savings system, for those without personal retirement savings.  This project timeframe reflects the scale of such a programme and its importance as being the most fundamental reform of the Irish supplementary pension system in generations.</p>  <p>  A new &lsquo;Automatic Enrolment Programme Management Office&rsquo; within my Department has started the work required to establish the evidence base which will inform future Government decisions regarding the design of the system.  An Interdepartmental Programme Board has also been established to provide strategic direction to automatic enrolment. </p>  <p>  In August, I launched a national consultation process and a &lsquo;Strawman Proposal for Automatic Enrolment&rsquo;.  This is intended to help the Government in considering the operational structure and design decisions that it will need to be make.  The Strawman is a high level draft intended to generate and prompt discussion and improve ideas and should not, in any way, be construed as a confirmation of what form AE will ultimately take.</p>  <p>  More than 100 submissions were received by the 4th November closing date from employer and employee representative organisations, industry bodies, advocacy groups and interested individuals. My officials have met with many of these groups.  I also chaired a number of public consultation seminars held in Dublin, Galway and Cork.  </p>  <p>  In addition, officials have provided a dedicated briefing session for members of the Oireachtas and also attended a special meeting of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection to discuss Automatic Enrolment.   </p>  <p>  My Department is now assessing the submissions made during the public consultation process.  In addition it is building further evidence through ongoing consultations, and it is sponsoring impact assessments.  These need to be completed and conclusions drawn before Government can make definitive decisions regarding the operational and design characteristics for automatic enrolment so that the first members would be enrolled in the new system in 2022.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This approach is expected to significantly benefit many people, particularly women, whose work history includes an extended period of time outside the paid workplace, while raising families or in a caring role.  It will make it easier for pensioners assessed under the current yearly average model, to qualify for a higher rate of the State Pension (contributory).   No-one will lose as a result of this option, and people will be paid whichever model produces the higher payment.</p>  <p>  It was announced at that time, in January 2018, that the number of years required under this approach ("TCA2012") would be 40, and this was set out in the legislation before the Houses of the Oireachtas this month.  While it will not become law until enactment, is has been clearly planned that it be based on 40 years since it was announced, and that position has not changed.</p>  <p>  40 years was chosen based upon it being a reasonable figure, commonly used in other pension schemes and systems, and with an allowance of up to 20 years of HomeCaring periods, it means a maximum pension can be earned with just 20 years of paid contributions, which would be generous by international standards.  The balance between years required and homecaring periods allowed for was decided by Government in the context of representations that had been made by various stakeholders, the Exchequer funds available, the sustainability of the pension system, and the principles of fairness and gender equality.  An alternative balance - for example, 30 years required, but only 10 years of homecaring periods, all post-1994, as originally proposed in the National Pensions Framework - would have been more advantageous for some pensioners, but would have been of limited benefit for women who were most affected by the 2012 rateband changes.</p>  <p>  I launched a public consultation on the design of the full TCA to be introduced from 2020 on the 28th of May to which stakeholder groups were invited including the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  A number of workshops were also held on the day to elicit views and feedback.  All Oireachtas members were also invited to a briefing in Leinster House.  The consultation was open for over 3 months and we received almost 300 responses from individuals and organisations including open written submissions.  Those submissions outlined the views of respondents upon a number of issues, including the number of years required for a full pension, as intended as part of the consultation process. </p>  <p>  There has been no decision on the number of years required to qualify for a maximum rate pension under the Total Contributions Approach that will apply from 2020.  Analysis of the views submitted is being finalised, and I understand will be submitted to me in the coming months.  When I have considered this analysis, I will bring a proposal to Government in due course.  The scheme will be introduced through the standard democratic process, and the balance of the proposal will, I believe, be broadly debated by members of the Oireachtas.    </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the performance of his functions under the Acts and the making of valuations for rating is his sole responsibility. I, as Minister, have no function in decisions in this regard. <b></b></p><p>The Deputy may be aware that, under the relevant legislation, there is a distinct separation of function between the valuation of rateable property and the setting and collection of commercial rates. The amount of rates payable in any calendar year is a product of the valuation set by the Commissioner of Valuation, multiplied by the Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV) decided annually by the elected members of each local authority.<b></b></p><p>Having a modern valuation base is very important for the levying of commercial rates on a fair and equitable basis across all economic sectors. The Valuation Acts provide for the revaluation of all rateable property within a rating authority area so as to reflect changes in value due to economic factors such as business turnover, differential movements in property values or other external factors and changes in the local business environment.<b></b></p><p>A valuation for commercial rates purposes is arrived at by estimating the <i>Net Annual Value</i>(NAV) of the property in question, at a specified valuation date. The term &ldquo;net annual value&rdquo; has a legal definition and is set out in section 48 of the Valuation Act 2001 as &ldquo;the rent for which, one year with another, the property might, in its actual state, be reasonably expected to let from year to year, on the assumption that the probable average annual cost of repairs, insurance and other expenses (if any) that would be necessary to maintain the property in that state, and all rates and other taxes payable in respect of the property, are borne by the tenant&rdquo;. This definition of Net Annual Value is applied to all rateable properties and on a nationwide basis. </p><p>Estimating the NAV of a rateable property is an evidence-based exercise. During a revaluation, the Valuation Office analyses relevant market rental transactions for all rateable properties, including service stations, in accordance with the legislation, best practice internationally as set out in published Practice Guidance Notes, well-established valuation principles and case law arising from the independent Valuation Tribunal and the higher Courts. The conclusion drawn from that analysis is applied to similarly circumstanced property using the &ldquo;comparative&rdquo; method of valuation which, as the name implies, employs direct comparison with other similar properties.<b></b></p><p>There are a number of avenues of redress for an occupier of rateable property who is dissatisfied with a determination of valuation made under the provisions of the Valuation Acts, 2001-2015. Firstly, before a determination is made, there is a right to make representations to the Valuation Office in relation to a proposed valuation. Later in the process, if the occupier is still dissatisfied with the determination, there is a right of appeal to the Valuation Tribunal which is an independent body set up for the purpose of hearing appeals against determinations of the Valuation Office. There is a right of appeal to the Higher Courts on a point of law. Appeals are made on an individual case basis. However, the decision in one case can have relevance in other similar cases.</p><p>There is no provision in the legislation for taking a &ldquo;class&rdquo; or group appeal before the Tribunal, as each case is considered on its individual merits and by reference to the specific circumstances of the property. However, individual appellants can make arguments to the Valuation Tribunal in relation to their concerns about the overall valuation methodology adopted by the Valuation Office for a specific category of rateable property.</p><p>Notwithstanding this, I am informed that it is possible for a Test case to be heard by the Valuation Tribunal. In order to proceed with a Test case all parties involved must agree that such an approach is appropriate.  In addition, such a process must be entered into on the clear understanding that the determination of the Valuation Tribunal in the test case would set a precedent which would without exception apply to the remaining cases identified as being part of the test case series and only these cases.  All cases involved would have to be similarly circumstanced.  A test case would be identified and nominated through mutual agreement.  This particular case would then be heard by the Valuation Tribunal.  </p><p>The need for attention to detail and confirmation of such cannot be underestimated in the use of a test case.  The determination of the Valuation Tribunal would be applied to the nominated test case and all other cases identified as being part of the test case series and only these cases.  The Valuation Tribunal would be advised in advance that the case being heard was a test case and would be relevant for these other cases. The right of appeal to the Higher Courts on a point of law for either the appellant or respondent still applies in a test case situation.  <b></b></p></reply>

All withdrawals are notified by the lender and the underlying reasons for withdrawal are not indicated. However, it is known that the 1,162 cases included some 500 applications that were incorrectly submitted by lenders in the early stages of the scheme when lenders were not familiar with the scheme's purpose and operation.</p><p>Not all MTR applications will develop into fully completed transactions given the understandable reluctance of those in mortgage arrears to lose ownership of their houses.  Such a decision cannot be taken lightly and so the process allows the borrower enough time to consider the option of MTR.  If other options rather than losing home ownership are put forward by the lender, a borrower is more likely to avail of these other options.  This is particularly the case in the context of a now improving economy.</p><p>A Review of the MTR scheme, published on 8 February 2017, introduced a range of amendments to the eligibility criteria and administration of the scheme in order to improve its operation.  The Review, available at the following link: , explored the avenues and impediments to participation in the scheme and recommended a number of actions to make the scheme work better for borrowers.  My Department and the Housing Agency are working with all stakeholders to ensure that the actions set out in the Review are being effectively implemented to benefit a greater number of households.  The eligibility requirements of the scheme were widened to include a greater number of borrowers and a larger number of property types.  Increasing awareness and understanding of the scheme has been a priority and a new website - www.mortgagetorent.ie - dedicated to guiding and advising borrowers has been developed.  In addition, new structures and arrangements have been put in place to encourage a greater number of entities to take part in the scheme.</p><p>It is the case and will continue to be the case that MTR applications may be withdrawn by the borrower or the lender.  However, the implementation of the resulting actions from the Review means that MTR can be a long-term solution for more households in mortgage distress.</p></reply>

In 2017 expenditure of &euro;64,167 was incurred in respect of social media relating to the  Creative Ireland programme.  This arose from a comprehensive citizen engagement programme to showcase the range and depth of Ireland's cultural and creative offering and to encourage participation in arts and creative activities as a means of individual, collective and societal well-being.  The vision of the Creative Ireland Programme is that every person in Ireland should have the opportunity to realise their full creative potential.  This represents a new approach to creativity and cultural policy and therefore required a sustained communications programme in 2017.  A combination of approaches and platforms were used to maximise impact, taking account of the diversity of the target audiences.  For further information on expenditure please see website on</p><p>The Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g regional radio and social media cost of &euro;48,780 was for a four week campaign from mid-May to mid-June 2018 to promote the 500 events taking place across the country as part of the inaugural Cruinniu na nOg day of creativity for children and young people.  Three bespoke videos were produced to support and raise awareness of Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g - Ireland's new national day of Creativity for children and young people - at a cost of &euro;24,815.</p><p>In addition to promoting interest in specific initiatives such as Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g, social media is also actively used to support and promote the Creative Ireland Programme generally as well as specific creative endeavours and partner activities.  During 2018, specific short videos were also commissioned to promote various aspects or pillars of the Creative Ireland Programme. These included a specially commissioned spoken word piece by Stephen James Smith to mark the publication of 31 Local Authority Culture and Creativity Strategies in September accompanied by five short videos to illustrate the breadth and range of activities supported by the local authority Creative Ireland Programmes; and a video to mark the roll out of the Creative Schools initiative in 150 schools nationwide, in partnership with the Arts Council and the Department of Education and Skills.</p><p>All these videos are available at .</p><p>A full breakdown of all costs in 2018 in relation to these activities will be published on the Creative Ireland website  The following table summarises the above mentioned expenditures.<table><tr><th>Creative Ireland Expenditure Summary</th><th>2018</th></tr><tr><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>-</div></td></tr><tr><td>Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Regional radio &amp;amp; social media campaign </td><td>&euro;48,780 </td></tr><tr><td>3 Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g videos </td><td>&euro;24,815 </td></tr><tr><td>Creative Ireland Programme  </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Social Media content - uploading of articles daily throughout 2018 </td><td>&euro;66,420 </td></tr><tr><td>12 videos </td><td>&euro;93,110 </td></tr></table>A similar level of  expenditure  is expected in 2019.</p><p>I am also advised that the Culture Ireland Unit has this year engaged Mr. Nik Quaife on a 1 year contract for the provision of services including a communications strategy for its GB18 programme, to celebrate and renew Ireland&rsquo;s cultural relationship with Britain.  The total value of this contract is &euro;50,000, with expenditure to date of &euro;47,800.</p><p>The Department has also engaged D&rsquo;Arcy Marketing and BigO at a cost of &euro;17,466 and &euro;6,125 respectively to promote awareness of the 2018 European Personnel Selection Office (EPSO) campaign for the recruitment of Irish language translators to the institutions of the European Union.</p><p>Value for money is a critical consideration at all times in assessing whether external firms should be engaged to provide services of this nature.</p></reply>
