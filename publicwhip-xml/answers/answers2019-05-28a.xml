When we get this right, the benefits for the child, and for us all, are considerable.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-05-28a.12.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019052800050#WRA00900"><p>I thank the Deputy for her important question. Maintaining consistent high standards in residential care is a challenge across many jurisdictions where the work involves caring for adolescents, many with traumatic histories, complex behaviour and ambivalence about their placement.  </p>  <p>  Residential care is a small, but vital part of our care system and the basis for successful outcomes for the young people relies on the experience, quality and resilience of the management and staff group. </p>  <p>  Approximately 6 % of children in care - 376 at the end of February - live in residential settings, and 238 of these children live in privately managed centres commissioned by Tusla. Included in this number are older teenage separated children seeking asylum or those received in care from the Irish Refugee Protection Programme. </p>  <p>  Residential settings care for a very small number of children, often two or three. Some are single occupancy, where the largest  centres for separated children have, on average, six young people. </p>  <p>  All centres are inspected against the relevant standards and regulations and additionally Tulsa registers private centres. Conditions are placed on the registration of centres who fall below the standards expected, for instance the number of children in the centre.  Centres that are struggling to meet standards do not survive in such a regulated environment.</p>  <p>  The majority of inspections show evidence of positive relationships between staff and young people, and the needs of the young people being met.</p>  <p>  The Deputy asks about staffing in residential centres. I have been concerned to learn that in some centres there is a high turnover of staff and a dependency on agency staff. I am also aware of injuries sustained by some staff in the course of their work and the impact this has on stability in the centre.</p>  <p>  My officials have been engaged with Tusla on the challenges posed in residential care and work is ongoing to provide a greater level of assessment and therapeutic input to the centres from the ACTS Team (Assessment, Counselling, Therapy and Support Team).</p>  <p>  I welcome CORU's upcoming accreditation of Social Care Courses and registration of Social Care Workers as I believe this will lead to the enhancement of professional social care as the lead profession in working with troubled young people.  </p>  <p>  Tusla have developed a programme called Creative Community Alternatives that will support older adolescents  at home with proper supports, and prevent their coming into a care placement against their wishes.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-05-28a.16.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019052800050#WRA01200"><p>I have noted many times how, historically, there has been very low levels of investment in Early Learning and Care and School Age Childcare in Ireland. Over the past four budgets however, we have increased investment substantially. It has risen from &euro;260 to &euro;575 million. This significant increase in investment has assisted with an unprecedented doubling of capacity in the sector from 103,000 places in 2014, to 214,000 places in 2018. The average service has grown from 33 places to 44 places.</p>  <p>  A key priority for me as Minister has been to support the early learning and care and school age childcare sector through the provision of capital funding, where it is most needed.  </p>  <p>  In 2019, I secured a Capital budget of &euro;9.6m for the sector which enables a focus on increasing the number of places available, and supporting services to get ready for the forthcoming National Childcare Scheme. </p>  <p>  This capital funding is expected to produce approximately 1,300 new 0-3 spaces and 2,300 new school age childcare places this year. Pobal and my officials are currently finalising the assessment of these applications and I expect to be announcing the successful applicants very shortly. This will enable building to begin over the summer and the places to be available before the end of the year.</p>  <p>  Under the National Development Plan published in 2018, I ensured that Childcare was identified as a strategic priority and I secured &euro;250 million in additional funding for the expansion of high quality services.</p>  <p>  Finally, I want to expand opportunities in the childminding sector. I commissioned an Expert Group Report on childminding services in 2017. In the coming months, I will publish an Action Plan setting out how my Department will support more of these vitally important service providers  to become registered with Tusla. This means they will be able to access the National Childcare Scheme when introduced. This will further increase access to high quality childcare services. </p>  <p>  I am very conscious of the need to ensure we have sufficient capacity for all age groups. My Department, in conjunction with Pobal, will continue to monitor the situation closely, and to plan for future requirements.</p></reply>

The guidance sets out definitions of abuse, and signs for its recognition. It explains how reports about reasonable concerns of child abuse or neglect should be made by the general public and professionals to Tusla. </p><p>It sets out what organisations need to do to keep children safe. It also describes the obligations under the Children First Act 2015 and who they attach to. These guidelines have been in place since 1999 and were fully revised and published in  October 2017 to include reference to the provisions of the Act.</p><p>Taken together, the Children First Act, the Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences Against Children and  Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 and the National Vetting Bureau (Children and  Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012, represent a significant legislative framework to promote the welfare and protection of children, including in relation to  organisations providing services to children.</p></reply>

Included in the plan is an individual Crisis Management Plan.</p>  <p>  This is based on an assessment of the young person&rsquo;s potential behaviour during a crisis and what are the most effective ways to help the young person manage their behaviour. The plan is drawn up in conjunction with the young person. </p>  <p>  The use of the Crisis Management Plan ensures that crisis behaviour is responded to appropriately and safely and that where a restrictive practice is needed it is  kept to a minimum. An important part of the plan is a review, including the young person, of what triggered the event, the young person's experience of the restrictive practice and learning for the future.  Young people in residential care centres are not subject to  seclusion as a restrictive practice. </p>  <p>  There are occasions where a child may be on their own or just with staff, but this does not mean that they are in seclusion.  There may be circumstances when a child is continuously with staff and separated from other children in the Unit. This will be for a time limited period and in response to a specific behaviour incident. </p>  <p>  Tulsa has a national policy on single separation for use in Special Care Units only. Special Care is where a child is detained by the High Court for their care and protection. Children in residential care are not detained.</p>  <p>  This practice is used only when alternative interventions either have not worked, or are not suitable, and when single separation has been assessed as being the least harmful option to the child to avoid immediate risk or harm.</p>  <p>  Tusla has provided me with the latest collated data available, which relates to March 2019.

Subsidies of up to &euro;5.10 per hour for babies will be available for up to 40 hours per week, for families using registered childcare.  This means that maximum subsidy for a child under 1 will be &euro;204 per week (&euro;10,600 per annum) - a significant increase on the current maximum targeted rate of &euro;145 per week.</p>  <p>  The National Childcare Scheme has been designed to be flexible, with income thresholds, maximum hours and subsidy rates which can be adjusted in line with Government decisions and as more investment becomes available.  As such, it establishes a sustainable platform for investment in early learning and care and school age childcare for years to come.</p>  <p>  Over the last four budgets investment in early learning and care and school age childcare has risen by 117%.  However, I acknowledge that more investment will be needed to deliver the system that children and families deserve and First 5 commits to doubling investment over the next 10 years.</p></reply>

However, in First 5, the Whole of Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families, I have made a commitment to reviewing such needs in due course.  It is important however that in the first instance my Department completes the planned three year evaluation of the AIM programme and that we apply any learning from it to the development of new policy and service provision.</p>  <p>  Deputies may be aware that AIM - the Access and Inclusion Model - provides both universal and targeted supports for the meaningful participation of children with disabilities in the ECCE pre-school programme. The third  year of AIM's operation will end next month and  work on the 3-year evaluation will then commence. A one year evaluation conducted by external consultants was very positive and indeed AIM has won a number of national awards.</p>  <p>  The Government made a commitment in First 5 to consider enhancements to, or extension of, AIM to other groups of children. Such an extension might involve younger children (such as under-3s) or children attending school-age childcare services, or it might involve children with additional needs other than a disability. However, I must stress that any decisions on extension or reform of AIM will be subject to the findings of the evaluation, other relevant developments and the securing of necessary resources. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be interested to know that on 21 May I launched a public consultation on the future of school-age childcare.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-05-28a.42.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019052800050#WRA03000"><p>In the first instance it should be highlighted that the Early Childhood Care and Education programme (ECCE) is a two year pre-school programme. There is no provision for a third year which may not be in the best interests of a child, and could have the capacity to lead to breaching the statutory school starting age. </p>  <p>  Overage exemptions were introduced at the onset of the ECCE programme in 2010.  At that time ECCE operated for a 38 week period, or one programme year.  For some children with special/additional needs, attending preschool five days a week was not feasible and so therefore an allowance was made. Their one year ECCE place was split over two years, e.g. a child may have availed of three days ECCE provision in year one and two days in year two. In order to facilitate this, in the cases where the child would have been overage for ECCE in the latter year, an overage exemption was granted.  It is important to note that this provision of an overage exemption by my Department for the ECCE programme was never intended as a mechanism to delay a child&rsquo;s entry to primary education or to address any issue of non-availability of a school place. In the past, the operation of the system of overage exemption has caused confusion where some parents and providers have mistakenly assumed that an overage exemption approval from the DCYA represented derogation from age requirements attaching to the statutory requirement that a child attend primary school before the age of 6 years.</p>  <p>  The application process for an exemption from the upper age limit for the ECCE programme was introduced within a context where:</p>  <p>  - The ECCE programme was for a year only; and</p>  <p>  - The Access and Inclusions Model (AIM) did not exist.</p>  <p>  Given the extension of the ECCE programme in 2016/2017, the further extension of the programme to two full years from September 2018, and the introduction of AIM in June 2016, the rationale underpinning the policy intent of the system of overage exemption came under review as the initial premise for the provision of an exemption might have been considered to be no longer valid, i.e. an overage exemption as originally designed allowed for a child to avail of one programme year of ECCE over two years, whereas the standard provision is now a full two programme years. </p>  <p>  The overage exemption process has recently been the subject of a consultation process and report by the National Disability Authority (NDA). Officials from my Department are now considering policy options following on from this report. The new policy will consider the future of the system of exemptions and how best to support parents and children in the important transition from pre-school to primary school. It is worth stressing that the only rationale underpinning these considerations is what is in the best interests of the child.  </p>  <p>  A key finding of the recently published NDA report is that it is in children's best interests to enrol in primary school with their peers and to transition to becoming a teenager with their peers.  I would also note that  associated research shows broad agreement that it is in the best interest of the child to start school with their peers.</p>  <p>  Until such time as any new policy proposals are implemented, I have stated that the current system should continue. Overage Exemptions currently provided by my Department are governed by three guiding principles as follows:</p>  <p>  - Letter of Recommendation from a specialist clinician</p>  <p>  - Child's age - not being over 6 years of age during the exemption year (as per Educational Welfare Act, 2000)</p>  <p>  - ECCE Allocation taken - if a child has utilised their full 2 years of ECCE provision they will not be eligible for any further ECCE allocation. </p>  <p>  My Department is working closely with the Department of Education and Skills and the National Council for Special Education to ensure that planning for a successful transition to primary school with the child's peers begins as early as possible, and that the necessary resources are in place in the school to enable the child settle in comfortably and optimise their learning experience.</p></reply>

These are available on a national basis through thousands of registered providers across all counties, including Wexford. They include:</p>  <p>  - The universal pre-school Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme, which provides children with 15 hours per week of pre-school education over a 38-week programme year. Since September 2018 children qualify for two years of universal pre-school.</p>  <p>  - The universal Community Childcare Subvention (CCSU) and the targeted Community Childhood Subvention (CCS), which provide weekly subsidies to offset fees charged by providers. CCS is available to families who hold a Medical Card or are in receipt of social welfare benefits.</p>  <p>  - The Training and Employment Childcare (TEC) Schemes provide a weekly subsidy to offset fees charged by providers for parents on approved education or training courses, Community Employment schemes, or those returning to work who need school-age childcare.</p>  <p>  - Specific supports are also in place for children in emergency accommodation, in accommodation centres provided by the State for persons in the protection process or programme refugee children in Emergency Reception and Orientation Centres.</p>  <p>  Radical reforms to the targeted schemes, based on the principle of progressive universalism, are in train. The National Childcare Scheme (NCS), when introduced this October, will replace the CCS and TEC schemes with a single, streamlined scheme. </p>  <p>  Under the NCS, parents will continue to have access to the universal subsidy towards the cost of Early Learning and Care. This stands at &euro;1,040 per annum currently for a child under 3 in full time registered Early Learning and Care. Targeted subsidies for children from 6 months to 15 years of age will be provided, with the level of subsidy determined by net household income and the age of the child (children). Households with a net income of less than &euro;26,000 will receive the maximum subsidy. This can be as high as &euro;5.10 per hour, available for up to 40 hours per week, for a child under one. Households with net income up to &euro;60,000 will also benefit, but on a sliding scale from the maximum subsidy level available for incomes under &euro;26,000. Further information is available at www.ncs.gov.ie. </p>  <p>  In addition to these universal and targeted subsidies, the NCS allows for additional support for families where there is an identified need for Early Learning and Care on grounds of child development or child welfare. Families with high levels of need, who require Early Learning and Care for child welfare, child protection or family support reasons, may be referred for support by a specified &ldquo;sponsor&rdquo; body.  Where such a referral is made, the family will automatically qualify for a subsidy for the number of hours considered appropriate by the sponsor without having to satisfy the scheme&rsquo;s eligibility, income or enhanced hours requirements. </p>  <p>  Recent analysis undertaken by the OECD has concluded that, when the NCS is introduced, the costs of Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare to parents will come closer to the OECD average. The NCS, in creating a flexible platform for future investment in funding, will allow subsidies to be expanded over time and further progress to be made.</p></reply>

Tusla projects that this recruitment may eventually result in an increase in Tusla&rsquo;s social care workers of 57 once attrition and backfilling is taken into account.</p>  <p>  Tusla has informed me that it has a rolling campaign for social care workers. In addition, Tusla has developed other initiatives, such as bespoke campaigns for social care workers, to support its on-going recruitment drive in the more difficult to fill Special Care settings. </p>  <p>  Tusla has advised that at 31 March, 2019 there were 1,152 Whole Time Equivalent (WTE) social care workers in Tusla, which represents 29% of its overall workforce (3955 WTE). In addition, Tusla currently engages 210 agency social care workers to ensure continuity of service.</p>  <p>  Recruitment of social care workers is particularly challenging in Special Care settings. For example, at the end of 2018, Tusla had appointed 131 new social care workers however, 70 social care workers either left or retired from the organisation during the same period. Tusla has identified that there are approximately 1,000 social care graduates per year however, a much smaller sub-group is willing to work in the particularly challenging environment of Special Care. This challenge is further compounded as Tusla is competing with the HSE, Oberstown Children Detention Campus, the voluntary and private sector to recruit from this subgroup.</p>  <p>  I am aware that Tusla is exploring a number of measures to address the challenges in Special Care, such as increasing the potential talent pool by widening the eligible skills and experience considered for the role, improving the work environment and implementing a new model of care. Tusla has also commenced a stability programme to appoint in excess of 25 agency social care workers on temporary three year contracts into identified posts within the service.</p>  <p>  At the same time, Tusla has indicated that a key focus for the Agency is the continued development of initiatives to support the retention of the talent, capability and institutional knowledge that already exists within the Agency. A Retention Steering Group has been established by Tusla to plan and implement an integrated approach throughout the organisation and its work is being coordinated through Tusla&rsquo;s Health and Wellbeing and Employee Assistance service. In this context, Tusla has confirmed that the turnover rate for social care workers has fallen from 4.6% in 2017 to 3.52% in 2018 and this may be attributed to the recent work that Tusla has undertaken to address retention issues.  </p>  <p>  Tusla has developed its Strategic Workforce Planning Model &ndash; Phase 1 Multidisciplinary teams which will be rolled out by a Strategic Workforce Implementation Plan 2019-2020 and which encompasses capability and capacity planning. It is my expectation that this will chart the way forward in terms of a realistic approach to the personnel deficits being experienced by Tusla. Tusla has established a Steering Group, and also intends to establish Working Groups, to oversee and drive the implementation of the Strategic Workforce Planning Model and I welcome this approach.</p>  <p>  I also welcome the fact that the Retention Steering Group will feed into the Strategic Workforce Planning Model, focusing on staff wellbeing by assessing workplace stressors, employee psychological wellbeing and critical incident exposure in the workplace. </p>  <p>  With regard to HR, my Department is primarily focussed on funding, governance and support of Tusla however, my officials are actively engaging and supporting Tusla and other stakeholders with regard to addressing issues relating to the supply, recruitment and retention of social workers and social care workers.</p></reply>

However a number of long term complex issues continue to exist in relation to both the governance and the staffing of the programme.</p>  <p>  In this regard and in recognition of the need for a strong policy platform for educational welfare services, including the SCP, I requested my officials establish a Task Group to support the further development and integration of these services. The work of this group is near completion and I am eager to ensure that output will result in a clear blueprint for the development of the three strands of the EWS, including the SCP.</p>  <p>  A consultation event on the blueprint will be held on June 10th  where those working with vulnerable young people as part of the EWS will have an opportunity to express their views and help shape the policy blueprint prior to its publication.</p>  <p>  As part of the implementation of the actions contained in the blueprint I have requested that a new SCP scheme be scoped out and developed to ensure that its reach, resources and impact are maximised in supporting young people and I will also continue to examine options in relation to the employment status of SCP Coordinators and Project workers.</p></reply>

The level of funding supports the delivery of a range of youth work programmes and services for all young people, including those from disadvantaged communities, by the youth work sector.  The additional funding will be used to support programmes in areas where there are disadvantaged young people and where there is a pressing need for targeted services to meet the needs of young people. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware my Department is managing the most significant reform of youth services ever undertaken. This reform will provide an opportunity to identify need and to focus funding on young people most in need of intervention.  Future development and investment in youth services will be informed by the mapping exercise completed in 2017, which mapped youth service provision across the State. This mapping will assist the Department and the relevant ETB in developing a detailed social demographic profile in terms of both population numbers and deprivation levels.  My Department is committed to working with ETBs to identify need and explore ways to address this need where it emerges.</p>  <p>  The provision of additional funding to my Department to support the provision of youth services and infrastructure is a matter for consideration in the context of the annual Estimates and Budgetary process and having regard to the resources available to the Government.</p></reply>

The interdepartmental group,  established to provide oversight of the development of this service, will, in conjunction with those working in the pilot site, agree on  the optimal number and location of centres.   </p>  <p>  The One House project is informed by international best practice, and is based on the Icelandic Barnahus model.  The model brings together the forensic, protection, health, therapeutic and policing services in a child centred way in order to minimise as far as possible any additional trauma for the child and their family.  </p>  <p>  This new approach is aimed at ensuring children are not re-traumatised by having to recount the details of their ordeal a number of times to different people.</p></reply>

Good progress is being made. The latest data from the 2017 Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC) shows a significant reduction in the consistent poverty rate for children over 2016, which decreased from 10.9% to 8.8%, a reduction of just over 2 percentage points (25,000 children), the second highest reduction in the rate since the collection of SILC data began in 2004. </p>  <p>  The forthcoming National Childcare Scheme, under my Department, will mean the first ever statutory entitlement to financial support for childcare.

This will assemble in one place the range of policy measures across Government Departments that are designed to address different aspects of poverty and social inclusion, including child poverty.  This Plan will keep child poverty firmly on the radar of Government and will help keep the momentum moving forward.</p>  <p>  I have written to the Taoiseach asking that as we prepare for the Action Plan that the issue of child poverty is discussed at the heart of Government &ndash; involving every Minister, every Department as well as the agencies they work with.</p></reply>

FRCs provide a holistic service of child, family and community support and advocacy to all children and families in their community.

Future equipment priorities for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service are considered in the context of the White Paper on Defence as part of the capability development and equipment priorities planning process.  The principal aim over the period of the White Paper will be to replace and upgrade, as required, existing capabilities in order to retain a flexible response for a wide range of operational requirements, including response to security risks and other emergencies, both at home and overseas.</p>  <p>  In accordance with the National Development Plan (NDP), the capital allocation for Defence has been increased to &euro;106 million for 2019, an increase of &euro;29 million. The NDP provides for a total of &euro;541 million over the period 2018 to 2022. This level of capital funding will allow the Defence Organisation to undertake a programme of sustained equipment replacement and infrastructural development across the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service as identified and prioritised in the Defence White Paper and builds on the significant investment programme over recent years.</p>  <p>  The Government is currently investing &euro;12.8 million in updating the Communications Information and Security Network System for the Defence Forces so as to enable the current system to migrate to a Virtual Desktop Architecture. This information technology modernisation project commenced in 2016 when a contract was awarded to Evros Technology, an Irish company, and is scheduled to run until 2021.  The project is on track and within budget. It will enable the Defence Forces to securely evolve its networks and information systems and to increase interoperability between users and other government departments and external agencies.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Defence Forces have the necessary modern and effective range of equipment and technology available to them which is line with best international standards in order to fulfil all roles assigned to them by Government.</p></reply>

I understand that the Taoiseach updated Prime Minister Trudeau on current Brexit and Northern Ireland developments and they spoke on other important issues, including the ratification of CETA.</p>  <p>  Otherwise, Prime Minister Trudeau visited Ireland in July 2017 and there was a follow up visit by the Taoiseach to Canada not long after.  2018 saw several high level visits of Government Ministers to Canada and this has been maintained into 2019. St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day 2019 saw the Minister Bruton visit Toronto and Minister of State Cannon visit Calgary and Vancouver, where we have opened a new Consulate General in recent months.  The Ministers launched the Government&rsquo;s new strategy for Canada, which sets a high level of ambition on all aspects of the relationship, and a further expansion of our footprint, with a new Consulate in Toronto before 2025.</p>  <p>  I have previously spoken by phone with my Canadian counterpart, Minister Freeland, in October 2017. I was also fortunate to visit Ottawa and Toronto earlier in that year in my previous Ministerial role, and saw first-hand the thriving Irish communities that exist there. I was warmly received by Minister McKenna, who has responsibility for Environment and Climate change, and we discussed the excellent and close relationship that our two countries share.</p>  <p>  I was also delighted to address the Ireland Canada Business Association conference last November to speak to the historic and continuing strong and collaborative relations we enjoy with Canada, and the potential of our bilateral relationship in the coming years.  I look forward to travelling to Canada and engaging with the Canadian Government, as well as visiting Ireland&rsquo;s Embassy in Ottawa and our new Consulate General in Vancouver, in the near future.</p></reply>

However, the ongoing and deepening political impasse in the UK, to which the Deputy refers, and the failure to date of the UK Parliament to ratify the Withdrawal Agreement mean that the risk of a no-deal Brexit is a significant and serious concern and we continue to prepare accordingly.</p>  <p>  The Cabinet had a further discussion on Brexit last week and has agreed that work on preparations for a no-deal Brexit should continue to be taken forward as a matter of priority across Government Departments and Agencies.</p>  <p>  The immediate focus since December 2018 has been on ensuring the necessary contingency measures are in place to limit the potential negative effects of a no deal Brexit.  Much of this work, details of which were published in the Government's December 2018 Brexit Contingency Action Plan and subsequent updates, will continue to be relevant in any Brexit scenario.</p>  <p>  The period afforded by the agreed extension is being used to further deepen our no-deal responses and to add to or refine completed measures to maximise readiness for a no-deal scenario.  Many of the preparatory measures undertaken by businesses should also be of benefit in any scenario but it is important that businesses and other affected sectors continue to do their own preparations also.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that legislative provisions have been passed by the Oireachtas in the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Act 2019 and remain ready to be deployed if and when required.</p>  <p>  Brexit, in whatever form it takes, will have a significant impact on Ireland.

On that occasion we discussed preparations for the European Council meeting, and the question of an extension to Article 50. On that occasion, Mr Barnier also held meetings with the Taoiseach and Minister Donohoe. I also met him again briefly on the margins of the General Affairs Council (Article 50) in Luxemborg on 9 April.</p>  <p>  Since the European Council (Article 50) meeting of 10 April, and the decision to extend the date of the UK's departure from the European Union until 31 October, my officials have been, and will continue to be,  in regular contact with both the Article 50 Taskforce and the Commission's Brexit Preparedness Group to discuss and review ongoing developments.</p>  <p>  There is complete agreement that responsibility for avoiding a no-deal Brexit firmly lies with the UK. At the same time, there is deep concern about the ongoing political impasse in the UK and real disappointment that the cross-party talks between the Government and the Labour Party ended without agreement. Unfortunately, it is our assessment that the risk of a no-deal Brexit is very real and therefore we continue to work urgently on no-deal preparedness.</p>  <p>  My most recent discussions with Mr. Barnier and my colleagues throughout the EU once again underlined the strong solidarity with Ireland and the EU's absolute committment, notwithstanding the ongoing political impasse in the UK, to protect the Good Friday Agreement.  As the European Council made clear again on 10 April, the Withdrawal Agreement, including the backstop, cannot be renegotiated, and any unilateral commitments by the UK Government should be compatible with the letter and the spirit of the Withdrawal Agreement.  However, should the position of the UK evolve, such as in the area of customs, then the EU would be prepared to reconsider the Political Declaration on the future relationship.</p>  <p>  The European Council will review the current situation at its meeting on 20-21 June. This discussion will be prepared at the General Affairs Council (Article 50) on 18 June, at which I will have another opportunity to meet Mr. Barnier.</p></reply>

Furthermore, during the EU Foreign Affairs Committee in December 2018, Council Conclusions were adopted calling on Myanmar to hold to account those responsible for war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide and to take meaningful action towards the creation of conditions conducive to a safe, voluntary, dignified and sustainable return of those displaced from Rakhine State to their places of origin.</p><p>  Two weeks ago, following a 10-day visit to Bangladesh, Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia, the UN Independent International Fact Finding Mission on Myanmar (IIFFM) urged the international community to cut off all financial and other support to Myanmar&rsquo;s military, owing to the Myanmar Government&rsquo;s lack of resolve in addressing the nation&rsquo;s conflicts and protecting human rights. The IIFFM also cited the need for the commanders of Myanmar&rsquo;s military to be isolated and brought before a credible court to answer charges of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide.</p><p>  Ireland, together with our EU and UN partners, has consistently called for the accountability of those who are responsible for such crimes and supports actions at international level in this regard. The EU has also put in place targeted restrictive measures, which Ireland continues to support, against senior military officers of the Myanmar Security Forces responsible for these acts.</p><p>  Ireland has strongly, directly and repeatedly stated that the best long-term framework for a sustainable solution that addresses the concerns of the Rohingya, including the key issue of securing citizenship rights and the protection that accrues, remains the recommendations of the Advisory Commission on Rakhine State which was led by the late Kofi Annan.</p><p>  Ireland continues to call for the full implementation of the Advisory Commission&rsquo;s findings and will continue to do so.  Officials in my Department, including in the Embassy of Ireland in Thailand, which is also accredited to Myanmar, will continue to monitor the situation.</p></reply>

During this visit, I also met with Secretary of State Pompeo at a Defeat-ISIS Coalition conference.  We discussed issues of mutual concern related to the conference, but also bilateral and broader international issues.</p>  <p>  My engagements were followed in March with visits by the largest ever delegation of Government Ministers to the US for St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day. In total, eight Ministers, the Attorney General and the Taoiseach visited fifteen cities and had a range of high level engagements, including in the White House with President Trump.</p>  <p>  The Government has since had the opportunity to engage with a high level Congressional delegation, representing the Friends of Ireland Caucus in Congress and led by Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-05-28a.134.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019052800052#WRC05400"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 54 to 56, inclusive, together.</p>  <p>  I am advised that Revenue commenced a nationwide compliance project in 2017 in relation to the gaming and amusement sector, including compliance with licensing laws.  Revenue&rsquo;s enforcement of the law in relation to gaming and amusement machine licensing is based on detecting machines that are unlicensed and in particular, detecting gaming machines that have been licensed improperly as amusement machines.  As of 11 April 2019, the total yield under the project was &euro;2.68 million.  In addition, a total of 325 gaming machines have been seized to date for failure to comply with excise licensing requirements.  Revenue has confirmed that the project is ongoing and it continues to be a priority.</p>  <p>  I note the Deputy&rsquo;s reference to industry estimates of the number of unlicensed gaming machines in operation and the possible excise receipts that would be involved.  Revenue has advised that it is not aware of the methodology used for these estimates and, in general, considers that there are inherent difficulties in measuring the scale of such illegal activity.  In the case of the national compliance project on gaming and amusements, Revenue is making use of internal taxpayer records across all tax headings, information on gaming and amusement licences granted previously and sharing of intelligence from Revenue offices across the country in its efforts to target compliance and enforcement activity under the project.  This allows for resources to be deployed based on assessment of compliance risk and ensures the best use of resources.</p>  <p>  Neither I nor officials from my Department have met or had discussions with the Revenue Chairman in relation to this project.  However, both Revenue and my Department participated in the discussions of the recent interdepartmental working group on the future licensing and regulation of gambling.  I understand that Revenue did provide information to the interdepartmental working group during its discussions on the progress of the national compliance project and this is reflected in the report of the group which was published by the Department of Justice and Equality on 20 March 2019.  Revenue has also advised that it must always plan for the deployment of its resources across all tax headings and that sector-specific projects such as the national compliance project on gaming and amusement machines are undertaken as part of its normal role in serving the community by fairly and efficiently collecting taxes and duties and implementing customs controls.  Similar projects have been undertaken in the past in other areas, industry sectors and professions.</p>  <p>  I note the Deputy&rsquo;s query in relation to the identification of local authority areas where Part III of the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956 is in operation.  Under this Part of the 1956 Act, local authorities may decide by resolution if gaming is to be permitted in respect of the whole or a specified part of its administrative area.  If gaming is permitted in the area concerned, a trader must first apply to the local District Court for what is called a &lsquo;certificate for a gaming licence&rsquo;.  The relevant local authority and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na must be given 28 days&rsquo; notice of this court application.  Revenue does not have any statutory role under this court process.  If the District Court grants this certificate, this allows the trader to apply to Revenue for a Gaming Licence, which is required for each premises where gaming machines are made available to play.  If the trader concerned presents the District Court certificate to Revenue and has paid the relevant licence fee, Revenue is under a statutory obligation under section 19 of the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956 to grant a Gaming Licence.  In addition to a Gaming Licence, a trader must also apply to Revenue for a Gaming Machine Licence under section 43 of the Finance Act 1975 in respect of each gaming machine made available to play.  Gaming Machine Licences may only be granted by Revenue to traders who have already been granted a Gaming Licence.</p>  <p>  I am advised that the sole focus of Revenue is on whether the trader concerned has appropriate Gaming Licences and Gaming Machine Licences.  Irrespective of whether a local authority has adopted a resolution under Part III of the 1956 Act, Revenue carries out a standard procedure when engaging with traders who have been identified as making gaming machines available for play in the public place.  Such traders are issued with a 21-day warning letter warning that it is an offence under section 43 of the Finance Act 1975 to make a gaming machine available for play without the required gaming machine licence and this includes a warning that failure to comply with licensing requirements may lead to seizure of the unlicensed gaming machines.  This is followed up by similar 14-day and 7-day warning letters where necessary.  If the trader concerned has not complied with the licensing requirements by this point, the machines are subject to seizure by Revenue.  This approach places the onus entirely on the trader concerned to establish if he or she is in a position to obtain a gaming machine licence.</p>  <p>  I understand that at the outset of the compliance project, Revenue did make enquiries to confirm the position of all local authorities in relation to whether they had adopted a resolution under Part III of the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956.  In a number of cases, the resolutions concerned were adopted over previous decades and there were difficulties in establishing the position in relation to a number of local authority areas.  In addition, the widespread reorganisation of local authorities in 2014 resulted in a lack of clarity as to previous resolutions that may have been made.  Ultimately, Revenue determined that it was for the individual traders concerned to clarify their position with regard to the 1956 Act.  The trader must apply to a District Court for a certificate for a Gaming Licence and the relevant local authority is placed on notice of the District Court application.  If a certificate for a gaming licence is granted by the District Court, the trader can apply to Revenue for a Gaming Licence.  If the trader is unable to obtain a certificate for a Gaming Licence, he or she is not in a position to apply to Revenue for a Gaming Licence and Revenue will, following reasonable warning, be able to take enforcement action.  I am advised that this approach allows Revenue to deploy its resources in the most efficient manner possible under the project.  Revenue has not been in contact with the Comptroller and Auditor General in relation to this issue.</p></reply>

As there is currently no such wealth tax in operation in Ireland, the Department understands that the Revenue Commissioners have no basis or requirement to compile the data needed to produce estimates in relation to a potential wealth tax. Although an individual's assets and liabilities are declared to the Revenue in a number of specific circumstances (for example, after a death), this information is not a complete measure of assets and liabilities in the State, nor is it recorded in a manner that would allow analysis of the implications of an overarching wealth based tax. </p>  <p>  However, in 2013 the Central Statistics Office conducted the first comprehensive survey of household wealth in Ireland (the Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS)). The survey provides information on the ownership and values of different types of assets and liabilities along with more general information on income, employment and household composition. </p>  <p>  During 2016, my Department, jointly with the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI), conducted a research project into the distribution of wealth in Ireland and the potential implications of a wealth tax using the HFCS. The research formed part of an on-going joint-research programme with the ESRI on the Macro-Economy and Taxation. The research paper, available on the ESRI website, presented results on the composition of wealth across both the wealth and income distributions in Ireland. A number of wealth tax scenarios were then applied to the Irish data (wealth tax regimes from other jurisdictions and hypothetical scenarios). In each case, the associated tax bases and revenue yields, the number of liable households across the income distribution, and the characteristics of the households affected are outlined.  While the scenarios do not fully capture the parameters outlined in the questions the Deputy may find them informative.</p>  <p>  In order to estimate the yield from a tax with the precise parameters as outlined in the Deputy's questions, it would be necessary to seek the agreement of the CSO to revisit its original survey data for this specified purpose. This would be a significant undertaking that would take considerable time and resources to complete. It is also noted that the HFCS does not include specific data on the global assets for those domiciled or ordinarily resident and the domestic assets for those resident for tax purposes. As such, any estimate on the yield obtained from HFCS data would not fully capture the parameters outlined in the Deputy's question.  It is therefore not possible for me to provide the revenue estimate sought in each of these three PQ's.</p></reply>

The incentive gives a refund of Income Tax and Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) paid in Ireland over the previous four years, subject to limits outlined in the legislation.  </p>  <p>  Section 477C of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 outlines the definitions and conditions that apply to the Help to Buy scheme.  A claimant under the scheme must make an application confirming they meet various conditions specified in the section, including that they are a first-time purchaser and that they have completed a tax return form and are tax compliant for each of the tax years for which a claim is being made.  The obligations apply to each party, where there is more than one party to a claim. </p>  <p>  The definition of &ldquo;first-time purchaser&rdquo; for the purposes of the scheme is an individual who, at the time of making a claim under the scheme, has not, either individually or jointly with any other person, previously purchased or previously built, directly or indirectly, on his or her own behalf a dwelling.  The &ldquo;qualifying residence&rdquo; must be occupied as the sole or main residence of the first-time purchaser. </p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that in the circumstances raised by the Deputy, where a person had previously legally purchased a home but never held a beneficial interest in the home, the full facts of the case would have to be established to determine if, at the time of the claim, the individual met the definition of &ldquo;first-time purchaser&rdquo; outlined above.  Revenue advise me that this type of claim would need to be examined on a case by case basis.  In cases where an individual had previously acted as a trustee to purchase a dwelling, the terms of the trust would have a bearing on the position.  If it were determined that an individual would be a &ldquo;first-time purchaser&rdquo; for the purposes of the help to buy scheme, then the individual concerned may qualify for the relief if the other conditions for the incentive are met.  </p>  <p>  If the Deputy has a specific case in mind, he may wish to send full details of the case to Revenue to determine the position on qualification for the incentive. </p></reply>

The person in question has the use of a company car and spends a small percentage of their working time working at their employer&rsquo;s head office and the rest of their working time working in the field and from home. </p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue where an employee uses his/her private car for business purposes, and he/she incurs the total cost of such usage (for example, insurance, tax, running costs), then the reimbursement in respect of the cost of business use of the car can be made free of tax by the employer by reference to either a flat rate per kilometre allowance (i.e. prevailing civil service &ldquo;mileage rates&rdquo;) or actual costs incurred.  However, in this instance, the employee in question is provided with the use of a company car and, in such circumstances, an income tax benefit in kind charge in respect of the use of the vehicle may arise for the employee.  Where an employee is obliged to personally incur some of the running costs (e.g. fuel), the benefit in kind charge is reduced accordingly. Further guidance on the charge to benefit in kind on the provision of a car to an employee may be found on Revenue&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  It is not clear from the information provided whether the person concerned intends to claim business mileage expenses from his/her employer or to make a claim for income tax relief in respect of the expenses to Revenue. In addition, the exact nature and circumstances of his/her working arrangements and requirements are not clear.  Although it is not possible for Revenue to express a view on the &ldquo;normal place of work&rdquo; in this specific case having regard to the information furnished by the Deputy, Revenue has advised that the person concerned has made direct contact with them on this query. Revenue will follow up the query with the person and, subject to receipt of further information, will advise them of their tax entitlements regarding motoring expenses.</p></reply>

Primary legislation was necessary in order to bring that change into effect.  It was made clear at the time that until such legislation was enacted, the compulsory retirement age of 65, which applied to the vast majority of this cohort, remained in effect and pre-2004 public servants reaching that age would be required to retire.</p>  <p>  Interim arrangements were provided for the cohort of public servants who reached their compulsory retirement age of 65 after the Government Decision because, while they would be aware of the Government&rsquo;s decision, they would be unable to avail of it.  Those arrangements permitted these individuals to be rehired post-retirement for a period of 1 year until they reached the age of eligibility for the State Pension (Contributory).  Without that specific arrangement, they would have been required to cease working on reaching the age of 65.</p>  <p>  The Public Service Superannuation (Age of Retirement) Act 2018 was enacted on 26 December 2018. Under the Act, any relevant public servant who had not already reached their compulsory retirement age of 65 before that date has a new compulsory retirement age of 70.  Enactment of the legislation had no effect on those public servants who retired at 65 prior to the 26 December 2018 and who availed of a one year contract under the interim arrangements.  The terms of their contracts continue to apply and they will cease working when they reach the age of 66.</p>  <p>  Section 3 of the 2018 Act also provides that I, as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, within three months of the passing of the Act, would prepare and lay before the Oireachtas a report on the public servants who were forced to retire between 6 December 2017 and the commencement of the Act, due to reaching the age of 65 years, and on potential remedies to assist this cohort of worker.  This Report was laid before the Oireachtas on 26 March 2019 and is publicly available on the www.gov.ie website and in the Oireachtas Library online catalogue.</p>  <p>  Having considered all of the issues outlined in the Report, I am satisfied that the interim arrangements were an appropriate temporary policy response at the time of the Government Decision, pending enactment of the legislation.  The terms of those arrangements were clear, unambiguous and made known to those who availed of them.  Accordingly, for the reasons set out in the report, I do not propose to make any changes to those terms.</p></reply>

The details of this investment were announced by Minister Moran with Mr. Leo Varadkar TD, An Taoiseach on 3<sup>rd</sup>May 2018, at the launch of the Flood Risk Management Plans (FRMPs). These Plans are the output from the largest study of flood risk ever undertaken by the State, through the Office of Public Works&rsquo; (OPW) Catchment-based Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme.</p><p>The FRMPs set out the strategic plan to tackle flood risk, with outline design for schemes. While the specific project costs are not available until the procurement for each scheme is complete, the FRMPs did include some preliminary indicative potential costs and these are available on the OPW website, <i>www.floodinfo.ie</i>.</p><p>For schemes which are currently at construction, and following a competitive tendering process for each project, the OPW and Cork County Council are working with project consultants on the following projects: Bandon (estimated cost &euro;28.4m) &ndash; currently at construction stage and is due to be substantially complete by July 2019, Skibbereen (estimated cost &euro;34.5m) &ndash; currently at construction stage and due to be substantially complete in June 2019, and Clonakilty (estimated cost &euro;24.1m) &ndash; currently at construction stage and expected to be completed in 2020.</p><p>At this time the OPW and Local Authorities have established Steering Groups to develop additional schemes to detailed design, planning and construction through procurement frameworks that were put in place ahead of the launch in 2018.  The OPW and Local Authorities will, as part of the ten- year programme of investment, continue to establish Steering Groups as capacity becomes available, for those other schemes identified by the FRMPs.</p><p>In that regard, the Steering Group has been established to develop the Bantry Flood Relief Scheme, which is estimated to cost &euro;6.6m, to detailed design and construction.  A further five proposed schemes have been identified by the CFRAM programme; namely Ballingeary, Castletown-Bearhaven, Inchigeelagh, Inishannon and Schull. These are not in the first tranche of projects to be progressed, but the OPW and Cork County Council will work closely to ensure that they will be commenced as soon as possible within the 10 year timeframe for the programme of investment.</p><p>The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government has overall responsibility for Government policy on coastal strategy.  Local Authorities lead on identifying works to protect the coast in their respective areas. </p><p>The primary objective of Government policy on coastal protection is to ensure that, in areas identified as being at greatest risk of damage or loss of economic assets through coastal flooding, Local Authorities identify appropriate and sustainable measures to protect those assets.  Where defence measures are economically justified and compatible with all required environmental and other statutory requirements, they can be implemented, subject to the availability of resources.</p><p>Where necessary, Local Authorities may put forward proposals to relevant central Government Departments, including the OPW, for funding of appropriate measures, depending on the infrastructure or assets under threat.</p><p>Further to that, my Office, through the Minor Flood Mitigation Works &amp;amp; Coastal Protection Scheme, provides a funding mechanism to support works to protect coastal communities, particularly those at risk from flooding.  This Scheme provides funding to Local Authorities to undertake minor flood mitigation or coastal protection works or studies, costing less than &euro;0.75 million each, to address localised flooding and coastal protection problems within their administrative areas.  A full list of funding approvals since 2009 under this Scheme is available at:</p><p>www.opw.ie/en/flood-risk-management/operations/minorfloodworkscoastalprotectionscheme/.</p></reply>

My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places in an area. However, this may result in some pupils' not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice. As schools may not have a place for every applicant, a selection process may be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory, and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. </p><p>  Under section 15 (2) (d) of the Education Act, 1998, each school is legally obliged to disclose its enrolment policy and to ensure that, as regards that policy, principles of equality and the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents' choice are respected.</p><p>  Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 provides for an appeal by a parent or guardian to the Secretary General of my Department or, - in the case of an Education and Training Board (ETB) school, - to the ETB in the first instance, where a Board of Management of a school, or a person acting on behalf of the Board, refuses to enrol a student in a school, expels a student, or suspends a student for 20 or more days in any school year. This Department has no authority to compel a school to admit a pupil, except in the case of an appeal under section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 being upheld. </p><p>  Application forms for taking a section 29 appeal, which are available on my Department's website, should include a copy of the letter received from the Board of Management or a person acting on behalf of the Board of Management which outlines the decision to refuse enrolment.  This is to ensure that refusal to enrol has taken place.

This next phase of the programme is focusing initially on the 22 schools that have precautionary measures in place and also at the school to which the Deputy refers, which remains partly closed.</p><p>The purpose of these investigations is to determine the type and extent of structural issues in each individual school and, from the technical information gathered by the appointed structural engineers, to design permanent remediation solutions for delivery where these are needed.  </p><p>In line with the update published by my Department in January, detailed structural investigations have now been completed in all of the 22 schools with precautionary measures in place and at the school in question.  </p><p>The school referred to is different from the schools with precautionary measures in place in that the nature and extent of the issues there are such that the building under investigation was required to close.  The school remains operational in another building on site.</p><p>Detailed investigations have concluded in the closed building and engineers are working to design solutions.  When these are known, a programme of works to remediate the building will be put in place for implementation.  </p><p>When the works programme is available, the details will be first shared at meetings with the Patrons and the schools involved.  Arrangements are being put in place, for such meetings with the Patrons and the School Authorities of the 22 schools, including Ardgillan which has been scheduled in June. </p><p>This is an Education and Training Board school.

It is not intended to cover the full costs of attending college. The student grant scheme does however, provide for different levels of maintenance support, depending on means.  Grants are also provided at adjacent and non-adjacent rates.  The higher non-adjacent rates are intended to provide additional support to those students who may be living away from home.</p>  <p>  Budget 2011 provided for a number of student grant measures which came into effect for the 2011/12 academic year, including the change in the assessment of the qualifying distance criterion for the non-adjacent rate of grant from 24 kilometres to 45 kilometres. </p>  <p>  The 24km distance criterion was originally set in 1968 and had not been updated in more than 40 years. Since then, significant improvements have taken place in the road and rail network and it is considered that the revised distance criteria is more consistent with the type of distances that students may legitimately be expected to commute to college.</p>  <p>  The current qualifying distance of 45km for the higher non-adjacent rate of student grant takes into account a reasonable radius within which students may commute on a daily basis. </p>  <p>  The data for the 2018/19 academic year is currently being finalised. However, according to the Higher Education Authority, there were 159,823 full-time undergraduate students in HEA supported higher education institutions for the 2017/18 academic year, of which 77,430 were grant holders with 62,946 undergraduate students in receipt of a maintenance grant. In 2017/18, 52% of maintenance grant holders qualified for the non-adjacent rate and 48% for the adjacent rate. </p>  <p>  In relation to the 2010/11 academic year, there were 161,361 full-time undergraduate students in HEA supported higher education institutions, of which 71,532 were grant holders with 53,226 undergraduate students in receipt of a maintenance grant.  In 2010/11, 77% were in receipt of the non-adjacent rate of grant and 23% were in receipt of the adjacent rate of grant.  </p>  <p>  The cost of reversing the change to the distance criteria in the Student Grant, is estimated to be in the region of &euro;26m.</p></reply>

An appeal could be submitted for a review of the information used and of the calculation of the allocation. </p><p>A second process will be put in place to address circumstances where the school profile significantly changed following the allocation process e.g. a developing school where the net enrolment numbers significantly increased.</p><p>The criteria for qualification for mainstream school developing school posts are set out in the Primary and Post Primary School Staffing Schedule for the 2019/20 school year.</p><p>Schools who qualify for additional mainstream developing school posts, in accordance with these criteria, will also qualify for additional Special Education Teaching Allocations to take account of this developing status. </p><p>Finally, it is acknowledged that there are some circumstances, which may arise in schools, which fall outside the appeals process, or allocations for developing school status. </p><p>These relate to exceptional or emergency circumstances which could not have been anticipated e.g. where the school profile changes very significantly, or where other exceptional circumstances have arisen in a school and which may require a review of schools capacity to provide additional teaching support for all pupils who need it in the school, or of their utilisation of their allocations.</p><p>A process will also be available where schools can seek a review of their allocations in the coming months, including the utilisation of their allocations, in circumstances where a school considers that very exceptional circumstances have arisen subsequent to the development of the profile.  </p><p>As revised updated allocations have recently been issued to schools, this process will recommence in September 2019. </p><p>I am satisfied that there are in place a number of processes which can review the special education teacher allocation for schools where necessary.</p><p>The very significant levels of additional provision we have made in recent years to provide additional Special Education Teachers means that all schools are resourced to provide for the special educational needs of children in their schools.</p></reply>

Previously this ASC was paid by F&Aacute;S/SOLAS with apprentices themselves paying the part of the contribution relating to examination fees. As part of Budget 2014, SOLAS ceased making payments to IoTs and apprentices pay the full pro rata ASC.</p>  <p>  The amount charged to apprentices is calculated on a pro rata basis of the time which they spend in IoTs during the academic year. For craft apprenticeships, this cost would typically be one third of the &euro;3,000 ASC paid by students attending for the full academic year and so amounts to approximately &euro;1,000 per apprentice per period spent in the IoT.  In the case of the new consortia led apprenticeships the contribution varies for each programme as their off-the-job training has a more flexible structure.   In cases where training is delivered in an Education and Training Board there is no contribution made by the apprentice. </p>  <p>  Based on projected apprenticeship provision in higher education institutions, apprentices or their employers will make up to &euro;6.6 million in ASCs in 2019. If the arrangement in place prior to Budget 2014 arrangement were to be reinstated, where the apprentices paid the proportion of the ASC deemed to relate to examination fees, the total cost of not charging the ASC to the State would be &euro;4.8 million in a full year.</p></reply>

These supplementary assignment arrangements for SNAs continue to operate under the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018 - 2020 , and both unions representing SNAs, namely SIPTU and F&Oacute;RSA, have signed up to that agreement. As set out in the LRC proposals, the supplementary assignment arrangements for SNAs only apply to current SNAs who are notified that they are to be made redundant. Accordingly, the purpose of these arrangements is to facilitate eligible SNAs who are being made redundant by one employer in filling SNA vacancies that may become available in another school / ETB.</p><p>  Once an SNA with a minimum of one year's service (service in a substitute capacity i.e. covering for maternity leave, sick leave, career breaks, job-sharing etc. does not count) is notified by his/her employer that s/he is to be made redundant then s/he shall be deemed to be a member of a supplementary assignment panel for SNAs. The detailed supplementary assignment arrangements for SNAs for the 2019/2020 school year are set out in Departmental Circular 0030/2019 which issued on 22 May 2019 and which is available on the Department's website at the following address: http://www.education.ie/en/Circulars-and-Forms/Active-Circulars/cl0030_2019.pdf</p><p>  The operation of this panel is described and outlined in Circular 0030/2019 and it is designed to be as flexible as possible which enables all eligible SNAs, who have the requisite Panel Form 1 completed by their former employer, to apply for any SNA position that is advertised by a school or an ETB with no sectoral, diocesan or geographical limitations imposed. Every eligible SNA will remain on the panel for two years with a view to getting further employment. If they are not successful over that period of time in obtaining a further SNA position then they will be eligible for a redundancy payment. Furthermore, an SNA may opt out of this supplementary assignment panel at any point in time triggering the processing of his/her redundancy payment in line with the terms set out in the SNA redundancy scheme (DES Circular 58/06) or any revision of same that is applicable at that time.</p><p>  It should be noted that this does not prevent any person, including newly qualified SNAs, from applying for SNA vacancies but employers are obliged to give precedence to applicants who are members of the SNA Supplementary Assignment Panel.</p><p>The Supplementary Assignment Panel arrangements are reviewed by my Department on an annual basis in conjunction with an independent Supplementary Assignment Manager, the school management bodies and the two unions representing SNA staff (F&Oacute;RSA and SIPTU).</p><p>My Department has set up a dedicated e-mail address to deal with all queries in relation to the SNA Supplementary Assignment Panel and any queries in respect of the operation of the Panel can be directed to this dedicated e-mail address:snasupplementpanel@education.gov.ie.</p></reply>

We have significantly increased the availability of special placements for children with special educational needs as well as bringing more and more children into mainstream education.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has a statutory function to plan and co-ordinate the provision of education and support services to children with special educational needs, in consultation with the relevant education partners and the Health Service Executive (HSE). </p><p>This includes the establishment of special class and special school placements in various geographical areas where there is an identified need. </p><p>In deciding where to establish a special class in an area, the NCSE take account of the current and projected demand and the available school accommodation both current and planned.  </p><p>The Council ensures that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special class placements.</p><p>Since 2011, the number of special classes in mainstream schools has increased from 548 to 1,459 this year. </p><p>Provision in special schools has increased from 6,848 placements in 2011 to 7,872 this year.</p><p>There are 37 special schools and 237 special classes attached to mainstream schools in Co. Dublin.  </p><p>The number of ASD special classes in Co. Dublin have increased from 66 in 2011/2012 to 197 in 2018/2019. Details of all special classes for children with special educational needs are available on . </p><p>When the NCSE sanction a special class in a school, the school can apply to my Department for capital funding to re-configure existing spaces within the school building to accommodate the class and/or to construct additional accommodation.  </p><p>Similarly, where special schools wish to expand provision, the school can apply to my Department for capital funding to accommodate additional placements.</p><p>In the case of all new schools, it is general practice to include a Special Education Needs Base (SEN Base) in the accommodation brief for new school buildings, unless local circumstances indicate that it will not be required. Typically, a two classroom SEN Base is provided in new primary schools and a two or four classroom SEN Base is provided in new post primary schools.</p><p>Notwithstanding the extent of this investment issues remain.  There are some parts of the country, including north County Dublin, where increases in population and other issues have led to shortages in capacity in the school system.  </p><p>The NCSE are actively engaging with education service providers in order to encourage them to address the shortage of places.  </p><p>The NCSE and my Department officials hosted a briefing session for Oireachtas members in Leinster House on Tuesday last to advise members on how the NCSE engages in a planning process to open special classes annually</p><p>The NCSE and the Department will continue to encourage stakeholders to seek to open new special classes for the 2019/20 school year, including in north County Dublin. </p><p>In short, ensuring that every child has a suitable placement available to them from September is a key priority for this Government.</p></reply>

Implementation of Part 5 of the Act is monitored on an ongoing basis by the National Disability Authority.  The Authority reports each year on progress made towards the statutory 3% target for employment in the public sector.The Authority's most recent report on compliance shows that at the end of 2017, 3.5% of staff employed in public sector bodies were people identifying with disabilities, this was the seventh successive year of exceeding the statutory 3% target.  </p><p>The Report, which includes a detailed breakdown and analysis of the number of people with disabilities employed across all public sector bodies, including local authorities, is available from the Authority&rsquo;s website at the following link: .</p><p>The Deputy will also be aware of the Government's Comprehensive Employment Strategy (CES) for Persons with Disabilities 2015 - 2024.  This strategy sets out a ten-year cross-Government approach to ensuring that people with disabilities who are able to, and want to, work are supported and enabled to do so, with different Departments and State agencies acting in a concerted effort to address the barriers and challenges that impact on employment of people with disabilities.  One of the key priorities of the Comprehensive Employment Strategy is to increase the statutory target of persons with disabilities employed in our public services from 3% to 6% on a phased basis by January 2024.  To give effect to this commitment, legislative proposals are currently being progressed through the Oireachtas as part of the Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016.</p></reply>

This legal framework requires that any proposed community CCTV scheme must:</p><p>- be approved by the local Joint Policing Committee,</p><p>- have the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner, and</p><p>- have the prior support of the relevant local authority, which must also undertake to act as data controller.</p><p>This is the legal basis for all community CCTV schemes and these key legal requirements have not changed since 2006. </p><p>In terms of the role of data the Deputy may wish to be aware that on 29 November 2018, the Data Protection Commission issued a note (available on its website ) confirming that there is a legal basis for community-based CCTV and that the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) does not introduce new barriers in that regard.  In particular, the Office in its note confirmed that: </p><p>&ldquo;Data protection legislation does not stand in the way of the roll-out of Community-based CCTV schemes that have been authorised by the Garda Commissioner. Once the local authority in the administrative area concerned is willing to take on and deliver on its responsibilities as a data controller for the schemes concerned, there is no legal impediment under data protection legislation to the scheme commencing.&rdquo;</p><p>The Data Protection Commission has this month also circulated broad guidance for data controllers on CCTV, which I am confident will be of interest and assistance to all stakeholders and in particular to local authorities.  </p><p>The Programme for a Partnership Government commits to supporting investment in CCTV systems. In furtherance of this commitment, a grant-aid scheme to assist groups in the establishment of community-based CCTV systems in their local areas is being administered by my Department. Eligible groups, including community groups and local authorities, can apply for grant-aid of up to 60% of the total capital cost of a proposed CCTV system, up to a maximum total of &euro;40,000.</p><p>20 applications have been approved under the scheme to date, for grant aid totalling more than &euro;500,000.  </p><p>In establishing the grant-aid scheme, the Department consulted broadly, including with the Office of the Data Protection Commission, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Office of the Attorney General and the Local Government Management Agency (LGMA).My Department continues to actively engage with all relevant parties, including the LGMA, reflecting the reality that all stakeholders have the same objective &ndash; safer and more secure communities.  </p><p>I am keen to ensure that all interested groups, in both rural and urban areas, have the opportunity to take advantage of the availability of the grant aid scheme.  Further details are available to download from my Department's website - and support and guidance is available to help interested groups through a dedicated email address </p></reply>

These supports and services are delivered directly to persons in the protection process in the same manner as to other residents in Ireland by the relevant Government Department or Agency. For example education services are delivered through the Department of Education and Skills, and health services are delivered by the Health Service Executive.</p>  <p>  My Department, through the Reception &amp;amp; Integration Agency (RIA), is responsible for the provision of accommodation and related services to protection applicants while they await a decision on their claim for international protection. </p>  <p>  On 30 June 2018, the Minister for Justice and Equality signed the European Communities (Reception Conditions) Regulations 2018. These Regulations transpose the EU (recast) Reception Conditions Directive into national law. The Directive lays down the standards for the reception of international protection applicants while their application is being examined.</p>  <p>  Further, a Standards Advisory Group was set up in 2017.  The work of this group is to build on the recommendations of the McMahon Report and to develop a set of standards for accommodation provided for those people seeking the protection of the State. The Standards will meet those set out in the Recast Reception Conditions Directive and in EASO Guidance on Reception Conditions.  Operational standards and indicators will take due cognisance of the responsibility to promote equality, prevent discrimination and protect the human rights of employees, customers, service users and everyone affected by policies and plans as defined by the Public Sector Equality and Human Rights Duty.   </p>  <p>  The Department of Justice and Equality working together with other Departments and agencies have already introduced far-reaching and important reforms to the overall system and this process will continue as we strive to make further improvements in the future.  One of the most significant improvements is the introduction of independent living, which allows applicants to obtain food and other products in a specially-constructed food hall in the centre and to cook the food at either communal or individual cooking stations.  </p>  <p>  As of early April 2019, over 2,200 applicants across eight centres were availing of the independent living model.   In addition, almost 1,400 other applicants have access to other self-catering facilities with food provided by the contractor or the applicant themselves.  The Department of Justice and Equality anticipates that all of the centres under contract to it will have moved to the independent living model by mid-2020.</p>  <p>  In addition, there have been significant improvements to recreation opportunities, such as the provision of outdoor sports pitches, including &lsquo;all-weather&rsquo; facilities, teenagers' rooms and family living rooms in centres to provide social areas for particular age groups.  Friends of the Centre groups have also been established in each centre.  This initiative aims to bring residents, community and voluntary groups together with a view to increasing integration opportunities and providing for the development of greater community linkages with the residents and the centre.</p>  <p>   RIA has a complaints procedure which is set out in the House Rules &amp;amp; Procedures Booklet for International Protection Applicants. Complaints are made initially to the Centre Manager with a view to informal resolution. If the person concerned is not satisfied with the outcome of their complaint, he or she may make a complaint to RIA who will investigate the matter and take action as appropriate.</p>  <p>  In the event that a resident is not satisfied with how his or her complaint is dealt with, he or she has full access to the services of the Ombudsman and Ombudsman for Children. The office of the Ombudsman received 148 complaints about Direct Provision in 2018, 15 of which were upheld. </p>  <p>  Separately, certain decisions by RIA made in line with the European Communities (Reception Conditions) Regulations 2018, relating to material reception conditions and listed in full in Regulation 20, allow for review by a Review Officer, a designated role in RIA.

As far as possible, every effort is made to inspect accommodation centres three times annually - twice by the internal RIA inspection team and once by the independent inspection company QTS. The purpose of an inspection is to assess the physical condition of the centre and to ensure that the services contracted by RIA are being delivered by the contractor.  All inspections carried out by RIA staff or the external inspection company are unannounced.</p><p>All RIA accommodation centres are also subject to inspection by various other statutory bodies in relation to activities carried out on site, on the same basis as any entity providing accommodation, catering and other services.

Under Section 26 of the International Protection Act 2015, it is an offence to identify an international applicant. As a result it would be contrary to national law for me or my Department officials to provide information which pertains to a protection applicant. The Chief International Protection Officer and his team of International Protection Officers are also bound by the confidentiality provisions of Section 26 of the 2015 Act to protect the identity of the applicant. Applicants or their legal representatives should contact the International Protection Office directly either by email to info@ipo.gov.ie, by telephone to the IPO Customer Service Centre at 01 6028008 or in writing to Customer Service Centre, International Protection Office, 79-83 Lower Mount Street, Dublin 2. </p><p>Following the commencement of the International Protection Act 2015 on 31 December 2016, new arrangements for the investigation and determination of applications for international protection (refugee status and subsidiary protection) and cases involving permission to remain in the State have been introduced. Such applications are now processed, as part of a single application procedure, by the International Protection Office (IPO) which has replaced the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC) from that date. The staff of that Office (the Chief International Protection Officer and International Protection Officers) are independent in the performance of their protection functions. </p><p>For your information, on 27 February 2017, the Chief International Protection Officer, following consultation with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), published a statement on the Prioritisation of Applications under the International Protection Act 2015 which is available on the website of the International Protection Office<i>(</i><i>).</i></p><p>Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS of my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

As the Union citizen had not been exercising EU Treaty Rights in the State in accordance with the provisions of Regulation 6(3)(a) of the Regulations since 2013, the applicant&rsquo;s derived right of residence under Regulation 6(3)(b) of the Regulations ceased from that time also. </p>  <p>  The person concerned requested a review of that decision on 16/08/2017, which application is currently under consideration.

However, it should be noted that this is a business target and does not constitute a legal obligation.  The business target reflects the detailed and often complex assessment that is required to be carried out in relation to applications for family reunification. </p><p>While INIS endeavours to have applications of this nature processed as quickly as possible, processing times for visas can vary based on a number of factors such as the number of applications under consideration at the time, individual circumstances of the applicant and the sponsor, the complexity of applications and whether further information or investigation is required, and the resources available.  Any delays in achieving the business target are primarily related to the processing of more complex cases where the provision of additional documentation is requested or where detailed assessments of family rights under the Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights are required. </p><p>In this particular case, I am advised that additional investigation is required and due to the complexities of the case it will be some time before it is completed.  Accordingly, I am not in a position at this time to indicate a precise date when a decision will be made.  </p><p>The central concern, as with all visa services worldwide, in deciding on visa applications is to strike an appropriate balance between protecting the country's vital national interests by maintaining an effective immigration regime, while at the same time facilitating travel for those who meet the criteria.  Each visa application is decided on its own merits taking all relevant factors into account.  <b></b></p><p>The Deputy may wish to note that queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

Under section 26 of the International Protection Act 2015, it is an offence to identify an international applicant. As a result it would be contrary to national law for me or my Department officials to provide information which pertains to a protection applicant. The Chief International Protection Officer and his team of International Protection Officers are also bound by the confidentiality provisions of Section 26 of the 2015 Act to protect the identity of the applicant. The applicant or their legal representative should contact the International Protection Office directly either by email to info@ipo.gov.ie, by telephone to the IPO Customer Service Centre at 01 6028008 or in writing to Customer Service Centre, International Protection Office, 79-83 Lower Mount Street, Dublin 2. </p><p>Following the commencement of the International Protection Act 2015 on 31 December 2016, new arrangements for the investigation and determination of applications for international protection (refugee status and subsidiary protection) and cases involving permission to remain in the State have been introduced. Such applications are now processed, as part of a single application procedure, by the International Protection Office (IPO) which has replaced the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC) from that date. The staff of that Office (the Chief International Protection Officer and International Protection Officers) are independent in the performance of their protection functions. </p><p>For your information, on 27 February 2017, the Chief International Protection Officer, following consultation with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), published a statement on the Prioritisation of Applications under the International Protection Act 2015, which is available on the website of the International Protection Office (<i>www.ipo.gov.ie</i>). </p><p>Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS of my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

It is carried out by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na primarily in accordance with the provisions of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Acts 2012-2016 and is, as I am sure you will agree, a very important task which must be done thoroughly and correctly. My Department has no role in the processing of individual vetting applications.</p>  <p>  Regarding sharing of vetting between organisations, vetting checks are conducted by the Garda National Vetting Bureau for each new vetting application received to ensure that the most recent data available is taken into account. This is because once there has been any significant lapse of time between one employment and another, the original vetting disclosure must be reviewed to take account of any changes in information, such as more recent criminal convictions. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Data Protection Acts require that any sensitive personal data which employers use in regard to their employees must be current, accurate and up-to-date. Importantly, the general non-transferability and contemporaneous nature of the current process also helps to protect against the risk of fraud or forgery in the process. </p>  <p>  However, the Act provides for the sharing of vetting disclosures in certain circumstances by registered organisations; a facility which is of assistance in the health and education sectors, for example, in reducing the need for multiple vetting applications. Section 12(3A) of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 (as amended) provides that two or more relevant organisations can enter into a joint written agreement in relation to the employment, contracting, permitting or placement of a person to undertake relevant work or activities, thereby providing for only one of the organisations being required to conduct vetting in respect of that person.</p>  <p>   In general, the vetting process is working well and I understand that there are no backlogs or delays in Garda vetting at present. This efficiency has been achieved by the deployment of the e-vetting system which facilitates the on-line processing of applications for vetting from registered organisations. The current turnaround time for vetting applications submitted by organisations utilising the e-vetting system is 5 working days for over 85% of applications received. Individual applicants can track the process of their application online using the e-vetting tracking system, details of which are contained in the email received by applicants when completing their application online. Furthermore, in circumstances where there is such a sustained reduction in processing times, the issue of vetting &ldquo;transferability&rdquo; is largely obviated.</p></reply>

Article 21 of the Directive requires Member States, in implementing the Directive, to take into account the specific situation of vulnerable persons, and Article 22 provides for the assessment of the special needs of vulnerable persons.</p><p>Vulnerable persons include minors, unaccompanied minors, disabled people, elderly people, pregnant women, single parents, victims of human trafficking, persons with serious illnesses, persons with mental disorders and persons who have been subjected to torture, rape or other serious forms of psychological, physical or sexual violence, such as victims of female genital mutilation.</p><p>The Directive was implemented through the European Communities (Reception Conditions) Regulations 2018 which provide for an assessment in relation to special reception needs within 30 days of presentation or application. Once assessed as having special reception needs, there are a number of ways in which those needs are responded to. For example, Tusla provides the required supports to meet the needs of unaccompanied minors once identified as such.</p><p>An initial interview is conducted with all<b></b>applicants when they first attend the International Protection Office in Dublin.  If the applicant indicates at that point that he or she requires accommodation, he or she will then be assessed for any specific reception needs.  This assessment is taken into account when assigning accommodation to the particular individual.</p><p>As detailed in the Regulations, the Minister for Health and the HSE has a lead responsibility in relation to health assessments.  Applicants are invited for an initial health assessment on a voluntary basis.</p><p>There is a specific Health Screening Team funded and managed by the HSE located on the site of the Balseskin Reception facility for the purpose of assessing those who have just arrived in the State. The team comprises of GPs, a Medical Officer, a Clinical Nurse Specialist and two nurses, a primary care social worker, two primary care psychologists and clerical/administration support. This team offers a range of individual services and screening for medical and psycho-social needs with onward referral as necessary.

I expect a draft report with options for reform to be submitted to me in the coming weeks, with a view to my bringing proposals to Government in the autumn.</p>  <p>  The Review is already addressing all the issues raised in submissions made to it, including those that featured in a recent campaign by the print media. These include:</p>  <p>- whether changes should be made to the respective roles of the judge and the jury in High Court defamation cases, in particular in relation to the question of damages; and</p>  <p>- whether any change should be made to the level or type of damages which may be awarded in defamation cases, or to the factors to be taken into account in making that determination.</p>  <p>  It is important that the Defamation Act operates in practice to ensure that where damages are awarded for defamation, they are fair and proportionate. The objective set for the defamation review was to ensure that our defamation law strikes the right balance between protecting an individual&rsquo;s good name and privacy, and protecting the right to freedom of expression, taking account of the vital role in our democracy played by a free and independent press.</p></reply>

This is usually in the form of a currently valid passport and may include other original supporting documents, such as a previously held or an out of date passport, birth certificate and marriage certificate. In cases where the applicant for a certificate of naturalisation has already submitted a passport to another area of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS), the Citizenship Division of INIS will take the necessary steps to secure the passport for appropriate examination and will revert to the applicant if further clarification or documentation is required.</p>  <p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS of my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Commissioner that the Garda National Diversity and Integration Unit (GNDIU), formerly known as Garda Racial, Intercultural and Diversity Office (GRIDO) was established in April 2000. The GNDIU has responsibility for co-coordinating, monitoring and advising on all aspects of policing in the area of ethnic and cultural diversity. The unit leads on Garda policies, strategies, initiatives and training in respect of diversity, equality, integration and hate crime.  The unit also liaises extensively with national and international stakeholders in the area of diversity, equality and integration to develop best policing practice that meets the policing needs of persons from diverse, minority and marginalised communities and groups. It is the conduit between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and new communities who now reside in Ireland, representative groups and civil society organisations.</p>  <p>  In addition to the Unit itself, there is a network of approximately 260 Ethnic Liaison Officers (ELOs) who are trained to engage positively with persons from diverse backgrounds and communities in the twenty-eight Garda Divisions across the State under the auspices of Community Policing.</p>  <p>  A Garda Superintendent and a Garda Inspector currently directly supervise GNDIU. In addition, the Unit is assigned two Sergeants, a Garda and two administrative Garda Staff. One of the Sergeant positions is currently vacant due to promotion and transfer of a Sergeant.</p></reply>

There is also a Constitutional presumption in favour of the grant of bail as, under Irish Law, a person is presumed innocent until proven guilty.</p>  <p>  The Criminal Justice Act 2017 strengthens the operation of the bail system with the aim of making the law as effective as possible in protecting the public against crimes committed by persons on bail.</p>  <p>  Under the Act, a Court, in considering an application for bail, is required to have regard to persistent serious offending by an applicant for bail and may take into account the nature and likelihood of any danger presented by the grant of bail to a person charged with an offence that carries a penalty of 10 years&rsquo; imprisonment or more.  The Court will also have the power, in certain cases, to hear evidence from the victim of an offence before a decision on bail is taken.</p>  <p>  Where an accused person is granted bail, the Act provides for stricter bail terms for repeat serious offenders, strengthens Garda powers to deal with breaches of bail and increases the use of curfews.</p></reply>

The LEOs can also offer advice and guidance in areas such as Local Authority rates, Public Procurement and other regulations affecting business.</p>  <p>  The LEO Westmeath can offer direct grant aid to microenterprises (10 employees or fewer) in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sectors which, over time, have the potential to develop into strong export entities.  Subject to certain eligibility criteria, the LEOs can provide financial assistance within three main categories: Feasibility Grants (investigating the potential of a business idea); Priming Grants (to part-fund a start-up); and Business Development Grants for existing businesses that want to expand.  (It should be noted that the LEOs do not provide direct grant-aid to areas such as retail, personal services, local professional services, construction/local building services, as it may give rise to the displacement of existing businesses).  In addition, there is a Technical Assistance Grant available for eligible micro-exporter applicants who are seeking to explore alternative markets for their product or service.</p>  <p>  Along with the core LEO priming and business development grants, the LEOs are now offering a Technical Assistance for Micro-exporters (TAME) grant, which is designed to help LEO clients to find new markets and exports by part-funding expenditure incurred investigating and researching export markets, e.g. exhibiting at Trade Fairs, preparing marketing material and developing websites specifically targeting export markets. </p>  <p>  Micro-enterprises may also avail of the Trading Online Voucher Scheme (TOVS) from the LEO Westmeath.  The Scheme offers the opportunity for businesses to develop their website or digital marketing strategy by availing of vouchers of up to &euro;2,500 or 50% of eligible expenditure.</p>  <p>  Anyone with a viable business proposal can also use the LEO Westmeath to make an application to MicroFinance Ireland, which offers support in the form of loans of up to &euro;25,000 to start-ups with viable business propositions that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by the banks.  Successful applicants can avail of a more favorable interest rate from MFI if they make their application through the LEO.</p></reply>

These supports include employment, capital, research and development, environmental and training grants.  These grants remain an important means of encouraging firms to invest in Ireland, particularly in regional locations.    </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that there is no uncertainty regarding the treatment of intellectual property assets in the tax system.  Irish tax law provides for a scheme of relief in the form of capital allowances available to companies that incur capital expenditure on intangible assets for the purposes of a trade.  The scheme applies to intangible assets which are recognised as such under generally accepted accounting practice and which are listed as a &ldquo;specified intangible asset&rdquo; in section 291A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  An important feature of the relief is that the allowances may only be offset against trading income generated from the intangible assets and, for capital expenditure incurred on or after 11 October 2017, only against up to 80% of that income. </p>  <p>  In addition to this, the Government introduced The Knowledge Development Box (KDB) in 2015.  The KDB provides for relief from tax on the profits earned from the exploitation of patents, copyrighted software and intellectual property for small companies, provided that the intellectual property was developed through research and development (R&amp;D) carried out by companies resident in Ireland.  The IDA continue to promote the KDB to new and existing clients. </p>  <p>  More broadly, IDA Ireland&rsquo;s record results for 2018 underline how strongly Ireland continues to perform when it comes to attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) of all types.  FDI continues to drive the economy with strong employment growth in this sector at 7%, compared to the national average of 3% in 2018.  FDI Exports experienced growth of 10% and an increase of 8% in the amount spent in the Irish economy on payroll, materials and services &ndash; which now stands at over &euro;19.2bn.  Ireland&rsquo;s investment and value proposition continues to resonate with companies across the globe as investors search for stability and certainty.</p></reply>

Full eligibility is determined mainly by reference to income limits.  Determination of an individual's eligibility status is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive.  Persons with full eligibility are entitled to a range of services including general practitioner services, prescribed drugs and medicines, all in-patient public hospital services in public wards (including consultant services), all out-patient public hospital services (including consultant services), dental, ophthalmic and aural services and appliances and a maternity and infant care service.  Other services such as allied health professional services may be available to medical card holders.  These services are provided free of charge except for prescribed drugs and medicines, which are subject to a &euro;2 charge per prescribed item (maximum of &euro;20 month per month per individual/family).</p><p>In relation to blood tests, under the terms of the current GMS contract, GPs are required to provide eligible patients with &ldquo;<i>all proper and necessary treatment of a kind usually undertaken by a general practitioner and not requiring special skill or experience of a degree or kind which general practitioners cannot reasonably be expected to possess</i>&rdquo;.  There is no provision under the GMS contract for persons who hold a medical card or GP visit card to be charged for routine phlebotomy services provided by their GP which are required to either assist in the diagnosis of illness or the treatment of a condition.</p><p>As testing and treatment for Lyme borelliosis is widely available in all major hospitals in Ireland there is no need for people to travel to other EU Member States for diagnosis or treatment.</p></reply>

The first of these building blocks is a clear governance and accountability framework.  As part of its recommendations in this area, the Committee called for the establishment of a HSE Board, the HSE to become a more strategic and patient-focused &lsquo;national centre&rsquo; carrying out national level functions, and the establishment of regional bodies with responsibility for the planning and delivery of integrated care at a regional level. </p>  <p>  The report further recommends that these new regional bodies should be established through the geographic alignment of current administrative regional structures.  As the Deputy will be aware, 9 Community Healthcare Organisations (CHOs) and 7 Hospital Groups are in place on an administrative basis to plan and deliver community and acute care services respectively.  While significant progress has been made by these structures, there is broad consensus that having separate and un-aligned structures for acute and community care impedes the development of a more integrated health service as envisaged under the Sl&aacute;intecare programme.</p>  <p>  In this regard, the Sl&aacute;intecare report recommended that &ldquo;further analysis and consultation should be undertaken to identify how alignment can best be achieved with minimal disruption to key structures including at community healthcare network level&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy published in August 2018 and the 2019 Sl&aacute;intecare Action Plan published in March 2019 commit to the development of a new system of health structures and governance as called for in the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  The Strategy and the Action Plan set out a number of actions to deliver on this commitment.  This includes determining the optimal approach for aligning current CHO and Hospital Group structures to provide the geographical basis for the proposed new regional bodies.  </p>  <p>  As a first step, my Department undertook a public consultation regarding the geographical alignment of CHOs and Hospital Groups in 2018.  In addition, my Department has carried out further detailed analysis work to determine the optimal geographical alignment of CHOs and Hospital Groups which can be achieved with minimal disruption, and which will ultimately be the geographical areas of the proposed new regional integrated care organisations.  My Department is finalising proposals in this regard, and I hope to bring these proposals to Government shortly.</p></reply>

This can lead to a protracted deliberation process, where suppliers commence the negotiation process with a pricing proposal that does not reflect affordability or the evaluation of clinical effectiveness. </p>  <p>  In the case of nusinersen (Spinraza), following detailed consideration of an application for reimbursement and lengthy engagement with the company, the HSE decided that it was unable to reimburse nusinersen.  The HSE concluded that the evidence for clinical effectiveness was still quite limited and that the price proposed by the manufacturer was not a cost-effective use of resources.</p>  <p>  On 21 February 2019, the HSE wrote to the manufacturer involved and informed them of the proposal to refuse reimbursement at the current price offering.  Under the requirements of the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, the company had 28 days to respond or make representations to the HSE&rsquo;s proposed decision. </p>  <p>  I am advised by the HSE that the manufacturer submitted additional information and that the matter remains under consideration by the HSE.</p></reply>

The aim behind LCR was to encourage more young people to take out health insurance - to avoid late entry loadings of 2% per annum which may apply at age 35 and older - in order to ensure sufficient balance in the market overall between younger and older people, and between those who tend to claim more and those who tend to claim less. </p><p>Following a comprehensive review of the LCR regime in 2017 by the independent regulator, the Health Insurance Authority, the loadings regime was refined in several ways and credits made available in certain further circumstances. For example, a three-year exemption from 2008 for those made redundant was broadened this year to cover LCR loadings. As of 1 February 2019, persons who have cancelled their insurance for 6 months or more, having previously been insured for at least 3 years, will be credited for any periods of non-cover (the period of 3 years' cover does not need to be consecutive). The credited period is limited to 3 years and is available regardless of why the insured person cancelled their insurance.</p><p>More detailed information is available on the website of the HIA at .</p><p>Everyone &ndash; with or without insurance - is entitled to access healthcare via the public health system, and the purchase of private health insurance by citizens is optional. The regulatory framework governing health insurance, such as late entry loadings under LCR and the application of waiting periods for new health insurance customers, applies to all persons choosing to purchase health insurance and is not related to a person's eligibility, or previous eligibility, for public health services.</p></reply>

Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key health service objective. However, the challenge is to do this in a safe and sustainable manner. Treatment must be appropriate and proportionate and clinical decision-making, such as prescribing, should be based on both patient needs and sound medical evidence.</p>  <p>  Lidocaine 5% medicated plasters are licensed for localised relief of post-shingles pain in adults. This is the patch's only licensed use in Ireland. It has been reimbursed in the community drug schemes since 2010.</p>  <p>  Clinical concern arose as usage increased significantly, to the point where more plasters were being used in Ireland than in the entire UK National Health Service. In such situations, it is important and appropriate for clinicians to review usage and, in 2016, the HSE Medicines Management Programme (MMP) reviewed the use of the plasters. The review estimated that only 5-10% of prescribing was for the licensed indication.</p>  <p>  From September 2017, following the clinical review, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement approval system for the patches, to support appropriate use and patient care. Under these arrangements, the patient's GP or consultant applies to the MMP for reimbursement approval on behalf of the patient. If an application is refused, the clinician may submit an appeal to the MMP, making a clear clinical case for the patient. Information for patients and practitioners is on the HSE MMP website at: hse.ie/yourmedicines.</p>  <p>  The decision to introduce a new reimbursement approval process for a particular treatment is a matter for the HSE. I fully support the objectives of the HSE Medicines Management Programme.</p></reply>

The HSE concluded that the evidence for clinical effectiveness was still quite limited and that the price proposed by the manufacturer was not a cost-effective use of resources.</p>  <p>  On 21 February 2019, the HSE wrote to the manufacturer involved and informed it of the proposal to refuse reimbursement at the current price offering. Under the requirements of the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, the company had 28 days to respond or make representations to the HSE&rsquo;s proposed decision. </p>  <p>  I am advised by the HSE that the manufacturer submitted additional information and that the matter remains under consideration by the HSE.</p></reply>

In accordance with the Health Act (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations,  2013, as amended, all designated centres must ensure that the number and skill mix of staff is appropriate to the  needs of their residents. The Regulations also include specific requirements in relation to the assessment of each resident, and the preparation, review and revision of the care plan for each resident. </p>  <p>  The purpose of the Regulations is to ensure proper standards apply to all designated centres. HIQA carries out a programme of scheduled and unannounced inspections to assess whether residential centres are providing high quality, safe and effective services and supports to residents, and ensures that any issues or deficiencies are addressed and rectified. Where issues of non-compliance are identified, HIQA&rsquo;s inspection reports include a series of follow-on actions that the registered provider must implement within a prescribed time-frame.</p>  <p>  Reports of inspections carried out by HIQA are published on the Authority's website www.hiqa.ie, and the reports outline the type of inspection carried out, along with the findings and outcomes of the inspection.</p></reply>

The Report identified around 4000 people (based on 2008 census) with disabilities in Ireland living in congregated settings, defined as a residential setting where people live with ten or more people. </p><p>The Programme for Partnership Government contains a commitment to continue to move people with disabilities out of congregated settings, to enable them to live independently and to be included in the community.  The objective is to reduce this figure by one-third by 2021 and ultimately, to eliminate all congregated settings.</p><p>By the end of this year, we will have exceeded this target and under 2,100 people with a disability will remain living in congregated settings. I want to emphasise that the appropriate supports and resources are being put in place to ensure that people are supported as they move out of residential centres. The model of care for individuals will be based on a person centred plan (PCP). The PCP may change over time in line with an individual&rsquo;s needs and circumstances and the model of service delivery applicable at a particular time. </p><p>Any opportunity for residents to live in smaller settings in the community will come after considerable planning and discussion with those residents and their families. It will be on the basis that it will enhance their life, and anyone who moves will continue to access the services they require. </p><p>The HSE has prioritised the transition of a further 160 people from congregated settings in 2019 under its Service Plan, and I am informed that 49 people have moved into their homes in the community to the end of March this year.</p><p>As the HSE is responsible for leading out on the recommendations of &quot;Time to Move on from Congregated Settings - A Strategy for Community Inclusion&quot;, I have asked the HSE to reply directly to the Deputy in relation to St. Mary of the Angels, Beaufort, Co.

It has been no secret that parts of this island have not been suitable for access by the public owing to their industrial legacy. </p>  <p>  The report to which the Deputy refers was commissioned by Cork County Council, acting in  its operational role as agent for my Department in the Haulbowline Island Remediation Project, and relates to the 11 hectare former steel works (factory) site only and not to the 9 hectare remediated East Tip site.   This 11 hectare site is fully secured, in a different location away from the remediated East Tip, and is not accessible to the public.  </p>  <p>  The report was prepared for inclusion in a planning application for the remediation of the 11 hectare former steel works (factory) site, which is a disused industrial site containing areas of contamination.  The references contained within the report relate to potential risks to users of the site, including future recreational end users. It should be noted that there are currently no active users of the site which is fully secured.  </p>  <p>  The report does not specify any risk to future users of the remediated East Tip area.  In addition, I am advised by Cork County Council that air quality monitoring undertake on Haulbowline Island between March 2017 and December 2018, as required under the licence conditions for the East Tip remediation works, did not identify any risk to human health from the former steelworks site.</p>  <p>  It has always been intended that all relevant reports and assessments would be made publicly available during consent application processes and this has been the case to date with the relevant planning application and waste licence for the East Tip area.  In addition, Cork County Council maintains a webpage for the remediation project and posts regular updates.</p></reply>

We also acknowledge that that rising concentrations of methane are a significant driver of global warming. However it is also important to understand that while the Global Warming Potential (GWP) was introduced in the IPCC First Assessment Report, the report also used the metric to illustrate the difficulties in comparing components with differing physical properties using a single metric.</p><p>The 5<sup>th</sup>assessment report states, &ldquo;<i>There are significant uncertainties related to metrics, and the magnitudes of the uncertainties differ across metric type and time horizon</i>&rdquo;.  Therefore careful consideration must be given to the metric used.  The IPCC&rsquo;s special report on 1.5 degrees further highlights the importance of reaching and sustaining net zero global anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub>emissions and declining net non-CO<sub>2</sub>radiative forcing would halt anthropogenic global warming on multi decadal time scales. As a result national policy seeks to divide fossil CO<sub>2</sub>, the key driver of climate change, from other non-CO<sub>2</sub>gases and the managed natural carbon cycle.</p><p>Every sector, including agriculture, will need to do its part in contributing to the Paris agreement goals and stakeholders in each sector will equally be challenges in addressing these emissions. Where zero emissions technologies are available they need to be implemented as soon as possible. Every effort will also need to be made to reduce the impact of sustainable food systems on the climate while still ensuring food production objectives are met. </p><p>In response to meeting our Paris Agreement targets, the Government is currently developing an &ldquo;All of Government Plan to Tackle Climate Disruption&rdquo; to supplement and expand upon the ambition set out in existing plans with a view to addressing the 2030 climate targets in particular with this process led by my colleague, Minister Bruton.</p></reply>

Progress to date is shown in the following table:-<table><tr><th>Scheme</th><th>2015 target</th><th>2015 Actual</th><th>2016 target</th><th>2016 Actual</th><th>2017 target</th><th>2017 Actual</th><th>2018 Target</th><th>2018 Actual</th></tr><tr><td>Scheme</td><td>2015 target</td><td>2015 Actual</td><td>2016 target</td><td>2016 Actual</td><td>2017 target</td><td>2017 Actual</td><td>2018 Target</td><td>2018 Actual</td></tr><tr><td>Afforestation, ha</td><td>6,000</td><td>6,293</td><td>6,660</td><td>6,500</td><td>7,140</td><td>5,536</td><td>7,205</td><td>4,036</td></tr></table></p><p>While targets overall have not been met, the level of native woodland planting has been increasing steadily. In fact the total area of new native woodlands established in 2018 is the highest on record at 374 hectares. Based on current levels of planting and approvals, 2019 should see an even higher rate of native woodland planting.</p><p>Our target is to reach 30% broadleaves as a % of new planting. In 2018, this figure was 27%. This was an increase on the previous year when it was 21%. This increase is directly related to the higher grant and premium rates for broadleaves introduced under the midterm review of the Forestry Programme 2014 -2020, accompanied by a mandatory requirement that all  new conifer plantations have 15% broadleaves.</p><p>With regard to the level of afforestation, while there are many challenges in reaching the targets set, not least competing land uses, I am committed to promoting planting, especially amongst farmers. To this end, I am hopeful that the increases in payment rates introduced under the mid-term review in 2018 will have the desired incentive effect and result in increased uptake. As 2018 was a particularly difficult year for planting because of inclement weather conditions, the full effect of these changes has yet to be seen.  Active promotion of afforestation is also key to achieving our target which is why I  recently granted support in the amount of &euro;830,000 to 15 innovative promotion projects which will run over the next  two years; their efforts will be complemented by Teagasc&rsquo;s promotional activities and information days, as well the Department&rsquo;s own communication strategy.</p><p>We also  continue to engage with stakeholders especially through the Forestry Implementation Group and a Forestry Promotion Group, which discuss  implementation and ways to promote afforestation.  Furthermore, my Department is engaging with Coillte to agree a model whereby Coillte may contribute to afforestation rates, in order to support the  Government in its climate change mitigation effort. We will also explore all opportunities under the new CAP to encourage farm forestry.</p></reply>

In 2017, 23% or 157,589 hectares of the stocked forest area was comprised of single species conifer stands. In terms of ownership, 62% of the single species conifer stand area is publicly owned and the remaining 42% privately owned. </p>  <p>  A relatively high proportion of native tree species are present in the national forest estate, occupying 26.6% of the total stocked forest area or almost 178,981 hectares. Nearly two-thirds (64%) of these native tree species are in private ownership and the remaining 36% in public ownership. </p>  <p>  It is worth noting that the mid-term review of the Forestry Programme 2014 to 2020 resulted in higher grant and premium rates been introduced to encourage more broadleaf and diverse conifer planting. The minimum mandatory requirement per site has been increased from 10% to 15% broadleaves. These changes have resulted in the proportion of broadleaves planted in the afforestation programme rising from 21% in 2016 to 27% in 2018.</p></reply>

My Department has separately completed several network models and associated cost models down to the premises level. The high level designs take into account the various passive infrastructure databases (i.e. buildings, poles and ducts) as well as the Eircode database of premises. This analysis indicates that nearly 99% of the premises in the intervention area are 150 metres or less from the road and the vast majority of these are less than 50m. </p>  <p>  Once the deployment commences a detailed design process will be conducted by NBI which is referred to as the low-level design. This low level design includes a detailed site survey of each route and each premises to be served on that route. The site survey will confirm what infrastructure is in place and what infrastructure will be required in order to enable a connection to be made to each premises. Every effort will be made to reduce costs by utilising existing infrastructure. In cases where there are &lsquo;difficult to serve&rsquo; premises that could involve a high cost to connect, NBI will consider alternative solutions to deliver the high speed broadband service.</p></reply>

It should be noted however that none of the options around verification are straightforward, and we must be cognisant of data minimisation where sensitive personal medical information is involved.   It is disappointing that it has not yet been possible to implement a support measure. It is important for all those involved, including the representative organisations, that the support goes to the correct people and that the scheme is not dependent on applications that cannot be verified. </p>  <p>  A number of models of delivery have been explored, but challenges arose in all options. Significant personal data concerns, under the new GDPR arrangements, were raised in one case but it is important to note that the GDPR issues are not being discussed with waste providers, the providers have tried to assist in the delivery of the scheme but all of us came across GDPR issues. Administration costs and procurement issues were also identified that would have been problematic in terms of getting the balance right between the prevention of fraudulent claims and the delivery of the scheme in a cost effective manner. Unfortunately, the absence of a database of persons who are in receipt of incontinence products from the HSE, which could be used to verify persons who are medically incontinent, has impacted on the delivery of a cost effective scheme. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the complex issues at play, which are understandable given the sensitive nature of the medical data in question, I would like assure the Deputy that I continue to be committed to try to address this issue. My Department is calling the stakeholders together on 13 June to discuss the matter further and examine a number of possible solutions to deliver this scheme. </p></reply>

I am, therefore, disappointed that a number of coal firms have indicated they would legally challenge the decision of two former Ministers to extend the ban nationwide.    Banning the use of smoky coal would have a positive impact on air quality and public health, particularly in built up areas. I am continuing to work with the Attorney General to finalise a legally robust plan which will improve air quality by reducing particulate matter in the air. </p>  <p>  Pending the completion of this work, I can confirm that the current ban on bituminous coal will not be extended nationwide for the 2019/20 heating season. I also do not propose to extend the smoky coal ban to other individual towns in the meantime.</p>  <p>  High levels of particulate matter arise from a number of sources, including the burning of smoky coal. In light of this, and of the fact that air pollution is now know to cause greater health effects at lower concentrations than was previously understood, I am committed to publishing the National Clean Air Strategy this year. This will provide the policy framework necessary to identify and promote integrated measures across Government to reduce air pollution and promote cleaner air, while delivering on wider national objectives.</p></reply>

The ComReg consumer helpline is accessible at and I would urge consumers who feel they have not received an appropriate response from service providers to make contact with the Regulator.</p><p>The Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce worked with key stakeholders to produce a report in December 2016, available on my Department&rsquo;s website, which contained 40 actions to alleviate some of the coverage deficits across the country.

The Implementation Group meets on a quarterly basis and publishes quarterly progress reports on the implementation status of actions. </p><p>Now in its third year of operation, the Taskforce has addressed over 60 actions and continues to focus on issues that are negatively impacting upon the roll-out of essential telecommunications infrastructure in rural areas. The outcome of discussions at the second Annual National Stakeholder Forum held in October 2018 informed preparation of the 2018 Annual Review Report, which was published on 21<sup></sup>February 2019 together with the 2019 Work Programme.

The report of the focus group was published on my Department&rsquo;s website on 31 August 2018. It is anticipated that the output of the focus group should influence the actions of the mobile network operators in their work to reduce mobile phone blackspots.

Mobile operators&rsquo; commercial investment has also resulted in improved services, following ComReg's 2012 multi-band spectrum auction.

However Recommended Criteria for Environmental Inspection (RMCEI) data compiled by the EPA for 2017 include the following waste statistics for local authorities:</p><p>- 60,806 Waste complaints received;</p><p>- 59,228 Waste complaints resolved; </p><p>- 17,814 Waste inspections undertaken; </p><p>- 59,808 Litter patrols/investigations;</p><p>- 13,387 Waste enforcement actions initiated;</p><p>- 12,013 Enforcement actions closed;</p><p>- 638 Waste prosecutions taken;</p><p>- 484 Waste prosecutions closed.</p><p>Penalties under the Waste Management Act are already substantial. Persons who are found to be responsible for, or involved in, the unauthorised disposal of waste are liable to a maximum fine of &euro;5,000 on summary conviction and/or imprisonment for up to 12 months, and to a maximum fine of &euro;15 million on conviction on indictment and/or imprisonment for up to 10 years.</p><p>There have been instances of individuals jailed for offences committed under the Waste Management Act and the EPA in 2015 secured a record &euro;20 million fine against a company for causing pollution at a former landfill in Co. Kildare.</p><p>My Department has previously issued a policy direction to local authorities instructing them to pursue illegal holders of waste in accordance with the maximum potential sanctions available under the law in order to maximise the deterrent factor and aim to eliminate the economic benefit deriving from such illegal activity.</p><p>My Department has introduced a number of measures to strengthen efforts to improve waste enforcement generally and target illegal dumping. These include:</p><p>- An annual waste enforcement grant of &euro;7.4 million to support the recruitment and retention of 150 local authority waste enforcement personnel across the country- Cork County Council receive an allocation of &euro;455,000 in this regard;</p><p>- The establishment of the Waste Enforcement Regional Lead Authorities;</p><p>- The establishment of a National Waste Enforcement Steering Committee which facilitates more co-ordinated multi agency operations taking place on a regional basis.</p><p>In addition, my Department has developed the Anti-Dumping Initiative to work in partnership with local authorities and community organisations in identifying high risk or problem areas, developing appropriate enforcement responses and carrying out clean-up operations.</p><p>I recently announced funding of &euro;3 million for the 2019 Anti-Dumping Initiative, an increase of 50% on last year, to support communities around the country to continue to tackle illegal dumping. Innovation, surveillance using drones, special collections for awkward items like mattresses, spreading awareness among young people and recognising the work of volunteers will play a role in this year&rsquo;s campaign.</p><p>There will be a special emphasis on targeting dumping blackspots and illegal operators. Since 2017, the Anti-Dumping Initiative has supported the removal of some 5,000 tonnes of illegal waste from some of the country&rsquo;s most notorious fly tipping black-spots and approximately 50% of this year&rsquo;s funding will go towards continuing to tackle this problem.</p></reply>

Under the Litter Pollution Act(s) 1997 to 2009, responsibility for management and enforcement falls under the remit of Local Authorities. It is a matter for each Local Authority to decide on the most appropriate public awareness, enforcement and clean up actions to take in relation to litter and illegal dumping, taking account of its own local circumstances, competing priorities, and resources available. </p><p>Under the Act(s), &euro;150 fixed penalty notices also known as &quot;on-the-spot-fines may be issued by Local Authority authorised officers (and the Garda&iacute;) for littering offences. Where a Local Authority prosecutes an offence in court, the maximum court fine for littering, on summary conviction, is currently &euro;4,000. The level of fines for littering offences is kept under review by my Department. </p><p>The specific data requested for south-west County Cork is not collated by my Department. However, data in respect of each Local Authority area on the amount of money collected from on-the-spot litter fines is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:</p><p><i></i></p><p>To support Local Authorities in their role, my Department funds the Local Authority Anti-Litter Awareness Grants on an annual basis. My Department also commissions, an annual National Litter Pollution Monitoring System (NLPMS) Report based on individual Local Authority litter surveys. The most recently published results are available at:  </p><p>The 2018 NLPMS Report will be published shortly. </p><p>I welcome the fact that consecutive NLPMS Reports have, overall, recorded a broad improvement in the litter situation across the country in recent years. However, I recognise the challenges still presented by littering and I believe that a multi-facetted approach is required to address these. The approach taken should incorporate effective enforcement, public awareness and education. I consider that raising of awareness of the litter problem and educating the young people of this country is key to effecting a long term change in Irish society&rsquo;s attitudes towards litter disposal. In this context, my Department supports a number of other national anti-litter initiatives <i>viz</i>the National Spring Clean, the Green Schools Programme, the Protecting Uplands and Rural Environments (PURE) Project, and the Irish Business Against Litter League. The Department also maintains negotiated agreements with the banking and chewing gum industries.</p></reply>

This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment across the country, and a State intervention in those areas where commercial operators acting alone are unlikely to invest.  </p><p>The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector. In 2012, less than 700,000, or 30% of Irish premises had access to high speed broadband. Today, 74% of the 2.4 million premises in Ireland can access high speed broadband.</p><p>The premises referenced by the Deputy is in the AMBER area on the National Broadband Plan (NBP) High Speed Broadband Map, which is available on my Department's website at . The AMBER areas represent the target areas for the proposed State led Intervention under the NBP. </p><p>This intervention is the subject of the procurement process to engage a company to build, operate and maintain the NBP State intervention network. Following rigorous evaluation by my Department, I recently brought a recommendation to Government to confer Preferred Bidder status on Granahan McCourt, the remaining bidder in the NBP procurement process and Government agreed to this at its meeting on 7 May.</p><p>The Government Decision means that it is intended to award the State Intervention contract to the Bidder. This award is subject to contract close including finalisation of financial and legal documents. Deployment of the NBP State Intervention network will commence shortly after that. The Bidder has indicated that the NBP State intervention will take an estimated 7 years from the beginning of deployment.</p><p>In the first year of this roll-out, the Bidder will deploy approximately 300 Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) across all counties. It is anticipated that between 7 and 23 BCPs will be deployed in each county. BCPs will provide a community based high speed broadband service, enhancing online participation and allowing for the establishment of digital work hubs in these locations. </p><p>A deployment plan will be made available by the Bidder once the contract is signed. The Bidder is aiming to pass 133,000 premises at the end of the second year, with 70-100,000 passed each year thereafter until roll-out is completed.</p></reply>

Those options are available to be looked at online at . Any alternative that aims to deliver high speed broadband across the country, would delay the process by at least another two to three years, would not be any more cost effective, would not deliver the objectives of the NBP and could involve the State taking on greater risk.  </p><p>The possibility of allocating the National Broadband State intervention to the ESB was considered as part of the alternative options analysis conducted by my Department. The Attorney General has advised that there are significant legal risks in relation to both procurement law and state aid law, if the State was to mandate and fund directly outside a procurement process any economic undertaking, including a commercial semi-state body such as the ESB, to carry out the National Broadband Plan. </p><p>Furthermore, engagement between officials of my Department and DG Competition, which is the Directorate General of the European Commission with responsibility for State Aid matters, has clearly established that it is the view of DG Competition that it would not be possible to provide a State subsidy to an economic undertaking, such as the ESB, to roll out the National Broadband Plan without undertaking a new public procurement process.</p><p>However, the ESB pole network may still be used by National Broadband Ireland where this represents the most effective use of existing infrastructure at a local deployment level. </p><p>While I have not met with the ESB directly in relation to high speed broadband, my officials have engaged extensively with ESB in relation to this matter.</p></reply>

Over 12,000 projects have now benefited from sports capital funding since 1998, bringing the total allocations in that time to close to &euro;1 billion.  The programme has transformed the sporting landscape of Ireland with improvements in the quality and quantity of sporting facilities in virtually every village, town and city in the country.</p><p>The most recent fully completed round of the programme was the 2017 round.  The exact amount allocated to each project was based on a formula which combined the assessment score obtained, the amount of funding sought and the total amount of funding available for that county based on a per-capita basis. The full scoring system and assessment manual was published on the Department&rsquo;s website prior to any assessments commencing.  Further details of the allocation process are available in the Review of the 2017 Sports Capital Programme which is published on the Department's website at <i> .</i></p><p>Work is now under way on the assessment of applications under the 2018 round of the SCP and again the full scoring system and assessment manual was published on the Department's website before the detailed assessment work commenced.  186 applications were for projects that were deemed invalid under the 2017 round of the programme that subsequently submitted corrected documents.  These applications were assessed first and approximately &euro;7 million in allocations to 170 projects were announced on 17 January.  619 equipment only applications were assessed next and 466 allocations with a value of &euro;9.8 million were announced to these organisations last week.  A number of local authorities received funding and details of these allocations are available on the website.  Work is now under way in assessing the remaining applications for capital works.</p><p>In relation to future funding of larger sports projects, the National Sports Policy was published on 25 July 2018 and provided for a Large Scale Sport Infrastructure Fund (LSSIF) with at least &euro;100 million available over the coming years.  The fund was launched in November 2018 and 72 applications were submitted by the deadline of 17 April 2019.  The fund is initially focused specifically on the requirements and development plans of National Governing Bodies of Sport and Local Authorities.</p><p>The SCP and the LSSIF are managed in a transparent and open manner as set out above and local authorities themselves are key beneficiaries of the schemes.  While both programmes will be reviewed on an ongoing basis, I have no plans to propose devolving responsibility for sports capital grants to local authorities.</p></reply>

The 2013 Act and its requirements <i>only</i>apply to services provided in the State - it does not provide for services across a border.  I understand that the legislative position in Northern Ireland is similar.  Thus, under current legislation, a taxi operator wishing to operate cross-border services, would have to apply for and obtain licences on each side of the border.  Unlike other areas of transport - such as bus and road haulage operations - taxi services are not subject to EU harmonisation, so arrangements for regulating taxi services remain a matter for the relevant authorities in each State in respect of services that operate in their jurisdiction. </p><p>With a view to ensuring that cross-border taxi services could be better legally facilitated and appropriately regulated, I previously agreed with my counterpart in Northern Ireland that primary legislation would be prepared, on a reciprocal basis, in both jurisdictions to allow for exempting licensed taxi operators in respect of certain cross-border services, subject to specified conditions.</p><p>I remain committed to developing the necessary legislative changes to the <i>Taxi Regulation Act 2013</i>, subject to Government approval, and provided that legislative arrangements can be progressed on a reciprocal basis either side of the border.  My Department continues to engage with counterparts in Northern Ireland.  However, in the absence of a Northern Ireland Executive, it is not possible for Northern Ireland to progress with making changes to its legislation at present.</p></reply>

The 2018 round of the Sports Capital Programme closed for applications on Friday, 19 October last.  By that deadline, a record 2,337 applications were submitted seeking a total of &euro;162 million in funding. 186 of these applications were for projects that were deemed invalid under the 2017 round of the programme that subsequently submitted corrected documents.  These applications were assessed first and approximately &euro;7 million in allocations to 170 projects were announced on 17 January.</p>  <p>  619 equipment only applications were assessed next and 466 allocations with a value of &euro;9.8 million were announced to these organisations last week.  Work is now underway in assessing the remaining applications for capital works including the application from the club referred to.   </p>  <p>  For the first time, applicants who have submitted incorrect documentation under this round are being given the opportunity to correct their application during the assessment period.  While there will be no undue delay in completing the assessment process, in view of the opportunity to correct documentation, the record number of applications received and the detailed information contained in each application, it is likely to take a number of months to have all applications assessed.  Accordingly, I expect that it may be the third quarter of this year before the full set of allocations under this current round of the programme are announced.</p>  <p>  An application for financial assistance for the development of the club's facilities has also been submitted under the Large Scale Sport Infrastructure Fund by Cork County Council.  The Large Scale Sport Infrastructure Fund opened for applications on 19 November 2018 and the closing date for receipt of applications was 17 April 2019.  72 applications were received in total and my officials are currently undertaking an initial assessment of them.</p>  <p>  In view of the detailed information contained in each application, I am advised that it will take a number of months to have all of them assessed.  Accordingly, I expect that it will be towards the end of this year before allocations under the Large Scale Sport Infrastructure Fund are announced.</p>  <p>  Full details of all applications received under both schemes are available on the Department's website. </p></reply>

First 5 includes over 150 actions including a broad a range of measures to support families given their fundamental importance in shaping children&rsquo;s experiences and outcomes.  The vision for babies and young children articulated in First 5 is of a healthy childhood starting in pregnancy; time together with parents especially in the first year in a nurturing and playful home environment where material needs are met; high quality play-based Early Learning and Care experiences; positive transitions to primary school; and supportive community contexts.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to supporting parents in caring for young children at home in a range of ways.</p>  <p>  Within the remit of my Department, the policy priorities are to provide access to Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare supports to parents of young children, whether they work full time or part time, or look after their children at home full-time. These policies seek to support children&rsquo;s early development and to support their families.</p>  <p>  For example, in terms of Early Learning and Care supports provided by my Department, from September of last year, all children are eligible to avail of two years of universal pre-school, without cost, through the Early Childhood Care and Education programme (ECCE) prior to beginning primary school.  Almost 108,000 children are currently participating, many of whom are children of stay-at-home parents.</p>  <p>  The current targeted Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare subsidy schemes are available to families where parents are in receipt of certain social welfare payments, medical cards, or GP Visit cards, again many of whom are stay-at-home parents.</p>  <p>  A universal subsidy is available to all parents of children from six months until their child becomes eligible for the universal preschool programme (ECCE), regardless of whether parents are working or not. The National Childcare Scheme which will be open for applications later this year will make  subsidies available on the basis of family income and will also be available to stay-at-home parents. This is underpinned by the Childcare Support Act 2018.</p>  <p>  My Department also provides funding for local parent and toddler groups to organise activities for parents and young children in the community to support their development through play. Both working parents and stay-at-home parents participate.  449 groups were supported in 2018.</p>  <p>  In the coming years, my Department will also be leading on developing a new model of parenting services from universal to targeted provision, covering key stages of child development and taking account of parents and children in a range of contexts and parenting relationships. </p>  <p>  More widely across Government, there are various initiatives that support stay-at-home parents. A child benefit payment of &euro;140 per child per month is available for all children. Budget 2019 announced an increase to the home carer tax credit to &euro;1,500 per year.</p>  <p>  There have also been a number of new measures to support parents to spend time at home with children in their early years. Two weeks of paternity leave and benefit for fathers was introduced in 2016. In 2017, there was an extension to maternity leave and benefit to mothers of babies born prematurely.  Budget 2019 announced the introduction of a new paid parental leave scheme which will be available to both fathers and mothers from later this year.  Legislation extending the amount of unpaid parental leave and increasing the age of the child to which it applies has recently passed.  </p>  <p>  First 5 sets out Government's commitment that by 2021, parents will each have an individual entitlement to seven weeks of paid parental leave, to potentially allow children to benefit from an additional 14 weeks parental care in their first year.</p>  <p>  My Department has led the development of the implementation plan for First 5 which will be published this week.  The implementation plan sets out how the first phase of delivery of the over 150 actions in First 5, including many that will benefit stay-at-home parents, will be progressed in the coming three years.  </p></reply>

Early Learning and Care practitioners play a critical role in supporting young children's early learning and development and in providing a safe and caring environment. They deserve to be recognised, valued and respected for this.</p><p>While my Department funds a wide range of initiatives to support the quality, affordability and accessibility of early learning and care and school age childcare services, the State is not the employer of staff in this sector and cannot set wage levels. The large majority of Early Learning and Care settings are private businesses (74% according to the most recent figures from Pobal), with the remainder being independent, community-based, not for profit organisations (26%).</p><p>I have repeatedly called for the Early Learning and Care sector to pursue a Sectoral Employment Order, which offers a viable mechanism to establish appropriate wage levels. As the Deputy will be aware, neither I nor my officials can initiate a Sectoral Employment Order, but my Department will readily co-operate with such a process, if and when it is underway.</p><p>My Department has also supported a range of measures to improve pay and conditions using the tools available. These include the 117% increase in investment over the last 4 budgets that has supported services to operate at optimal capacity and has provided additional capitation for early learning and care programmes, including a 7% rise in September 2018 in the ECCE capitation rate. Measures also include the introduction for the first time of an annual Programme Support Payment to recognise the administrative roles that services play; this totals &euro;21.4m in 2019. I have also continued to provide a higher rate of capitation payment for graduate-led pre-school rooms, to encourage the attraction and retention of Early Learning and Care graduates, and in 2017 I introduced a higher capitation payment for services that employ a qualified Inclusion Coordinator as part of the AIM programme. In addition, last year I introduced a pilot measure for funding services whose staff take part in continuing professional development, and I am extending the pilot this year to include the new 'Aistear and Play' CPD programme implemented by Better Start. I hope to build on this pilot further over the years to come, following an evaluation.</p><p>  I have encouraged providers to use such additional funding to support, wherever possible, improved pay and conditions of the hard-working frontline staff that make such a lasting difference to children's lives. </p><p>The 2018 sector profile published by Pobal showed an increase in the average wage in the sector from &euro;11.93 per hour in 2017 to &euro;12.17 in 2018, but  it is clear that there is a long way to go before staff have the wages and working conditions ( including full time , full year contracts) that reflect the importance of the work they do.</p><p><i>First 5</i>, the Whole-of-Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and Families, includes commitments to move to a graduate-led workforce, with at least 50% of staff holding an appropriate degree-level qualification by 2028, and to raise the profile of careers in Early Learning and Care (and school-age childcare). Work will commence shortly on preparing a Workforce Development Plan, which will set out the actions required over the next 10 years to achieve these commitments in <i>First 5</i>.</p></reply>

Children, depending on their individual need and based on their Care Plan, may be placed in foster care either with relatives or with general foster carers. Of the children in care in Ireland, 92% are in foster care, nationally.  This compares very favourably to foster care services overseas. In the UK  73% of children in care are in foster care. In fact, Ireland compares extremely well internationally with regard to placement of children with foster carers, as opposed to in institutional care. Ireland, along with Australia, has one of the highest rates of  family placement (foster family care and formal relative or kinship care) in child welfare systems globally. </p><p>I wish to advise the Deputy that Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, collate data by Tusla administrative area, rather than by county.</p><p>The following table shows the number of children in foster care in each of the counties mentioned by the Deputy. These figures relate to February 2019, the latest available data.

The development of this Scheme is a significant move forward in delivering quality, accessible, affordable childcare to families throughout Ireland. </p><p>The Scheme represents a fundamental shift away from subsidies grounded in medical card and social protection entitlements, and towards a comprehensive and progressive system of universal and income-based subsidies.  By making this shift and by tangibly reducing the cost of quality childcare for thousands of families across Ireland, the Scheme aims to improve children's outcomes, support lifelong learning, make work pay and reduce child poverty. It is also designed to have a positive impact on gender equality in relation to labour market participation and employment opportunities.</p><p>The Scheme will replace the existing targeted childcare schemes with a single, streamlined and user-friendly scheme, providing both universal and targeted childcare subsidies.  To make the transition to the new Scheme as smooth as possible, families can choose to make the switch to the new Scheme once it launches (targeted for October/ November 2019) or can remain on their current childcare subsidy programme for one final year.</p><p>With regard to income-based subsidies awarded under the Scheme, parents who are working, studying or who meet certain other conditions will qualify for an enhanced-hours subsidy (up to a maximum of 40 hours per week).  The definitions of &lsquo;work&rsquo; and &lsquo;study&rsquo; will be set out in regulations made under the Childcare Support Act 2018 and will be comprehensive, covering differing types of work and study arrangements, such as part-time, week on/ week off and zero hour contract arrangements. </p><p>The National Childcare Scheme will greatly increase the number of families who can access financial support. By removing many of the restrictive eligibility requirements of the existing programmes, a far greater number of families will be eligible for targeted, income-related subsidies. Many families will, for the first time, be entitled to subsidies which will reduce their childcare costs significantly.</p><p>There may, however, be a small number of cases where a family who is currently receiving the maximum rate for <i>full-time</i>childcare under an existing programme may receive less under the National Childcare Scheme, particularly if their child is &ndash;  in reality &ndash; receiving <i>afterschool</i>care rather than full-time childcare.  In such cases, the family can remain on their current payment in the transition period following the Scheme&rsquo;s launch.  I have also directed my officials to undertake research and analysis to examine any adjustments to the National Childcare Scheme which might be required to address unusual or anomalous cases, where this is the right thing to do to protect and benefit lower income parents. </p><p>In this regard, I would highlight that the new National Childcare Scheme has been designed to be flexible, with income thresholds, maximum hours and subsidy rates which can be adjusted in line with Government decisions and as more investment becomes available.  As such, any adjustments deemed necessary by Government can be carried out in a quick and responsive manner.</p><p>Finally, the Deputy may be aware that my Department also funds Educational Welfare services which are operated by Tusla, the Child and Family Agency. The Schools Completion Programme regularly provides after-school services or homework clubs. These are most often provided in areas of disadvantage. The funding for Educational Welfare activities is unaffected by the National Childcare Scheme.</p></reply>

Children whose families are homeless are prioritised for services such as homework clubs and breakfast clubs. </p>  <p>  Tusla and the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive (DRHE) have agreed a joint protocol to facilitate an inter-agency response to the many challenges posed by homelessness. As part of the protocol, Tusla provides support to the DHRE&rsquo;s &lsquo;one-stop-shop&rsquo; assessment centres. Here Tusla staff deal with matters of child protection and welfare, educational welfare and Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence (DSGBV) services.  Tusla&rsquo;s Homelessness Liaison Officer supports these centres.</p>  <p>  Family Resource Centres, funded by Tusla, provide facilities where homeless children and families can avail of a safe, warm environment for homework, relaxation and nutritious food. Tusla is engaging with the Centres to offer further, enhanced services across the greater Dublin area in 2019.</p>  <p>  My Department funds free childcare for children and families experiencing homelessness, under the Community Childcare Subvention Resettlement (Transitional) Programme. This includes a daily meal for each child. 312 children have been registered under this scheme in the current programme year (August 2018 &ndash; August 2019).</p>  <p>  Finally, acting on evidence that a minority of young people leaving the care of the State can have particularly complex needs, I have succeeded in having care-leavers included for the first time as a separate category for funding under the Capital Assistance Scheme (CAS).  This provides targeted assistance to the most vulnerable care leavers by enabling Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) to acquire residential units to accommodate them. Where accommodation is provided under CAS, Tusla will provide and, where necessary advocate for, additional independent living supports, in particular for the most vulnerable care leavers, in accordance with the individual&rsquo;s pre-agreed aftercare plan.  </p>  <p>   I am pleased to be able to confirm that as of 24 May 2019, 24 care-leavers have availed of places with different Approved Housing Bodies, including 15 with Focus Ireland, six with the Peter McVerry Trust, and three with Don Bosco. Additional placements have been secured and are expected to come on stream within the coming months. These should be available for other young people leaving care in the near future.  The security provided by a tenancy in CAS accommodation, combined with the aftercare supports identified by Tusla as part of the aftercare planning process, can help ensure that these young people have a safe base from which to begin their transition to independent adult life.</p>  <p>  Our response to homelessness overall is a test of our compassion as a society. We need to eliminate child and family homelessness. While we work towards this we must provide the assistance necessary to help these children and families live in a way that goes some way to addressing the challenges of the situation. </p></reply>

The internet is an increasingly valuable resource for everyone, including children and young people, but it also exposes people to new risks including cyberbullying.  </p>  <p>  A range of Government Departments and agencies have a role in relation to internet safety. In recognition of the whole of government approach required, in July 2018, the Taoiseach launched the Action Plan for Online Safety 2018-19. The Action Plan involves a wide range of actions, across six Government Departments - Departments of Communications, Climate Action and Environment; Education and Skills; Justice and Equality; Children and Youth Affairs; Health and Business Enterprise and Innovation, recognising that online safety is not the responsibility of any one Department and signifying the range and breadth of the issues involved. A Sponsors Group, involving the six Departments and chaired by the Department of Education &amp;amp; Skills, has been established to drive implementation of the Action Plan.</p>  <p>  Children First operates on the premise that it is the responsibility of everyone in society to keep children and young people safe from harm. This responsibility includes keeping children safe from harm online. As part of the Action Plan for Online Safety my Department committed to amending the Children First Guidance to include a specific reference to the need to consider online safety in the completion of a Child Safeguarding Statement. An addendum to the guidance, clarifying the need to consider online safety in the preparation of risk assessments and Child Safeguarding Statements, was finalised and published on my Department&rsquo;s website in January. In addition, the Child and Family Agency &ndash; Tusla has revised its template for the completion of Child Safeguarding Statements to refer to the need to consider online risks to children if a service provides access to the internet. </p>  <p>  My Department does not have a role in relation to the coordination or investigation of complaints about cyberbullying.</p></reply>

I and officials in my Department are working towards alleviating this financial strain for all families.</p><p>The National Childcare Scheme (NCS), which will be introduced later this year, is a new user-friendly scheme to help parents meet the cost of quality childcare. The development of this Scheme is a significant move forward in delivering quality, accessible, affordable childcare to families throughout Ireland. </p><p>Through the NCS, and a range of other measures, I am committed to changing Ireland&rsquo;s childcare system from one of the most expensive in the world to one of the very best. In designing the NCS, extensive research and consultations have been carried out to ensure that this goal is achieved and that the scheme can help as many families as possible.</p><p>Under the Scheme, a Universal subsidy is available to all families using registered childcare with children aged between 24 weeks and 3 years.  An Income Assessed subsidy will be available to families with children aged between 24 weeks and 15 years. This subsidy will vary depending on family income, the child&rsquo;s age and their educational stage. It can be used towards the cost of a registered childcare place for up to a maximum of 40 hours per week where parents are working, studying or training, or in circumstances where a parent is unavailable to care for a child. Where parents are not working, studying or training, the subsidy will be paid for up to a maximum of 15 hours per week. </p><p>  A priority for me in last year&rsquo;s budget was to increase the lower income threshold under the NCS from &euro;22,700 to &euro;26,000 per annum.  This will &lsquo;poverty-proof&rsquo; the Scheme, ensuring that families at or below the relative income poverty line will benefit from the highest subsidy rates under the Scheme, over &euro;200 per child in some instances.</p><p>A second priority was to increase the Scheme&rsquo;s maximum net income threshold from &euro;47,000 to &euro;60,000 per annum in order to benefit moderate and middle income families struggling with the cost of childcare.  </p><p>These enhancements will ensure that 7,500 more children will now benefit from the Scheme relative to the original proposals.  Over 40,000 other children, already eligible for support, will see increases to their subsidies.</p><p>The NCS will greatly increase the number of families who can access financial support. The Scheme removes many of the restrictive eligibility requirements of the existing support programmes, whereby a parent must be in receipt of certain Social Protection payments or a Medical Card in order to receive targeted supports.  It will also make work pay for parents trying to get back into employment or training as they will now be able to avail of help with their childcare costs.  Many working families will, for the first time, be entitled to subsidies which will reduce their childcare costs significantly.  Others will see an increase in their level of subsidy.  </p><p>The Early Childhood Care and Education Scheme,  or ECCE as it is known, is a universal scheme available to all children in Ireland for the two years prior to them starting in primary school. It is estimated that this scheme can save parents who require full or part time childcare approximately &euro;5000 over the course of the two years. </p><p>Over the last four budgets, investment in childcare has risen by nearly 117%.  However, I acknowledge that more investment will be needed.  Historic under-investment in early learning and care has created a situation that has no quick solution.  The new National Childcare Scheme will establish a sustainable platform to enable us to continue investing for years to come, and the Scheme is designed to be flexible, allowing income thresholds, maximum hours and subsidy rates to be adjusted in line with Government decisions and as more investment becomes available.</p></reply>

Having to arrange for their children to meet with the other parent can be  difficult and worrying.</p><p>This was highlighted in a report I launched for Women's Aid last month, which suggested that as many as one in five women were under threat of abuse from a violent partner during access visits.  This is shocking.</p><p>My own Department and the Department of Justice and Equality have been engaging on this issue for some time.</p><p>I am convinced of the need for the provision of safe child contact spaces when they are needed for  protective purposes.</p><p>My Department has embarked on work to firstly assess exactly what facilities and supports are available for families in this situation.</p><p>Child Access Services exist through the Family Resource Centres.  Preliminary indications are that at least 42 Family Resource Centres provide some sort of service for access visits.  </p><p>These have grown up in an organic and ad hoc way and are dependent on the facilities and staff available within a Centre.  For example some Family  Resource Centres provide a pick up and drop off service which helps in the avoidance of contact between parents, if that is desirable. </p><p>I want to build on the  services available through FRCs and expand the number of locations where a child's right to have access to both parents is preserved in a safe way. </p><p>The Deputy may also be aware of the Time4Us service in Galway which is a family access service.  Following the resolution of funding and governance issues the service has now been absorbed into the ARD Family Resource Centre.  </p><p>I understand that this is operating very successfully and is now facilitating even more families than originally planned.  Parents and children are also participating in other activities in the FRC outside of the family access service.  This is a very  positive benefit of being part of the FRC.</p><p>Family breakdown is difficult for children.  Parental separation can take a toll on children.  I am  keen to support children and families as much as possible and to keep them safe if there is evidence of family violence.</p></reply>

It has the necessary legal powers and resources to conduct these investigations. The Commission's Fifth Interim Report describes its engagement with the order, and its interim findings are based on its assessment of the available documentary evidence and witness testimony. Notably, the Commission also confirmed that private burial grounds, including those owned by religious institutions during the period in question, were not automatically subject to the same regulation as publicly owned burial grounds. Most significantly, there was no was no legal requirement to keep a register of burials in such burial grounds.</p><p>The Commission has conducted geophysical surveys and test excavations on the designated child burial grounds on the site of Sean Ross Abbey.  The Commission has stated that it will report further on these investigations in its final report. </p><p>  Information regarding the sale of parts of the former institution at Sean Ross Abbey is available in the public domain.

Over the past four budgets however, investment has increased by some 117% - rising from in &euro;260 million in 2015, to &euro;575 million in 2019. </p>  <p>  This 117% increase in investment in childcare over the last 4 budgets has assisted with an unprecedented doubling of capacity in the sector, most growth occurring in ECCE, but some elsewhere. </p>  <p>  Assisting childcare providers in extending their existing childcare services, or establishing new childcare services, have always been key areas of focus for my Department's capital programmes.</p>  <p>  My Department's 2019 Early Years Capital Scheme includes a focus on baby and toddler places. &euro;4m is available and in excess of 100 development proposals are currently being assessed. This will create hundreds of more places, significantly increasing capacity in just one year.</p>  <p>  Concerns have been raised about the availability of childcare places in the registered childcare sector. I am aware that the higher cost of operating baby rooms, due to higher staffing ratios being required, may be contributing to the capacity issue and my Department is monitoring this situation closely whilst also taking a number of measures to address it.</p>  <p>  Access to high quality and affordable childcare generally remains a topical issue. The particular focus on availability of places in the centre based sector for the 0-3 age range has emerged in the context of recent media coverage. There is a suggestion that ECCE has been expanded (successfully) at the cost on provision for younger children. </p>  <p>  The National Childcare Scheme (NCS), due to be launched later this year will also be a significant intervention to address this challenge. The NCS recognises the different costs associated with providing childcare for children of different ages. The Scheme will provide for a progressive system of subsidies starting with the highest subsidy rates for children under 1(up to &euro;5.10 per hour) and the next highest subsidy for children from 1 to under 3 (up to &euro;4.35 per hour).  </p>  <p>  In relation to childminding, I was delighted to secure &euro;500,000 in Budget 2019 to recruit a National Childminding Coordinator and a team of six Development Officers around the country, to support the registration of more childminders with Tusla and thus enable them access subsidies under the National Childcare Scheme. My Department will publish a Childminding Action Plan in the coming months to follow through on the commitments in First 5 and the Programme for Government to further develop the childminding sector.</p>  <p>  My Department funds 30 City and County Childcare Committees across the country. Part of their role is to advise my Department on capacity issues. I would encourage anyone having difficulty in securing a place to make contact with their local CCC. Contact details for all of the CCCs, in addition to other information about the services they provide, may be found on www.myccc.ie</p>  <p>  As regards capacity issues more generally, each year Pobal conducts research on behalf of my Department to examine a number of factors related to childcare services in Ireland, including the monitoring of capacity. The Early Years Sector Profile report, which was published in November and relates to the 2017/2018 programme year, indicates that existing childcare provision nationally meets current needs nationwide in terms of capacity whilst recognising that small pockets of under supply may exist within this.</p>  <p>  This report outlines a 4% vacancy rate as a percentage of children enrolled in Dublin. Pobal reports that nationally the trend for waiting lists suggests a reduction in waiting lists for older children and an increase for under twos. Pobal cautions that its data on waiting lists cannot by itself be used to inform capacity decisions as parents often place their children on more than one waiting list. </p>  <p>  Under the National Planning Framework and the National Development Plan published in 2018, I ensured that Childcare was identified as one of our nation's strategic priorities. I am delighted that &euro;250 million in additional funding has been committed to for the expansion of high quality, early learning and care and school age childcare over the duration of the Plan.</p></reply>

The Department of Children and Youth Affairs is not the owner or operator of any childcare service, but through a Funding Agreement provides a range of funding supports, through capitation payments and other programmes, to support the sector. My Department generally cannot prescribe the enrolment policies of private businesses. Accordingly, the notice period that a childcare provider gives to a parent/guardian of a child occupying an ECCE place is subject to this private agreement and therefore outside of our remit.</p>  <p>  In relation to parents securing childcare places on our programmes, our requirement regarding parental notice on our childcare schemes are based solely to my Department's public funding obligations and the administration of the  childcare schemes by service providers.  In order to accommodate the smooth registration of children on our childcare programmes, we do ask parents who wish to remove a child or move them to another service to provide their current service provider with four weeks notice (where possible) in order to provide a space for that service provider to de-register the child from their service, thus enabling my Department to cease payments to that service in relation to that child. This notice period prevents the IT payment system from declining their child's registration in their new chosen service due to a 'double registration' scenario.</p></reply>

My Department has separately completed several network models and associated cost models down to the premises level. The high level designs take into account the various passive infrastructure databases (i.e. buildings, poles and ducts) as well as the Eircode database of premises.

CL&Aacute;R provides funding for small capital projects in rural areas which have suffered high levels of population decline.  </p>  <p>  The programme was first launched in October 2001 and the areas originally selected for inclusion in CL&Aacute;R were those which suffered the greatest population decline from 1926 to 1996.  The Cooley Peninsula was also included on the basis of the serious difficulties caused in that area by Foot and Mouth disease. The average population loss in the original CL&Aacute;R regions over the period 1926 to 1996 was 50%.</p>  <p>  In 2006, an analysis of the 2002 Census data was carried out by the NIRSA Institute at Maynooth University and the programme was extended to include areas with an average population loss of 35% between 1926 and 2002. </p>  <p>  The CL&Aacute;R programme was closed for new applications in 2010.  However, I re-launched the programme in the second half of 2016, using as a base-line the areas identified in the work carried out by NIRSA.  Over 1,200 projects have been approved for funding of more than &euro;25 million under CL&Aacute;R since I re-launched the programme in 2016. </p>  <p>  I have initiated a review of the CL&Aacute;R programme which will examine CL&Aacute;R areas by reference to the 2016 Census of Population data.  It will also consider whether there are any other factors that should be taken into account in designating areas for eligibility under CL&Aacute;R in the future.  </p>  <p>  The review process began in November last with a targeted consultation meeting with a number of experts recognised for their background in rural development issues.  Following on from this, my officials have been in contact with NIRSA with regard to carrying out a detailed analysis of the most recent Census data to further inform the review process. </p>  <p>  I envisage that a wider stakeholder consultation will also take place before the review is completed.  Once completed, the review will help to inform the design of future CL&Aacute;R programmes. </p></reply>

Since 2015, there has been an increase of over 146,000 in the number of people employed in regions outside of Dublin, surpassing the Government&rsquo;s target of 135,000 extra jobs by 2020.  </p>  <p>  The level of investment being made in rural Ireland is also unprecedented.  Thousands of projects have been supported by my Department alone since the start of 2017, with further investment across Government also benefitting rural communities in areas such as agriculture, fisheries, tourism and transport.  The Rural Regeneration and Development Fund, which was launched last year, will provide &euro;1 billion for rural development over the period 2019-2027.</p>  <p>  Progress Reports on the implementation of the Action Plan for Rural Development are published twice a year on my Department&rsquo;s website, www.drcd.gov.ie. The Third Progress Report was published in November 2018 and outlined the progress which took place between January and June 2018.  Of the 275 actions reported on, 266 had been completed or were substantially advanced. The Fourth Progress Report, focusing on activity between July and December 2018, was approved on 22 May by the Monitoring Committee which oversees the Action Plan, and will be published in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  The Action Plan for Rural Development includes a commitment to developing a pilot scheme to encourage increased residential occupancy in rural towns and villages.  In October 2018, I announced that six rural towns (Boyle in Co. Roscommon, Callan in Co. Kilkenny, Ballinrobe in Co. Mayo, Banagher in Co. Offaly, Castleblayney in Co. Monaghan, Cappoquin in Co. Waterford) would participate in the pilot scheme. </p>  <p>  Funding of up to &euro;100,000 is being made available to each of the towns to develop proposals to encourage town centre living.  This funding will be used by the Local Authorities to engage with communities and local businesses, and identify practical solutions to increase the number of people living in their towns.  </p>  <p>  I am expecting to receive a report from each of the relevant Local Authorities next month on the progress they have made.  It is envisaged that the solutions identified through this pilot could lead to the development of more substantive proposals for funding from the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund in due course.</p></reply>

It is a community work placement initiative which aims to provide short-term work opportunities for those who are unemployed for more than a year.  The duration of the T&uacute;s contract is a maximum of 12 months and this ensures that as many people as possible who are unemployed for over 12 months are able to benefit from the initiative.</p>  <p>  It is recognised by Government that T&uacute;s is a positive initiative that enables the long-term unemployed to make a contribution to their communities whilst up-skilling themselves for prospective future employment.</p>  <p>  If a person is interested in pursuing a work placement with training and development opportunities, it is open to them to apply for a placement on a Community Employment (CE) scheme. CE participants between 21 and 55 years are entitled to one year on the programme, this can be extended by up to 2 more years if they are engaged in a recognised training or education award that is helping them progress towards employment.  All CE participants age 55 and over can avail of 3 consecutive years on a CE scheme.  The overall limit of participation on CE is 6 years from 1st January 2007 (7 years if on a disability payment). </p>  <p>  Participants over age 62 are allowed to participate on a continuous basis up to the State Pension age on the CE Service Support Stream (SSS), subject to availability of places on the SSS, satisfactory performance on the scheme and to annual approval by the Department.   The places allocated for these participants within each individual CE scheme are subject to limitation criteria.  </p>  <p>  Customers of my Department who are engaged with the JobPath service have, from 1st June 2018, the option of taking up a placement on T&uacute;s or CE while continuing to engage with the JobPath service.  This ensures that jobseekers can benefit from the job-seeking support of the JobPath service while also availing of a part-time work placement provided by T&uacute;s or CE. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to review its activation programmes to ensure the best outcomes for participants.  The Government is very mindful of the large number of work programme places involved in service delivery and other valuable services to individuals and communities across Ireland. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The principal conditions for receipt of the allowance are that full time care and attention is required and being provided and that the means test which applies is satisfied. </p>  <p>  The means test is one of the least onerous in the social protection system. &euro;332.50 of gross weekly income is disregarded in the calculation of means for a single person.  The equivalent disregard for someone who is married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting is &euro;665 of combined gross weekly income.  This means that a couple under 66 with two children, earning a joint annual income of up to &euro;35,400 can qualify for maximum payment Carer&rsquo;s Allowance.  A couple with combined income or earning &euro;59,300 will still qualify for the minimum rate.  </p>  <p>  In addition a carer may, with the prior permission of the Department, engage in employment outside the home for up to 15 hours per week. The caree must be adequately cared for in the carer's absence. Income from this employment would be assessable as means if the aggregate of all income exceeds the relevant disregard amounts.</p>  <p>  As with any other social welfare payment there is an onus on the individual in receipt of the payment to contact the Department of Employment Affairs Social Protection and advise of any change in their personal circumstances.  There are a number circumstances and events which may affect a person&rsquo;s entitlement to a Carer's Allowance, including a change in their means.   It is also important to note that a change in circumstances could mean an increase in a social welfare payment or a person may be entitled to different social welfare payment.</p>  <p>  Issues relating to the tax treatment of social welfare payments, including income contained on P60s, is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.  There are however a number of social welfare payments including Carer&rsquo;s Allowance which, depending on a person&rsquo;s circumstances, may be liable to income tax.  The Department of Employment Affairs Social Protection makes the payment to the individual without deducting tax. The Department does not give Revenue details of the taxable amount of the payment but does advise the individual to contact Revenue to confirm the taxable amount of the payment.</p></reply>

My Department will spend approximately &euro;248 million this year on HHB for over 440,000 customers.  The package is generally available to people living in the State aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment or who satisfy a means test.  The package is also available to some people under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.  </p>  <p>  From 1 April 2012, new applicants in receipt of Carers Allowance who are not living with the person for whom they provide care are not entitled to the household benefits package.  Carers who live with the person they are caring for still have an entitlement of their own to the household benefits package and do not have to satisfy the household composition criteria.  </p>  <p>  The Government values the role of carers very much and it is for this reason that they receive significant income supports from the Department.  In addition to carer&rsquo;s allowance carers receive additional support in the form of free travel and household benefits (for those who live with the person for whom they care) and the annual carers support grant (&euro;1700) in respect of each person for whom they care.  Where a person is in receipt of certain qualifying social welfare payments, and also providing full time care and attention to another person, they can keep their primary social welfare payment and also get the half-rate carer's allowance.  </p>  <p>  Any decision to change the qualifying criteria for HHB would have budgetary consequences and would have to be considered in the context of budget negotiations. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household. </p>  <p>  My Department also pays an electricity or gas allowance under the Household benefits scheme at an estimated cost of &euro;187 million in 2019.  This is paid at a rate of &euro;35 per month, 12 months of the year.  This comes to &euro;420 per annum, or &euro;8 per week, plus free TV licence, travel etc.  It's worth noting that Jobseekers Allowance is not a qualifying payment for this benefit, nor the other benefits available under the Household Benefits scheme.  </p>  <p>  The Government values the role of carers very much and it is for this reason that they receive significant income supports from the Department.  In addition to carer&rsquo;s allowance carers receive additional support in the form of free travel and household benefits (for those who live with the person for whom they care) and the annual carers support grant (&euro;1700) in respect of each person for whom they care.  </p>  <p>  If a person is getting certain qualifying social welfare payments and also providing full time care and attention to another person, they can keep their main social protection payment and get the half-rate carer's allowance as well.  They can also receive an extra half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance if they care for more than one person.  </p>  <p>  The maximum rates of Carer's Allowance, at &euro;219 for where one person is being cared for, and &euro;328.50 where there are two or more carees, is significantly higher than that for Jobseekers Allowance, which is &euro;203 for those aged 26, and lower for younger claimants.  In addition to this higher rate, the means test for Carer's Allowance is very significantly more generous than that which applies to Jobseekers Allowance, which widens further the gap in payments between Carers and Jobseekers.  Also, Fuel Allowance is a household-based payment, and a Carer will very often live with and be caring for a person with a qualifying payment for Fuel Allowance.  A similar household, where the person received Jobseekers Allowance instead of Carers Allowance, would have the same rate of Fuel Allowance, as only one payment is permitted per household.</p>  <p>  It would not be accurate, therefore, to suggest that those in receipt of Carer's Allowance are in a less advantageous position than those paid Jobseekers Allowance.  Even when the more generous means test is not taken into account, and even during the Fuel Allowance season, the payments made to Carer's Allowance recipients, including Electricity/Gas payments, are higher than those made to those in receipt of Jobseekers Allowance.</p>  <p>  It should also be noted that the payment of half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance does not preclude a person from qualifying for fuel allowance.  If a person is in receipt of a non-contributory social welfare payment and a half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance, then they are deemed to have satisfied the means test and fuel allowance is payable subject to all remaining criteria being satisfied.  If a person is in receipt of a contributory social welfare payment and a half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance then they will have to undergo a means test for fuel allowance.</p>  <p>  Any decision to amend the criteria for receiving fuel allowance to include carer&rsquo;s allowance as a qualifying payment would have to be considered in the overall policy and budgetary context.  </p>  <p>  Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, exceptional needs payments may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which customers are unable to meet out of their own resources and this may include exceptional heating cost.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The person concerned informed the Department on 19/12/18 that she had received notice to quit her privately rented accommodation and accordingly, her rent supplement claim was closed.  The person concerned was subsequently provided with exceptional needs payments (ENPs) to assist with her rental costs from November 2018 to January 2019.

The plan details 43 individual actions that, taken together, will modernise our pension system while continuing to target resources at those most in need.  Given the wide breadth of actions included under the plan, action owners include three Government Departments, two Government agencies, a public body and some interdepartmental structures (where policy responsibilities span a number of departments).  </p>  <p>  In delivering on the actions contained within the reform plan, extensive consultation exercises have been undertaken with respect to a new Total Contributions Approach for calculation of the State Pension Contributory, the development of a new Auto Enrolment system for occupational pensions, and general reform and simplification of the existing pensions landscape. This level of engagement, and the subsequent collation and analysis of views, takes considerable time, both to allow people the opportunity to engage and subsequently feedback on proposals made. The time and effort expended on this analysis and consideration of options is invaluable to the deliberative process and is critical in ensuring optimum design of solutions that will follow.  </p>  <p>  In this context, the majority of actions set out in the Roadmap due for delivery within the plan's first year of operation have been completed or are at a very advanced stage of progression. I am also encouraged that the general feedback to date has been very supportive of the proposed reform measures and efforts will be continuing apace to implement these over the coming years in accordance with the Roadmap&rsquo;s ambitious targets. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

My Department will spend approximately &euro;248 million this year on HHB for over 446,000 customers. The package is generally available to people living in the State aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment or who satisfy a means test.  The package is also available to some people under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.  </p>  <p>  Since 1 April 2012, new applicants in receipt of Carers Allowance who are not living with the person for whom they provide care do not have an automatic entitlement to the household benefits package. Carers who live with the person they are caring for still have an entitlement of their own to the household benefits package and do not have to satisfy the household composition criteria.  </p>  <p>  The Government values the role of carers very much and it is for this reason that they receive significant income supports from the Department.  In addition to carer&rsquo;s allowance carers receive additional support in the form of free travel and household benefits (for those who live with the person for whom they care) and the annual carers support grant (&euro;1700) in respect of each person for whom they care.  Where a person is in receipt of certain qualifying social welfare payments, and also providing full time care and attention to another person, they can keep their primary social welfare payment and also get the half-rate carer's allowance.  </p>  <p>  It should be noted that Carer's payments are made at a higher level than other working age income-maintenance payments made by my Department.  The weekly rate for Carer's Allowance is &euro;219 where one person is being cared for, and &euro;328.50 where it is two or more, compared to &euro;203 for most other income-maintenance payments to those below pension age.  The means test for Carer's Allowance is also significantly more generous than those applying to other schemes.  </p>  <p>  Any decision to change the qualifying criteria for HHB would have budgetary consequences and would have to be considered in the context of budget negotiations. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

It aims to enhance employability and mobility by providing work experience and training opportunities for unemployed persons within their own communities. </p>  <p>  A key function of CE is supporting social inclusion and counteracting the drift into structural unemployment.  It is a broad and flexible programme that has been utilised to address many social challenges presenting at individual and/or societal level.  5% of CE placements are reserved to support the re-integration of participants referred to a CE place on a drug rehabilitation scheme through the delivery of the agreed inter-agency CE Drug Rehabilitation Programme within the CE Social Inclusion strand.</p>  <p>  All CE placements are categorised as either a training/activation strand or a social inclusion strand.  This is to acknowledge that not all CE places are the same.  The Social Inclusion placements provide an opportunity for those who are very distant from the labour market to gain employment and deliver services in their local communities while the activation placements are more directly related to employment opportunities for participants who are long-term unemployed with a view to providing them with more labour market relevant work experience.</p>  <p>  Deputies on all sides of the House are fully aware of the positive benefits derived from schemes like CE. Communities benefit from the skills and talents of participants and, in addition, participants are provided with the opportunity to improve existing skills, or develop new skills, while performing valuable work in their local communities.  Furthermore, many CE schemes provide vital community services across the country, all of which are well embedded in these communities.</p>  <p>  The Government agreed to establish an Interdepartmental Group (IDG) to explore the most appropriate organisational arrangements, in particular in respect of those CE schemes whose primary focus is social inclusion and the delivery of social services.  The first meeting of the IDG was held on 26th March and my Department are currently engaging with key stakeholders. </p>  <p>  I am fully committed to the future of this programme and will continue to support and improve the programme for the benefit of the participants and the valuable contribution it makes to local communities. </p></reply>

These payments are being reviewed under a new Total Contributions Approach (TCA) to pension calculation which includes provision for homecaring periods. </p>  <p>  The person has 751 reckonable paid contributions which combined with the maximum permissible number of HomeCaring periods and reckonable credits of 1,040, as set out in legislation, results in an increase from 85% to 86.11% of maximum rate State pension contributory.  A review outcome letter has issued to the person, outlining details of their increase of State pension contributory and includes a breakdown of their social insurance contribution record.  </p>  <p>  Under the terms of the restorative justice payment, a claimant aged over 66 years is entitled to a maximum payment of &euro;248.30 per week (which is equivalent to maximum rate state pension (contributory)).  The rate of restorative justice payment is the difference between the person's personal rate of social welfare entitlement and the maximum rate of state pension (contribution).   The person concerned was previously in receipt of a state pension contributory payment at the weekly rate of &euro;211.40 and their applicable rate under the restorative justice scheme was &euro;36.90 per week.  As the person's state pension contributory rate has increased to &euro;213.90,  the applicable weekly rate payable under the restorative justice scheme is now &euro;34.40. </p>  <p>  The provision of a weekly income of &euro;248.30 per week under the scheme, for a person over state pension age, is intended to put the person in a position that they would have occupied had they acquired sufficient contributions to qualify for the maximum rate of state pension contributory.  Any person who is already in receipt of another state benefit, such as state pension contributory, does  not receive the restorative justice payment in addition to their social welfare entitlement, but as a top up payment to bring the person's rate of payment up to the current maximum rate of state pension (contributory).</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This Act will facilitate commencement of existing legislation that provides for registration of children of donor-assisted births. </p>  <p>  The Act will make possible the registration, as parents, of both partners in a female same-sex relationship, whereas formerly only the particulars of the mother could be recorded in the birth register.  Inclusion of both partners as parents on birth certificates will assist in affirming their parental rights in practical day-to-day matters.  These new arrangements will support  easier access to services such as passports for their children, school enrolment, interaction with medical practitioners, and other situations where the demonstration of parental relationship may be required.</p>  <p>  Another key provision in the Act brings civil registration legislation in line with current legislation governing the presumption of paternity.  This will make it less onerous on a woman to rebut automatic presumption of paternity of her estranged husband in the birth registration process.  It will be possible for a woman to present her own evidence of separation in order to rebut automatic presumption that her estranged husband is the father of a child she may subsequently give birth to with a new partner.</p>  <p>  The Act also includes other amendments to civil registration that include provisions:</p>  <p>  - to allow a role for family members in registering a death in cases involving a coroner; </p>  <p>  - to allow the Civil Registration Service to share historical records with a body under the aegis of the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht; </p>  <p>  - to enable the Central Statistics Office to comply with EU Regulations concerning data collected as part of the death  registration process; and</p>  <p>  - other technical amendments concerning civil registrations.</p>  <p>  I will keep under review the need to bring forward further amendments to the Civil Registration Act, to ensure that the legislative provisions keep pace with new developments. </p></reply>

My Department will spend approximately &euro;248 million this year on HHB for over 446,000 customers.  The package is generally available to people living in the State aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment or who satisfy a means test.  The package is also available to some people under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.  </p>  <p>  Since 1 April 2012, new applicants in receipt of Carers Allowance who are not living with the person for whom they provide care do not have an automatic entitlement to the household benefits package.  At the time the measure was introduced the estimated yearly saving that would be achieved was &euro;5.9 million. </p>  <p>  Carers who live with the person they are caring for still have an entitlement of their own to the household benefits package and do not have to satisfy the household composition criteria.</p>  <p>  The Government values the role of carers very much and it is for this reason that they receive significant income supports from the Department.  In addition to carer&rsquo;s allowance carers receive additional support in the form of free travel and household benefits (for those who live with the person for whom they care) and the annual carers support grant (&euro;1,700) in respect of each person for whom they care.  Where a person is in receipt of certain qualifying social welfare payments, and also providing full time care and attention to another person, they can keep their primary social welfare payment and also get the half-rate carer's allowance.  </p>  <p>  It should be noted that Carer's payments are made at a higher level than other working age income-maintenance payments made by my Department.  The weekly rate for Carer's Allowance is &euro;219 where one person is being cared for, and &euro;328.50 where it is two or more, compared to &euro;203 for most other income-maintenance payments to those below pension age.  The means test for Carer's Allowance is also significantly more generous than those applying to other schemes.  </p>  <p>  Any decision to change the qualifying criteria for HHB would have budgetary consequences and would have to be considered in the context of budget negotiations. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

These are chaired by Directors of Housing in each authority and include HSE and disability representative organisations.  </p><p>Each HDSG has prepared a local Strategic Plan for its own City/County area, to develop specific local strategies to meet identified and emerging need over the next five years.  These Plans, the majority of which are now available on the relevant local authority websites, along with the annual Summary of Social Housing Assessments (SSHA), will allow local authorities to plan more strategically for the housing needs of people with a disability and will support the delivery of accommodation using all appropriate housing supply mechanisms.</p><p>The specific persons mentioned will be able to get more detailed information from their local authority in respect of its own local Strategic Plan. </p></reply>

The review is addressing a number of key aspects including sound or noise, visual amenity setback distances, shadow flicker, community obligation, community dividend and grid connections. </p>  <p>  As part of the overall review, a strategic environmental assessment (SEA) is being undertaken on the revised Guidelines before they come into effect, in accordance with the requirements of EU Directive 2001/24/EC on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment, otherwise known as the SEA Directive. </p>  <p>  SEA is a process by which environmental considerations are required to be fully integrated into the preparation of plans and programmes which act as frameworks for development consent, prior to their final adoption, with public consultation as part of that process.  My Department appointed SEA experts in December 2017 to assist in this regard.  </p>  <p>  While the revised draft guidelines were to be published in Quarter 1 2019, some delays to the planned schedule arose, due to the recent publication of updated World Health Organisation (WHO) noise standards and the need to focus on certain Brexit-related planning issues.  As part of the SEA process, there will be an 8 week public consultation on the revised draft Guidelines, together with the comprehensive environmental report with the aim of issuing the finalised Guidelines, following detailed analysis and consideration of the submissions and views received during the consultation phase, later in 2019.</p>  <p>  When finalised, the revised Guidelines will be issued under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.  Planning authorities and, where applicable, An Bord Plean&aacute;la must have regard to guidelines issued under Section 28 in the performance of their functions generally under the Planning Acts.  In the meantime, the current 2006 Wind Energy Development Guidelines remain in force.</p></reply>

This included an improved funding scheme for on-site wastewater treatment systems (more commonly known as septic tanks).</p>  <p>  The composition of the new multi-annual programme is based on recommendations from the Working Group that I established in April 2018 to conduct a review of investment needs and rural water services.  The Working Group, which is chaired by my Department, includes nominees from the National Federation of Group Water Schemes, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Health Service Executive, Department of Rural and Community Development and local authorities, through the County and City Management Association (CCMA).  The Working Group considered all elements of Rural Water Services, including enhancements to the scheme for Domestic Wastewater Treatment systems to better support the programme of measures in the River Basin Management Plan for Ireland 2018-2021, published in 2018.</p>  <p>  Work is at an advanced stage of development for the funding scheme.  I expect that the process will be completed in the coming weeks when the necessary Statutory Instruments containing regulations dealing with the financial assistance arrangements and related administrative matters are put in place.

The 2011 Regulations do not provide local authorities with any discretion to exceed the limits that apply to their administrative areas. </p>  <p>  Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, and the universal social charge.  The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once off in nature.</p>  <p>  The income bands are expressed in terms of a maximum net income threshold for a single-person household, with an allowance of 5% for each additional adult household member, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%; and 2.5% for each child, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%.  On that basis if the household consists of three adults and at least four children, the maximum net income threshold for a household in Co. Tipperary is &euro;30,000 and the maximum net income threshold for a household in Waterford City and County is &euro;36,000. </p>  <p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country.  It is important to note that the limits introduced at that time also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.</p>  <p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support.  The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources. </p>  <p>  However, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is underway.  The review will also have regard to current initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and cost rental and will be completed when the impacts of these parallel initiatives have been considered. </p></reply>

While responsibility for the provision of accommodation for homeless persons rests with individual housing authorities, the administration of homeless services is organised on a regional basis.</p>  <p>  The administration of homeless services is organised on a regional basis as this approach is considered more effective, bringing a strategic perspective to bear, including avoidance of over-concentration of homelessness services in certain areas and promoting appropriate regional availability of services, consistent with need.  In this regard, Kildare is included in the Mid-East Region along with the counties of Meath and Wicklow, while Laois is included in the Midlands Region along with the counties of Longford, Offaly and Westmeath.  </p>  <p>  Regional funding allocations are delegated to a lead-authority in each region and under these arrangements responsibility for assessment and decision-making in relation to the funding of services rests with the relevant regional Homeless Management Group, overseen by the lead-authority, within the available allocations.  </p>  <p>  As part of the delegated arrangements in place, my Department receives performance reports on a quarterly basis from the regional lead authorities.  These reports provide information on the numbers of adults in emergency accommodation for longer than six months.  The most recently submitted reports (Quarter 1 2019) show that on 31 March 2019, 47 adults in the Midlands Region and 124 adults in the Mid-East Region had been in emergency accommodation for longer than six months.  </p>  <p>  With regard to the numbers of persons rough sleeping in Co. Kildare, the data requested by the Deputy is not held by my Department.  I understand that the incidence of rough sleeping in Co. Kildare is limited to a small number of individuals, with no one sleeping rough due to a lack of available services.  When rough sleeping does occur, housing authority-funded outreach workers will engage with the rough sleeper to encourage them to avail of services, including accommodation.</p></reply>

However, Regulation 22(2) of the 2011 Regulations provides that this ineligibility does not apply where an applicant for social housing support owns accommodation that is occupied by his or her spouse, from whom he or she is formally separated or divorced.  Under the enactment, a deed of separation is sufficient to set aside this ineligibility ground and it is not necessary to await judicial separation or divorce to get a decision on social housing support in these cases.  The rationale for this exception is that the terms of a formal separation or divorce will provide for the future ownership and occupation of the family home and it will be clear whether the household that has left the family home can return to live there. </p><p>In order to provide more flexibility to local authorities to deal with cases where the ownership of the family home had not yet been finalised, the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014 amended section 20 of the 2009 Act and Local authorities may now provide such households with social housing support under the Rental Accommodation Scheme or the Housing Assistance Payment scheme until ownership of the family home is resolved in a formal separation or divorce settlement. </p><p>The 2014 Act amendment provides that support in these circumstances will be reviewed by the local authority at prescribed intervals and the household will not be able to transfer to other forms of social housing support while ownership of the family home remains to be determined.  However, where the household ultimately qualifies for the full range of social housing supports, the length of time the household was supported under RAS or HAP will be reckonable for the purposes of determining the household&rsquo;s relative priority for a transfer.</p></reply>
