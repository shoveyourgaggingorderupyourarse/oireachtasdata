The &lsquo;Ministerial Decision on the TRIPS Agreement&rsquo; provides for a waiver of certain obligations of the TRIPS Agreement and includes clarifications that will allow eligible WTO Members to authorise a company to manufacture and export COVID-19 vaccines in a fast and simplified manner and without the consent of the patent owner. </p>  <p>  Developing countries will be able to use this solution to authorise the manufacture, import or export of COVID-19 vaccines without prior negotiation with the patent owner and without any notification requirements that would delay the start of the manufacture or export. </p>  <p>  Equally important is the clarification that the remuneration for patent owners may take account of humanitarian or not-for-profit purpose of production and hence support the production and supply of COVID-19 vaccines at affordable prices for those in need.</p>  <p>  The Ministerial Decision covers COVID-19 vaccines as well as the ingredients and processes necessary for their manufacture.  At the time of the adoption of the Decision, there was no consensus among the Members to cover also COVID-19 diagnostics and therapeutics.  </p>  <p>  As a compromise, paragraph 8 of the Decision stipulates that no later than six months from the date of that Decision (17 December 2022), Members will be expected to decide on whether to extend the Decision to cover the production and supply of COVID-19 diagnostics and therapeutics.</p>  <p>  Trade is an exclusive competence of the EU, and accordingly the negotiations on TRIPS, as a trade matter, are led by the EU.  The EU is in the process of conducting internal consultations and analysis on the extension, taking into consideration that the case for COVID-19 therapeutics and diagnostics is more complex than the one pertaining to vaccines. </p>  <p>  Discussions on the extension of the mechanism to cover the production and supply of COVID-19 diagnostics and therapeutics are ongoing in the WTO and the EU is engaging constructively in these discussions. </p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to engage with the European Commission and other Member States on the EU position.  A decision to extend the earlier Ministerial Decision from June 2022 will require the agreement of all WTO Members. </p></reply>

This includes a new Electricity Cost Emergency Benefit Scheme through whereby &euro;550.47 (exclusive of VAT) will be credited to each domestic electricity account in three payments of &euro;183.49 in each of the following billing periods - November/December 2022, January/February 2023 and March/April 2023 to an estimated 2.2 million domestic electricity accounts, including pay as you go accounts. The estimated cost of this scheme is &euro;1.211 billion. The Electricity Costs Emergency Benefit Payment credited &euro;176.22 (excluding VAT) to domestic electricity accounts, including pay as you go accounts, through April, May and June this year. Upon the scheme&rsquo;s conclusion on 30 June over 2.1 million domestic electricity accounts had received the payment with the value of these payments totalling almost &euro;377 million. This means that 99.36% of eligible domestic electricity accounts had the credit applied. </p><p>The forthcoming scheme will apply to domestic electricity accounts using their unique MPRN to allow the payment to be credited to individual bills automatically without the need for application or approval including pay as you go meters.  </p><p>While the majority of residential tenants will hold their own domestic electricity accounts, and therefore receive the credit directly, others would have tenancy agreements where tenants pay their actual share of each bill and, in those cases, will benefit from the payment because the amount of the bill will be reduced by the amount of the payment. A small proportion would have other arrangements in place whereby electricity costs are part of the rental cost. Where tenants have a dispute relating to tenancies including any terms relating to electricity payments, these can be referred to the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) for dispute resolution.</p></reply>

An estimated 250,000 of these are where households requested this for various reasons (i.e. rental accommodation; holiday homes; or where a customer prefers to pay in advance for more certainty). There are about 90,000 so called &lsquo;hardship&rsquo; pay-as-you-go electricity meters, who have been switched to these to assist customers with managing their energy costs. There are estimated to be 117,000 pay-as-you-go gas meters, out of a total of nearly 690,000 residential gas meters (bill-pay and pay-as-you-go meters). </p><p>I understand there is no charge for moving from a hardship prepayment meter to bill-pay, whether it is electricity or gas.  </p><p>Government is acutely aware of the impact that the recent increases in global energy prices are having on households. This is why the Government introduced a &euro;2.4 billion package of supports 2022 and a package of one-off measures worth &euro;2.5 billion in the Budget 2023 cost of living package. </p><p>The Electricity Costs Emergency Benefit Payment credited &euro;176.22 (excluding VAT) to domestic electricity accounts, including pay as you go accounts, through April, May and June this year.

This means that 99.36% of eligible domestic electricity accounts had the credit applied.</p><p>Included in the Budget 2023 package is a new Electricity Cost Emergency Benefit Scheme through which &euro;550.47 (exclusive of VAT) will be credited to each domestic electricity account, including Pay as You Go accounts, in three payments of &euro;183.49 through the November/December 2022, January/February 2023 and March/April 2023 billing cycles. </p><p>This is in addition to an extension of the 9% VAT rate on electricity and gas until February 2023 and lump sum payments to social welfare recipients of schemes such as the Fuel Allowance, the Living Alone Allowance, and the Working Family payment.The Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU), was assigned responsibility for the regulation of the Irish electricity and gas markets following the enactment of the Electricity Regulation Act (ERA), 1999. As part of its statutory role, the CRU also has consumer protection functions and sets out the obligations on suppliers in the Electricity and Gas Suppliers Handbooks. Further detail is available at <i>www.cru.ie/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CRU21111a-Electricity-and-Gas-Suppliers-Handbook-2021.pdf</i>.</p><p>Furthermore, as part of Responses 6 and 7 under the National Energy Security Framework, CRU have announced enhanced consumer protection measures for implementation this winter. For pay as you go customers, these strengthened protections include:</p><p>-  increased emergency credit of no less than &euro;20; </p><p>-  an obligation on suppliers to advise their prepayment customers in debt, of other payment options available to them, including bill pay; </p><p>-  debt repayment levels will reduce from 10% from a previous 25% on pay-as-you-go customers top-up payments, whereby, on a &euro;20 top-up only &euro;2 will go towards debt repayment (if it exists), rather than &euro;5 previously; and,</p><p>-  an obligation on suppliers to place their customers who are on financial hardship meters on the most economic tariff for them.</p><p>The obligations set out in the Supplier Handbooks include special provisions for vulnerable customers on billing and disconnection. A vulnerable customer is defined as a household customer who is critically dependent on electrically powered equipment, which includes, but is not limited to, life protecting devices, assistive technologies to support independent living and medical equipment. This category of vulnerable customers cannot be disconnected for non-payment at any time.</p><p>Vulnerable customers are also defined as those who are particularly vulnerable to disconnection during the winter months for reasons of advanced age or physical, sensory, intellectual or mental health. The moratorium on disconnections for this group has been extended to 6 months (1 October to 31 March). The moratorium applies to bill pay customers. It is important that people who are in such a situation contact their energy supplier to register with them as a vulnerable customer. Their electricity supplier will then notify ESB Networks. ESBN maintains a Vulnerable Customer Register based on the information provided to them by suppliers.</p><p>Given, the challenges that all households will face this winter I met with the CRU and suppliers to discuss the situation on the ground and the practical supports, such as hardship funds, for pay-as-you-go customers. As with all customers it is important that if someone finds it is difficult to maintain their credit that they contact their supplier as soon as possible. Energy suppliers also work with NGOs such as MABS and St. Vincent de Paul. Further meetings are scheduled.</p><p>The Deputy may wish to note that CRU provides a dedicated email address for Oireachtas members, which enables them raise questions on energy regulatory matters, to CRU at oireachtas@cru.ie for timely direct reply.</p></reply>

These gas increases feed directly through to retail electricity prices as the wholesale price of electricity correlates strongly with the price of gas. Natural gas futures prices for next year are fluctuating but are averaging around 450 pence per therm.    The Government is acutely aware of the impact of high electricity and gas prices on households and businesses. This is why the Government introduced a &euro;2.4 billion package of supports in 2022 and a package of one-off measures worth &euro;2.5 billion in the Budget 2023 cost of living package. This includes a new Electricity Cost Emergency Benefit Scheme through which &euro;550.47 (exclusive of VAT) will be credited to each domestic electricity account, including Pay as You Go accounts, in three payments of &euro;183.49 through the November/December 2022, January/February 2023 and March/April 2023 billing cycles.

The agreed measures include:</p>  <p>  -  A cap on excess revenues made by energy producers not using gas to produce electricity. All revenues that exceed that cap will be returned to electricity customers. </p>  <p>  -  A solidarity payment to capture part of the surplus profits being made by fossil fuel companies, again to be return to electricity customers.</p>  <p>  -  An EU wide plan to introduce energy reduction measures, particular targeting the peak hours of 5-7pm to lower the need for expensive gas generation to meet that peak demand. </p>  <p>  The details of the agreed measures are now being worked out but are expected to provide additional funding to distribute strategically to those put most at risk by high prices over the coming months. </p></reply>

The purpose of the NBP is to promote the deployment of a Next Generation Access network (&lsquo;NGA&rsquo;) comprising access segments and where necessary related backhaul segments in areas of the country where there is no broadband network in place capable of delivering reliably download speeds of at least 30 Mbps and where there are no plans for such coverage in the next seven years (i.e. &lsquo;white&rsquo; NGA areas).</p>  <p>  As a State intervention, the NBP must comply with the requirements of the European Commission&rsquo;s State Aid Guidelines (SAG) on the application of the State aid rules to broadband networks.  The SAG requires, amongst other things, that Member States carry out a detailed mapping exercise and public consultation process to identify, as far as reasonably possible, those areas where intervention is required. </p>  <p>  Since 2013, the Department has engaged in an extensive Mapping Process to map broadband availability across Ireland, in order to identify which geographic areas already have or will have access to Next Generation Access (NGA) broadband services, i.e. a broadband service delivering at least 30Mbps download speeds and which areas required intervention from the State.  Extensive information has been published at every stage of the overall NBP process, including each iteration of the NBP Map and information on the Mapping Process and the development of the NBP Map itself. This information can be found at www.broadband.gov.ie. </p>  <p>  The mapping process included a number of public consultations conducted over a six year period from 2013 to 2019.  The most recent public consultation was in November 2019, which aimed to finalise the NBP Map in advance of signing the NBP contract. This public consultation confirmed the existing and planned coverage of broadband services across Ireland. It relied on the most up to date information available, shared by commercial operators, of their existing and planned broadband services. The Department undertook an analysis of this information and determined where broadband services existed and where it was planned. </p>  <p>  The European Commission approved the National Broadband Plan in the context of EU State Aid rules.  The Commission issued the decision on 15 November 2019. The Commission has published a non-confidential version of its detailed decision on the EU Commission website.</p>  <p>  The NBP contract, which was signed on 19 November 2019, provides that a future proofed high-speed broadband network will be deployed by National Broadband Ireland (NBI) to people living and working in the intervention area. It is expected that over 600,000 premises will be connected including new builds.  The NBP network will offer those premises in the Intervention Area a high-speed fibre broadband service with a minimum download speed of 500Mbps from the outset.  </p>  <p>  The EU Commission is currently in the process of updating the State Aid Guidelines for broadband, which could allow EU Member States to allocate public funding to locations where 100Mbps is not yet available. The revised guidelines will aid EU Member States in meeting the EU&rsquo;s ambition of enabling Gigabit networks to all premises by 2030.</p></reply>

The estimated cost of this scheme is &euro;1.211 billion and will be provided to my Department through a Supplementary Estimate.The payment will be applied to domestic electricity accounts which are subject to distribution use of system charges at the rate for urban domestic customers (DG1) or the rate for rural domestic customers (DG2). This includes accounts with pre-pay meters. The scheme uses the single identifier of the Meter Point Registration Number (MPRN) to ensure it can be administered automatically and without an application/approval process. </p><p>On 22 September I announced the extension of Government supports of up to &euro;2,400 for the installation of solar PV panels for non-domestic buildings &ndash; aimed specifically at businesses, public organisations and community groups. The new grants are the next phase in the Government&rsquo;s Microgeneration Support Scheme (MSS) and are administered through the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI). The scheme provides grant funding of up to &euro;2,400 towards the installation of solar PV technology up to a maximum of 6kWp, which equates to approximately 16 solar panels. This provides an opportunity for all areas of the non-domestic sector to not only reduce their electricity bills, but to visibly demonstrate their commitment to sustainability and Ireland&rsquo;s broader climate action goals.At the current high electricity prices, businesses, including the community groups, have the potential to save &euro;2,000-3,000 per annum from a solar PV system supported under this scheme. Moreover, with the introduction of the Clean Export Guarantee (CEG), any residual renewable electricity not consumed on the premises is now eligible for an export payment which further supports the investment. This means that the installation can pay for itself quickly &ndash; thus helping to protect businesses and organisations across the country against rising energy prices into the future. Solar PV is also one of a range of measures funded under the SEAI Communities Energy Grant Scheme which makes grant funding available to improve the energy efficiency of the building stock and is open to domestic and non-domestic applications. To apply for a grant, non-domestic applicants should visit www.seai.ie and follow the outlined steps.</p><p>In addition, as part of its suite of once-off measures, Budget 2023 allocates &euro;340 million for support for communities including sports bodies and community organisations.</p></reply>

The level of activity in this area will rise in Q4 and along with a range of other measures and schemes will contribute to SEAI working to reach its overall target of 27,000 home energy upgrades for the year. </p><p>Budget 2023 included an exchequer capital funding allocation of &euro;337.3 million for the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) residential and community energy upgrade schemes, including Solar and Microgen. &euro;291 million of the exchequer allocation is being provided from carbon tax revenue. The 2023 allocation compares to &euro;244.2 million in funding in 2022 (allocation following the Supplementary Estimate in July) and equates to an increase of &euro;93 million.This overall allocation is the highest ever and means that the Warmer Homes Scheme, National Home Energy Upgrade Scheme, Better Energy Homes, Community Energy Grant Scheme and the Solar PV Scheme and Microgen will each have record budget allocations for 2023 to support homes, businesses, and community organisations including approved housing bodies, helping to protect them against energy cost increases into the future, while also reducing our emissions.This investment will deliver over 37,000 home energy upgrades including over 13,800 homes to a Building Energy Rating (BER) of B2 and 6,000 free upgrades under the SEAI energy poverty scheme.</p><p>Regarding the estimated number of homes that require attic and cavity wall insulation upgrades, the SEAI estimate that there could be of the order of 500,000 homes that have attic insulation with a thickness of less than 120mm (4-5 inches) of mineral wool, while approximately 162,000 homes have cavity wall construction that could benefit from insulation, of which approximately 80,000 were constructed pre-1980 that could particularly benefit from cavity wall insulation.</p></reply>

The Climate Action Plan set a goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the residential sector from 7 Mt CO2 eq. in 2018 to between 3.5-4.5 Mt CO2 eq. in 2030.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government and Climate Action Plan set ambitious targets to retrofit the equivalent of 500,000 homes to a Building Energy Rating (BER) of B2/cost optimal or carbon equivalent and the installation of 400,000 heat pumps in existing homes to replace older, less efficient heating systems by end-2030.  This represents approximately 30% of the housing stock and is among the most ambitious retrofit programmes worldwide.</p>  <p>  Recognising that the achievement of these targets will require a step-change in the pace and scale of delivery Ireland&rsquo;s residential retrofit programme, earlier this year the Government has approved a package of supports to make it easier and more affordable for homeowners to undertake home energy upgrades, for warmer, healthier and more comfortable homes, with lower energy bills. The key measures include:</p>  <p>  - A new National Home Energy Upgrade Scheme providing increased grant levels of up to 50% (up from 30%-35%) of the cost of a typical deep retrofit to a B2 BER standard.</p>  <p>  - Significantly increasing the number of free energy upgrades for those at risk of energy poverty, to 400 per month from an average of 177 per month in 2021.</p>  <p>  - A special enhanced grant rate, equivalent to 80% of the typical cost, for attic and cavity wall insulation for all households, to urgently reduce energy use as part of the government&rsquo;s response to current exceptionally high energy prices.</p>  <p>  To support the overarching policy objectives, the grant rates to homeowners are focused towards those measures which will be most effective in reducing energy use and reducing carbon emissions. On that basis, grant supports for wood pellet stoves are not available under the SEAI residential energy upgrade schemes.</p></reply>

As such, the NTA has powers to make regulations in relation to the age limits of SPSVs.</p>  <p>  Regulations made by the NTA in 2010 first established an age limit of less than 10 years old for new standard taxis and hackneys. The ten-year rule was adopted in recognition of the need to strike a balance between achieving standards that offer the customer confidence, comfort and safety, and allowing industry members to operate successfully.  I would note that the Irish 10-year rule for standard taxis and hackneys is not particularly onerous by comparison with other jurisdictions.</p>  <p>  Wheelchair accessible taxis and hackneys are permitted to operate up to 15 years of age. No maximum permissible age is prescribed for limousines in recognition of both the vintage nature of many of these vehicles and their generally reduced mileage.</p>  <p>  During the Covid-19 pandemic, standard age limits for taxis and hackneys were extended on several occasions, and are currently extended through to the end of 2022. This change helped ensure no operator exited the industry simply because of the need to replace a vehicle.</p>  <p>  Within the last month a series of global circumstances has, in the NTA&rsquo;s view, considerably worsened the capability of taxi and hackney licence holders to secure new vehicles, with lead times of one year not uncommon already. Therefore, the NTA has recently proposed to temporarily extend the maximum permissible age for taxis and hackneys with a current final operation date in 2023 and 2024, such that no current vehicle licence holder is forced out of the industry because a replacement vehicle cannot be purchased.</p>  <p>  The NTA opened a public consultation on this proposal on 19 September 2022, which runs until 12 October 2022. Details and submission forms are available on the NTA website.</p></reply>

Upon its finalisation a full review of National Ports Policy will commence later this year which will look at the overall ports policy framework.</p>  <p>  National Ports Policy provides the overarching policy framework for the governance and future development of Ireland&rsquo;s state port network. The responsiveness and competitiveness of Ireland's maritime transport industry are underpinned by National Ports Policy 2013. It has helped foster competition between ports and ensure minimal barriers to entry for shipping companies seeking to enter the Irish market.</p>  <p>  The aim of the National Ports Policy is to facilitate a competitive and effective market for maritime transport services and to ensure that the system has adequate and efficient capacity. It included a commitment to undertake regular independent assessments of port capacity starting in 2018.  A consultancy team were contracted to assess the capacity of Ireland&rsquo;s port network.   However, COVID-19, Brexit, and more recently the Russian/Ukraine conflict have been a key priority for stakeholders and has delayed this work.</p>  <p>  The national and international environment for which the 2013 policy was developed has changed fundamentally. As Minister, I recognise that a new approach is needed to assist our ports with the environmental, technological, demographic, and geopolitical challenges of the next decade and beyond.</p>  <p>  In line with National Development Project objectives and National Ports Policy, the State ports are continuing to progress projects under their Masterplans. The Ports of Dublin, Cork, Shannon Foynes and Rosslare will spend &euro;144m in capital expenditure in 2022 and almost &euro;500m over the next five years. These non-exchequer funded investments will enhance Ireland&rsquo;s capacity and connectivity and will allow the ports to respond to market needs, handle increases in ship sizes and frequency and serve the import and export needs of the economy.</p></reply>

This report aligns with Government Policy I published last December on the facilitation of ORE by Irish Commercial Ports in identifying that a number of port facilities will be required for deployment activity and a multiple of ports will be needed for O&amp;M operations. Delivery of the necessary infrastructure is ongoing in ports to address the requirements of industry. </p>  <p>  Ireland will potentially need to build on a phased basis, around 4 to 5 standard ORE port facilities (each capable of building 500 MW of ORE annually) that will act as construction and deployment ports over the next 25 &ndash; 30 years.

Like all other commercial state ports, its investments must be funded from port revenues. </p>  <p>  While the primary function of our commercial State ports is to facilitate maritime transport, it is recognised that there is a pressing need for Ireland to have the port capacity in place to exploit the opportunities presented by ORE. </p>  <p>  To provide clarity to stakeholders, including ports, I published a Policy Statement in December 2021 on the facilitation of Offshore Renewable Energy by commercial ports in Ireland, setting out a Government's multiport approach to the provision of the necessary port facilities. </p>  <p>  Ireland will potentially need to build on a phased basis, around 4 to 5 standard ORE port facilities (each capable of building 500 MW of ORE annually) that will act as construction and deployment ports over the next 25 &ndash; 30 years. In addition, a number of smaller ports will be required for ORE Operation and Maintenance activities. A multiport approach will ultimately allow investments that are commercially viable in the long-term progress without undermining the ability of any port to meet its primary obligations in relation to the facilitation of international trade.</p>  <p>  Located on the east coast where the first Offshore Wind Energy (ORE) developments will progress, Rosslare Europort is ideally situated to service a range of windfarms in the Irish Sea. </p>  <p>  A number of ports, including Rosslare, and private entities are already progressing plans to provide the facilities and infrastructure required to assist the ORE sector to develop in Ireland.  It is intended that the first largescale facilities that will be required at construction and deployment stage will be in situ as early as possible, subject to all consents being obtained in a timely fashion.</p>  <p>  In order to capture the wider and longer the economic and business opportunities associated with ORE, significant work is ongoing at official level across a number of Government Departments to accelerate  delivery of the various workstreams that are needed for the development of ORE in Ireland, including the delivery of port infrastructure.  This includes the establishment of a Ports Co-Ordination Committee in this Department which involves ports and relevant Departments to ensure alignment with Government policy in the delivery of the port projects. </p>  <p>  Work is also underway in the Department of Environment, Communications and Climate in preparation for the holding of the Offshore Renewable Energy Support Scheme (ORESS1) auction.  The completion of this auction will provide clarity around the projects to be progressed and allow for deeper engagement between developers and ports on requirements and revenue streams for services.  In addition, the Government has decided that ORE projects will be prioritised through all planning and consenting stages.</p>  <p>  It is envisaged that like all port infrastructure, the ORE facilities will be funded though a combination of port revenues, EU funding and borrowing from the likes of ISIF, EIB and other financial institutions.</p>  <p>  In order to maximise EU funding opportunities, the Department engaged extensively with other Member States and the Commission advocating for the inclusion of funding for ORE required port infrastructure under the Connecting Europe Funding facility (CEF). The CEF criteria was extended in 2021 to allow EU funding of port infrastructure for ORE for ports (or terminals within ports) on the Trans European Network for Transport (TEN-T). This is significant as successful applicants can obtain grant funding of up to 50% of eligible costs for studies and up 30% of infrastructure works costs. This is a competitive process and generally oversubscribed.  While the outcome of the 2021 CEF call was disappointing, the 2022 CEF call is now underway.   It is expected that ports, including Rosslare Europort, will be making new applications for EU funding under that call.  The Department assists, as appropriate, eligible applicants with the application process.  In addition, my Department and I engaged intensively with the EU Commission, along with separate feedback to ports, to understand the 2021 decisions so that we could work towards a better outcome for the 2022 CEF call.</p></reply>

However, the Directive allows a Member State to continue its application of a historic VAT treatment, under certain strict conditions, including that the application of the historic treatment cannot be expanded.  On this basis, Ireland has retained the application of its reduced rate of VAT, currently 13.5%, to the services of yoga studios.  There is no discretion under the Directive to expand the application of this VAT rate to other supplies, for example to karate-class training for children.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, changes in the VAT Directive agreed in April this year would allow for a reduced rate to apply to the supply of sport or physical exercise classes. Changes in VAT rates are considered as part of the normal annual Budget and Finance Bill process.

In general, the EU VAT Directive provides that all goods and services are liable to VAT at the standard rate (currently 23% in Ireland), unless they fall within the categories of goods and services specified in Annex III of the VAT Directive, in respect of which Member States may apply a lower rate of VAT. Ireland is also permitted to retain some historic VAT arrangements, under strict conditions.</p>  <p>  Following amendments to Annex III of the VAT Directive, agreed in April 2022, it now includes a category for "the supply and installation of solar panels on and adjacent to private dwellings, housing and public and other buildings used for activities in the public interest." This does not include agricultural buildings.</p>  <p>  Outside of the above category in Annex III, the supply of solar equipment, including rooftop solar photovoltaic, is liable to VAT at the standard rate, currently 23%.  However, if these goods are supplied as part of a &ldquo;supply and install&rdquo; contract, they may be subject to VAT at the reduced rate of 13.5%.  A &ldquo;supply and install&rdquo; contract is where installation services are provided in conjunction with the goods for example, solar panels.  As a result, if solar panels were supplied on agricultural buildings as part of a &ldquo;supply and install&rdquo; contract, then the contract may be subject to VAT at the reduced rate of 13.5%, provided that the value of the goods supplied does not exceed two thirds of the total value of the contract.</p>  <p>  The Deputy should also note that in accordance with the EU VAT Directive farmers may register for VAT or be treated as an unregistered flat rate farmer for VAT purposes. Farmers that are not registered for VAT are not entitled to recover VAT incurred on their expenses. However, these farmers are compensated for the VAT incurred on goods and services used in the course of their farming business through the flat rate addition which they receive on payments for their supplies of agricultural produce and services. </p>  <p>  Unregistered farmers may also be able to avail of a VAT refund on certain expenses allowed for under the Value-Added Tax (Refund of Tax) (Flat-rate Farmers) Order 2012 (S.I. No. 201/2012). This provides for a refund of VAT to unregistered farmers on &ldquo;the construction, erection or installation of qualifying equipment for the purpose of micro-generation of electricity for use solely or mainly in his or her farming business&rdquo;.  The equipment that qualifies under this Refund Order includes a wind turbine system, photo-voltaic system, and equipment ancillary to these systems. </p>  <p>  Alternatively, farmers may elect to register for VAT and will have an entitlement to reclaim VAT on costs incurred in relation to their farm business.  A VAT registered farmer would be entitled to reclaim VAT incurred on the purchase and installation of solar panels used for their farming business through their VAT returns.</p></reply>

Until the changes I brought in as part of the Finance Act 2019, Ireland&rsquo;s vehicle benefit-in-kind regime was unusual in that there was no overall CO2 rationale in the regime. This is despite a CO2 based vehicle BIK regime being legislated for as far back as 2008 (but never having been commenced).</p>  <p>  In Finance Act 2019, I legislated for a CO2-based BIK regime for company cars from 1 January 2023. From that date the amount taxable as BIK remains determined by the car&rsquo;s original market value (OMV) and the annual business kilometres driven, while new CO2 emissions-based bands will determine whether a standard, discounted, or surcharged rate is taxable. The number of mileage bands is reduced from five to four. EVs will benefit from a preferential rate of BIK, ranging from 9 &ndash; 22.5% depending on mileage. Fossil-fuel vehicles will be subject to higher BIK rates, up to 37.5%. This new structure with CO2-based discounts and surcharges will incentivise employers to provide employees with low-emission cars.</p>  <p>  I am aware there have been arguments surrounding the mileage bands in the new BIK structure as they can be perceived as incentivising higher mileage to avail of lower rates, leading to higher levels of emissions. The rationale behind the mileage bands is that the greater the business mileage, the more the car is a benefit to the company rather than its employee (on average); and the more the car depreciates in value, the less of a benefit it is to the employee (in years 2 and 3) as the asset from which the benefit is derived is depreciating faster. Mileage bands also ensure that cars more integral to the conduct of business receive preferential tax treatment.</p>  <p>  I believe that better value for money for the taxpayer is achieved by curtailing the amount of subsidies available and building an environmental rationale directly into the BIK regime. It was determined in this context that reforming the BIK system to include emissions bands provides for a more sustainable environmental rationale than the continuation of the current system with exemptions for electric vehicles (EVs). This will bring the taxation system around company cars into step with other CO2-based motor taxes as well as the long-established CO2-based vehicle BIK regimes in other member states.</p>  <p>  In addition to the above and  in light of government commitments on climate change, Budget 2022 extended the preferential BIK treatment for EVs to end 2025 with a tapering mechanism on the vehicle value threshold. This BIK exemption forms part of a broader series of very generous measures to support the uptake of EVs, including a reduced rate of 7% VRT, a VRT relief of up to &euro;5,000, low motor tax of &euro;120 per annum, SEAI grants, discounted tolls fees, and 0% BIK on electric charging. </p>  <p>  This new BIK charging mechanism was legislated for in 2019 and was announced as part of Budget 2020, therefore providing a sufficient lead in time to adapt to this new system before its implementation in 2023. There are no plans to review it.</p></reply>

The scheme will be administered by the Revenue Commissioners and will operate on a self-assessment basis. Businesses will be required to register for the scheme and to make claims within the required time limits. These are similar requirements to the Covid Restrictions Support Scheme. The focus is on Case I trades rather than Case II professionals because of the likely differences in energy consumption between trading and non-trading businesses.</p><p>It is proposed that the scheme will operate by comparing the average unit price for the relevant bill period in 2022 with the average unit price in the corresponding reference period in 2021. If the increase in average unit price is more than 50% then the threshold has passed and the business is eligible for support under the scheme.A business who has not seen an increase of 50% over the period will not be eligible for the scheme.</p><p>Once eligibility criteria are met, the support for businesses will be calculated on the basis of 40% of the amount of the increase in the bill amount. A monthly cap of &euro;10,000 per trade will apply and an overall cap will apply on the total amount a business can claim in accordance with the State Aid Temporary Crisis Framework .</p><p>Where a business meets all of the criteria for the scheme, they may apply for support under the scheme subject to the applicable caps. </p><p>The operational details of the scheme are being worked through by officials and will be available soon. </p></reply>

This includes the delivery of 90,000 social homes by 2030. Housing for All is supported by an investment package of over &euro;4bn per annum, through an overall combination of &euro;12bn in direct Exchequer funding, &euro;3.5bn in funding through the Land Development Agency and &euro;5bn funding through the Housing Finance Agency. </p><p>Under Housing for All, the Government will deliver 47,600 new build social homes and 3,500 social homes through long-term leasing in the period 2022-2026. Our clear focus is to increase the stock of social housing through new build projects delivered by local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies (AHB) and, with this, to reduce the numbers of social homes delivered through acquisition programmes. However, acquisitions of second hand properties for social housing fall under a number of local authority and Approved Housing Body (AHB) acquisitions programmes. </p><p>On 19 January my Department issued a circular letter to local authorities advising that social housing acquisitions by local authorities and AHB CALF acquisitions in 2022 would be focussed on a number of priority areas, as follows:</p><p>-  One-bedroom units to deliver on Housing First and meet the short supply in this category;</p><p>-  Other properties that allow persons/families to exit homelessness; and</p><p>-  Specific housing required for/suitable for individuals with a disability or other particular priority needs;</p><p>Local authorities were also advised that limited acquisitions through the Capital Assistance Scheme will also be approved, subject to the available budget for specific vulnerable cohorts, such as housing for older people, accommodation for individuals and families who are homeless and for people with a disability.</p><p>On 20 April, a further circular letter issued to local authorities in relation to social housing acquisitions. The key purpose of this circular was to advise local authorities that I had reinstated the delegated sanction to local authorities in respect of social housing acquisitions which are:</p><p>(i)  in one of the priority categories set out in the January circular letter; (ii)  in line with acquisition cost guidelines; and (iii)  can be completed during 2022.</p><p>The reinstatement of delegated sanction will allow local authorities to respond more flexibility to secure acquisitions which support a household to exit or to prevent homelessness. I have requested local authorities to be proactive in acquiring properties which can prevent homelessness, including properties where a notice of termination has been issued to the tenant. </p><p>My Department publishes comprehensive programme level statistics on a quarterly basis on social housing delivery activity in all local authorities, including information on social housing acquisitions. This data is available until the end of Quarter 2 2022 and is published on the statistics page of my Department&rsquo;s website, at the following link: www.gov.ie/en/collection/6060e-overall-social-housing-provision/.</p><p>My Department does not hold data on the occupation status of properties acquired for social housing. This information may be available from the individual local authorities. </p></reply>

The Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe (Towns) Fund is a key initiative which underpins these policy objectives set out in Pathway Four of Housing for All.</p><p>Schemes under the Fund, which are delivered by local authorities, provide new choices for people to live in towns and villages in Ireland, through the provision of a grant to support the refurbishment of vacant properties and by providing serviced sites in towns and villages to people in order to build their own homes.</p><p>On the 14 July, I launched the Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant as part of the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe (Towns) Fund. The grant benefits those who wish to turn a formerly vacant house or building into their principal private residence. A grant of up to a maximum of &euro;30,000 is available for the refurbishment of vacant properties for occupation as a principal private residence, including the conversion of a property which has not previously been used as residential. Where the refurbishment costs are expected to exceed the standard grant of up to &euro;30,000, a maximum top-up grant amount of up to &euro;20,000 is available where the property is confirmed to be derelict, bringing the total grant available for a derelict property up to a maximum of &euro;50,000.</p><p>On 21 September, I launched the Ready to Build Scheme, also funded by the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe (Towns) Fund.  Under the Ready to Build Scheme, local authorities will make serviced sites in towns and villages available to potential individual purchasers to build their homes. These sites will be available at a discount on the market value of the site for the building of a property for occupation as the principal private residence of the purchaser. </p><p>The operation of both schemes under the fund is delegated to and managed by local authorities. In 2022, a &euro;50 million fund is available and it is not anticipated that there will be a constraint on allocations. Expenditure and associated allocations will be kept under review for 2023.</p></reply>

This includes the delivery of 90,000 social homes by 2030. Housing for All is supported by an investment package of over &euro;4bn per annum, through an overall combination of &euro;12bn in direct Exchequer funding, &euro;3.5bn in funding through the Land Development Agency and &euro;5bn funding through the Housing Finance Agency. </p><p>Under Housing for All, the Government will deliver 47,600 new build social homes and 3,500 social homes through long-term leasing in the period 2022-2026. Our clear focus is to increase the stock of social housing through new build projects delivered by local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies (AHB) and, with this, to reduce the numbers of social homes delivered through acquisition programmes. However, acquisitions of second hand properties for social housing fall under a number of local authority and Approved Housing Body (AHB) acquisitions programmes. </p><p>On 19 January my Department issued a circular letter to local authorities advising that social housing acquisitions by local authorities and AHB CALF acquisitions in 2022 would be focused on a number of priority areas, as follows:</p><p>(i) One-bedroom units to deliver on Housing First and meet the short supply in this category; (ii) Other properties that allow persons/families to exit homelessness; and (iii) Specific housing required for/suitable for individuals with a disability or other particular priority needs;</p><p>Local authorities were also advised that limited acquisitions through the Capital Assistance Scheme will also be approved, subject to the available budget for specific vulnerable cohorts, such as housing for older people, accommodation for individuals and families who are homeless and for people with a disability.</p><p>On 20 April, a further circular letter issued to local authorities in relation to social housing acquisitions. The key purpose of this circular was to advise local authorities that I had reinstated the delegated sanction to local authorities in respect of social housing acquisitions which are:</p><p>(i) in one of the priority categories set out in the January circular letter;(ii) in line with acquisition cost guidelines; and (iii) can be completed during 2022.</p><p>The reinstatement of delegated sanction will allow local authorities to respond more flexibility to secure acquisitions which support a household to exit or to prevent homelessness. I have requested local authorities to be proactive in acquiring properties which can prevent homelessness, including properties where a notice of termination has been issued to the tenant. </p><p>My Department publishes comprehensive programme level statistics on a quarterly basis on social housing delivery activity in all local authorities, including information on social housing acquisitions. This data is available until the end of Quarter 2 2022 and is published on the statistics page of my Department&rsquo;s website, at the following link: www.gov.ie/en/collection/6060e-overall-social-housing-provision/.</p><p>My Department does not hold data on the occupation status of properties acquired for social housing. This information may be available from individual local authorities. </p></reply>

The purpose of the SSHA is to capture the total number of households qualified for social housing support across the country whose social housing need has not yet been met, in order to better understand the level of need for such support. It sets out the categories of need under which all applicants have applied for social housing supports, including those with a disability. </p><p>My Department introduced a revised social housing application form in March 2021 in consultation with the local authority sector. The changes made provided an application form that is more customer focused, and which is more streamlined and accessible for the applicant. The application form already provided for applicants to identify housing requirements arising from a disability or medical condition, but now also includes an identifier for persons requiring 'wheelchair liveable' accommodation. In order to ensure that data captured in the SSHA aligns with the changes to the application form my Department recently collaborated with the Local Government Management Agency and the Housing Agency on a project to assess how this can best be achieved. This work is completed and the SSHA 2022 report will include the number of applicants on the housing waiting list who require &lsquo;wheelchair liveable&rsquo; accommodation.</p><p>My Department does not hold information on the allocation of housing supports and the oversight and practical management of housing waiting lists, including the allocation and transfer of tenancies, is solely a matter for the relevant local authority in accordance with the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, and associated regulations. Section 22 of the 2009 Act requires all local authorities, as a reserved function, to make an allocation scheme determining the order of priority to be accorded in the allocation of dwellings to households qualified for social housing support and to households approved for a transfer, the allocation of which would, in the opinion of the authority, meet the accommodation needs and requirements of the households.</p><p>In addition, information on the number of &lsquo;wheelchair liveable&rsquo; housing provided by each local authority is not available in my Department. This information may be available directly from local authorities.</p><p>The National Planning Framework (Objective 37) requires each local authority to carry out a Housing Needs Demand Assessment (HNDA) in order to correlate and accurately align overall future housing requirements, as an evolution of their existing Housing Strategy requirements under Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000.  The HNDA framework also aims to ensure support of independent living for people requiring more specialised types of housing or support needs, including accessible and wheelchair housing. </p><p>The initiation, design, planning, development and management of housing projects is a matter for local authorities in exercise of their statutory functions. Each local authority also has a Housing and Disability Steering Group (HDSG) whose role it is to plan for the housing of disabled people in their areas in collaboration with the statutory agencies, including the preparation of strategic plans. The knowledge and experience of these groups on the ground plays a key role in advocating for the housing needs of disabled people when local authorities are putting housing plans in place.  </p><p>I launched the second joint National Housing Strategy for Disabled People (NHSDP) 2022-2027., on 14 January 2022 together with Minister of State Peter Burke, T.D. and Ms. Anne Rabbitte, T.D., Minister of State with responsibility for Disability.<b></b>The new Strategy operates within the framework of <i>Housing for All</i>&ndash; A New Housing Plan for Ireland which is committed to ensuring that affordable, quality housing with an appropriate mix of housing design types provided within social housing, including universally designed units, is available to everyone in Irish society, including those with disabilities and older people. The role of the Housing and Disability Steering Groups will be strengthened over the lifetime of the national Strategy. </p><p>Preparation of the Implementation Plan for the National Housing Strategy for Disabled People is at an advanced stage and will be completed by year end.</p></reply>

All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties comply with these regulations. Responsibility for the enforcement of the Regulations rests with the relevant local authority.  </p><p>To aid increased inspections of properties and ensure greater compliance with the Regulations, increased Exchequer funding has been made available to local authorities since 2018 to enable them to build inspection capacity, with payments based on the number of inspections undertaken. Significant progress was made across the sector. The number of inspections more than doubled from 19,645 in 2017 to 40,728 in 2019. However, given the need for inspectors to enter tenants&rsquo; homes, pandemic restrictions greatly impacted on inspection activity since March 2020. The number of inspections undertaken fell to 25,703 in 2020 and 20,240 in 2021. However, figures for the first half of 2022 show that more than 23,000 inspections have been carried out. </p><p>The following table includes the number of private rental accommodation inspections by each local authority for 2021 and to date in 2022. <table>    <tr>       <th><div>Local Authorities </div></th>       <th><div>Total Inspections carried out 2021 </div></th>       <th><div>Total Inspections carried out to Q2 2022 </div></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Carlow </td>       <td><div>317 </div></td>       <td><div>                              25 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cavan </td>       <td><div>83 </div></td>       <td><div>                            163 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Clare </td>       <td><div>173 </div></td>       <td><div>                            337 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork City </td>       <td><div>837 </div></td>       <td><div>                        3,010 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork </td>       <td><div>557 </div></td>       <td><div>                            718 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Donegal </td>       <td><div>1,621 </div></td>       <td><div>                            875 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin City </td>       <td><div>3,663 </div></td>       <td><div>                        3,404 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown </td>       <td><div>1,175 </div></td>       <td><div>                           985 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Fingal </td>       <td><div>2,798 </div></td>       <td><div>                        3,930 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway City </td>       <td><div>145 </div></td>       <td><div>                            102 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway County </td>       <td><div>626 </div></td>       <td><div>                        1,105 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerry </td>       <td><div>699 </div></td>       <td><div>                            655 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare </td>       <td><div>341 </div></td>       <td><div>                            365 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilkenny </td>       <td><div>437 </div></td>       <td><div>                            190 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Laois </td>       <td><div>247 </div></td>       <td><div>                            473 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Leitrim </td>       <td><div>142 </div></td>       <td><div>                            302 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick City &amp;amp; County </td>       <td><div>416 </div></td>       <td><div>                           445 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Longford </td>       <td><div>331 </div></td>       <td><div>                            112 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth </td>       <td><div>305 </div></td>       <td><div>                            475 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mayo </td>       <td><div>682 </div></td>       <td><div>                            576 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Meath </td>       <td><div>664 </div></td>       <td><div>                            866 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Monaghan </td>       <td><div>89 </div></td>       <td><div>                            256 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Offaly </td>       <td><div>45 </div></td>       <td><div>                              76 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Roscommon </td>       <td><div>266 </div></td>       <td><div>                            338 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Sligo </td>       <td><div>611 </div></td>       <td><div>                            611 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>South Dublin </td>       <td><div>1,438 </div></td>       <td><div>                        1,832 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Tipperary </td>       <td><div>714 </div></td>       <td><div>                          275 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Waterford City &amp;amp; County </td>       <td><div>40 </div></td>       <td><div>                              80 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Westmeath  </td>       <td><div>241 </div></td>       <td><div>                            235 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wexford </td>       <td><div>15 </div></td>       <td><div>                            213 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wicklow </td>       <td><div>522 </div></td>       <td><div>                            411 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>TOTALS </td>       <td><div>20,240 </div></td>       <td><div>                      23,440 </div></td>    </tr> </table> </p><p><font color="#001A26">My Department plays no operational role in the inspection of private rental accommodation under these regulations.

Where it has been recommended in a professional report that a specialist placement is in the interests of a student, this may be provided through a special class in a mainstream school or through a special school. There is no planned provision for admittance to these classes without a corresponding professional report. </p>  <p>  Specific educational supports being made available is a matter for each individual school. Parents are advised to speak with the Principal of the school in relation to what supports will be available for each student. Parents may also contact their local SENO who will be available to offer further advice and assistance specific to needs of each student, contact details are available on www.ncse.ie.   </p>  <p>  Schools may apply to the NCSE for additionality where they can demonstrate that the current allocation does not meet additional care needs within the mainstream or other special classes in the school. Applications for additionality arising from significant new or emerging additional care needs, which cannot be catered within existing allocations, will continue to be dealt with by way of an exceptional review process, the details of which can be found on the NCSE website: ncse.ie/application-for-sna-exceptional-review.</p>  <p>  The NCSE is actively planning for an increasing demand for special classes on a national basis. As the school population increases over the coming years, so too will demand for special classes. The NCSE is working with the Department of Education to provide sufficient appropriate accommodation for these special classes.</p>  <p>  My Department is committed, in conjunction with the NCSE, to continue to work with parents, schools, patrons and all stakeholders to ensure that there are sufficient appropriate places for students with additional needs and to support all students to achieve their potential.</p>  <p>  I want to reassure you also that my Department will continue to support the NCSE and schools through the provision of the necessary funding and capital investment to ensure all children are successful in accessing an education.</p></reply>

Where necessary, schools may also purchase new or additional equipment or software for students from normal school resources or funds.</p>  <p>  Last April, my Department announced the Digital Strategy for Schools to 2027 with &euro;200 million associated grant funding committed for all recognised primary and post-primary schools. The first tranche of &euro;50 million funding has already been provided to schools through the ICT Grant. Decisions regarding the use and deployment of digital technology in schools is a matter for the Board of Management of each school, as schools are best placed to determine the most appropriate solution to adopt in terms of supporting the learning needs of their students based on school's own context and circumstances, and in accordance with their Digital Learning Plan. The grant funding allocation issues directly to schools and can be used to provide devices for use by students and teachers, for learning platforms, software and overall digital technology infrastructure development in the school.</p>  <p>  Where children with more complex disabilities require essential specialist equipment to access the school curriculum, which they do not already have, or which cannot be provided for them through the schools existing provisions, schools may make an application for such equipment to the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) under the terms of this scheme.</p>  <p>  The NCSE through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) is responsible for processing applications from schools for special educational needs supports. SENOs also make recommendations to my Department where assistive technology/specialised equipment is required. The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in making recommendations for support.</p>  <p>  Schools make applications directly to the SENO, providing details of the student&rsquo;s special educational needs or disability, including details of the approach taken by the school in making relevant interventions.</p>  <p>  In order to qualify for equipment under the Assistive Technology Scheme, a student must have been diagnosed with a physical or communicative disability and must also have a recommendation in a professional assessment that the equipment is essential in order to allow the student to access the curriculum.</p>  <p>  SENOs will review the application, and professional reports provided in support of same, in order to establish whether the criteria of the scheme have been met. They will then make a recommendation to my Department as to whether or not assistive technology is required; and based on this recommendation, my Department will decide on the level of grant, if any, to be provided.</p>  <p>  The type of equipment provided under the Assistive Technology Scheme is varied, and includes audiological supports for students with hearing impairment, braille equipment for children with visual impairment, and computer equipment with associated modified software for students with physical or severe communicative disabilities.</p>  <p>  Communication devices or medical or therapy related devices which are not specific educational interventions or equipment specifically required as essential for school educational access, and which have a general application outside of school, are not provided for under the Assistive Technology scheme, however. Such equipment is normally provided for children with disabilities by the Health Service Executive (HSE).</p>  <p>  I can confirm that to date no application for assistive technology has been received by my Department for the pupil named by the deputy. Officials from my Department have been in contact with the school and the SENO with the view to progression the application.</p></reply>

It also includes funding for the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) for an additional 54 psychologists to provide services to special schools and special classes. </p><p>In 2022, funding for an additional 980 teachers and 1,165 special needs assistants was provided. For 2023, the number of teaching and SNA posts in our schools will increase with an additional 686 teachers and a further 1,194 special needs assistants in our schools next year. </p><p>For the first time ever we will have over 19,000 teachers working in the area of special education and over 20,000 Special needs assistants. Together we have almost 40,000 qualified and committed people in our schools who are focused wholly and exclusively on supporting children with special educational needs.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide.</p><p>In 2023, there will be a significant investment in the expansion of the National Council for Special Education, with a total full-year investment of &euro;13 million, in over 160 additional staff. This investment is being undertaken so that the NSCE can respond effectively, compassionately and quickly to the increased need in our education system so that children and their families are fully supported and achieve the best possible education outcomes.</p><p>My Department and the NCSE continue to work very closely in planning for the delivery of new places required to meet forecasted demand.</p><p>I am satisfied that this approach is delivering.  We have seen 392 new special classes open, bringing the total of special classes to 2,543 opened nationwide for the 2022/23 school-year. The 392 new special classes for 2022/23 is broken down by 260 at primary level and 132 at post primary level.</p><p>For 2023, a further 370 special classes will open, taking the total number of special classes to over 2,900 in 2023.</p><p>Information on the list of schools with special classes, the types and locations of these classes is published on the NCSE website and is available at www.ncse.ie. </p><p>NCSE is continuing to engage with schools regarding the establishment of additional special classes for the next school year 2023/2024. Every support will be made available to schools to progress the opening of special classes in the shortest possible timeframe</p><p>It is of course open to any school to engage with the NCSE to establish a special class.</p><p>The NCSE has advised that an expression of interest for the establishment of 2 ASD classes has been issued in respect of the school. The NCSE requires a response from the school&rsquo;s board of management regarding these classes prior to being able to issue letters of sanction.</p><p>My Department is committed, in conjunction with the NCSE, to continue to work with parents, schools, patrons and all stakeholders to ensure that there are sufficient appropriate places for students with additional needs and to support all students to achieve their potential.</p><p>I want to reassure you also that my Department will continue to support the NCSE and schools through the provision of the necessary funding and capital investment to ensure all children are successful in accessing an education.</p></reply>

Bus &Eacute;ireann can accommodate these pupils on existing services and will be in contact with the families directly. With regard to the pupils whose applications have not yet been received, School Transport Section will liaise directly with the Realt Coordinator for the area in this regard. </p>  <p>  While every effort will be made to ensure school transport services are up and running as they are required, given the ongoing movement and arrival of families, it may in some cases take some time to arrange services for families as information becomes available for those who require school transport.</p></reply>

This scheme helps eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs and those of their dependents.   </p>  <p>  Citizens living in Carrick on Suir can meet a Community Welfare Officer (CWO) by appointment at the Social Welfare Branch Office, 55 New St, Carrick on Suir.  A CWO is available as required either on an appointment basis or if an emergency need arises Monday to Friday. </p>  <p>  The Community Welfare Service continues to provide local access to local CWOs in local areas across the country and there are no plans to change this aspect of the service.  CWOs can facilitate urgent and in-person meetings in 51 Intreo Centres, across business hours, five days per week.  In addition to meeting citizens in Intreo Centres, Branch Offices and DSP offices, CWOs can facilitate an appointment within a short time of a person requiring such a meeting, at a mutually agreed location, including at the person's home. I have not received any complaints or adverse feedback from customers regarding access to the Community Welfare Service. </p>  <p>  Any person who needs to access the Community Welfare Service can also call the recently established National CWS freephone phoneline which is available at 0818 60 70 80 to make an appointment within a short time of a person requiring such a meeting, at a mutually agreed location, including at the person's home.   More and more customers are availing of the opportunity to have their issues resolved by this method rather than by calling into an office. </p>  <p>  A modern Community Welfare Service should be easily accessible to all customers and for this reason, customers no longer have to meet in person with a CWO to make a claim. This significant change ensures enhanced access to the Community Welfare Service.  </p>  <p>  It means, for instance, that those citizens living in Carrick on Suir who require community welfare assistance no longer have to meet with a CWO if that is more convenient for them.  The application form, SWA1, is widely available.  It can be downloaded at www.gov.ie.   It is available in all Intreo Centres and Branch Offices.  It can also now be requested by emailing cwsforms@welfare.ie  or by calling 0818 60 70 80.  Customers can also request a SWA1 form by using the Request Application Form page available on www.gov.ie.  The completed application form should be returned to my Department where it will be processed promptly.  </p>  <p>  This is a new addition to the service, and it does not replace or diminish face-to-face meetings with a CWO.  Depending on the person's needs a direct home visit appointment or a call to another mutually agreed location can be arranged, including at the person&rsquo;s home and customers in Carrick on Suir can meet a CWO by appointment at the Social Welfare Branch Office in Carrick on Suir. </p>  <p>  The Community Welfare Service is ready to provide a flexible service to meet the different needs of customers, who may find themselves in a financially difficult or vulnerable situation. It is important that this service is easily accessible and responsive to customer needs. While changes to modernise and improve the service for customers are a feature of the Community Welfare Service, the delivery of a locally based CWS remains and will continue to remain a cornerstone of the service.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter.</p></reply>

It is a scheme which, by its nature, is a short-term social welfare scheme.  It has a high degree of churn with people coming onto the scheme and moving off every week, often with very short duration claims.   For example, between July and September 2022, almost 115,000 Illness Benefit claims were awarded, and of these, only 21,000 remain in payment. This indicates a churn of 82% over just a three-month period. The average duration on Illness Benefit is 6 days.</p>  <p>  In addition, many Illness Benefit payments are paid directly to the employer. Therefore, a double payment such as the cost of living support would be an employer subsidy as opposed to an additional support to the customer. This is not the intent behind the October cost of living support, nor would it be a targeted use of resources.</p>  <p>  If an individual or family are struggling with additional costs, Additional Needs Payments can provide help and support to people facing financial hardship. Under the scheme, the Department may make an Additional Needs Payment to people on a low income, whether they are working or receiving an income support, to meet essential expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income. A major national awareness campaign has promoted and raised awareness of the Additional Needs Payment.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This is an overarching term used to refer to exceptional and urgent needs payments, and certain supplements to assist with ongoing or recurring costs that cannot be met from the client&rsquo;s own resources and are deemed to be necessary. Payments are made at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme, taking into account the requirements of the legislation, and all the relevant circumstances of the case in order to ensure that the payments target those most in need of assistance. </p><p>Table 1 shows the number of Basic Supplementary Welfare Allowance claims registered, awarded and disallowed by county from January 2022 to September 2022.</p><p>Table 2 shows the number of additional needs payment claims registered, awarded and disallowed by county from January 2022 to September 2022.</p><p>These tables do not reflect claims that were withdrawn, cancelled or awaiting further information.  The claim figures represent a snapshot of claim activity and are subject to change.</p><p>Table 3 shows the number of rent supplement recipients awarded by county at end of September 2022. Statistics are not available for Rent supplement claims registered and disallowed at present.</p><p>Table 4 shows the total expenditure for Basic SWA, Rent Supplement and Additional Needs Payments to end of August 2022.  Figures for September 2022 are not yet available.A breakdown by county of this expenditure is not available.</p><p>Any person who considers they may have an entitlement to an additional needs payment is encouraged to contact their local community welfare service.  There is a National Community Welfare Contact Centre in place - 0818-607080 - which will direct callers to the appropriate office.  </p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the

This includes additional funding of &euro;121m for the National Childcare Scheme (NCS) which has been allocated to reduce average parental co-payments for early learning and childcare by 25%.</p>  <p>  From 2 January 2023, all families accessing registered early learning and childcare will receive a minimum hourly NCS subsidy of &euro;1.40.</p>  <p>  In September 2022, there were 69,485 children in receipt of a subsidy under the NCS. The Scheme calculates and awards subsidies to parents, which are paid directly to their childcare provider once correctly registered.</p>  <p>  The actual subsidy payment is based on the hours agreed between the parent and the provider, and claimed on the NCS system.  All claims are paid in arrears based on the attendance of a child. As such the child must be registered with a childcare provider and the provider must confirm that attendance.</p>  <p>  Given the substantial public monies involved and the importance of meeting the scheme's important policy goals providers must register with Tusla under section 58C of the Child Care Act 1991.</p>  <p>  There must be a Funding Agreement in force between the Minister and the childcare service provider. The agreement includes important governance items on fees, opening hours and service calendar, attendance, declarations and compliance</p>  <p>  A list of approved providers offering the National Childcare Scheme is maintained on the National Childcare Scheme website (www.ncs.gov.ie)</p>  <p>  As per the 2022 Programme Call, the number of early learning and childcare providers that are currently contracted and available to offer the NCS is 3,279. It must be noted that early learning and childcare providers are private businesses. As such, it is a matter for each provider to decide whether they enter into any contractual arrangement with the Department - including for the NCS. It is, however, open to all registered early learning and childcare providers to opt in to contract on an annual basis to participate in this Scheme. </p>  <p>  I appreciate the difficulties caused when a parent&rsquo;s preferred early learning and childcare provider does not engage with the NCS.

The model achieves this by providing universal supports to pre-school settings, and targeted supports, which focus on the needs of the individual child, without requiring a diagnosis of disability.</p>  <p>  As such, AIM operates in tandem with the ECCE programme and provision of AIM supports are directly linked with ECCE participation / hours of operation. The minimum eligibility age of 2 years and 8 months for the ECCE programme was chosen based on national experience and a review of international practice. It also had regard to the regulatory environment for early years&rsquo; education and care in this country and issues such as child development readiness and adult-child ratios.</p>  <p>  The ECCE programme is available to all children for 2 years although the age at which individual children start ECCE will vary depending on the date of birth of each child.</p>  <p>  First 5, A Government Strategy for Babies and Children, committed to undertake an end-of-year-three evaluation of AIM which is due to be published soon.

Every year, more than 100,000 children participate in the universal pre-school programme (ECCE) and the National Childcare Scheme (NCS) subsidises more than 80,000 children.</p>  <p>  Before the onset of Covid-19, national data indicated that, on the whole, supply of early learning and childcare places was meeting demand, with evidence of undersupply for certain age groups and in certain areas.</p>  <p>  Data gathered throughout the Covid-19 pandemic revealed lower demand for early learning and childcare, and reduced occupancy among early learning and childcare services.</p>  <p>  My Department has continued to monitor early learning and childcare capacity, with a particular focus on monitoring Covid-19 impacts as public health restrictions have been lifted and on responding to the unmet early learning and childcare needs of families. Data captured earlier this year parallels the pre-Covid-19 context, whereby the supply of early learning and childcare places is meeting demand though there is evidence of undersupply for certain age groups including children under 3, and in certain areas.</p>  <p>  In April of this year, City/County Childcare Committees (CCC) undertook a nationwide survey of capacity in early learning and childcare services. This survey was followed in May by the Annual Early Years Sector Profile Survey that is undertaken by Pobal.</p>  <p>  Preliminary analysis of the latest data captured by CCC and Pobal reveal a drop in vacancy rates across the country &ndash; with the national vacancy rate now averaging at 13.3%. The overall vacancy rate in Dublin was 12.4% - though the vacancy rate for ECCE children in Dublin was slightly higher at 13.3% </p>  <p>  The network of 30 CCC across the country, including Dublin City CCC are in a position to match children and families to services operating with vacant places. In addition, the CCC has been mobilised to engage proactively with services to identify vacant places and to explore possibilities for expansion among services, particularly where there is unmet need. Parents experiencing difficulty in relation to their early learning and childcare needs should contact Dublin CCC for assistance. Contact details for CCCs may be found on www.myccc.ie.</p>  <p>  In addition to this, a range of other steps are being taken by my Department to address issues of under supply.</p>  <p>  Some &euro;70m has been allocated to my Department through the revised National Development Plan (NDP) &ndash; with the majority of this funding earmarked for new places.</p>  <p>  Under the National Action Plan for Childminding, my Department has committed to opening up access to the NCS to parents who use childminders following the extension of regulation to childminders, which is expected to happen within the first 2-3 years of the Plan.</p>  <p>  My Department, in partnership with the Department of Housing Planning and Local Government, is in the process of updating the 2001 Planning Guidelines for Local Authorities on Early Learning and Childcare Settings.</p>  <p>  In addition, the new Core Funding scheme, introduced on 15 September, has given rise to a significant growth in capacity - with initial analysis showing a significant capacity growth for certain cohorts (such as babies and toddlers) and in areas where there has been significant pressure on places, including Dublin.</p>  <p>  To meet the cost of this capacity growth, I recently announced that the original allocation for Core Funding will be increased to &euro;259 million for Year 1 of the Scheme. In addition, the full year value of Core Funding will increase by &euro;28 million to &euro;287 million in Year 2 of the Scheme.</p>  <p>  Funding earmarked for the Scheme in Year 2 will be informed by the emerging data from Year 1 and may focus on promoting further capacity expansion.</p></reply>

The strategy will focus on specific areas that may not be addressed by other national strategies, such as, the National Disability Inclusion Strategy or the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities.</p>  <p>  A number of steps have been taken to progress development of the strategy to date. As the first step in the development process, a public consultation was launched on 29 April this year to gather feedback, opinions and insights into the current supports and services provided and to identify specific issues to be addressed by the strategy. The consultation process ran until the end of May 2022. A report analysing the submissions from the public consultation is currently being finalised. The feedback received from this consultation will feed directly into a first draft of the Autism Innovation Strategy.</p>  <p>  The second phase of the development of the strategy, comprising of an expression of interest process for membership of the Autism Innovation Strategy Oversight and Advisory Group, was launched in June 2022. This group will play a key role in overseeing implementation of the strategy and it is intended that the group will represent lived experience as much as possible. Applications for membership of the group are currently being assessed and it is anticipated that the group will be appointed in the coming weeks. </p>  <p>  The advisory group will provide oversight and critical, constructive analysis that will help the Autism Innovation Strategy to achieve its aims. </p>  <p>  Once the results from the public consultation have been analysed and the advisory group has been appointed, my Department will coordinate efforts across Government to develop a draft strategy text.       </p>  <p>  A further public consultation process will take place to give anyone interested the opportunity to provide further feedback on the strategy before it is finalised and adopted, which is expected to take place in 2023. </p></reply>

This research, which is being conducted under the aegis of the Department&rsquo;s partnership with the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI), will use data gathered through the Growing up in Ireland (GUI) study to explore how different types of accommodation tenure affect outcomes for children. Drawing on data from the &lsquo;08 Cohort of the GUI study (these children were recruited into the study at 9 months and are now aged about 14), the study will explore the housing conditions faced by children in early and middle childhood, and the implications of these housing experiences for their cognitive, socio-emotional and health outcomes.  </p>  <p>  I expect this paper to also explore measures of housing quality and the effects of moving accommodation for children, and to pay particular attention to how tenure type and housing quality affect children from different socio-economic groups, ethnic backgrounds and family types. Because of the longitudinal nature of the GUI data, the paper will be able to track how housing situations of children change over time and the ways in which these changes interact with the child development. It is because of our commitment to children&rsquo;s research and the state&rsquo;s long-standing investment in GUI that this unique project is possible.</p>  <p>  The paper is due at the end of November and I am very much looking forward to receiving it and interrogating its findings.

This investment is the first significant step in addressing core underfunding of the higher education system in a strategic and reformative way.

However, all capital projects advanced by publicly funded Higher Education Institutions must comply with the provisions of the Public Spending Code. I understand following detailed consideration on a number of matters, including the risk associated with continuing with a project that would breach the Public Spending Code, the Governing Authority decided to terminate the contract.</p>  <p>  Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) are governed by the Universities Act 1997, the Institutes of Technologies Acts 1992 to 2006 and the Technological Universities Act 2018. Within the meaning of these Acts, HEIs are autonomous bodies and are responsible for their own day-to-day management and operational affairs including dealing with policy and procedure in relation to any levy payable by students for services or campus facilitates.</p>  <p>  The expenditure that has been incurred to date on the project will be met by the University from financial reserves. No financial contribution is being sought from the Exchequer and there will be no impact on the student levy collected from the MU student body. Maynooth University are considering the most appropriate means of meeting the need for additional student spaces on campus, in the short and long term, in the overall context of achieving value for money in any future investment.</p>  <p>I met with Student representatives on a range of issues on Thursday last the 6th   of October.  The Student&rsquo;s Union from Maynooth University were represented at this meeting and I listened to their concerns about the Student Centre and the Student Levy. I would strongly encourage the University to continue engagement with the student representative body, on the next steps for this project and I understand a further meeting is scheduled this week.</p></reply>

The vast majority of those arriving to date are women and children. </p>  <p>  There is a coordinated whole-of-Government response to support people arriving in Ireland who have fled the violence in Ukraine. Government Departments and services are working together to implement Ireland's commitments under the EU Temporary Protection Directive (2001/55/EC), which has been activated for the first time to grant temporary protection to displaced persons from Ukraine.</p>  <p>  My Department is primarily responsible for issuing temporary protection documents to those who are eligible. Those granted Temporary Protection have immediate access to the labour market, social welfare, accommodation and other State supports as needed. </p>  <p>  The Department of Justice does not have staff assigned to Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth (DCEDIY) on a full time basis. The support which is provided to DCEDIY is in the form of shared access to the airline alerts inbox which contains numbers of Ukraine nationals on an agreed number of flights. Staff from the Border Management Unit of my Department staff also continue to welcome and process new arrivals at Dublin Airport as part of their usual immigration duties. Other staff from my Department are onsite in Citywest to ensure that people receive their temporary protection permissions as quickly as possible. </p>  <p>  This is in addition to staff operating from Rosslare Europort on sailing days and at the Ukraine Support Centres in Cork Street in Dublin and in Limerick City.  Other Department of Justice staff are also involved in a range of associated legislative, policy and communications matters. </p>  <p>  Responsibility for the coordination of the work of volunteers and the community response to the Ukraine crisis primarily falls under the remit of the Department of Rural and Community Development. </p>  <p>  As the situation in Ukraine continues to evolve, it is difficult to predict with any degree of certainty the number of people that may arrive over the coming weeks. However, the immediate and overriding priority is to assist those who have arrived and continue to arrive in Ireland to find safety with access to state supports as needed, as part of a whole of Government response. </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that my Government colleagues and I will continue to work with our EU counterparts on any further EU-wide measures that might be needed to assist those fleeing Ukraine.</p></reply>

This is the mechanism established by the Oireachtas to provide for the processes relating to funding under the NHSS and the negotiation of prices for services for private and voluntary providers with the designated State agency, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF). Maximum prices for individual nursing homes are agreed with the NTPF following negotiations and based on the NTPF&rsquo;s cost criteria. These criteria include:</p><p>- Costs reasonably incurred by the nursing home</p><p>- Local market prices</p><p>- Historic prices- Overall budgetary capacity</p><p>  The NTPF carry out this role independently under the NHSS Act 2009 and there is no role for Ministers or the Department in these negotiations. It should also be noted that the Department continues to work with the NTPF to take forward the recommended actions that emerged from the review of the NTPF pricing system published in June 2021.</p><p>  I am aware that a number of nursing homes have closed this year, with several new closures notified in recent weeks. The closure of any nursing homes reduces bed capacity and puts pressure on other local health and social care facilities, including acute hospitals. Ensuring the welfare and safety of residents is secured when nursing homes close is the most important thing and work to alleviate the concerns of nursing home residents must continue.</p><p>  All nursing homes, as registered providers with HIQA, have well-established obligations under the legal framework in terms of the delivery of safe care to residents.  As per regulations, HIQA must also be notified of any closure with 6 months&rsquo; notice. It is essential that when nursing homes are intending to close, residents and their families are consulted with and given appropriate notice so that new homes can be found and they can be moved in a safe, planned way. The continued wellbeing of nursing home residents and their families remains my continued focus.</p><p>  The Government has provided substantial supports to the nursing home sector over the course of the pandemic. Over &euro;144 million has been claimed by nursing homes under the Temporary Assistance Payment Scheme (TAPS) since its introduction in 2020. The Government has now agreed to extend TAPS to the end of the year by maintaining the availability of Outbreak Assistance support. The scheme will also be refocused on addressing this year's inflationary pressures related to energy and heating, whilst continuing to support nursing homes with the cost of managing COVID-19 outbreaks. Details are being finalised and these will be communicated in the coming days. </p><p>  Substantial additional supports have also been provided by the HSE in terms of serial testing, PPE, the deployment of specialist teams and other services. Many of these supports continue. Finally, in response to the strategic workforce challenges in the nursing home and home care sector, a Cross-Departmental Strategic Workforce Advisory Group was established earlier this year. The Group has been working to a tight timeline and is currently finalising a report which will outline a set of recommendations for my consideration.</p><p>  Respite care may be based in the community within the persons own home or in residential care settings through HSE managed facilities, by agreement with local/ national voluntary organisations or by contracted private facilities. As of 31 August 2022, the HSE Bed Public Register for Older Persons reports that there are 1,466 short stay beds available across our public residential units. 225 of these beds are identified as general respite and a further 24 beds defined as dementia specific. There are also a further 189 beds categorised for convalescent care, which may also be used for respite purposes. In CHO 4 the register reports that there are 142 short stay beds, of which 42 are identified as respite with a further 50 identified as for convalescent care. It is important to note that these figures relate to publicly managed residential units and do not take into account respite beds sourced though contractual arrangement with voluntary or private agencies. In addition, Transitional Care funding continues to support discharging patients who have completed their acute care and who required long stay residential care under the Nursing Home Support Scheme or who required convalescence up to 4 weeks prior to returning home.</p></reply>

Following that meeting, the designated senior manager in the Health Service Executive who liaises with Irish thalidomide survivors and assists them to access supports towards their ongoing health and personal social service needs, commenced a process to develop recommendations for future planning and pathways of care for survivor&rsquo;s health care needs now and into the future. The recommendations will also inform the work already underway in the Department to provide these health and personal social supports on a statutory footing as committed to by the Government. It is not possible at this stage to say when the Bill will be published. </p>  <p>  Following a Government decision in 1975, Irish survivors of thalidomide have been in receipt of monthly payments for life from the Irish State.  The range of supports provided by the Irish State to each Irish survivor also include a medical card on an administrative basis regardless of means, which includes access to a full range of primary care, hospital and personal social services, provision of appliances, artificial limbs, equipment and housing adaptations.</p>  <p>  The German Contergan Foundation has confirmed that since 2013 it is accepting applications from individuals for compensation for thalidomide related injury.  It is open to any Irish person to apply to the Foundation for assessment of their disability as being attributable to thalidomide.  Any Irish person who establishes that their injury is attributable to thalidomide will be offered appropriate supports by the Irish Government, commensurate with those currently provided to Irish thalidomide survivors.</p></reply>

Regulations were made in 1971, 1973 and 1975, prescribing 16 illnesses covered by the scheme. These are: acute leukaemia; mental handicap; cerebral palsy; mental illness (in a person under 16); cystic fibrosis; multiple sclerosis; diabetes insipidus; muscular dystrophies; diabetes mellitus; parkinsonism; epilepsy; phenylketonuria; haemophilia; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide.</p>  <p>  Under the LTI scheme, patients receive drugs, medicines, and medical and surgical appliances directly related to the treatment of their illness, free of charge. Children under 16 years of age with a diagnosis of ADHD come within the &lsquo;mental illness&rsquo; category of the LTI scheme.</p>  <p>  Statutory Instrument No. 277 of 1971 sets out the following limitation on Section 59(3) of the Health Act 1970: "Arrangements for the supply of drugs and medicines to persons suffering from mental illness in pursuance of section 59 (3) of the Act shall be made only in respect of persons under the age of 16 years." Therefore, the HSE must regard 16 years of age as the upper age limit in terms of eligibility under the LTI scheme for those with a diagnosis of mental illness.</p>  <p>  The LTI scheme will be included as part of a review of the current eligibility framework, including the basis for existing hospital and medication charges, to be carried out under commitments given in the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy. However, it is not possible at this juncture to say what the outcome of this review will be.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, there are other arrangements which protect people from excessive medical costs. Under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;80 a month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals with ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p>  <p>  People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be eligible for a medical card. In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE. Medical card eligibility is primarily based on an assessment of means and is not granted on the basis of any particular condition.</p>  <p>  In certain circumstances the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income guidelines, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from illness. The HSE afford applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting documentation to determine whether undue hardship exists and to fully take account of all relevant circumstances that may benefit them in assessment, including medical evidence of costs and certain expenses.</p>  <p>  In circumstances where an applicant is still over the income limit for a medical card, they are then assessed for a GP visit card, which entitles the applicant to GP visits without charge.</p>  <p>  Individuals may also be entitled to claim tax relief on the cost of their medical expenses, including medicines prescribed by a doctor, dentist, or consultant. Relief is at the standard tax rate of 20%.</p></reply>

Over &euro;144 million has been claimed by nursing homes under the Temporary Assistance Payment Scheme (TAPS) since its introduction in 2020. The Government has now agreed to extend TAPS to the end of the year by maintaining the availability of Outbreak Assistance support. The scheme will also be refocused on addressing this year's inflationary pressures related to energy and heating, whilst continuing to support nursing homes with the cost of managing COVID-19 outbreaks. Details are being finalised and these will be communicated in the coming days.</p><p>Substantial additional supports have also been provided by the HSE in terms of serial testing, PPE, the deployment of specialist teams and other services. Many of these supports continue.</p><p>Funding to support people to access services in the sector continues to be provided in line with the long-established statutory mechanisms under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009. This is the mechanism established by the Oireachtas to provide for the processes relating to funding under the NHSS and the negotiation of prices for services for private and voluntary providers with the designated State agency, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF). Maximum prices for individual nursing homes are agreed with the NTPF following negotiations and based on the NTPF&rsquo;s cost criteria. These criteria include:</p><p>- Costs reasonably incurred by the nursing home- Local market prices- Historic prices- Overall budgetary capacity</p><p>The NTPF carry out this role independently under the NHSS Act 2009 and there is no role for Ministers or the Department in these negotiations.  It should also be noted that the Department continues to work with the NTPF to take forward the recommended actions that emerged from the review of the NTPF pricing system published in June 2021.</p><p>As I announced prior to Budget Day, my priority over the past weeks has been to secure additional funding for Budget 2023 to ensure the continuation of all services to a high standard.  Long-term residential care will be supported through &euro;47 million of additional funding for the Nursing Home Support Scheme to maintain services and manage inflationary increases.</p><p>In addition, the Department is also taking forward the nine recommendations of the Value for Money Review on Nursing Home costs published last December.</p></reply>

Under this measure, they are considered ordinarily resident in Ireland for a limited time period and are entitled to access health care services, in line with other refugee groups and Irish citizens.</p>  <p>  It is a priority for my Department and the HSE to ensure that Ukrainian refugees are provided with appropriate health and social care services. Ukrainian refugees are entitled to apply for a medical card to access primary care services for each adult and child dependent as well as ongoing care of priority medical conditions such as cancer, diabetes, heart disease and other chronic illness. Over 40,000 medical cards have been granted to Ukrainian refugees to date. Ukrainian Refugees can also seek medical care while awaiting a medical card.</p>  <p>  For those with urgent medical needs, healthcare services are provided through the public hospital system. Ukrainian refugees can also receive health care services including access to Covid-19 vaccinations, GPs, community care and hospital or emergency care, as well as access to services for children&rsquo;s health, mental health, disabilities, maternity care, older people and many more.</p>  <p>  The HSE has arranged a range of bespoke GP services for those accommodated in hotels and other settings. The exact model for each site varies, however all have access to GP Out-of-Hours services, while those staying in private accommodation can register with local GPs.</p>  <p>  In addition, Ireland has organised 27 medical evacuations of Ukrainians in need of emergency care and provided &euro;4.3 million in medical humanitarian donations for the Ukraine health system as part of the EU health response.</p>  <p>  A HSE digital health questionnaire is now live for Ukrainian refugees to register. Medical cards are now linked with an Individual Health Identifier (IHI), through the PPS number assigned to the individual , which in turn will be linked in with the HSE digital health questionnaire. This will enable GPs to access information regarding their own individual patients.</p>  <p>  Department of Health and the HSE officials maintain regular contact with counterparts in other Departments and agencies on an ongoing basis on a wide range of issues concerning the provision of services to Ukrainian refugees.</p>  <p>  They meet representatives from the local authorities on a regular basis to discuss issues in relation to accommodation and services in the area, to support Ukrainian refugees, i.e. availability of Housing, GP services etc. The HSE is also represented on the Ukrainian community forums convened by local authorities.</p>  <p>  The HSE assists Irish NGOs in the planning to bring humanitarian aid to Ukraine, and in the movement of people with disabilities from Ukrainian conflict zones. It meets with Disability Workstream (Umbrella Bodies, Red Cross, TUSLA, Heads of Disability HSE etc.) on a bi-weekly basis.</p>  <p>  It is vital that we continue to stand in solidarity with the people of Ukraine. My Department and the HSE will continue to work with colleagues across Government to ensure every health support we can provide is made available.</p></reply>

In accordance with the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE. The HSE assesses each application on a qualifying financial threshold. This is the amount of money that an individual can earn a week and still qualify for a card and is specific to the individual&rsquo;s own financial circumstances.</p>  <p>  Regarding persons aged 70 or older, the medical card assessment is based on gross income. The weekly gross income thresholds for eligibility to a medical card for those aged 70 and over were increased in November 2020 and are currently &euro;550 per week for a single person and &euro;1,050 for a couple. However, It should be noted that those aged over 70 can also be assessed under the general means tested scheme where there are particularly high costs, e.g., medication, nursing home fees. Furthermore, the Deputy may be aware that, since 2015, every individual aged 70 and over has automatic eligibility for a GP visit card.</p>  <p>  Persons aged 69 and under are assessed under the general means tested medical card thresholds which are based on an applicant&rsquo;s household income after tax and the deduction of PRSI and the Universal Social Charge. The means assessment determines an applicant&rsquo;s eligibility allowing for taking account of one&rsquo;s eligible expenses from their income. Given that this is a net assessment, it means that where one&rsquo;s income or allowable expenses change there will be an impact on the decision about one&rsquo;s eligibility. Examples of allowable expenses include rent, mortgage, insurance, childcare, maintenance, nursing home costs, (detailed guidelines are available at: www2.hse.ie/file-library/medical-cards/medical-cards-national-assessment-guidelines.pdf).</p>  <p>  It is important to note that certain social welfare payments are not included in the means assessment for a medical card.  Changes to the rates in Budget 2023 include changes to these non-assessed payments and, therefore, changes will not have any bearing on the outcome of a medical card assessment. For other social welfare payments that are assessed as income for a medical card, it is noted that the increase in the rates in Budget 2023 would not be expected to make a substantial difference to the outcome of the assessment process.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputies that, to ensure the medical card system is responsive and sensitive to people's needs, my Department keeps medical card issues, including the current medical card income thresholds under review and any changes are considered in the context of Government policy and other issues which may be relevant.</p></reply>

This independent expert group considers and assesses evidence in a robust and transparent manner, and against internationally accepted criteria. It is important we have rigorous processes in place to ensure our screening programmes are effective, quality assured and operating to safe standards, and that the benefits of screening outweigh the harms.</p>  <p>  The Committee's first Annual Call in 2021 for proposals for new screening programmes or changes to our existing programmes, received a significant response with a total of 53 submissions received. Submissions were received from various sources, including members of the public and patient advocates, and have been undergoing consideration by the committee at its scheduled meetings during 2022. The NSAC intends to publish its full work programme in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to note, however, that the Committee has already made some decisions, including in relation to the existing national cancer screening programmes. Following submissions from several sources, including from BreastCheck, the Committee has asked HIQA to begin looking at the evidence for extending the age range for breast screening. It has also asked HIQA to look at the age range for bowel screening.</p>  <p>  Additionally, the Committee made a recommendation to me for the adoption of a clinical guideline in the BowelScreen programme, that was submitted by BowelScreen via the Annual Call, which I approved in March 2022.</p>  <p>  Progress has also been achieved in the expansion of the National Newborn Bloodspot Screening (NBS) programme. A ninth condition (ADA-SCID) was added to the NBS programme in May 2022, following a recommendation from the National Screening Advisory Committee which I approved in 2020.</p>  <p>  A Health Technology Assessment (HTA) to look at the evidence for the addition of a tenth condition (called SCID) is currently underway, and I am looking forward to receiving a recommendation from the Committee before the end of 2022.</p>  <p>  The second NSAC Annual Call is expected to open in November 2022 and will welcome proposals from the public and healthcare professionals. Further details will be published on the NSAC website shortly.</p></reply>

I wish to progress this much-needed and long-awaited piece of historic legislation as quickly as possible to ensure that a robust regulatory framework for AHR is in place.</p>  <p>It is not within the scope of the AHR legislation to include provisions in respect of statutory leave. Responsibility for various forms of family-related leave comes under the remit of the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration &amp;amp; Youth and that Department has informed my officials that legislative changes in respect of all forms of family leave must be developed in the context of the broader legal situation concerning parentage or pertaining to any other relevant issue. </p>  <p>As Minister for Health, I have no role in the matter of the level of legal costs which may be incurred in relation to the undertaking of an individual surrogacy agreement or any court applications arising from such an arrangement. I am of the view that matters of such importance as the determination of the parentage of a child born through surrogacy should be decided by an appropriate court.</p>  <p>The published Bill does not contain provisions to regulate surrogacy arrangements undertaken in other jurisdictions. International surrogacy raises complex ethical questions concerning areas of law that intersect across the remits of several Government Departments and require detailed examination. The issues which arise from Irish people engaging in cross-border surrogacy primarily relate to parentage, guardianship, citizenship and, potentially, adoption.</p>  <p>Following the publication of the Special Oireachtas Joint Committee on International Surrogacy&rsquo;s Final Report, a working Inter-Departmental Group was established to review the Report&rsquo;s recommendations, along with other relevant matters, with the aim of determining an agreed policy position and suitable next steps, in the form of a unified Policy Paper and, as appropriate, legislative proposals.</p>  <p>Any policy and legislative proposals that may arise following the completion of the Departments&rsquo; examination of the Committee&rsquo;s recommendations will require consideration and approval by Government. However, the clear intention of the Group, and Minister McEntee, Minister O&rsquo;Gorman and myself, is that the appropriate vehicle for accommodating legislative proposals in respect of international surrogacy will be through the insertion of relevant provisions into the Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Bill 2022 at Committee Stage.</p></reply>

This report set out the capacity requirements for health-funded disability services for the period up to 2032. In order to drive the process of implementing the recommendations of the Capacity Review, a Working Group was set up to develop an Action Plan for Disability Services for the period 2022-2025. This Group has now completed its work and the draft Action Plan is currently being finalised for approval. </p><p>In recent years, significant resources have been invested by the health sector in disability services. This year, the overall Budget for disability services in 2023 will be &euro;2.4 billion, including a significant level of funding for specialist disability services. Building on the previous year, this is an unprecedented level of funding for Disability services. It follows substantial increases in the budget in 2021 and 2022; and reflects this Government&rsquo;s commitment to strengthening the funding provided for the disability sector and working to act to address the shortfalls identified in the Disability Capacity Review.  </p><p>The following increased funding has been provided for 2023: <table>    <tr>       <th>Funding </th>       <th>Measure </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&euro;109m </td>       <td>To support existing levels of service </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&euro;4.3m </td>       <td>Digital Initiatives/Disability Awareness and Participation Fund </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&euro;25m </td>       <td>Building Capacity (Core Services) </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&euro;39m </td>       <td>One off Costs associated with activity during Covid-19 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>A significant fund of up to &euro;100m has been allocated this year to support community based voluntary organisations who are such an essential pillar in the provision of Health services across country.  This fund is being made available in recognition of the challenges being faced by the sector in delivering and maintaining key health and social care services against a backdrop of increased inflationary pressures affecting energy, heating and related costs.  These organisations are funded through the HSE to deliver a range of health and social care services on behalf of the HSE to communities around Ireland. This includes residential, day and ancillary services for people with a disability, older people, mental health services, palliative care services, addiction services and other health and social care services provided in the community. Details of the fund including its administration are being finalised.</p><p>The HSE, in preparing its National Service Plan, will examine how services, including relevant KPIs, can be progressed in 2023 within the overall increased envelope of funding for disability services.</p></reply>

Under the Mental Health Act 2001, the Mental Health Commission is required to inspect and regulate all approved centres across the country at least once a year. </p>  <p>  The Mental Health Commission in its recent inspection reports identified numerous risks associated with this centre. </p>  <p>  The decision not to proceed with refurbishment of Owenacurra was made by HSE CHO 4, in consultation with HSE Estates. The Deputy will appreciate that as the HSE has statutory responsibility for the planning and delivery of health services, it would be inappropriate for me, as Minister, to become directly involved in this operational matter. However, since I was informed of the HSE decision to close Owenacurra, I have been liaising with them as appropriate to ensure all decisions and actions taken are made with the best interests of the residents in mind, both from a health and safety viewpoint and from the provision of appropriate treatments and supports.</p>  <p>  On the broader front, Department of Health officials have regular Governance meetings with the Mental Health Commission to review relevant issues at a high level, including monitoring the issue raised in this instance. </p>  <p>  I acknowledge that mental health services must evolve to ensure they are in line with international best practice and regulatory requirements. It is positive to note that there has been an overall improvement in Mental Health Commission compliance among approved mental health centres in recent years. However, I and the HSE recognise that further improvements are required generally in our approved centres to meet appropriate regulatory requirements. This objective is in line with the objectives of Sharing the Vision and the significant funding given to Mental Health over recent years, including under Budget 2023.</p>  <p>  The Government and I value the role of the Mental Health Commission as an independent regulator and their commitment to promoting high standards and good practice in mental health services. We remain, in conjunction with the HSE, fully committed to the delivery of high-quality, person-centred,  and recovery oriented mental health care. This needs to take account, as appropriate, of many factors including a balance between promoting high standards, operational requirements and identified service needs.</p>  <p>  The Deputy can rest assured that I will continue to closely monitor, as appropriate, this issue.</p></reply>

Prices for oil, gas, including wood pellets and firewood has seen increases, resulting from increased demand and restricted supply.  </p>  <p>  Using wood for energy and wood pellets to heat homes is an excellent alternative to using fossil fuels. On the Island of Ireland, we have a number of suppliers manufacturing wood pellets and material is available in a number of outlets. I would also point out that Irelands forests are currently producing over 4 million cubic metres of roundwood each year and this supply will increase to over 6 million cubic metres by 2030. An increasing supply of biomass provides the raw material for the production of pellets and biomass for energy.  </p></reply>

While my Department is responsible for the protection of the health of Irish poultry, wildlife comes under the remit of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS).</p>  <p>  The Department works very closely with NPWS to ensure effective implementation of the AI surveillance programme, including the submission of dead wild birds for sampling and testing in our laboratory service. The goal of this testing is to confirm or negate the presence of Highly Pathogenic AI (HPAI). HPAI positive results in wild birds that are sampled following notification from NPWS are communicated between the two departments at a local level and the HPSC/HSE follow up as necessary in relation to any human contacts. Although the strain of avian influenza currently in circulation in wild birds in Ireland (HPAI H5N1) is considered by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC)/HSE to be of low risk to humans, current advice from the HPSC/HSE and DAFM to the public is from a general health perspective is not to approach or handle sick or dead wild birds at this time. Dogs should be kept on a lead and not allowed to approach sick, injured or dead birds.</p>  <p>  In locations where HPAI has been confirmed further sampling may not be required from that location. For example, a large number of dead wild birds from coastal areas have been confirmed HPAI positive recently by my Department. As such further sampling from coastal areas is not required at this time. However, wild bird sampling continues in inland counties, including Co. Cavan. </p>  <p>  It is not within my Department&rsquo;s scope nor available resources to conduct full post-mortem examinations to investigate the ultimate cause of death of all dead wild birds submitted through the AI Surveillance Programme. </p></reply>

The budget includes EU funding of &euro;5.97bn for Pillar I and &euro;1.56bn for Pillar 2 with indicative national funding of &euro;2.3bn including projected carbon receipts.  This significant increase in national co-financing for Pillar II.  </p>  <p>  It brings the national co-financing rate to 60%, which is a significant increase on the previous co-financing rate of 47% for the Rural Development Programme for the period 2014-2020.  Even when the carbon tax funding is excluded, the national co-financing rate remains higher than that in the previous Programme, at just above 50%.  </p>  <p>  The carbon tax funding will be used primarily to support the Agri-Climate Rural Environment Scheme (ACRES), which is included in Ireland's CAP Strategic Plan for the period 2023-2027.

It is also a core principle of the European Union and the new CAP Regulations place particular focus on promoting the participation of women in the socio-economic development of rural areas, with special attention to farming. Improving gender balance, gender equality and increasing the participation of women in farming are, for the first time, part of the objectives for CAP Strategic Plans (CSP). Ireland&rsquo;s CSP includes innovative proposals to promote gender equality:</p>  <p>  -  An increased rate of grant aid of 60% for women farmers aged 40-66 years under the Capital Investment Scheme;</p>  <p>  -  Women-only Knowledge Transfer (KT) Groups; and,</p>  <p>  -  A call under the European Innovation Partnerships (EIP) initiative for proposals to examine women&rsquo;s participation in agriculture.</p>  <p>  In addition, Food Vision 2030, the stakeholder-led strategy for the Irish agri-food sector, includes a number of actions to promote and improve gender balance at all levels. It also recommends the establishment of female farmers&rsquo; networks and other supports to better understand and meet the needs of Irish women farmers, fishers and rural female entrepreneurs. It also proposed holding a national event on women in agriculture and I recently announced that former T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Agriculture, Mary Coughlan, will chair such an event next year.</p>  <p>  Also, since 2015, my Department has provided support for rural female entrepreneurs under the ACORNS programme. This initiative involves the development and implementation of a tailored programme to support early-stage female entrepreneurs living in rural Ireland. I recently launched a new call for applications and it is expected that up to 50 participants will be selected for the six-month programme that will run from October 2022 to April 2023.</p></reply>

A further &euro;5 million was allocated for the "Ireland for Ukraine Fund" which is being administered by Community Foundation Ireland. Also funding of &euro;0.5 million was announced for volunteer centres to deal with increased activity and demands on these centres and on the volunteers helping to deal with this crisis.</p>  <p>Some services that are available through SICAP to support Ukrainians include transport services; access to health care; access to school places; services to older people; Ukrainian community engagement; personal skills and wellbeing, lifelong learning and access to the labour market.  Some of these supports are delivered on a one-to-one basis and in a group setting.</p>  <p>My Department will continue to monitor the situation and keep it under review, and additional funding will be provided to SICAP in 2023 to deal specifically with new arrivals from Ukraine. </p></reply>
