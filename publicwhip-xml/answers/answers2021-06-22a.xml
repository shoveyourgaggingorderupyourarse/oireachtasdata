Applications may be made via the MEBAS application portal on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  I have also made an allocation of &euro;5 million  available to local authorities for live performances in summer 2021 to animate town centres, should public health considerations permit.  This will allow for the procurement by local authorities of performances by local performers.  This funding will be allocated shortly.</p>  <p>  &euro;5 million will also be made available for a scheme of capital supports for the commercial live entertainment sector.</p>  <p>  Up to &euro;1 million was allocated to the St Patrick's Festival 2021 for programming and it has supported over 3,500 days of employment for performers, producers, artists, technicians, creatives and support staff. With gatherings still restricted, SPF 2021 curated a rich and dynamic programme of events involving hundreds of artists, musicians, performers, creators, and community organisations which was broadcast on the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Festival TV online channel marking the national day.</p>  <p>  In addition, I have announced an additional &euro;11.5m for a new Events Sector Covid Support Scheme which I hope to launch soon.  This scheme will target SMEs in the events sector which aren&rsquo;t eligible for the CRSS and for whom MEBAS and the Small Business Assistance Scheme for COVID-19 will not make a significant contribution to fixed costs relative to the level of support that that would be available under CRSS, had such SMEs been eligible for that support.</p></reply>

It sets out that the role of F&aacute;ilte Ireland is to encourage, promote and support the development of tourist traffic within and to the State and the development and marketing of tourist facilities and services in the State.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland have played a key role in developing the tourism sector to be one of the leading indigenous sectors in the country and in the continuous growth of tourism prior to COVID-19.</p><p>Tourism was one of the most directly affected sectors in this current crisis. F&aacute;ilte Ireland provided vital assistance in sustaining tourism business during lockdown, supported enterprises during reopening and will be crucial in assisting the tourism sector survive and thrive into the future. Tourism helps sustain infrastructure and businesses that are vital to the local economy and local communities.  It is closely related to the wider hospitality sector, the bulk of which serves the non-tourist local resident market.  <b></b></p><p>My Department and F&aacute;ilte Ireland has engaged with the wider hospitality sector and Government Departments on issues of mutual concern.  The Hospitality and Tourism Forum, was established by An T&aacute;naiste, Leo Varadkar, TD, Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and I, to provide a platform for structured engagement between the Hospitality and Tourism sectors, the tourism agencies and relevant Government Departments.  </p><p>The Forum enables The T&aacute;naiste and I,  to engage with a wide spectrum of industry stakeholders in order to assess the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, to help improve understanding and responses to the crisis and to discuss ideas for recovery measures, thus assisting the Government in formulating its on-going response to the crisis. </p><p>F&aacute;ilte Ireland also currently chairs the Tourism &amp;amp; Hospitality Careers Oversight Group which is a collaborative approach by  stakeholders, including Industry Bodies, Education Providers, Government Departments and State Agencies to addressing skills shortages in the Tourism and Hospitality Sector.</p><p>Tourism has proven itself resilient before and I am confident that, with the support of Government, it will recover from this crisis and thrive again.  Accordingly, while I am always open to review and improve existing structures, I have no plans at present to realign F&aacute;ilte Ireland.</p></reply>

My Department is currently undertaking an analysis of three further plans - Oile&aacute;in &Aacute;rann, Cl&eacute;ire and Maigh Eo Thiar.  I am also informed by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta that preparation of a Language Plan for An Ghaeltacht L&aacute;ir, Co Donegal is currently underway. I am confident that language plans for each of the 26 language planning areas will be approved and indeed that their implementation will be underway before the end of 2021. </p>  <p>  To date, language plans for four Gaeltacht Service Towns have been approved under the process, namely, Letterkenny, Daingean U&iacute; Ch&uacute;is, Galway City and An Chloch&aacute;n Liath, which I recently approved. My Department is also currently evaluating the language plan for Tralee, Co Kerry.  The process of preparing language plans is underway for the following Gaeltacht Service Towns: Dungarvan, Cahirciveen and Cork City.</p>  <p>  I should also point out that language plans have been approved for the Irish Language Networks of Clondalkin, Ennis and Loughrea. </p>  <p>  19 Language Planning Officers and four Assistant Language Planning Officers have been recruited and are implementing the plans approved to date. </p>  <p>  My Department has, through successive budgets, increased the allocation available for implementation of the language planning process.  The total allocation from budget 2021 for the process amounts to &euro;5m - an increase of &euro;1.3m on the 2020 allocation.  From this allocation, I was, in recent weeks, in a position to approve funding of &euro;3.4m for &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and Foras na Gaeilge to assist them with implementation of the process during the current year.  From this allocation, my Department is also supporting the early years, family and traditional arts sectors through the provision of funding for Comhar Nao&iacute;nra&iacute; na Gaeltachta, Tuismitheoir&iacute; na Gaeltachta and Eala&iacute;n na Gaeltachta respectively with each of these sectors being an important component of the language planning process. </p>  <p>  All in all, I am satisfied that the language planning process is now gaining momentum.  At full-implementation stage, we will have a team of nearly 50 full-time language planning officers dedicated exclusively to the implementation of language plans across Gaeltacht Language Planning Areas, Gaeltacht Service Towns and Irish Language Networks.  This important work at community level will be complemented by the new initiatives provided for in the Official Languages (Amendment) Bill to be taken at D&aacute;il Report Stage shortly.  These initiatives include the objective of 20% of new recruits to the public service being competent in the Irish language by 2030 and the development of a National Plan for the Provision of Irish-Medium Public Services - the implementation of which the Government has already committed to in its Civil Service Renewal Strategy 2021-2030.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-06-22a.20.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1471" speakername="Catherine Martin" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021062200060#WRB01100"><p>The Government&rsquo;s longstanding ambition is to enable Ireland to become a global hub for the production of film, TV drama and animation. This is supported by the initiatives outlined in the Audiovisual Action Plan, launched in June 2018 under the Creative Ireland Programme.</p>  <p>  The aim is to grow the audiovisual sector in Ireland to such an extent that sufficient employment opportunities are made available to allow our cast and crew to work consistently work across different productions. In Ireland, a key attraction to foreign production companies is the calibre of our talented workforce in the audiovisual sector and the positive reputation they enjoy internationally. Looking at the recent announcement of the Irish Film and Television Awards (IFTAs) 2021 Nominations for the Irish Academy Awards, I was struck by how much our Irish acting talent is being showcased, both here in Ireland and across the world through myriad roles in film and television. It is truly heartening to see Irish talent on the global stage, both in front of, and behind the cameras. </p>  <p>  Government policy supports the film and television sector to create an attractive environment for film production. Key to this is support for skills and training initiatives in the sector. Ireland also supports the sector though its international film co-production treaties and by offering a competitive section 481 tax credit. This is a tax credit calculated by reference to expenditure on cast and crew working in Ireland, and on goods and services sourced in Ireland. As members of the European Union, we must of course be mindful of our responsibilities to avoid discrimination on the grounds of nationality but we are unabashedly proud of our talented Irish workforce and the reach of our talent across the global industry is testament to this.   </p>  <p>  My Department funds Screen Ireland, the national development agency for the screen sector investing in Talent, Creativity and Enterprise. Screen Ireland&rsquo;s role is to support and promote Irish film, television and animation through fostering Irish artistic vision and our diverse creative and production talent, growing audiences, and attracting filmmakers and investment into the country. </p>  <p>  Not all projects taking place in Ireland will have Screen Ireland funding but I can assure the deputy that Screen Ireland and particularly its training division Screen Skills Ireland place a strong emphasis on the promotion and development of Irish talent.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-06-22a.25.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1471" speakername="Catherine Martin" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021062200060#WRB01600"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 72, 75 and 113 together.</p>  <p>  The local media sector faces a fall in revenue arising from the pandemic, but also longer term challenges as a result of changing patterns of media consumption, technology and shifts in advertising revenue. I recognise the essential role that the local media plays and the particular value of local and regional newspapers, as well as local, regional and community radio stations, in bringing communities together and sharing reliable and relevant local news.</p>  <p>  In recognition of these longer term challenges facing the sector, the Programme for Government provided for the establishment of the Future of Media Commission, chaired by Professor Brian MacCraith, to consider the future of print, broadcast, and online media in a platform agnostic fashion.  The Future of Media Commission conducted a public consultation, that resulted in over 800 written submissions from stakeholder groups, including local media, and the general public.  In addition, the Commission conducted a number of online dialogues with stakeholders and experts CRAOL, IBI, the NUJ, Local Ireland, and NewsBrands. I look forward to receiving the Commission's Report on the completion of its work in July which will inform media policy, including local print and broadcasting media, over the next 10 years. </p>  <p>  Since I assumed formal responsibility for the media sector in September 2020, I have met key stakeholders including NewsBrands, Local Ireland and the National Union of Journalists (NUJ).  My Department has developed an understanding of the impact of the pandemic and general financial trends in the print sector through particularly useful engagement with Local Ireland.  My officials continue to engage with all relevant stakeholders in order to explore the issues arising and build an understanding of the range of challenges facing the sector.</p>  <p>  The Government has put in place a range of supports for all businesses impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which are available to local newspapers, such as the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme and the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme.  The loss the sector has suffered from the impact of the restrictions has also been addressed by the public health advertising placed by the Government. </p>  <p>  I understand that at least &euro;4.4 million has been expended on regional and local print advertising from March 2020 to April 2021. I am also ensuring that advertising campaigns organised by my Department include a local print media element.  Recently the campaign for Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g, a day of free creative events for young people, included a spend of &euro;187,000 on local print advertising. </p>  <p>  To relation to the local radio sector, I have received quarterly reports from the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, analysing how COVID-19 has affected Independent Radio.  These reports have identified the size of falling revenue streams for commercial radio, especially local radio; and the beneficial impact of government supports, such as the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme, which has reduced costs for local stations. In the first quarter of 2021, 17 radio stations availed of this scheme and received &euro;1.5m in supports.  Moreover, government and HSE COVID-related advertising spend also produced a source of revenue for radio stations which amounted to &euro;1.8m in Q1 2021. The BAI will continue to report to me on the sector in the coming months.</p>  <p>  In recognition of challenges facing the sector and its important contribution to society as a whole, I secured additional funding for the Sound and Vision scheme alongside the allocation of 7% of net licence fee receipts which normally supports the fund.  I allocated an additional &euro;4.9m to the BAI in December 2020.  &euro;1m of this was distributed by the BAI in December and the balance of &euro;3.9m comprising &euro;2.5m for the independent radio sector and &euro;1.4m to support the live music sector was recently allocated by the BAI.  On 31 May 2021, in Round 38 of the Sound and Vision 4 scheme, the BAI announced the allocation of &euro;7.2m in supports which will facilitate the production of 104 projects.</p>  <p>  A further round of &euro;2.58m was awarded on 29 April to support all 32 radio stations in the independent radio sector. This funding, which is Round 39 of the Sound and Vision 4 scheme, is on top of the supports already put in place in 2020. Further Sound and Vision funding rounds will follow later in year and the BAI, will announce these as they arise.</p>  <p>  It must be noted that the Sound and Vision scheme is a statutory scheme provided for under Part 10 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 and is largely funded by the television licence.

In 2021, the Government allocated &euro;130m to the Arts Council which is an increase of 62% over the amount initially allocated for 2020. The Arts Council is independent in its funding decisions under the Arts Act 2003. The Arts Council announced details of its investment plans last February and this included a range of initiatives aimed at supporting artists and arts organisation through the crisis. </p>  <p>  From the outset of the COVID-19 crisis, the Arts Council adopted pro-active approach to supporting individual artists of all genres as well as arts and culture organisations.  One of the Council's first actions was its announcement to honour all existing funding commitments, pre-funding grantees up to 90% of funding to assist with commitments, especially to artists. Since then, the Arts Council introduced new and enhanced funding programmes specifically in response to COVID-19. Further information of these investments can be accessed on the Arts Council&rsquo;s website </p>  <p>  In 2021, I allocated &euro;50 million for a suite of measures to assist the live performance sector aimed at supporting employment and wellbeing opportunities across all genres and the continued production of high quality artistic output for the public.  Included in this package are the following measures:</p>  <p>  - I recently announced 237 grant allocations under the 2021 Live Performance Support Scheme amounting to &euro;25m. </p>  <p>  - An allocation of &euro;14m has  been made available for the Music and Entertainment Business Assistance Scheme (MEBAS) to make a contribution to the overheads of businesses, specifically musicians and related crew, that have been negatively affected by COVID-19 and that do not qualify for other business supports.  This Scheme is a demand led scheme and is accepting applications at present.</p>  <p>  - An allocation of &euro;5 million has been made available to local authorities for live performances in summer 2021 to animate town centres, should public health considerations permit. </p>  <p>  - Up to &euro;1 million was allocated to the St Patrick's Festival 2021 for programming and it supported over 3,500 days of employment for performers, producers, artists, technicians, creatives and support staff.</p>  <p>  A separate &euro;11.5m new fund for the entertainment industry, including festivals, conferencing and large events has been agreed between myself and the T&aacute;naiste Leo Varadkar.

The stadium referred to by the Deputy received a provisional allocation of &euro;71,000 under the 2018 round of the Programme but this has not been drawn down. </p>  <p>  The latest round of the SCEP closed for applications on the 1st March and assessment work is underway. An announcement on the timing of the next round of the Programme will be made once these allocations have been finalised.   </p>  <p>  The National Sports Policy published in 2018 provided for the establishment of the LSSIF. The aim of the fund is to provide support for larger sports facilities where the Exchequer investment is greater than the maximum amount (&euro;300,000) available under the SCEP. The National Development Plan provided a capital allocation of at least &euro;100m over the period to 2027 for the Fund.   Approximately &euro;86.4m has been allocated to 33 projects to date including an allocation of &euro;918,750 to Dublin City Council towards the overall design cost for the redevelopment of the stadium to which the Deputy refers. </p>  <p>  While it is not proposed to open the LSSIF for new applications at present, my Department is undertaking a review of the LSSIF which is expected to be complete in the near future. This review will look at, inter alia, progress on all existing grants and the timing of a new call for proposals will also be considered. </p>  <p>  A key consideration in the assessment of any applications under the SCEP and the LSSIF is the likelihood of increasing participation including female participation and the government is committed to continued investment in our sport infrastructure in the years ahead. Any future application for funding for the stadium referred to by the Deputy under either the SCEP or LSSIF will be considered on its own merits in line with the relevant assessment criteria.</p></reply>

Under the terms of the scheme, the Department provides a subsidy, currently worth &euro;10 per day (equivalent to &euro;220 per student for a three week course) which benefits over 26,000 students a year while staying in any of the c.700 Gaeltacht households approved under the scheme.</p><p>This represents a State investment of over &euro;4m annually in support of the Irish summer colleges sector. Not only does this annual state investment yield benefits in providing language learning and enrichment opportunities to thousands of young people annually, it also generates economic benefits for Gaeltacht regions.</p><p>In addition to providing and administering this practical assistance, the Department also administers a number of further specific measures under the scheme, including <b>DEIS Gaeltachta</b>.  Under this measure which was introduced in 2019, 50 scholarships are made available annually -  worth c. &euro;850 each - to qualifying students attending DEIS post-primary schools. The scheme is administered on behalf of the Department by Galway and Roscommon Education and Training Board, which also administers another initiative called <b>&Aacute;rainn Gaeltachta.</b>This initiative provides funding of up to &euro;150,000 over a 3-year period so that up to 30 post-primary students per year can spend a full year attending any one of the three post-primary schools on the Aran islands while residing with accredited Gaeltacht households.</p><p>While my Department has for a number of years subsidised the accommodation costs for trainee teachers attending residential Gaeltacht courses, in 2019, it launched a new initiative, named <b>Erasmus Gaeltachta</b>, which provides up to 175 third-level students with the opportunity to spend a semester residing with accredited Gaeltacht households. This initiative is administered under my Department's Sc&eacute;im na bhFoghlaimeoir&iacute; Gaeilge to subvent the cost of accommodation for students staying with Gaeltacht households approved under the scheme. It is expected that this will resume in the new academic year, having been cancelled over the past year due to the pandemic. </p><p>Both I and my officials are continuing to engage with the summer colleges sector on foot of the decision to cancel courses this summer. The overall purpose of this engagement  - which includes discussions with a representative group of Gaeltacht accommodation providers, is to tailor insofar as possible, suitable stabilisation measures with a view to ensuring the sector is on a sound footing for a full and safe return in 2022.</p><p>Needless to say, my Department continues to keep under constant review how best to further support and develop the sector within available resources and in a way which best supports the overall objectives of the overarching 20-Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-2030 and in turn, the Irish language and Gaeltacht regions.</p></reply>

In particular, sectors such as tourism, live events, sports and the arts have been among the worst-affected sectors of the pandemic, and the Economic Recovery Plan recognises the particular impact on the economic viability of the sectors that will continue for longer than other sectors in the economy while of physical distancing remains a feature of these sectors.</p>  <p>  Under the Economic Recovery Plan, Government has committed to maintaining supports by extending the period during which a range of horizontal and business supports will be available to enterprises and workers in all sectors of the economy, including Tourism, Arts and Culture, Sport, Media and those working in Gaeltacht communities. Of particular relevance are the following measures:</p>  <p>  - Extending the COVID Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS);</p>  <p>  - Extending the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme to 31 December;</p>  <p>  - Extending the Pandemic Unemployment Payment beyond 30 June 2021;</p>  <p>  - Extending the Commercial Rates Waiver to end-September 2021;</p>  <p>  - Broadening of eligibility criteria for the Small Business Assistance Scheme for COVID-19, which opens the scheme up to businesses in non-rated premises.</p>  <p>  The Economic Recovery Plan also sets out the intention to introduce a new, additional and more streamlined business support scheme in September 2021, called the Business Resumption Support Scheme.</p>  <p>  In addition to horizontal supports, the Economic Recovery Plan includes a package of sectoral measures for the Tourism, Live Events and the Arts and Culture, which are providing additional interventions to support recovery in these sectors.</p>  <p>  For the live events, arts and culture sectors, I opened applications for the new &euro;14 million Music and Entertainment Business Assistance Scheme last week, on 9 June. This payment is targeted at helping not only bands and musicians, but suppliers and music businesses. I also recently announced 237 grant allocations under the &euro;25m Live Performance Support Scheme.</p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste Leo Varadkar and I have also agreed to deliver a separate &euro;11.5m new fund for the entertainment industry, including festivals, conferencing and large events . This Events Sector Covid Support Scheme will support SMEs that are not eligible for the CRSS.</p>  <p>  I am also delighted that the  Economic Recovery Plan includes a commitment for Government to prioritise a Basic Income guarantee pilot scheme for artists. This was a key recommendation of the Arts and Culture Recovery Taskforce, and I will bring forward a proposal following the report of the Arts and Culture Recovery Oversight Group in July.</p>  <p>  I also recently confirmed the release of funding for local authorities with &euro;5m to support live music in villages and towns across the country. Amounts of &euro;285,000 are now available to the Dublin local authorities, and &euro;143,000 to other local authorities to facilitate programming of outdoor live performances over the summer months, animating town centres for local communities as public health considerations permit. Local Authorities and hospitality businesses can also benefit from F&aacute;ilte Ireland's Outdoor Dining Enhancement Investment Scheme, which will facilitate greater capacity in outdoor dining by supporting the upgrade and enhancement of streets and public spaces, and implementing weather-proofing solutions which will facilitate year-round outdoor dining.</p>  <p>  In addition to benefiting from revised and extended horizontal supports, the Economic Recovery Plan also provides the following additional targeted interventions for the Tourism sector:</p>  <p>  - An Extension of the 9% VAT rate to September 2022. This will continue to act as a stimulus for the sector as it moves towards recovery.</p>  <p>  - The F&aacute;ilte Ireland Business Continuity Scheme will also continue.</p>  <p>  This will provide tourism and hospitality businesses with much-need clarity that will enable them to plan longer-term with confidence and accept bookings. Government also recognises that as long as physical distancing remains a public health requirement, further supports may be needed for these sectors.</p>  <p>  These supports will augment the work already being undertaken by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, and Screen Ireland in supporting Gaeltacht companies, the Tourism and Hospitality sector, and the audiovisual industry to withstand the full impact of the pandemic and position them for growth in the coming years.</p>  <p>  In regard to sport, a total Covid-19 funding package of &euro;88.5 million was provided last year to support the sport sector. This significant investment benefited all levels of the sport sector, including thousands of grassroots clubs across the country, and provided some certainty for sporting organisations in their planning for 2021.  In relation to further Covid-19 funding for 2021, Minister Chambers and I have committed to supporting the sport sector again this year in meeting the challenges arising from Covid-19. Sport Ireland is in ongoing communication with the NGBs and is assessing the financial needs of the sector. In addition, I am engaging with NGBs with regard to the supports required. </p>  <p>  I will continue to work with colleagues across Government to ensure that the sectors covered by my Department are supported in their recovery as we reopen our society and our economy.</p></reply>

Under the terms of the scheme, the Department provides a subsidy, currently worth &euro;10 per day (equivalent to &euro;220 per student for a three week course) which benefits over 26,000 students a year while staying in any of the c.700 Gaeltacht households approved under the scheme.</p><p>This represents a State investment of over &euro;4m annually in support of the Irish summer colleges sector. Not only does this annual state investment yield benefits in providing language learning and enrichment opportunities to thousands of young people annually, it also generates economic benefits for Gaeltacht regions.</p><p>In addition to providing and administering this practical assistance, the Department also administers a number of further specific measures under the scheme, including: <b>DEIS Gaeltachta</b>.  Under this measure which was introduced in 2019, 50 scholarships are made available annually - worth c. &euro;850 each - to qualifying students attending DEIS post-primary schools. The scheme is administered on behalf of the Department by Galway and Roscommon Education and Training Board.</p><p>Due to COVID-19, it was not possible to provide the scholarships last year nor indeed this year, following the recent decision not to proceed with recognised Irish summer courses, in the interests of protecting public health.</p><p>It is envisaged that the provision of scholarships under <b>DEIS Gaeltachta </b>will resume next year or as soon as it is safe to do so. The number of scholarships made available under the measure will of course be kept under consideration in the context of available resources and competing demands.  However, it is a stated priority of mine to expand this scheme in order to increase the availability of the Gaeltacht experience to students from all socio-economic backgrounds.</p><p>In the interest of completeness, the Deputy may be interested to note that both I and my officials are continuing to engage with the summer colleges sector on foot of the decision to cancel courses this summer. The overall purpose of this engagement, which includes discussions with a representative group of Gaeltacht accommodation providers, is to tailor insofar as possible, suitable stabilisation measures with a view to ensuring the sector is on a sound footing for a full and safe return in 2022.</p></reply>

My Department is working closely with the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science to progress these recommendations.</p>  <p>  In addition, F&aacute;ilte Ireland chairs and co-ordinates the work of the Tourism &amp;amp; Hospitality Careers Oversight Group which includes members from across the tourism industry and is currently implementing an agreed Plan of Action with stakeholders.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland is also delivering a number of strategies and working closely with industry, education providers, and other State agencies to address the recruitment and retention challenges in the tourism sector, such as a recent recruitment webinar event and an ongoing social media campaign targeting job-seekers.</p></reply>

Furthermore, every effort will be made to fund as many worthwhile projects as possible while providing a sufficient level of grant to ensure the projects are viable.  While a minimum of &euro;40m is available, the level of funding will be kept under review, in the context of drawdown demands in the coming years for older SCEP grants and the review of the National Development Plan.</p></reply>

Applications may be made via the MEBAS application portal on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  I have also made an allocation of &euro;5 million  available to local authorities for live performances in summer 2021 to animate town centres, should public health considerations permit.  This will allow for the procurement by local authorities of performances by local performers.  This funding will be allocated shortly.</p>  <p>  &euro;5 million will also be made available for a scheme of capital supports for the commercial live entertainment sector.</p>  <p>  Up to &euro;1 million was allocated to the St Patrick's Festival 2021 for programming and it has supported over 3,500 days of employment for performers, producers, artists, technicians, creatives and support staff. With gatherings still restricted, SPF 2021 curated a rich and dynamic programme of events involving hundreds of artists, musicians, performers, creators, and community organisations which was broadcast on the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Festival TV online channel marking the national day.</p>  <p>  In addition, I have announced an additional &euro;11.5m for a new Events Sector Covid Support Scheme which I hope to launch soon.  This scheme will target SMEs in the events sector which aren&rsquo;t eligible for the CRSS and for whom MEBAS and the Small Business Assistance Scheme for COVID-19 will not make a significant contribution to fixed costs relative to the level of support that that would be available under CRSS, had such SMEs been eligible for that support.</p></reply>

A proportion of support up to a maximum of 20% of the total request may be directed towards essential repair and maintenance.</p><p>The Council is now inviting applications for the Visual Artists Workspace Scheme 2022. The closing date of this scheme is 8 July 2021 and applications and detailed guidelines can be accessed on its website at the following link: </p><p>The Cultural Capital Scheme 2019-2022 is a &euro;4.7m capital investment scheme for arts and culture centres which is being administered by my Department.  The scheme will run until 2022 and will focus on enhancing the existing stock of arts and culture centres throughout the country. In line with the Government's action on climate change, this scheme will prioritise projects that reduce an organisation's carbon footprint that will make a real and positive impact on the environment. Projects that provide additional capacity for artists and artistic production particularly in arts centres will also be favoured. The Cultural Capital Scheme 2019-2022 is constructed of a number of funding steams one of which is Stream C which is aimed at upgrading visual artists' workspaces and is run by Visual Artists Ireland (VAI) on behalf of my Department. Funding of approximately &euro;79k was announced in October 2020 by VAI for Stream C to 10 applicants.</p><p>In recent years my Department has had discussions with the Arts Council, the Office of Public Works and some local authorities to consider possible short-term and longer-term approaches to the issue of artists workspaces both in relation to specific issues in Dublin and to wider national approaches. In that regard my Department, in conjunction with Dublin City Council, has agreed in principle to make up to &euro;3m available towards artists workspaces in Dublin. There are certain sites in the city currently being examined for their suitability in this regard by the City Council. This level of investment will greatly benefit the artists in this area and address the deficit in artist workspaces in Dublin City.</p><p>The Urban Regeneration and Development Fund (URDF) was launched in 2018 to support more compact and sustainable development.  I understand that my colleague the Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government announced up 87 projects approved under Call 1 together with up-to-date provisional URDF funding allocations and this includes an allocation to Dublin City Council in respect of Artists Workspaces.</p></reply>

Consideration of funding proposals for any particular sport such as the one referred to by the Deputy arises accordingly in that context, also bearing in mind the specific role and responsibility of the National Governing Body concerned.  </p>  <p>  As the recognised National Governing Body for the development of football in Ireland, the FAI is currently in the process of developing a new Strategic Plan which will identify targeted and measurable objectives and the key enablers for delivery, to drive the development of football in Ireland in the coming years.  I consider that all proposals for the development of football in Ireland, including the one to which the Deputy refers, requires assessment in the particular context of that new Strategic Plan and also bearing in mind the Government&rsquo;s broader National Sport Policy (2018-2027).</p>  <p>  There is considerable emphasis in current programming on the important role of schools. The FAI currently delivers a range of programmes and projects in second level schools.  In a normal year, the FAI target a participation level of some 6,000 players in its post-primary school futsal programme delivered locally and regionally by FAI Development Officers. 38,000 participants also take part in the FAI&rsquo;s Post-Primary Schools competitions. The FAI has also delivered programmes/coach education course for Transition Year students in secondary schools. Programmes are also delivered by the FAI in third level colleges and universities both with a participation focus and also coach education. The FAI have also delivered Education Training Board courses supporting Player Development to approx. 250 trainees in a given academic year.</p>  <p>  There is already considerable financial support provided by the State for the development of football in Ireland. The Memorandum of Understanding between the Government and the FAI for the period 2020-2023, provides for a package of funding of &euro;5.8million per annum to the FAI for the period 2020-2023 for football development as well as a recoupable amount of &euro;7.6338million, (paid in three instalments of &euro;2.5446 million, directly to New Stadium DAC (trading as Aviva Stadium) on behalf of the FAI in each of the years 2020, 2021 and 2022,) towards the licence fee payable to New Stadium DAC. In addition to this funding, Sport Ireland has also invested an additional &euro;13.2m in the FAI in COVID-19 grants as part of the Government&rsquo;s &euro;88.5m COVID-19 funding package for the overall sports sector announced last year.</p>  <p>  Proposals for an alteration of the distribution of proceeds from the betting levy are a matter for my colleague the Minister for Finance.</p></reply>

Both strands are valued artistically, with classical circus having a long working history in Ireland, while contemporary circus practice is relatively new. The Arts Act 2003 cites circus as one of nine art forms. As an art form, circus attracts high audience numbers each year including many rural audiences and members of new communities.</p>  <p>  The Arts Council supports both strands of circus and, through direct support and strategic intervention, engages with the sector to assist individuals and organisations to develop high-quality performance and participatory work. The Arts Council's support is by way of grants under a range of categories including bursary, strategic funding, project awards and touring and dissemination awards.  There were very significant increases in supports provided to circus in 2020 and 2021, with over &euro;2.2 million allocated to circus, street arts and spectacle in 2021 to both organisations and individual circus artists. Details of all grants are available on the Arts Council&rsquo;s website. Funding for the Arts Council has increased steadily in recent years, reaching a record level of &euro;130 million this year. Under the Arts Act 2003, the Arts Council is independent in its funding decisions.</p>  <p>  Under the Economic Recovery Plan, Government extended the period during which a range of horizontal and business supports will be available to enterprises and workers in all sectors of the economy, including the Arts and Culture sectors.  Measures include:</p>  <p>  - Extending the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme to 31 December.</p>  <p>  - Extending the Pandemic Unemployment Payment beyond 30 June 2021.</p>  <p>  - Extending the Commercial Rates Waiver to end-September 2021.</p>  <p>   - Broadening of eligibility criteria for the Small Business Assistance Scheme for COVID-19, which opens the scheme up to businesses in non-rated premises.</p>  <p>  - The Economic Recovery Plan sets out the intention to introduce a new, additional and more streamlined business support scheme in September 2021, called the Business Resumption Support Scheme.</p>  <p>  In addition to horizontal supports, the Economic Recovery Plan includes a package of sectoral supports for the Tourism, Live Events and Arts and Culture.</p>  <p>  For the live events, arts and culture sectors, I opened applications for the new &euro;14 million Music and Entertainment Business Assistance Scheme on 9 June. This payment is targeted at helping not only bands and musicians, but also technical crew who support live performance. </p>  <p>  I also recently announced 237 grant allocations under the &euro;25m Live Performance Support Scheme. I allocated &euro;50 million to a suite of measures to assist the live performance sector. The 2021 scheme is aimed at supporting employment and wellbeing opportunities across all genres and the continued production of high quality artistic output for the public.  These included a number of allocations to circuses.</p>  <p>  An allocation of &euro;5 million has been made available to local authorities for live performances in summer 2021 to animate town centres, should public health considerations permit.  This will allow for the procurement by local authorities of performances by local performers.  This funding will be allocated shortly.</p>  <p>  Up to &euro;1 million was allocated to the St Patrick's Festival 2021 for programming and it supported over 3,500 days of employment for performers, producers, artists, technicians, creatives and support staff. </p>  <p>  The Economic Recovery Plan includes a commitment for Government to prioritise a Basic Income guarantee pilot scheme for artists. This was a key recommendation of the Arts and Culture Recovery Taskforce.</p></reply>

From 5 July the numbers permitted at outdoor organised events can further increase to a maximum of 200 for the majority of venues, with a maximum of 500 for outdoor stadia/venues with a minimum accredited capacity of 5,000. Subject to improving public health conditions, further easing of restrictions will be considered for August and we anticipate further increases in the numbers permitted at both indoor and outdoor events.</p>  <p>  In addition to that, my Department has been working since October 2020 with a combined working group of the FAI, the IRFU and the GAA and Sport Ireland.  The working group's guidelines, prepared with the assistance of health and safety experts, are designed for use by event organisers and have recently been published. The guidelines describe how spectators can safely be accommodated at sporting events.</p>  <p>  Pilot events are necessary as a proof of concept for the safe management of events in line with the guidelines whilst Covid-19 is still circulating in our communities. They assess and build confidence in the Covid-19 guidance and event management protocols developed by sectors. The pilot events we have announced will allow for sports bodies and stadiums to put in place and test out the necessary safety measures to allow the safe return of spectators.</p>  <p>  The pilot events will use measures to mitigate against Covid-19 including reduced attendances, careful communication with spectators, social distancing, mask-wearing, the careful management of entrance and departure of spectators and hand sanitising. Spectators are required to agree to a code of conduct for the event and advised not to attend if they are feeling the symptoms of Covid-19.  A health screening questionnaire is communicated to spectators before events. Full refunds are available to spectators should they need to stay away from the event for health reasons.</p>  <p>  The intention is that the pilots will, subject to public health conditions, pave the way for greater attendances in July and August. Pilots will be reviewed by the working group in the week following any pilot event and results will also be communicated to broader society to ensure that communities around Ireland can get back to safe enjoyment of our favourite sports and events. The guidelines will be updated at the end of the pilot events if need be to reflect any lessons learned.</p></reply>

For cross border consumer protection issues, the CCPC is part of the European Consumer Protection Co-operation (CPC) Network, which is comprised of national authorities responsible for enforcing EU consumer protection laws. This network protects consumers when conducting transactions across national borders and, allows consumer protection agencies to co-operate to resolve particular consumer issues. The CPC Network is central to addressing this matter, which involved the purchase by consumers of properties in France. These properties were developed, marketed, sold and managed by French traders under a French &lsquo;Residence de Tourisme&rsquo; scheme devised by the French Government to provide tourist accommodation in France. Under the European CPC network, the appropriate authorities to conduct an investigation in relation to this matter are the French consumer protection authorities &ndash; Direction G&eacute;n&eacute;rale de la Concurrence, de la Consommation et de la R&eacute;pression des Fraudes (&lsquo;DGCCRF&rsquo;). </p>  <p>  The CCPC has informed my Department that they engaged with the DGCCRF with respect to the issues highlighted by Irish property purchasers. The CCPC received complaints from Irish property purchasers and provided an initial preliminary assessment to the DGCCRF for over 150 complainants. Following consultation with the DGCCRF, the CCPC collated and transferred to the DGCCRF the transactional documentation of over 150 Irish property purchasers. The CCPC has and continues to provide significant time and resources to this matter and to supporting the DGCCRF investigation. In addition, throughout the period of engagement with the DGCCRF, whenever issues have been raised by Irish property purchasers or where they have requested the CCPC to forward on additional documentation to DGCCRF in relation to any legal matters, the CCPC has done so and taken whatever additional steps requested by DGCCRF. </p>  <p>  The DGCCRF are investigating the issues that were referred to the CCPC by the individuals involved. The primary focus of the CCPC is to continue to support the DGCCRF investigation through providing any assistance or information requested by the DGCCRF.

The lists are subject to twice yearly, evidence-based reviews.</p>  <p>  On 14 June, following the most recent review of the employment permit occupation lists, I announced changes to the employment permit system, with immediate effect, to address skills and labour shortages in the healthcare and nursing home sector.  </p>  <p>  The occupations of Health Care Assistant, Social Worker, Occupational Therapist, Physiotherapist, and Speech and Language Therapist are now eligible for a General Employment Permit and Dieticians can apply for Critical Skills Employment Permit.</p>  <p>  In light of COVID-19, increases in the aging population and consequent increases in demand for services, a significant number of extra Health Care Assistants will be required to provide sufficient long-term residential care for older people into the future. The removal of this occupation from the ineligible occupations list comes under the following framework:</p>  <p>  - Attainment of a relevant QQI Level 5 qualification after 2 years employment in the State</p>  <p>  - A minimum remuneration threshold of salary of at least &euro;27,000  </p>  <p>  The General Employment Permit is the main permit used by the State to attract non-EEA nationals in occupations of a more general nature. It requires a range of criteria be met including a labour market needs test demonstrating that the employer was unable to fill the position from the Irish and EEA labour markets.</p>  <p>  Making the occupations of Health Care Assistant, Social Worker, Occupational Therapist, Physiotherapist, or Speech and Language Therapist eligible for a Critical Skills Employment Permit would require consideration of the potential impacts, including on the domestic labour market and a detailed business case from the sector.  The next review will be announced shortly, with the launch of a public consultation. My Department continues to engage with the Department of Health on these issues.</p></reply>

A medium-size offshore windpark now entails installed capacity of circa 500MW and a corresponding capital expenditure of over &euro;1.5 billion, according to the latest estimates provided by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). </p>  <p>  The RESS is intentionally designed to leverage the greater energy production capabilities of offshore wind in favour of coastal and marine communities through the community benefit fund. This revenue-sharing mechanism mandates a community payment of &euro;2 for every MWh of energy generated. In practice, this will mean multi-million euro contributions per project, per annum, to offshore communities.</p>  <p>  In order to ensure good governance and the sustainable use of these funds, guidance will be provided by my Department or a nominated body, complementing the  RESS terms and conditions themselves, and firmly establishing local community benefits in their administration.</p></reply>

This ambition aligns with our Programme for Government commitment to an average 7% per annum reduction in emissions from 2021 to 2030, and to achieving net zero emissions no later than 2050. The Climate Action Plan, currently being updated,  will set out the measures and actions required to meet our 2030 target.  </p>  <p>  Delivering the actions in the Climate Action Plan and ultimately achieving the transition to net zero will require both public and private investment, complimented by taxation, regulatory and behavioural change measures. In terms of Exchequer investment, the National Development Plan 2018 - 2027, which is currently being reviewed, allocated &euro;30.4 billion for investment in climate action, while the Programme for Government commits to allocating all additional carbon tax revenue, estimated &euro;9.5 billion over the next ten years, for climate action with a particular emphasis on ensuring a just transition. In addition, the EU&rsquo;s &euro;750 billion Next Generation EU recovery package and &euro;1 trillion budget require that money can only be spent on projects that meet certain green criteria, with 30% of all funding to go on climate change mitigation.</p>  <p>  Failure to rapidly move to a carbon-neutral economic model will have far reaching negative impacts on the economy and the public finances; undermine the long-term, sustainable competitiveness of the economy; and lock Ireland into a redundant fossil-fuel based economic model. Embracing the transition will support further job creation through the development of new and emerging sectors. The green economy, including the retrofitting and renewable energy sector, the circular economy, clean mobility, green and blue infrastructure, sustainable agriculture and the bio-economy will create high quality employment opportunities that will be a source of significant employment growth over the coming decades, as well as supporting a stable tax base. In addition, failure to meet our legally binding EU targets could result in a cost to the Exchequer of up to &euro;1.75 billion.</p></reply>

This popular scheme supports partnership approaches that deliver energy savings to a range of building types including public, commercial and community buildings with a particular focus on using the projects to deliver home retrofits to support Climate Action Plan objectives.  The 2021 budget for the scheme, at &euro;30 million, is a 50% increase on the 2020 allocation and demand for the scheme has been very strong.   </p>  <p>  The partnership approach used by the scheme has proved to be successful for a number of years.  By bringing together groups of buildings under the same retrofit programme, community projects facilitate community-wide energy improvements more efficiently and cost effectively than might otherwise be possible.</p>  <p>  My Department is also currently working with SEAI to develop additional supports for community based projects and Sustainable Energy Communities (SECs).

In County Limerick, premises have been surveyed or surveys are ongoing in the areas of Pallaskenry, Toreen, Old Kildimo, Askeaton, Adare, Croagh, Rathkeale, Kilfinny, Croom, Ballingarry, Patrickswell, Crecora, Banogue Cross, Granagh, Lees Cross, Ballykennedy and in outlying parts of the city, including Killalee, Caherline and Ballynanty. Main works are ongoing in townlands outside Limerick City including Mungret, Patrickswell, Crecora, Castleconnell and Caherconlish. The area of Meentulla, Murroe is located in the Intervention Area and will be provided with access to highspeed broadband under the NBP.  </p><p>The first fibre to the home connections are successfully connected in Cavan and in Carrigaline, County Cork. I am advised by NBI that, as of 17 June, nearly 4,400 homes are passed and available for connection in both Counties Cork and Cavan.  A further 15,000 premises can also pre-order via retail service providers (RSPs) in Counties Cork, Cavan, Galway and Limerick and will be able to get a connection in the coming months.</p><p>Further details are available on specific areas within Limerick through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises when works are due to commence. </p><p>Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 17 June, 325 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible locations and the Department of Education for schools. BCPs installed with high speed publicly accessible broadband include Cappamore Community Centre (6.68km from Meentulla), Caherline Community Centre, Glenmore Community Centre, Coolcappa Community Centre, Galbally GAA Club, Glenroe GAA Club, Kildimo GAA Club, and Patrickswell GAA Club. </p><p>Gerald Griffin National School, Anglesboro National School, Knocknadea National School, Limerick East Educate Together National School, Coolcappa National School, Killinure National School, Tinnatarriff National School and Mountcollins National School  are installed as part of this initiative. My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband, within the Intervention Area, for connection over the term of the NBP. In this regard, an acceleration of this aspect of the National Broadband Plan will see some 679 primary schools connected to high speed broadband by 2022, well ahead of the original target delivery timeframe of 2026. Further details are available on the NBI website at .</p><p>I note from the Question that a service provider in the area intends to withdraw its service, however, I understand that access to broadband should still be available through another existing service provider pending roll out of the National Broadband Plan in the area.</p></reply>

Furthermore, it was agreed that any Exchequer contribution would only be paid on completion of all upgrade works and the runway being confirmed &lsquo;ready for service&rsquo; by the Irish Aviation Authority.</p><p>As part of this decision, Government also committed to providing operational supports, on an exceptional basis, to the airport to ensure the continuation of the Search and Rescue (SAR) services at the Waterford base as well as general aviation services while the runway was being constructed.  Since 2018, Waterford Airport has received &euro;1.5 million in operational supports - &euro;750,000 in 2018 followed by &euro;375,000 in each of the years 2019 and 2020.  It has not received any funding in 2021 and I have informed Waterford Airport that in the absence of flights, the Airport fails to meet the connectivity objective associated with Government policy on regional airports. While some operational payments to Waterford airport were made on an exceptional basis between 2018 and 2020 in anticipation of the return of scheduled services, the radically changed outlook for the return of such services means that such payments cannot be continued and Waterford airport have been advised of this position. </p><p>Furthermore, given the changed circumstances in the context of the project timeline and the impacts of Covid19 on the aviation market and wider economy, I have informed Waterford airport that any renewal of a commitment to provide Exchequer funds of &euro;5m for development works will need to take account of these circumstances as well as the enhanced obligations that are now in place under the revised Public Spending Code, which was published in December 2019.</p></reply>

The RSA reopened its network of test centres and will be permitted to conduct 25,000 driver theory tests per month.  </p>  <p>  Prior to COVID-19, the RSA provided 15,000 tests per month. In light of the significant backlog of customers, capacity will gradually increase in centres to 25,000 tests monthly.  </p>  <p>  The test centres have extensive COVID-19 measures in place to protect both customers and staff and to ensure the safe delivery of the service. It is hoped that capacity will gradually increase to 50,000 tests monthly, if public health guidance permits.  </p>  <p>  The RSA, like all organisations and business, must take its direction and guidance from the Government, the HSA, and the Department of Transport in relation to capacity restrictions for in-person services and therefore must adopt and implement all recommendations relating to the services which can be provided.</p>  <p>  The RSA has been working to deliver an online theory test service, with a pilot online test already underway for trucks and buses. This pilot service has now been extended to include a limited number of car and motorbike tests.   </p>  <p>  The new offering will see 4,000 online theory tests available for all categories of vehicles during June.  The RSA has plans to increase this by a further 6,000 during July. Tests are available on a first-come-first-served basis with the new online service becoming more widely available later in the year.   </p>  <p>  It is important to emphasise the limits of online testing.  These may be convenient for test candidates, but they have to be monitored closely by a supervisor, which makes them more staff-intensive than tests in test centres.  In consequence, if the RSA and Prometric, the test operator, get approval in future to extend capacity in test centres to 50,000 tests, they have indicated that they will prioritize staff for the test centres and may have to reduce the figure online from 10,000.  This will in fact have a positive impact on numbers tested, as the test centres are far more efficient.  </p>  <p>  The gradual reopening of services will not immediately solve the backlogs. Every possible measure is being put in place to ensure that the maximum number of customers can be served while public health guidance is strictly adhered to.</p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from local authorities' own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority. </p>  <p>  The major cuts to funding for regional and local roads during the post 2008 recession resulted in the build-up of a substantial backlog of works across the country. Work is in hand at the moment to firm up on the cost of the backlog but an indicative cost is in excess of &euro;5 billion. As the length of the regional and road network in Cork is about 12% of the total, the Cork County share of the estimated backlog would be over &euro;600 million. </p>  <p>  Because of the pressures on the regional and local road network, over 90% of  available Exchequer grant assistance to local authorities is being directed to maintenance and renewal works rather than roads upgrades. The aim is, subject to funding, to increase investment to the level where the network reaches &ldquo;steady state&rdquo; i.e. where it can be held in its existing state without further deterioration.  </p>  <p>  While steady state has not been achieved yet, there has been significant increases in Exchequer grants for regional and local roads particularly in the last four years. In 2021, Cork County Council has been allocated a total of &euro;66,581,844 which is an increase of 84.7% in comparison with 2017. My Department's grant funding for the maintenance of regional and local roads is allocated to local authorities on a pro-rata basis, determined mainly by the length of the regional and local road network in the county. The fact that Cork County Council has the longest road network is, therefore, reflected in its grant. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that exchequer funding for regional and local roads is intended to supplement realistic contributions from local authorities&rsquo; own resources. As the statutory road authorities for their areas, it is open to local authorities to reprioritise investment towards regional and local roads.</p></reply>

While the National Development Plan 2018 -2027 provides for a gradual increase in funding for regional and local roads, investment is not yet at the level needed to ensure that the public road network is being maintained adequately. This means that expenditure is still below the amount required to hold the public network in a "steady state" condition and in addition there is a backlog of works.</p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from Councils&rsquo; own resources supplemented by State road grants, where applicable. Arising from the arrangements in place in relation to Local Property Tax receipts, the four Dublin Councils are largely self-funding for works on regional and local roads since 2015 and my Department no longer provides grants to these Councils under the main regional and local road grant categories.</p>  <p>  Details of the regional and local road grant allocations and payments to local authorities are outlined in the regional and local road grant booklets which are available in the Oireachtas Library. The Revised Estimates Volume (REV) allocation for regional and local roads in 2021 is &euro;555 million and to increase this by 20% would require additional funding of &euro;111 million.</p>  <p>As Minister for Transport I have responsibility for overall policy and securing exchequer funding in relation to the National Roads Programme. Under the Roads Acts 1993-2015 and in line with the National Development Plan (NDP), the operation and maintenance of individual national roads is a matter for Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII), in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.  This is also subject to the Public Spending Code Guidelines and the necessary statutory approvals. In this context, TII is best placed to advise you.</p>  <p>  Noting the above position, I have referred your question to TII for a direct reply. Please advise my private office if you do not receive a reply within 10 working days.</p></reply>

The latter funding stream constitutes the first ever major Active Travel investment programme for rural Ireland. &euro;50 million has been allocated to the Department&rsquo;s Greenways programme in 2021 in addition to a carryover of &euro;19m from 2020. This overall increase in funding will not only support the construction and improvement of walking and cycling infrastructure but also the deployment of almost 250 Active Travel staff in local authorities around the country.</p>  <p>  The Deputy should also be aware that local authorities can also access funding sources through other Departments to support walking and cycling infrastructure development. The two most significant are the Urban Regeneration and Development Fund (URDF), which falls under the remit of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, and the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund (RRDF), overseen by the Department of Rural and Community Development. The latter Department also supports leisure orientated walking and cycling through the Outdoor Recreation Infrastructure Scheme (ORIS).</p></reply>

The contract(s) will be subject to a maximum term of 7 months and will operate in accordance with EU law.</p><p>To mitigate against any further disruption to these services, my Department will shortly launch a procurement process for the continued provision of the services after the temporary arrangements have expired.

This pilot service has now been extended to include a limited number of car and motorbike tests.</p>  <p>  The new offering will see 4,000 online theory tests available for all categories of vehicles during June. The RSA has plans to increase this by a further 6,000 during July. Tests are available on a first-come-first-served basis with the new online service becoming more widely available later in the year.</p>  <p>  It is important to emphasise the limits of online testing. These may be convenient for test candidates, but they have to be monitored closely by a supervisor, which makes them more staff-intensive than tests in test centres. In consequence, if the RSA and Prometric, the test operator, get approval in future to extend capacity in test centres to 50,000 tests, they have indicated that they will prioritize staff for the test centres and may have to reduce the figure online from 10,000. This will in fact have a positive impact on numbers tested, as the test centres are far more efficient.</p></reply>

The support is available to companies, self-employed individuals and partnerships who carry on a trade or trading activities, the profits from which are chargeable to tax under Case I of Schedule D, from a business premises located in a region subject to restrictions introduced in line with the Living with Covid-19 Plan.</p>  <p>  Details of CRSS were published in Finance Act 2020 and detailed operational guidelines, which are based on the terms and conditions of the scheme as set out in the legislation, have been published on the Revenue website.</p>  <p>  The CRSS applies to businesses carrying on trading activities from a business premises located in a region subject to restrictions, which requires the business to prohibit or considerably restrict customers from accessing their business premises and as a result, is operating at less than 25% of turnover in 2019.</p>  <p>  It is not sufficient that the trade of a business has been impacted because of a reduction in customer demand as a consequence of Covid-19.  The scheme only applies where, as a direct result of the specific terms of the Government restrictions, the business is required to either prohibit or significantly restrict access to its business premises. This means that in the case of a travel agent that operates from a business premises, they may qualify for support under the scheme provided they meet all the eligibility criteria, including the requirement that customers are either prohibited, or significantly restricted, from accessing their business premises under the public health regulations.</p>  <p>  As non-essential retail, including travel agent businesses, were permitted to open from 17 May 2021, they are no longer subject to Covid restrictions which would require them to prohibit or significantly restrict customers from accessing their business premises. Therefore, from that date, they ceased to qualify for support under the CRSS. However, subject to meeting the relevant criteria, a business such as a travel agent business, reopening after a period of restrictions, may claim a &ldquo;restart week payment&rdquo; under the CRSS scheme to assist it with the costs of reopening.</p>  <p>  For businesses reopening between 29 April 2021 and 1 June 2021, an &ldquo;enhanced restart week payment&rdquo; may be claimed, which is computed at double the normal weekly CRSS rate, for two weeks, subject to a maximum weekly amount payable of &euro;5,000.</p>  <p>  On 1 June, I announced that an additional business support scheme, the Business Resumption Support Scheme (BRSS), would be available for businesses whose turnover in the period from 1 September 2020 to 31 August 2021 is reduced by 75% compared with their 2019 turnover. To qualify under the scheme, a business must carry on a trade or trading activities, the profits from which are chargeable to tax under Case I of Schedule D. The BRSS will come into operation from early September.  Under the scheme, a qualifying business will be able to claim a cash payment calculated as three times the sum of 10% of their average weekly turnover up to &euro;20,000 and 5% on any excess of average weekly turnover above &euro;20,000, subject to a maximum payment under the scheme of &euro;15,000.</p>  <p>  Companies and self-employed individuals may be entitled to support under other measures put in place by Government, including the COVID Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) and the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS). Businesses may also be eligible to warehouse VAT and PAYE (Employer) debts and also excess payments received by employers under the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme, and the balance of Income Tax for 2019 and Preliminary Tax for 2020 for self-assessed taxpayers if applicable.</p>  <p>  The Government will continue to assess the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on the economy and I will continue to work with my Ministerial colleagues to ensure that appropriate supports are in place to mitigate these effects.</p></reply>

Having said that, the Deputy will appreciate that, neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, have powers around pricing or provision of insurance cover. These are commercial matters for insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept and the need to make adequate provisioning to meet these risks. This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive).</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding these constraints, insurance reform is high on the Government&rsquo;s agenda as evidenced by the Action Plan for Insurance Reform. The Action Plan sets out 66 actions which aim to bring down costs for consumers and business; introduce more competition into the market; prevent fraud and reduce the burden that insurance costs can have on business, community and voluntary organisations.</p>  <p>  I would like to note that significant progress have been made in this regard. Achievement to date includes:</p>  <p>  - The adoption of new Personal Injuries Guidelines by the Judicial Council; and </p>  <p>  - The creation of an Office to Promote Competition in the Insurance Market within the Department of Finance.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will know, the new Personal Injuries Guidelines came into effect on 24 April. The Guidelines materially reduce award levels for many categories of common injuries, particularly those of soft tissue. As awards have been reduced, we now expect that insurance premiums should also be reduced. This is a logical consequence and it is also the commitment that the industry has made.</p>  <p>  Another key achievement of the reform agenda is the new Office to Promote Competition in the Insurance Market. Since its establishment, the Office has held meetings with wide range of stakeholders including insurance companies, representative bodies, civil society groups and other state regulators on the issues surrounding competition. Minister of State Fleming chairs meetings of the Office which has met on a number of occasions since its establishment and will report on a regular basis to the Cabinet Sub-Group on its progress.</p>  <p>  In conclusion, securing a more sustainable and competitive market through deepening and widening the supply of insurance in Ireland remains a key policy priority for this Government. In this regard, it is my intention to continue to work with my Government colleagues to ensure the timely implementation of the Action Plan which will have a positive impact on the affordability and availability of insurance for individuals, businesses, community and voluntary groups across Ireland.</p></reply>

I would also note that the primary purpose of the measure is to improve the robustness of the international corporate tax system as a whole by preventing base-erosion and profit shifting through the use of excessive interest expenses. Therefore, while it is expected that the measure will generate some yield, a measure of its success will also be the prevention of BEPS activities rather than the raising of Exchequer revenue.</p>  <p>  A number of other factors set out below also give rise to difficulty in estimating a yield.</p>  <p>  First, the ILR is a generic, fixed ratio-based limit on current year interest deductibility, without general or targeted anti-avoidance rules. By contrast, Ireland&rsquo;s existing comprehensive set of rules on borrowings and interest deductibility have evolved over time to combat abusive practices and provide strong protection to the Exchequer. For this reason I have decided to largely retain our underlying interest rules and introduce the ILR as an additional measure, which is designed to work with the continuing protections afforded by existing domestic legislation.</p>  <p>  In addition, our transfer pricing legislation ensures that tax relief is only available for an arm&rsquo;s length amount of interest. The &ldquo;arm&rsquo;s length principle&rdquo; is an internationally agreed standard that requires related party transactions to be priced as if they were carried out by unrelated parties dealing at arm&rsquo;s length. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, while our existing interest rules permanently disallow non-qualifying interest, the ILR permits the deferral of excessive interest charges, so that amounts disallowed in one year may qualify as a deduction in a later year, subject to conditions. </p>  <p>  Finally, Ireland&rsquo;s long-standing general anti-avoidance rule ensures that Revenue is empowered to counteract tax avoidance in Ireland that is not caught by a specific anti-avoidance provision.</p>  <p>  Having regard to the measure's objective of preventing excess interest charges, and taking into account the protections afforded by pre-existing domestic legislation, the ILR carry-forward provisions and the fact that drafting of the ILR legislation is still ongoing, it is not possible at this time to predict a specific yield from the ILR.</p></reply>

It provides a flat-rate subsidy to qualifying employers based on the numbers of paid and eligible employees on the employer&rsquo;s payroll and charges a reduced rate of employer PRSI of 0.5% on wages paid which are eligible for the subsidy payment.</p>  <p>  The objective of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) is to support  employment and maintain the link between the employer and employee insofar as is possible.

It is therefore appropriate that key business supports should remain in place until the end of December 2021.</p>  <p>  As the revised plan is implemented, the EWSS will play an important role in getting people back to work as public health restrictions are eased, thereby reducing the numbers dependent on social welfare payments over time, including the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP).</p>  <p>  For Q3 2021, the Government has decided to broadly maintain the status quo for EWSS, including the enhanced rates of support, with a modification to widen eligibility, and maintaining the reduced rate of Employers&rsquo; PRSI of 0.5%.</p>  <p>  While the Government has agreed that the EWSS should be extended to end Q4 2021, it is too early as yet to prescribe the precise operational parameters of the scheme that should apply for that quarter.  Decisions in that regard will be taken closer to the time, possibly around the end of August/early September, with the benefit of more up-to-date information on a number of variables, including the overall epidemiological situation, progress made in reopening all sectors of the economy, the vaccine efficacy, as well as the operation of the EWSS during the early parts of Q3.</p>  <p>  Similarly, no decisions have been taken in relation to future of the scheme beyond the end of Q4, 2021.</p>  <p>  It is important that, as the recovery gains further momentum, supports are further recalibrated in the longer-term interests of businesses that are in receipt of those supports and in the interests of the wider body of taxpayers. As such, and as already signalled, for Q4, consideration will be given to a future change to EWSS which will require an employer contribution towards employee wages. The precise manner in which such a change might be implemented is a matter to be considered.</p>  <p>  Finally, for those businesses who may need additional support during this period, I would draw attention to the comprehensive package of other business and employer supports that have been made available since the July Stimulus Plan and Budget 2021 - including the Covid Restriction Support Scheme (CRSS) which has been extended, the Credit Guarantee Scheme, the SBCI Working Capital Scheme, Sustaining Enterprise Fund, and the Covid-19 Business Loans Scheme. I also announced on 1st June a new additional business support scheme (Business Resumption Support Scheme or BRSS) for businesses with reduced turnover as a result of public health restrictions to be implemented in September 2021.</p>  <p>  The Government remains fully committed to supporting businesses and employers insofar as is possible at this time.</p></reply>

For the purposes of the HTB scheme, a tax year is considered January to December of the relevant year. Where an applicant has only paid Income Tax for part of a tax year (e.g. if only worked August to December), the applicant may still choose that year as a relevant tax year for the purposes of the HTB scheme, and any Income Tax / DIRT paid during that year will be included in the HTB refund calculations, subject to the limits outlined in legislation.</p>  <p>  The Revenue Tax and Duty Manual Part 15-01-46, available at www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/tdm/income-tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax/part-15/15-01-46.pdf, outlines further guidance on the conditions and operation of the Help to Buy scheme including details of how the payment is calculated.</p>  <p>  The refund period covering the previous four tax years as set out in the HTB legislation is linked to the general time limits on repayments of tax that are contained in section 865 TCA 1997. This section provides that claims for repayment of tax will not be allowed unless the claim is made within four years of the end of the period to which the claim relates. </p>  <p>  However, the Deputy may wish to be aware that, as regards the negative impact of Covid-19 related restrictions on employment and the ability to qualify for HTB, Revenue have advised that where an underpayment of tax arises for the year 2020 as a result of amounts received under the TWSS or PUP, Revenue will allow a claim for HTB relief for the amount of income tax paid for 2020 and will not require the outstanding tax liability to be paid in advance where the underpayment of tax is due to be collected from 2022 by reducing the claimant&rsquo;s tax credits. This will only apply where all other conditions of the HTB scheme are satisfied.</p>  <p>  The future of the HTB scheme beyond its current sunset date of 31 December 2021 is a matter that will fall to be considered in the context of Budget 2022 and the subsequent Finance Bill.</p></reply>

I am also aware of reports of some customers experiencing issues in obtaining mortgage protection cover as a result of having higher risk conditions particularly in the context of COVID-19, however this usually relates to certain chronic conditions.   </p>  <p>  With regard to insurance, it should be noted that neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can intervene in the provision or pricing of insurance products or have the power to direct insurance companies to provide cover to specific individuals or businesses. This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive). Consequently, I am not in a position to direct companies as to what terms and conditions apply in relation to cover.  </p>  <p>  However, I have asked my officials to examine this and to engage with Insurance Ireland, the representative body for the insurance industry in this country, so as to assess the extent of the issue in Ireland for cancer survivors, and if it has become more prevalent in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. In doing this work, they will also assess the legislative measures taken in the jurisdictions mentioned, including their application and scope. My officials will also monitor any relevant developments at the EU level as part of their work on this issue, and in this context, I understand that the European Commission published a Plan, &ldquo;Europe&rsquo;s Beating Cancer Plan&rdquo;, last February, which includes an initiative for 2021-2023 to &ldquo;Address fair access for cancer survivors to financial services (including insurance), via a code of conduct and a reflection on long-term solutions&rdquo;.  </p>  <p>  On the issue of access to mortgage protection cover, Insurance Ireland has indicated that while most customers are still able to get life; critical illness; or mortgage protection insurance, it is aware of a small number of individual cases where a final decision on some applications is being postponed for a period where applicants have a COVID-19-related health condition. However, it stated that while unaware of any cases where life cover has been denied, such policies are assessed on a case-by-case basis and that underlying health conditions are taken into account by the underwriters, as was the case pre-COVID-19. </p>  <p>  Separately, my officials recently engaged on the issue of mortgage protection insurance with the Banking and Payments Federation Ireland (BPFI). From correspondence received, the BPFI has indicated that only 0.05% of mortgage applications approved by its members did not proceed to draw-down due to a lack of mortgage protection insurance. Moreover, it is my understanding that under Section 126 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995, lenders can provide a mortgage in situations where a borrower may be unable to obtain mortgage protection insurance, or where such insurance is unduly costly compared to that payable by borrowers generally. </p>  <p>  Where a consumer feels that they are being treated unfairly, they have the option of making a complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO). The FSPO is a statutory official who acts as an independent arbiter of disputes which consumers may have with their insurance company or other financial service provider. The FSPO can be contacted either by email at info@fspo.ie or by telephone at 01-567-7000.</p>  <p>  Finally, it is also worth noting that Insurance Ireland operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in obtaining insurance, and it can be accessed at feedback@insuranceireland.eu.</p></reply>

This is the latest data available. I expect the cost for 2019 should be available later in the year.</p><p>The annual cost of the Special Assignee Relief Programme (SARP) for 2012 to 2018 (the most recent year for which data are available) is as follows: <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th>&euro;m</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2012</td>       <td>0.1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2013</td>       <td>1.9</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2014</td>       <td>5.9</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2015</td>       <td>9.5</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016</td>       <td>18.1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017</td>       <td>28.1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018 </td>       <td>42.4</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>It is not possible to estimate with any degree of reliability the likely savings that would accrue to the Exchequer in 2021 or in the years beyond that if the SARP were abolished. The reason for this is that there are currently no data available that would enable such a calculation to be made. The Deputy will be aware that in Finance Bill 2018 I re-imposed an upper salary ceiling of &euro;1 million on the relief with effect from 1 January 2019 for new entrants and for existing beneficiaries of the programme from 1 January 2020. Such data as are available within the system relate to years before 2019 (no cap existed between 2015 and 2019). It would therefore be necessary to assess the cost-saving impact of this cap as well as taking account of the evolution in the take up of the relief during the current year in order to estimate the savings that might arise in 2021 from the abolition of the programme.</p><p>Finally, it should also be kept in mind that any estimation exercise of the type mentioned by the Deputy might also need to take into account changes in behaviour, including the loss of income tax from SARP-related jobs that may no longer arise, and the economic benefit provided by the relief.</p></reply>

In the NACE system, dog breeding or dog selling are not separately categorised. In addition, these types of operations are often part of wider economic activities undertaken by taxpayers and it is therefore not possible for Revenue to identify or report on the registrations specifically by dog breeding.</p></reply>

However, I can assure him that Ireland has a clear and transparent statutory corporation tax regime that applies to all companies equally and raises billions in revenue each year. Taxable trading income is taxed at 12.5% in Ireland, one of the most competitive headline rates of corporation tax in the OECD. This rate is applied to a broad base &ndash; a policy which is endorsed by the likes of the OECD because it is good for economic growth. In many countries, a high statutory rate is mitigated by its application to a relatively narrow base, so producing a lower effective rate. By contrast, Ireland&rsquo;s effective tax rate of between 10% and 11% is close to the 12.5% headline rate and the difference relates to a small number of targeted tax measures provided for in legislation.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, Revenue has no authority to depart from or supersede the law. Revenue&rsquo;s Tax and Duty Manual Parts 37-00-00a and 37-00-40 outline the procedures to be followed where taxpayers are seeking Revenue&rsquo;s advance confirmation as to how a transaction will be treated for tax purposes, based on the relevant legislation. As Revenue publishes detailed guidance, opinions should only be required in relatively limited circumstances. Nevertheless, any opinions given by Revenue are not legally binding and it is open to Revenue officials to review the position when a transaction is completed and all the facts are known.  </p>  <p>  Finally, Revenue analysis shows that foreign-owned multinationals were responsible for &euro;9.7 billion (82%) of net corporation tax receipts in 2020 and Irish-owned multinationals accounted for &euro;0.8 billion (7%) of net corporation tax receipts. Non-multinationals paid &euro;1.3 billion or 11%. Revenue analysis of 2019 tax returns also show that foreign-owned multinationals accounted for over 2.4 million employments in companies with combined income tax, USC and PRSI payments for these employees of &euro;21.5 billion. Foreign multinationals account for 32% of employment and 49% of employment taxes. In 2019, Revenue calculated the average effective tax rate for all companies as 10.3% while for foreign owned multinationals it was 11.1%.</p></reply>

The Living Wage has no legislative basis and is therefore not a statutory entitlement. It currently stands at &euro;12.30 per hour according to the Living Wage Technical Group document 2020.</p>  <p>  The National Minimum Wage is a statutory entitlement and has a legislative basis. The Low Pay Commission annually assesses the appropriate level of the National Minimum Wage. The current national minimum hourly rate of pay, since 1 January 2021, is &euro;10.20 per hour, as set out in the National Minimum WageOrder (No. 2) 2020.</p>  <p>  The suggested Living Wage at &euro;12.30 per hour based on the Civil Service 37 hour standard net working week equates to an annual salary of &euro;23,747.</p>  <p>  Detailed data on civil service staff indicates that only some 0.2% of staff (FTE) in the civil service are on salary points less than &euro;23,747. Further to this, all civil servants are paid at rates above the minimum wage of &euro;10.20 per hour.</p>  <p>  Those currently on an annual salary of less than &euro;23,747 may be receiving remuneration in excess of the suggested living wage through additional premium payments in respect of shift or atypical working hours or are on salary scales that progress to the suggested living wage and above through incremental progression. </p>  <p>  Building Momentum - A New Public Service Agreement 2021-2022 provides for a general round increase in annualised basic salary for all public servants of 1% or &euro;500 (whichever is greater) on both 1 October 2021 and 2022, as well as the equivalent of a 1% increase in annualised basic salaries to be used as a Sectoral Bargaining Fund (in accordance with Chapter 2 of the Agreement) on 1 February 2022. The Agreement is heavily weighted towards those at lower incomes with headline increases of approximately 5% for the lowest paid public servants. These groups will also benefit more from other measures in the Agreement including the overtime rates and premia payment adjustments. By the end of the Agreement, the annualised pay increases will almost eliminate the cohort of civil servants earning less than the suggested living wage.</p>  <p>  More broadly, the Low Pay Commission has, on request of the Government, formally begun work on examining how Ireland could move towards a Living Wage. The study will examine the design of a living wage in an Irish context and consider the policy, social and economic implications. It is expected that the report will be completed in the second half of 2021.</p></reply>

On receipt of these documents, and based on further communication with the responsible Department, which is the Approving Authority for the project, some further clarifications and material to underpin the review were sought.</p>  <p>  These clarifications and updated documents were received from the Approving Authority on 11 June 2021. My Department is now prioritising the technical review of these Business Case documents and will conclude its technical review shortly. These typically can take 4-6 weeks depending on the complexity of the project, and my Department is handling this matter as expeditiously as is possible.</p>  <p>  It must be noted that the technical review conducted by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform focuses on the robustness of the appraisal and whether the analysis supports the conclusions drawn and is neutral from a policy perspective. It does not convey approval or permission. For a project of this nature, with exchequer funding expected to be in excess of &euro;100 million, the Government is the Approving Authority for the next stage in the project lifecycle. The responsible Department is the day-to-day approving authority and funder for the project. It is their responsibility to seek approvals and ensure compliance with the requirements of the Public Spending Code.</p>  <p>  As part of the technical review, my Department will not have verified input data or the calculations included in the analysis. My Department will not have verified the forecast cost or delivery schedule for the proposal. The day-to-day Approving Authority must be satisfied that the appraisal adequately accounts for the range of risks that may have an impact on delivery and cost. It should ensure that the forecasts are informed by past experience on completed projects and outturn data on earlier investments, for instance using practices such as reference class forecasting or benchmarking.</p></reply>

Unlike the National Minimum Wage, the Living Wage has no legislative basis and is therefore not a statutory entitlement. The Low Pay Commission annually assesses the appropriate level of the National Minimum Wage, and the current national minimum hourly rate of pay, since 1 January 2021, is &euro;10.20 per hour, as set out in the National Minimum Wage Order (No. 2) 2020.</p><p>The suggested Living Wage at &euro;12.30 per hour based on the Civil Service 37 hour standard net working week equates to an annual salary of &euro;23,747.  Detailed data on Civil Service staff indicates that only some 0.2% of staff (FTE) in the Civil Service are on salary points less than &euro;23,747. Further to this, all civil servants are paid at rates above the minimum wage of &euro;10.20 per hour.</p><p>Those currently on an annual salary of less than &euro;23,747 may be receiving remuneration in excess of the suggested Living Wage through additional premium payments in respect of shift or atypical working hours or are on salary scales that progress to the suggested Living Wage and above through incremental progression. </p><p>Building Momentum - A New Public Service Agreement 2021-2022 provides for a general round increase in annualised basic salary for all public servants of 1% or &euro;500 (whichever is greater) on both 1 October 2021 and 2022, as well as the equivalent of a 1% increase in annualised basic salaries to be used as a Sectoral Bargaining Fund (in accordance with Chapter 2 of the Agreement) on 1 February 2022. The Agreement is heavily weighted towards those at lower incomes with headline increases of approximately 5% for the lowest paid public servants. These groups will also benefit more from other measures in the Agreement including the overtime rates and premium payment adjustments.

The Programme for Government has a commitment to &ldquo;Support Creative Ireland in engaging the public on climate change through the creative and cultural sectors initiative&rdquo;. To date, the Creative Ireland Programme has engaged with representatives across the creative, cultural, climate and public sector to help identify the potential of creative and cultural public engagement to contribute to climate action.</p>  <p>  In March 2021 my Department, in collaboration with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, launched the Creative Climate Action fund to create partnerships that connect the public sector and the creative sector in order to enhance public engagement with climate change. This is a current rather than a capital-funded competitive scheme. It is seeking creative and cultural projects that can meaningfully connect people with the profound changes that are happening in our environment, society and economy arising from climate change, and can transform that connection into behaviour change or climate action.</p>  <p>  Applications were invited under Strand 1 - An open call to organisations, NGOs, charities, enterprises, institutions and collectives/networks working with creative and cultural practitioners, and  Strand 2 - A closed call to local authorities, either individually, with other local authorities or external partners. </p>  <p>  The deadline has now closed for applications and further details will be available once the successful projects are announced.</p></reply>

Applications may be made via the MEBAS application portal on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  I have also made an allocation of &euro;5 million  available to local authorities for live performances in summer 2021 to animate town centres, should public health considerations permit.  This will allow for the procurement by local authorities of performances by local performers. This funding will be allocated shortly.</p>  <p>  &euro;5 million will also be made available for a scheme of capital supports for the commercial live entertainment sector.</p>  <p>  Up to &euro;1 million was allocated to the St Patrick's Festival 2021 for programming and it has supported over 3,500 days of employment for performers, producers, artists, technicians, creatives and support staff. With gatherings still restricted, SPF 2021 curated a rich and dynamic programme of events involving hundreds of artists, musicians, performers, creators, and community organisations which was broadcast on the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Festival TV online channel marking the national day.</p>  <p>  In addition, as part of the National Economic Recovery Plan I have secured an additional &euro;11.5m for a new Events Sector Covid Support Scheme which I hope to launch soon. This scheme will target SMEs in the events sector which aren&rsquo;t eligible for the CRSS and for whom MEBAS and the Small Business Assistance Scheme for COVID-19 will not make a significant contribution to fixed costs relative to the level of support that would be available under CRSS, had such SMEs been eligible for that support.</p></reply>

I announced today that antigen testing will be deployed for the forthcoming concert event at IMMA on 3 July. 3,500 fans will be in attendance, 500 of those will be health care workers; and some of Ireland's best talent will be performing on stage - talent we have all greatly missed seeing live this past year. The measures being employed will be reviewed for their appropriateness as pilot events proceed and will be adjusted as necessary and if necessary.</p></reply>

Under the Economic Recovery Plan, Government extended the period during which a range of horizontal and business supports will be available to enterprises and workers in all sectors of the economy, including the tourism sector. The relevant measures include:</p>  <p>  - Extending the COVID Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS). Revisions will see payments for businesses reopening of up to &euro;30,000;</p>  <p>  - Extending the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme to 31 December;</p>  <p>  - Extending the Commercial Rates Waiver to end-September 2021;</p>  <p>  - Broadening of eligibility criteria for the Small Business Assistance Scheme for COVID-19, which opens the scheme up to businesses in non-rated premises; and</p>  <p>  - The ERP sets out the intention to introduce a new, additional and more streamlined business support scheme in September 2021, called the Business Resumption Support Scheme.</p>  <p>  In addition to benefiting from revised and extended horizontal supports, the Economic Recovery Plan also provides for an extension of the 9% VAT rate to September 2022, which will continue to act as a stimulus for the tourism sector as it moves towards recovery.</p>  <p>  These measures and supports will provide tourism businesses with much-needed clarity that will enable them to plan longer-term with confidence and accept bookings. The ERP also commits to continuing to provide business continuity schemes through F&aacute;ilte Ireland.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, F&aacute;ilte Ireland ran an Ireland Based Inbound Agents Business Continuity Scheme of &euro;10m in the final quarter of 2020. Taking into account the new and revised horizontal supports set out in the ERP, I have asked F&aacute;ilte Ireland to examine what supports will be needed for the tourism sector in the coming months. I will discuss these proposed supports with colleagues across Government to ensure that the tourism sector is supported in their recovery as we reopen our society and our economy.</p></reply>

I am aware however, that a number of National Governing Bodies of Sport have schemes in place to support their club networks in relation to cardiac care, screening and defibrillator training. The GAA&rsquo;s Community Heart Programme, the FAI&rsquo;s Heart Care Programme and the IRFU&rsquo;s Safe Rugby programme are excellent examples of proactive supports to assist clubs and members to participate safely in sport. At a local level, the network of Local Sports Partnerships throughout the country deliver education and training opportunities across a broad range of areas to local sports clubs and community groups. This includes First Aid Workshops, which typically cover CPR and/or Defibrillator Training as part of the content. Defibrillators situated at sports clubs are generally also for community use and funding is also available through the HSE&rsquo;s National Lottery grants schemes and other Community grants schemes.</p>  <p>  In relation to my Department, the Sports Capital and Equipment Programme is the primary vehicle for Government support for the development of sports and physical recreation facilities and the purchase of non-personal sports equipment throughout the country.  Grants are available for a wide variety of capital works and non-personal sports equipment including first aid kits and defibrillators.</p>  <p>  While the 2020 round of the Programme closed in March of this year, there is a commitment in the Programme for Government to continue the programme. A decision on the timing of the next round of the Programme will be taken once the grants under this current round are finalised.</p>  <p>  Any organisation that has not already registered with the Department and wishes to apply for funding in the future must first register on www.sportscapitalprogramme.ie.  Organisations must have a tax registration number from the Revenue Commissioners if they wish to register.</p></reply>

It has also triggered discussions around re-imagining our cities and towns as better places to live, work and visit and bodies across Government and local government have been responding to this promptly and thoroughly. It is clear that appropriate artistic, cultural, public realm animation and tourism/hospitality interventions have a key role to play in reinvigorating city and town centres and attracting people back into urban areas. Officials of my Department have participated in collaborative, cross-organisational consideration of the challenges faced and steps being taken in relation to cities and urban areas in the period ahead arising from the COVID pandemic.</p>  <p>  With specific regard to tourism capital supports, F&aacute;ilte Ireland has launched two schemes in particular aimed at supporting and enhancing the tourism experience in cities and towns.  One is the Urban Animation Capital Investment Scheme - a pilot Capital Grants Scheme for Local Authorities aimed at supporting sustainable tourism development through public realm and urban animation projects that have the potential to transform and re-imagine urban centres for visitors and communities. The other is the Outdoor Dining Enhancement Scheme, which comprises two parts being delivered in partnership between F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Local Authorities across the country. The Scheme provides capital funding to individual tourism and hospitality businesses to help them develop or increase their own outdoor seating capacity and is being administered and evaluated directly by each Local Authority. Under the other part of the Scheme, funding is allocated directly to local authorities to enable them to develop permanent outdoor public dining spaces in towns and urban centres, similar to?those that exist in various European cities.</p>  <p>  On the Arts and Culture side, my Department is also making funding available to local authorities to improve public spaces for cultural and events activity under the Outdoor Public Space Scheme, which I launched on 11 February 2021. The scheme provides up to &euro;250,000 for each of the 31 local authorities to adapt, equip or otherwise improve public spaces for cultural and events activities, taking account of public health guidelines and the needs of local arts and entertainment communities. The intention is to support flexible, innovative proposals that facilitate year-round use of public spaces in a way that supports the recovery of the creative, cultural, entertainment and events sectors and is future-proofed from a health and safety perspective. Projects should aim to deliver speedy results or actions with added benefits for tourism and the hospitality sector and should also demonstrate how they will support the Night-Time Economy. I have also made &euro;5 million in funding available to local authorities for live performances in summer 2021 to animate town centres, should public health considerations permit.</p>  <p>  My Department also has a number of advisory groups in place to inform development of policy and initiatives, including the Arts and Culture Recovery Taskforce, Night-time Economy Taskforce and Tourism Recovery Taskforce.</p>  <p>   As we collectively pave the way for a sustainable recovery from the pandemic on life, society and the economy, there is now cause for optimism as the roll-out of vaccinations gathers pace. My Department will play its part in bringing life and vibrancy back to city and town centres.</p></reply>

The Government will shortly make further decisions which should allow for the continued phased reopening of the music and entertainment sectors for the critical summer season, as the public health situation permits  </p>  <p>  The Government has responded to the challenges facing the arts, and culture sector through a range of measures. Significant additional funding was announced in Budget 2021, with &euro;130 million allocated to the Arts Council for 2021 and &euro;50 million for supports for life performance. The supports in 2020 and again in 2021 included provision for extensive online content to be generated. Supports have also been provided to those impacted in the arts, culture, performance and events sector through the pandemic unemployment scheme and various wage subsidy schemes. My Department also continues to expand the delivery of the Creative Ireland programme.</p>  <p>  In 2021, I allocated &euro;50 million for a suite of measures to assist the live performance sector aimed at supporting employment and well-being opportunities across all genres and the continued production of high quality artistic output for the public. Included in this package are the following measures:</p>  <p>  - I recently announced 237 grant allocations under the 2021 Live Performance Support Scheme amounting to &euro;25m. </p>  <p>  - An allocation of &euro;14m has been made available for the Music and Entertainment Business Assistance Scheme (MEBAS) to make a contribution to the overheads of businesses, specifically musicians and related crew, that have been negatively affected by COVID-19 and that do not qualify for other business supports.  This Scheme is a demand led scheme and is accepting applications at present. </p>  <p>  - An allocation of &euro;5 million has been made available to local authorities for live performances in summer 2021 to animate town centres, should public health considerations permit. </p>  <p>  - Up to &euro;1 million was allocated to the St Patrick's Festival 2021 for programming and it supported over 3,500 days of employment for performers, producers, artists, technicians, creatives and support staff.</p>  <p>  A new &euro;11.5m new fund for the entertainment industry, including festivals, conferencing and large events has been agreed between myself and the T&aacute;naiste Leo Varadkar. This Events Sector Covid Support Scheme (ESCSS) will support SMEs that are not eligible for the CRSS.</p>  <p>  I am providing funding to local authorities in support of local creative and cultural activity under the Creative Communities Strand of the Creative Ireland Programme. The Creative Ireland Programme is a culture-based programme to promote individual, community and national well-being. Its core proposition is that participation in arts, cultural and heritage-based activities drives personal and collective creativity, with significant implications for individual and societal wellbeing and achievement. Under the Creative Communities initiative in the Creative Ireland Programme, my Department and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage provide funding to Kildare and to the other 30 local authorities to implement their individual Culture and Creativity Strategies 2018-2022.  </p>  <p>  In County Kildare, the Culture and Creativity Team is made up of local authority-defined positions including the Librarian, Arts Officer, Heritage Officer, Irish Language Officer and Climate Action Officer along with economic development staff. To support the implementation of their Culture and Creativity Strategy, Kildare County Council has been allocated funding on an annual to implement their Strategy. This includes access to targeted funding streams to facilitate engagement in creative ways to address societal issues such as those related to climate action, positive ageing and health and well-being. For example in 2021, Kildare County Council successfully applied for additional funding of &euro;26,810 under the Creativity in Older Age scheme for an initiative that supports positive ageing groups in communities in Kildare to explore, discuss and question artworks from the Kildare County Council Municipal Art Collection.</p>  <p>  Funding for local authorities for commemorative events under the Decade of Centenaries can be applied to appropriate cultural events under the creative imagination strand.</p></reply>

These include inter alia:</p><p>- A &euro;55m support fund for strategic tourism businesses;</p><p>- &euro;50m support for live entertainment - a range of supports for live entertainment events to take place in 2021 in venues across the country, other measures to support music, and a new grant scheme for equipment;</p><p>- A separate &euro;11.5m  Events Sector Covid Support Scheme; </p><p>- &euro;130m for the Arts Council &ndash; a record level;</p><p>- Measures to support the Gaeltacht Summer college sector;</p><p>- Increased funding for sporting bodies of &euro;88.5m provided last year, with Sport Ireland in ongoing communication with NGBs to assess financial needs for 2021.  </p><p>The Government&rsquo;s recently announced Economic Recovery Plan sets out a framework for recovery as we emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic, and pays particular attention to sectors most impacted, such as tourism and hospitality, live events and the arts. The Economic Recovery Plan responds to the commitments made in the Programme for Government in charting a path to recovery from the challenge of COVID-19.</p><p>Under the Economic Recovery Plan, Government extended the period during which a range of horizontal and business supports will be available to enterprises and workers in all sectors of the economy, including Tourism, Arts and Culture, Sport, Media and those working in Gaeltacht communities. Key measures include:</p><p>- Extending the COVID Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS); </p><p>- Extending the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme to 31 December;</p><p>- Extending the Pandemic Unemployment Payment beyond 30 June 2021;</p><p>- Extending the Commercial Rates Waiver to end-September 2021;</p><p>- Extending the 9% VAT rate for hospitality to September 2022; </p><p>- Broadening of eligibility criteria for the Small Business Assistance Scheme for COVID-19, which opens the scheme up to businesses in non-rated premises; and</p><p>- A new, additional and more streamlined business support scheme to be introduced in September 2021, called the Business Resumption Support Scheme.</p><p>In addition, the T&aacute;naiste Leo Varadkar and I have also agreed to deliver a separate &euro;11.5m new fund for the entertainment industry, including festivals, conferencing and large events. This Events Sector Covid Support Scheme will support SMEs that are not eligible for the CRSS.</p><p>I am also delighted that the Economic Recovery Plan includes a commitment for Government to prioritise a Basic Income guarantee pilot scheme for artists. This was a key recommendation of the Arts and Culture Recovery Taskforce, and I will bring forward a proposal following the report of the Arts and Culture Recovery Oversight Group in July.</p><p>I will continue to engage with stakeholders across my sectors to monitor the evolving situation and to work with my Government colleagues to support these sectors not just during this pandemic, but into the all important recovery phase which will follow it.</p></reply>

The relevant measures  include:</p>  <p>  - Extending the COVID Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS). Revisions will see payments for businesses reopening of up to &euro;30,000; </p>  <p>  - Extending the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme to 31 December;</p>  <p>  - Extending the Commercial Rates Waiver to end-September 2021;</p>  <p>  - Broadening of eligibility criteria for the Small Business Assistance Scheme for COVID-19, which opens the scheme up to businesses in non-rated premises; and</p>  <p>  - The ERP sets out the intention to introduce a new, additional and more streamlined business support scheme in September 2021, called the Business Resumption Support Scheme.</p>  <p>  In addition to benefiting from revised and extended horizontal supports, the Economic Recovery Plan also provides for an extension of the 9% VAT rate to September 2022, which will continue to act as a stimulus for the tourism sector as it moves towards recovery.</p>  <p>  These measures and supports will provide tourism businesses with much-needed clarity that will enable them to plan longer-term with confidence and accept bookings. The ERP also commits to continuing to provide business continuity schemes through F&aacute;ilte Ireland.</p>  <p>  Taking into account the new and revised horizontal supports set out in the ERP, I have asked F&aacute;ilte Ireland to examine what supports will be needed for the tourism sector in the coming months. I will discuss these proposed supports with colleagues across Government to ensure that the tourism and hospitality sector is supported in their recovery as we reopen our society and our economy. The Tourism Recovery Oversight Group, which I appointed last December to oversee the implementation of the Recovery Plan and monitor the recovery of the sector, will also continue to be a key input into my thinking with regard to further support for the tourism sector.</p></reply>

Sport Ireland has also developed a &lsquo;Coaching Girls programme for coaches of teenage girls. This workshop aims to reduce the high dropout rate of teenage girls from sport by upskilling and educating the coaches.</p>  <p>  Sport Ireland is also funding school-based initiatives as part of the &lsquo;Get Ireland Running&rsquo;, &lsquo;Get Ireland Swimming&rsquo; and &lsquo;Get Ireland Cycling&rsquo; programmes in line with the National Sport Policy commitment to prioritise these sports as they have the greatest potential for generating high levels of active participation across the life course.</p>  <p>  The European School Sports Day (ESSD) will take place on September 24th 2021.

The IPPEA have been invited to apply for funding supports and the application review process is currently underway. The IPPEA plan to grow the event from last year, reaching more students and schools. They have already held workshops with schools focusing on the sustainability of their activities following the ESSD. They also plan to continue with competitions for physical education equipment for schools, to drive further engagement.</p>  <p>  Sport Ireland and my Department, in collaboration with the educational authorities, will continue to support these and other initiatives to get young people more active in our schools and in our communities.</p></reply>

Following discussions with the County and City Managers Association, amounts of &euro;285,000 are now available to the Dublin local authorities and &euro;143,000 to all other local authorities to facilitate the programming of live performances over the summer months, animating town centres for local communities as public health considerations permit. Performances can be recorded or streamed if health restrictions prevent live events. Local authorities will be encouraged to engage events companies or curators to develop and deliver a programme of performances.</p>  <p>  I have also recently announced the allocations for the &euro;25m Live Performance Support Scheme (LPSS 2021).  I was delighted to be in a position to fund 237 successful applications under this scheme, the details of which are available on my Department&rsquo;s website.  There was a very high level of interest in this scheme, with over 400 applications requesting funding in excess of &euro;80 million. Given the available funding of &euro;25 million, difficult decisions had to be made and it was not be possible to award grants to everyone who applied.  All of the applications were assessed and scored and the allocations were based on the scores awarded.  The 237 grants awarded will help support employment and wellbeing opportunities across all genres and the continued production of high quality artistic output for the public.</p></reply>

Provision was made for &euro;2.5 million to be made available to local authorities in 2018, increasing to &euro;4.5 million in 2019 with corresponding inspection rate targets of 10% and 15% of tenancies respectively. This has enabled local authorities to build inspection capacity incrementally. Significant progress was made across the sector. The number of inspections more than doubled from 19,645 in 2017 to 40,728 in 2019. </p><p>The 2020 inspection rate target was 20% and &euro;6 million of Exchequer funding was made available to local authorities. An increased budget of &euro;10 million is being made available in 2021 to facilitate a targeted inspection rate of 25%.

Due to the quasi-judicial nature of work of the RTB, it would be inappropriate for me as Minister, or my Department to comment on, or to intervene in the specifics of any individual case.</p>  <p>  The Residential Tenancies Acts regulate the landlord-tenant relationship in the private rented sector and sets out the rights and obligations of landlords and tenants. Under section 16(a) of the Residential Tenancies Acts tenants are obliged to pay rent. Section 34 of the Acts sets out clearly defined grounds for termination of a tenancy, one of which is the tenant has failed to comply with the obligation to pay rent under the tenancy. </p>  <p>  Where a tenancy is to be terminated on grounds of rent arrears, enhanced protections and procedures apply for tenants and landlords under Part 3 (Residential Tenancies) of the Planning and Development, and Residential Tenancies, Act 2020 (the PDRTA).  The PDRTA provides for temporary modifications to the operation of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 to provide, subject to certain conditions, that during the period from 11 January to 12 July 2021 a 90 day (rather than the usual 28 days) termination notice period applies, where a tenant is in rent arrears due to Covid-19 and is at risk of losing their tenancy. The earliest termination date allowed in such circumstances is 13 July 2021. Rent increases are also prohibited for relevant tenancies until 13 July 2021.</p>  <p>  The protections under the PDRTA do not apply to a tenant who owed an amount of rent equal to 5 or more months&rsquo; rent on 10 January 2021 or builds rent arrears to such an amount.  The PDRTA provides for a number of scenarios, set out at the weblink below - in which a landlord can make a declaration to the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) and to the tenant with the effect that the PDRTA protections cease to apply in respect of the tenant - https://www.rtb.ie/emergency-measures-ended-new-protections-introduced-for-the-rental-sector/latest-rent-arrears-procedures-requirements-and-protections. </p>  <p>  The Government has recently published the Residential Tenancies (No. 2) Bill 2021, which includes the extension of the targeted protections of the PDRTA until 12 January 2022, to afford more time to the most vulnerable tenants to recover their financial stability.</p>  <p>  The Residential Tenancies Board displays comprehensive information on its website - www.rtb.ie - including guidance and frequently asked questions documents relating to terminating tenancies during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p></reply>

The Programme commits to putting affordability at the heart of the housing system through the progression of State-backed affordable housing.  </p><p>This commitment is reflected in Budget 2021, which provides for an overall investment of &euro;3.3 billion for the delivery of housing programmes.  This represents an increase of &euro;641m or 24% on 2020 and the single biggest spend on housing by any Government to fund the largest build programme, in the history of the State.  </p><p>Importantly, &euro;110 million of this amount will be provided to deliver a new national Affordable Purchase Shared Equity Scheme for first time buyers and a new funding model to accelerate the delivery of cost rental homes through the Approved Housing Body sector. </p><p>&euro;75 million is allocated for the Affordable Purchase Shared Equity Scheme, aimed at first-time buyers buying new-build homes on private land. It will enable first-time buyers to buy a new home at a price they can afford, much sooner than would otherwise have been the case. The equity stake will fill the gap between the mortgage people can get, and the price of a new home. In so doing, it will build confidence in the construction sector to increase housing supply. The proposed price caps for the equity scheme are reflective of the median price of a new home bought by first-time buyers, and are targeted to address the affordability gap in different areas.  It is anticipated that the Scheme will be supported and operated in partnership with the retail banks - depending on the final design, this will allow support for c.1,500 to 2,000 households to buy new homes in the first year.</p><p>The new Cost Rental Equity Loan (CREL) is the first dedicated funding stream for Cost Rental housing in Ireland. CREL will assist Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) in developing or acquiring new homes for Cost Rental, to accelerate implementation of this new housing sector in the immediate term. The scheme harnesses the expertise and capacity of AHBs, amply demonstrated in the provision of social housing, and builds a foundation for further AHB involvement in Cost Rental.</p><p>Under the CREL scheme, the Housing Agency will make loans available to AHBs on very favourable terms to cover up to 30% of the development or acquisition costs of new homes for Cost Rental. The Budget allocation of &euro;35 million is intended to assist the delivery and tenanting of c. 350 new homes this year, on top of the 50 new Cost Rental apartments scheduled for delivery later this year at Enniskerry Road, Stepaside.</p><p>To date, my Department has issued two broad-based Serviced Sites Fund (SSF) calls for proposals to local authorities. Funding of almost &euro;200 million has been approved in principle in support of 40 infrastructure projects in 14 local authority areas across 9 counties, to assist in the delivery of almost 4,200 affordable homes for purchase or for rent.</p><p>Details of 35 SSF projects which received approval in principle under the two SSF calls to date are available on the Rebuilding Ireland website as follows:</p><p>Call 1.</p><p>Call 2 .</p><p>In addition to these projects, approval in principle has also been given to five further applications for SSF funding, namely, Dublin City Council&rsquo;s projects in Emmet Road and Oscar Traynor Road, Fingal County Council&rsquo;s projects in Ballymastone, Donabate, and Hayestown, Rush and Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council&rsquo;s project in Shanganagh.</p><p>In making an application for SSF, each local authority must demonstrate that an affordability issue exists in the area in question and that it is viable to deliver homes, for purchase or rent, with a price reduction of at least 10% below open market values.</p><p>In addition, the Land Development Agency is tasked with working with Government Departments, Local Authorities, state agencies, and other stakeholders to assemble strategic sites in urban areas and ensure the sustainable development of social and affordable homes for rent and purchase. On its establishment, the LDA had access to an initial portfolio of 8 sites that have near term delivery potential for approximately 3,400 new homes. Whilst the tenure mix for these homes has not been finalised, the LDA will have regard to Government policy, and all appropriate legislation, in considering the appropriate tenure mix for developments on public land, as well as the criteria for the operation of cost rental and affordable housing schemes. All these measures are designed to increase housing supply at a time when needed most. </p><p>Finally, the Government has also approved the drafting of amending provisions to Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, for inclusion in the Affordable Housing Bill 2021 as Committee Stage amendments. This will see an increase in the current 10% social housing requirement related to all new housing developments to a mandatory 20% for social and affordable requirements. </p><p>Finally, the Government&rsquo;s upcoming Housing strategy &lsquo;Housing for All&rsquo; will detail an extensive range of measures and ambitious targets to underpin the delivery of affordable housing over the coming years.</p></reply>

It is not a compensation scheme and is very much a scheme of last resort for homeowners who have no other practical options of redress.</p>  <p>  The Defective Concrete Blocks Grant scheme was informed by the report of an Expert Panel which was published in 2017 which involved extensive research, investigations and analysis.  Any consideration of extension to the Defective Concrete Blocks Grants Scheme would, in the first instance, require the relevant local authority to conduct the same rigorous analysis as that carried out in Donegal and Mayo. </p>  <p>  Such analysis would need to demonstrate that identified issues in Limerick were due to the presence of excessive amounts of deleterious materials (mica or pyrite) in the aggregate used to manufacture the concrete blocks. The relevant "I.S.465" protocol would need to be followed in this regard. The extent of the problem would also need to be quantified.  Pending the receipt of and consideration of such analysis it would be premature to consider an extension of the scheme. Similar to what is happening in other counties seeking admittance to the scheme, it is suggested that the local authority would lead on the rigorous analysis required in accordance with the I.S. 465 protocol and on the estimation of quantum and make the appropriate submission to my Department. Any extension of the scheme  would also have to be the subject of budgetary discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. </p>  <p>  Separately, my Department has recently extended the pyrite remediation scheme to include the administrative area of Limerick City and County Council, which will see homeowners of dwellings with significant damage attributable to pyritic heave in County Limerick eligible to apply for remediation works under the Pyrite Remediation Scheme.</p></reply>

One such programme, that AHBs progress construction projects through, is the Capital Advance Loan Facility (CALF). </p><p>CALF funding is capital support provided to AHBs by local authorities to facilitate the funding of construction, acquisition or refurbishment of new social housing units.  This loan facility can support up to 30% of the eligible capital cost of the housing project, with the housing units provided to local authorities for social housing use under long-term lease arrangements known as Payment and Availability Agreements. A nominal interest rate of 2% fixed per annum is charged by the local authority on the initial capital amount. Repayments on either the capital or interest are not required during the term of the loan (between 10 and 30 years), although where an AHB chooses to, repayments can be made during the term. At the end of the term, the outstanding capital amount plus the interest accrued, is owed and repayable to the local authority. The local authority issues the CALF monies to the AHB and the local authority, in turn, recoups same from my Department.  </p><p>My Department has provided funding through the CALF Scheme for 34 high-quality homes for social housing use at the location referred to. The project is being progressed by the AHB, Cooperative Housing Ireland, working in partnership with D&uacute;n Laoghaire/Rathdown County Council. I can confirm that my Department issued a CALF approval for this construction project in January 2019. The latest update on the project from D&uacute;n Laoghaire/Rathdown County Council is that the homes have an indicative site start date of Q2 2021 and an estimated completion date of Q3 2022. As with all construction projects in the current COVID 19 climate, delivery programmes and timelines are under constant review.</p><p>My Department publishes a quarterly Social Housing Construction Projects Status Report, which sets out the continuing progress being made in advancing the national local authority and AHB new-build pipeline.  The latest report, setting out the position at end Q1 2021, can be accessed at the following weblink:</p></reply>

To be eligible, tenants must meet certain criteria, including having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum and having been in receipt of social housing support for at least one year.</p>  <p>  The minimum reckonable income for eligibility under the scheme is determined by the relevant local authority in accordance with the detailed provisions of the Ministerial Direction issued under Sections 24(3) and (4) of the 2014 Act. In the determination of the minimum reckonable income, local authorities can include income from a number of different sources and classes, such as from employment, private pensions, maintenance payments and certain social welfare payments, including pensions, where the social welfare payment is secondary to employment income.  A housing authority shall disregard income that is once-off, temporary or short-term in nature and that is outside the regular pattern of a person&rsquo;s annual income, including the Rural Social Scheme.</p>  <p>  In determining reckonable income, the income of all tenants of the house, including adult children that are joint tenants, is included, as is the income of the spouse, civil partner or other partner / co-habitant of a tenant who lives in the house with them, thus ensuring the appropriate level of discount is applied to the purchase price. </p>  <p>  The minimum income criterion was introduced in order to ensuring the sustainability of the scheme.  Applicants must demonstrate that they have an income that is long-term and sustainable in nature. This ensures that the tenant purchasing the house is in a financial position, as the owner, to maintain and insure the property for the duration of the charged period, in compliance with the conditions of the order transferring the ownership of, and responsibility for, the house from the local authority to the tenant.</p>  <p>  A review of the first 12 months of the Scheme&rsquo;s operation has been undertaken. In addition, the Programme for Government commits to maintaining the right of social housing tenants to purchase their own home with some changes to eligibility. The review and the commitments in the Programme for Government are being examined as part of the work on the broader social housing reform agenda. I expect to be in a position to publish the review and finalise changes to the Scheme once the work on these reform measures is complete.</p></reply>

It does not address housing developments which rely on DPI which must necessarily be considered separately on a case by case basis.</p><p>In this regard a multi-annual  Waste Services DPI Resolution Programme was introduced in 2019 to facilitate the progressive resolution in a sustainable manner of the DPI element of water services in relevant estates with a view to supporting the taking-in-charge of the estates upon resolution.</p><p>Allocations for the first funding cycle covering the years 2019-2021 inclusive were announced in September 2020.  This first funding cycle focussed on estates in towns and villages where the resolution is to connect their water services to the public networks. The programme will also support a number of pilot projects where connection is not feasible in the immediate future. These pilot projects, together with a major study currently being undertaken by Irish Water, will inform future policy considerations on resolving sub-standard DPI with sustainable solutions.  </p><p>All local authorities that submitted bids were informed about the outcome of their bids in a circular which included a copy of an independent Expert Panel report on the bids process. The report provides the commentary of the Panel on their evaluation in the case of unsuccessful bids and guidance for the local authority in making future bids in upcoming programmes.

The relevant "I.S.465" protocol would need to be followed in this regard. The extent of the problem would also need to be quantified. </p>  <p>  I am establishing a time bound working group with representatives from my Department, the relevant local authorities and homeowner representative groups, to review and address any outstanding issues in relation to the operation of the scheme, including issues such as grant caps, homeowner contributions, engineering, allowable costs recoupment etc.   The recommendations of this working group will inform any potential changes or improvements to the scheme as may be required which I will bring forward to Government following collaboration with Ministerial colleagues and in particular the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Attorney General.</p></reply>

The full conditions for eligibility under the scheme are set out in the scheme which is available on the Board&rsquo;s website, www.pyriteboard.ie. </p>  <p>  The scheme is applicable to dwellings, which are subject to significant damage attributable to pyritic heave established, in accordance with I.S. 398-1:2017 - Reactive pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material &ndash; Part 1: Testing and categorisation protocol.  In this regard, it is a condition of eligibility under the scheme that an application to the Board must be accompanied by a Building Condition Assessment with a Damage Condition Rating of 2.  Dwellings which do not have a Damage Condition Rating of 2 are not eligible to apply under the scheme.  This ensures that, having regard to the available resources, the focus of the scheme is on dwellings which are most severely damaged by pyritic heave. There are no proposals to provide for further financial assistance outside of the scheme.</p>  <p>  Once a dwelling is included in the Scheme, the cost of testing, damage verification, professional services and remediation works are borne by the Scheme. A scheme participant may recoup the vouched cost of the Building Condition Assessment, subject to a maximum limit of &euro;500 (including VAT). This may be recouped from the Housing Agency once the dwelling is approved for inclusion in the Scheme.</p>  <p>  The vouched cost of the alternative accommodation, required for the dwelling occupants during the remediation works, can be recouped by the scheme participant. Recoupment of the vouched cost is subject to a monthly maximum limit of &euro;1,500 (including VAT) and an overall limit of &euro;4,500 (including VAT) per dwelling.</p>  <p>  The vouched costs in relation to the removal, storage and return of the furniture in the dwelling, equipment and effects can be recouped by the scheme participant, subject to a maximum limit of &euro;2,500 (including VAT) per dwelling.</p>  <p>  Where the scheme participant satisfies the Housing Agency in advance that suitable rental accommodation cannot be obtained for &euro;4,500 or less, the alternative accommodation and the removal and storage expenses may be combined, but are subject to an overall limit of &euro;7,000 (including VAT).</p>  <p>  The lastest figures indicate, in excess of 2,100 dwellings have been remediated. The average all in cost of remediation of dwellings under the Scheme ranges from &euro;65,000 to &euro;70,000 per dwelling.</p></reply>

The provision of central funding reinforces the capacity of my Department&rsquo;s Vacant Homes Unit to liaise with and seek information/statistics from a dedicated contact point within each local authority. The Vacant Homes Office plays a key role in the co-ordination of work to tackle vacancy within each local authority.</p></reply>

The capital funding to be provided in 2022 will be dependent on the progress made by local authorities on the development of additional family hubs.  </p>  <p>  In relation to the operational funding for family hubs, my Department does not fund any homeless services directly but contributes towards the overall expenditure incurred by housing authorities in the provision of homeless accommodation services.  Under the funding arrangements, housing authorities must provide at least 10% of the cost of services from their own resources and may also incur additional expenditure outside of the funding arrangements with my Department.  Therefore, the exact spend on homeless services, including on the operation of family hubs, is a matter for individual housing authorities, in consultation with the Management Group of each of the relevant regional joint Homeless Consultative Forums established in accordance with Chapter 6 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009.</p>  <p>  Financial reports from each of the regions, setting out total expenditure on homeless services, including on family hubs for 2020, are published at the following link https://www.gov.ie/en/collection/80ea8-homelessness-data/.  These financial reports show that housing authorities incurred expenditure of some &euro;25m on the operation of 35 family hubs in 2020.  The current funding to be provided in 2022 will depend on the scale of family hub provision at that time.</p></reply>

It extends the delivery of Housing First nationally, with the introduction of targets for each local authority.</p>  <p>  The Plan includes an overall target of 663 tenancies in the period 2018-2021. The implementation of the Plan is a joint initiative of my Department, the Department of Health, the HSE and the local authorities.  </p>  <p>  In line with the National Implementation Plan, Housing First is being delivered on a regional basis by the local authorities and the HSE. Contracts for the delivery of services have been put in place in each of the nine regions responsible for the delivery of homeless services with tenancies now in place in every region. At the end of March 2021, a total of 539 individuals were being housed under the Housing First programme including 438 individuals who have been housed since the publication of the National Implementation Plan. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to the further expansion of Housing First. Research is currently being undertaken by the Housing Agency to carry out an assessment of need for the supports provided by Housing First.  This will inform the expansion of the Programme which I expect to announce later this year, in advance of the expiration of the current National Implementation Plan.  Costings based upon the targets set out in the expansion of the Programme will be assessed in conjunction with my colleague the Minister for Health.</p></reply>

Part B (Fire safety) sets down the statutory minimum standards of fire safety provision. </p>  <p>  Part III of the Building Control Regulations requires a Fire Safety Certificate (FSC) to be obtained for new buildings (with some exceptions) and certain works to existing buildings. The FSC ensures the building/works, if constructed in accordance with the plans and specifications submitted, comply with the requirements of Part B of the Building Regulations. As such, an application is examined technically, by the Chief Fire Officer /Building Control Authority, for compliance with Part B, either on the basis of Technical Guidance Document B or through alternative approaches to providing fire safety.  </p>  <p>  A right of appeal is also provided for in this Part of the Building Control Regulations, in instances where a building control authority grant a fire safety certificate with conditions, or refuse to grant a fire safety certificate.  The applicant may appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la against the decision of the building control authority. The Board is fully independent in the performance of these statutory functions.   </p>  <p>  Under the Building Control Acts 1990 to 2020, primary responsibility for compliance of works with the requirements of the Building Regulations rests with the owners, designers and builders of buildings.</p>  <p>  Since the introduction of Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014, (BCAR), greater accountability is required in relation to compliance with Building Regulations in the form of statutory certification of design and construction by registered construction professionals and builders, lodgement of compliance documentation, mandatory inspections during construction and validation and registration of certificates. This legislation empowers competence and professionalism in construction projects and establishes a chain of responsibility that begins with the owner. </p>  <p>  In addition, under the Building Control Acts 1990 to 2020, Building Control Authorities have strong powers of inspection, enforcement and prosecution. As such, the number of inspections is a matter for local authorities, who are independent in the use of their statutory powers the Acts.</p>  <p>  In line with the agreed Performance Indicators for Local Government and the Code of Practice for Inspecting and Certifying Buildings and Works, Building Control Authorities are required to carry out a level of inspection equivalent to 12% to 15% of new buildings for which valid commencement notices have been received. The National Oversight &amp;amp; Audit Commission (NOAC) collects and publishes this data. The Performance Indicators in Local Authorities reports are available at http://noac.ie/noac-reports/. </p>  <p>  The National Building Control Office (NBCO) within Dublin City Council provides oversight, direction and support for the development, standardisation and implementation of Building Control as an effective shared service in the 31 Building Control Authorities.  My Department is working with the NBCO on a review of the inspection policy for building control. It is intended that the new policy will position Building Control Authorities to carry out risk-based targeted inspections by making more efficient and effective use of the available resources. Much progress has been made on this review, an inspections protocol and methodology has been developed and a pilot IT system to support inspections has also been developed. The issue of targets and capacity will be considered further in this context of this policy review.</p></reply>

The 2011 Regulations do not provide local authorities with any discretion to exceed the limits that apply to their administrative areas.</p><p>Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI, Universal Social Charge and Additional Superannuation Contribution. The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once-off in nature. There is no provision in the policy to deduct any other regular outgoings, such as childcare costs, from gross household income for the purposes of the income threshold.</p><p>A table setting out the details of the three bands and the limits currently applicable in each local authority area is available on the Department's website at the following link: <i>https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/04c69-social-housing-support-table-of-income-limits/ </i></p><p>The income bands are expressed in terms of a maximum net income threshold for a single-person household, with an allowance of 5% for each additional adult household member, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%; and separately, an allowance of 2.5% for each child.</p><p>The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced in 2011 also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.</p><p>Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support. The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources.</p><p>However, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is underway. The review will have regard to current initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and cost rental and will be completed when the impacts of these parallel initiatives have been considered.</p></reply>

As a member of the UN Security Council, and given our friendly relations with Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan, Ireland has been closely monitoring efforts to facilitate dialogue between the parties.</p>  <p>  Ireland recognises that the GERD is of critical significance for the three countries. We support the continued leadership of the Africa Union (AU) in facilitating negotiations to find an equitable and peaceful solution. Ireland supports the active role played by the EU in supporting the AU-led negotiation process. </p>  <p>  I remain extremely concerned by the ongoing conflict in Tigray.  Notwithstanding commitments made, the situation on the ground is worsening. An immediate ceasefire is the most important step all parties can take. In this regard, it is imperative that Eritrean forces leave Tigray immediately.   </p>  <p>  I am alarmed by credible warnings of famine.  I am also concerned by attacks on humanitarian workers. There is an urgent need for full humanitarian access.  Ireland joined recent international calls for a humanitarian ceasefire to allow for planting and to avert the risk of famine.</p>  <p>  We support the work of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, with the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission, to investigate reported atrocities, including widespread and systematic sexual violence.  It is vital that perpetrators be held to account. </p>  <p>  Ireland continues to work on the UN Security Council to ensure a focus on the situation in Tigray. Most recently, on 15 June, we called an informal meeting of the Security Council that focused on the humanitarian situation, having led the negotiation in April of a Council press statement on the situation in Tigray, the first time the Security Council spoke publicly on the crisis. We have also used Council thematic discussions on conflict and hunger, and on conflict-related sexual violence, to highlight these aspects of the crisis.  </p>  <p>  We continue to support a strong and constructive EU response to the crisis. Minister Coveney also continues to engage with key interlocutors on the situation, including in the region, the Gulf, as well as the AU.</p>  <p>  The Department, through Irish Aid, has provided over &euro;3.2 million to support the humanitarian response in Tigray and the refugee response in neighbouring Sudan, through our UN and NGO partners on the ground.  Further Irish Aid humanitarian support is under active consideration.</p>  <p>  Ethnically-motivated conflict in Ethiopia beyond Tigray is also of concern, including in the context of the national elections which partially took place on 21 June. In advance of the elections, the EU issued a statement highlighting concerns about the situation on the ground, including ongoing violence, human rights violations and political tensions, harassment of media workers and detention of opposition members.  The exclusion of large segments of the electorate was troubling, and we remain concerned that the situation on the ground was not conducive to a credible, inclusive and transparent electoral process.</p></reply>

The Review also referenced the training needs of SNAs.  In this regard, the NCSE recommended that a new national training programme at Level 5 of the National Qualification Framework be developed for existing SNAs who do not have the requisite level of training and for new SNAs on appointment.  The NCSE also recommended that training tailored to the specific complex needs of some students being cared for by SNAs would also be provided.  </p>  <p>  The policy advice has been considered by the Department. It was decided that priority should be given to the development of a training programme for SNAs who may not have had a recent opportunity to access a training programme tailored to their role.  </p>  <p>  A public procurement competition was held for the development and delivery of a new national training programme for SNAs. A detailed specification of need and learning outcomes was developed and published for the competition. Formal accreditation to the National Qualifications Framework was not a requirement for the programme. Following evaluation of the tenders received, the contract was awarded to University College Dublin (UCD) School of Education, in conjunction with UCD School of Nursing, Midwifery and Health Systems.  </p>  <p>  UCD has a strong reputation in the world of education and training.  It brings with it a wealth of experience and research knowledge in the training and has very strong quality assurance arrangements for its programmes.  Feedback from programme participants is a key feature of this quality assurance process.  </p>  <p>  This new programme aims to enhance the knowledge, skills and expertise of SNAs whose work is central to the inclusion of students with additional care and complex needs in school life.  </p>  <p>  The programme consists of five modules, delivered online over a 10-month period. Flexibility is a key part of the approach to the delivery of the programme and participation is voluntary. </p>  <p>  The programme is fully funded by the Department and delivered at no cost to the SNA.</p>  <p>  Completion of the programme may serve as a stepping stone to further education opportunities in the area. </p>  <p>  Each participant who completes the programme successfully will receive a certificate from UCD School of Education which may be of assistance in pursuing further education.  </p>  <p>  &euro;2.45m will be allocated to this programme over the next 4 year period based on a full uptake of 3,500 SNAs. The first cohort of 500 SNAs enrolled in January and this phase was oversubscribed.  </p>  <p>  This is the first national training programme for SNAs employed in our schools and is tailored to their needs.  The programme will be evaluated and the outcome will inform the approach to the training of SNAs in the future. There is no cost to serving SNAs working in schools. This course is fully funded by the Department of Education. </p>  <p>  The Department recognises that a more strategic approach is required for the training of SNAs.  This would deal with a number of matters including the identification of need and the provision of appropriate training programmes.  The issue of programme accreditation will be considered further in this context.</p></reply>

The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. </p><p>It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p><p>In light of the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the introduction of the new Frontloaded Allocation Model for SNAs for students in mainstream classes in primary and post -primary schools is to be deferred for a further year to the beginning of the 2022/23 school year. </p><p>In order to minimise disruption for schools, in the current circumstances, and to provide for continuity of allocations the following arrangements for the allocation of Special Needs Assistants for mainstream classes for the 2021/22 school year:</p><p>- Existing mainstream class SNA allocations in schools on 30 April 2021 will be maintained and will automatically rollover into the 2021/22 school year. </p><p>- No school will therefore receive an allocation less than that which they had on 30 April 2021. </p><p>- SNAs currently in mainstream settings can continue in post for the next school year in the normal way. </p><p>- Priority consideration will now be given by the NCSE to applications for increased support for the 2021/22 school year, in particular, applications from schools with no SNAs and developing schools will be prioritised.  Determinations will be made before 30 June. Other applications will be processed in order of date received.</p><p>- As in previous years, where circumstances change during the course of the 2021/22 school year that materially increase the level of care need in a school to the extent that the school can clearly  demonstrate that it cannot be met within the existing SNA allocation, the school may apply to the NCSE for a review. Detailed information on the NCSE exceptional review process is published on the NCSE website </p><p>The NCSE have published the SNA allocations on their website www.ncse.ie. </p><p>SNA allocations for special classes and special schools are not affected by this arrangement.</p><p>Circular 0029/2021 has been published and advises schools of the arrangements for the allocation of SNAs for the 2021/22 school year.  Provisions set out in Circular 0030/2020 has been extended for the 2021/22 school year.</p><p>Circulars 29/2021 and 30/2020  are available on the Department's website.</p><p>My Department does not have a role in making individual school determinations.

In recognition of the difficulties faced by some students to engage with remote learning, at the time the grant issued last year all DEIS schools were informed by letter that they could consider using some of their DEIS funding to support pupils&rsquo; learning, for example to arrange access to additional materials of supports for students during the move to remote teaching and learning caused by Covid-19. It is a matter for each individual school to determine how best to use this funding, but it is intended to support the objectives of the DEIS programme. </p>  <p>  Schools are asked to be conscious of students who may not have access to online facilities or technology and to adapt approaches to ensure that these pupils&rsquo; ability to participate in learning is not compromised. Schools in the DEIS programme are asked to use all available supports, both in-school and community-based, to promote a positive solution-oriented approach that will support all pupils to achieve, to learn and to progress in their education and to help minimise any further educational inequality among those at risk of educational disadvantage.   </p>  <p>  Under the Schools Broadband Access Scheme my Department will continue to fund the provision of broadband services to schools and upgrade services to existing schools as the opportunity arises. Currently some 98% of schools are provided with broadband connectivity through the Scheme. All post primary schools and some special schools have speeds of 200Mb/s or greater through the High Speed Programme for Post Primary Schools., while some 1,000 primary schools are on high speed connectivity of 100 Mbp/s or greater.</p>  <p>  A project in collaboration with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications is also underway under the Schools Broadband Programme to provide improved broadband services to those primary schools not in the National Broadband Plan intervention area, or in areas where commercial provision will not provide high speed connectivity. This project will comprise up to 1,100 primary schools, while some 679 primary schools are in the National Broadband Plan Intervention Area (NBP IA), with the balance of schools in areas where commercial provision will provide the infrastructure for high speed connectivity. Planning is already underway with a view to having all primary schools on high speed connectivity by the end 2022 through this project, the NBP, and commercial provision.</p>  <p>  Home broadband is the responsibility of the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications. </p>  <p>  The development of a new Digital Strategy is underway and an extensive consultation process has commenced with an open call for submissions. Further strands of the consultation will include questionnaires to key stakeholder and engagement through focus groups. A Consultative Advisory Group has been established comprising key stakeholders representing parents, teachers, students and industry. Future funding measures to support schools in embedding the use of digital technologies in teaching, learning and assessment will be considered as part of that process.</p></reply>

There is a prescribed special class to SNA ratio.</p><p>Circumstances may arise where this level of support is not sufficient to meet the care needs of the cohort of students enrolled. In such circumstances, the school may apply to the NCSE for access to additional care supports, clearly outlining the reason why the additional support is necessary.</p><p>The NCSE has published SNA allocations for the 2021/22 school year on their website at .</p><p>The Department does not have a role in making individual school determinations.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible for determining the appropriate staffing levels in relation to the support of pupils with special educational needs in special schools, in accordance with the policies of my Department. </p><p>Special school staffing allocations are reviewed and updated each year by the NCSE and special schools are staffed on the basis of each year&rsquo;s current school enrolments.Staffing arrangements for special schools are in line with policy advice provided by the NCSE in 2013, which did not recommend alteration to staffing ratios established under the Special Education Review Committee (SERC) Report in 1993. </p><p>Enhanced pupil teacher and SNA ratios are provided to special schools to support them in dealing with pupils' educational and care needs. These schools are staffed on the basis of individual pupil profile and the disability categorisations of those pupils, as opposed to being based primarily on school designation, in accordance with my Department's Circular 0032/2019 - Appointment of Administrative Deputy Principal and Staffing in Special Schools.</p><p>The deputy refers to lengthy waiting times for assessments through NEPS.  It is important to note that In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service and this model does not operate on a waiting lists basis.  </p><p>The NEPS Model of Service is one where there is a balance between consultation and casework about individual children, and support and development work with school personnel.  This model of service allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.</p></reply>

I have also extended the Employee Assistance Service to all school staff. </p>  <p>  The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under grant schemes. Where a school employs a staff member to support those functions those staff are employees of individual schools and responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school.  As a result my Department does not hold data on the estimated 15,000 staff concerned and is not in a position to provide costings. In terms of the current claim for secretaries and caretakers, my Department has recently completed a data gathering exercise in respect of school secretaries and caretakers paid by grant-funding which will inform costings of this claim. </p>  <p>  An arbitration agreement was implemented for secretaries and caretakers over 2015-2019 which was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a secretary or caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration has from 1 January 2019 been paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay. </p>  <p>  F&oacute;rsa trade union has tabled a follow-on claim from that agreement seeking public sector status, including a pay scale and access to pension schemes, for secretaries and caretakers. Officials from my Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and School Management Bodies have been engaging with F&oacute;rsa on the claim which does not include any other similarly employed school staff such as cleaners.</p>  <p>  On the 27th of October 2020, under the auspices of the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC), an understanding was agreed on a pathway to progress the issues raised in the F&oacute;rsa claim. Several key strands have been identified, and a phased approach is being taken to the development of proposals. The parties continue to engage under the auspices of the WRC and I support meaningful engagement on this issue by all parties.</p></reply>

This information can be used to inform strategies for improving ventilation and in that regard the Department of Education has funded the provision of a number of portable CO2 monitors for schools at an estimated overall cost of circa &euro;4 million.

It was decided that priority should be given to the development of a training programme for SNAs who may not have had a recent opportunity to access a training programme tailored to their role.</p>  <p>  A public procurement competition was held for the development and delivery of a new national training programme for SNAs. A detailed specification of need and learning outcomes was developed and published for the competition. Formal accreditation to the National Qualifications Framework was not a requirement for the programme. Following evaluation of the tenders received, the contract was awarded to University College Dublin (UCD) School of Education, in conjunction with UCD School of Nursing, Midwifery and Health Systems.  </p>  <p>  UCD has a strong reputation in the world of education and training.  It brings with it a wealth of experience and research knowledge in the training and has very strong quality assurance arrangements for its programmes.  Feedback from programme participants is a key feature of this quality assurance process.</p>  <p>  This new programme aims to enhance the knowledge, skills and expertise of SNAs whose work is central to the inclusion of students with additional care and complex needs in school life.</p>  <p>  The programme consists of five modules, delivered online over a 10-month period. Flexibility is a key part of the approach to the delivery of the programme and participation is voluntary. </p>  <p>  The programme is fully funded by the Department and delivered at no cost to the SNA.</p>  <p>  Completion of the programme may serve as a stepping stone to further education opportunities in the area. </p>  <p>  Each participant who completes the programme successfully will receive a certificate from UCD School of Education which may be of assistance in pursuing further education.  </p>  <p>  &euro;2.45m will be allocated to this programme over the next 4 year period based on a full uptake of 3,500 SNAs. The first cohort of 500 SNAs enrolled in January and this phase was oversubscribed.  </p>  <p>  This is the first national training programme for SNAs employed in our schools and is tailored to their needs.  The programme will be evaluated and the outcome will inform the approach to the training of SNAs in the future. There is no cost to serving SNAs working in schools. This course is fully funded by the Department of Education. </p>  <p>  The Department recognises that a more strategic approach is required for the training of SNAs.  This would deal with a number of matters including the identification of need and the provision of appropriate training programmes.  The issue of programme accreditation will be considered further in this context.</p></reply>

This model has replaced the previous model of allocating resource teaching support and learning support to schools.</p><p>The Special Education Teacher allocation, allows schools to provide additional teaching support for all pupils who require such support in their schools and for schools to deploy resources based on each pupil&rsquo;s individual learning needs.</p><p>It gives greater flexibility to schools as to how they can deploy their resources, to take account of the actual learning needs pupils have, as opposed to being guided by a particular diagnosis of disability, and schools are guided as to how they should make such allocation decisions.</p><p>The school will take account of learning needs of children as evidenced by performance in schools but also supported where relevant by information provided regarding the nature of a condition that a pupil may have.</p><p>The Department of Education and Skills has published guidelines for schools as to how they should utilise and deploy their resources under the new allocation model, which are available at www.education.ie.</p><p>The guidelines support schools in how they identify pupils for additional teaching support and decide how much support to provide for pupils who need it.  </p><p>Under the special education teacher allocation model schools are frontloaded with resources, based on each schools profile, to provide supports immediately to those pupils who need it without delay.</p><p>Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.</p><p>Children do not have to be labelled with a particular condition to qualify for extra teaching assistance.</p><p>The model gives greater freedom to schools to give extra teaching help to the pupils who most need it, regardless of their diagnosis.</p><p>Schools also do not have to give a set amount of time to pupils based on their disability category. They can give the most assistance to the pupils who need the support most and allocate resources based on needs.</p><p>Children who have additional learning needs in school, including those children who have additional learning needs associated with attainment in literacy, can receive additional teaching support in schools, regardless of wheter the child has a diagnosis of dyslexia or not. </p><p>As decision on the allocation of additional teaching support is made locally by schools, based on learning need as opposed to being based on a diagnosis of dyslexia, my Department does not have details of the number of pupils in primary or post primary schools who have been diagnosed as having dyslexia or who have been recommended to receive additional support by an educational psychologist. No reading classes have been established following the introduction of the new special education teacher allocation model.</p></reply>

Major new residential developments in a school planning area have the potential to alter demand in that area.  In that regard, as part of the demographic exercises, my Department engages with each local authority to obtain the up-to-date data on significant new residential development in each area. </p>  <p>  Where data indicates that additional provision is required at primary or post primary level, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:</p>  <p>  - Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Extending the capacity of a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Provision of a new school or schools.</p>  <p>  Since 2018, 47 new schools to cater for demographic demand have been announced to be established over the period 2019-2022 and included in that number are two new primary schools in Donaghmede_Howth_D13. Stapolin Educate Together NS opened in September 2019 and Gaelscoil Ghrainne Mhaol will be established in September 2021. </p>  <p>  New schools are established by my Department on the basis of identified demographic demand in an area, and, as outlined above, only after consideration of the capacity of existing schools to absorb the expected school place demand.  Furthermore, such new schools are required to build their enrolments incrementally, with an intake of Junior Infants or First Years each year.  This is designed to allow the new school&rsquo;s enrolment capacity to increase in tandem with emerging demographic demand and in order to mitigate any impact on the enrolments at other schools in the area. </p>  <p>  On this basis, Gaelscoil Ghrainne Mhaol will be established with a Junior Infant intake only in 2021.</p></reply>

The payment begins automatically from the month after the birth. Where a birth is not registered within the required time (that is, 3 months) the parents must complete a Child Benefit form (CB1) and submit it to my Department.</p>  <p>  I understand that the cyber security attack which targeted HSE systems recently has caused difficulties in the General Register Office which have in turn resulted in delays in the registration of births.  Where this has caused any knock-on delays with Child Benefit applications, such claims will be prioritised as soon as they are received and payments will be backdated to the beginning of the parent's eligibility.  Regulations provide that where Child Benefit is awarded, payment commences from the 1st day of the month following that in which the claimant became a qualified person.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that even where a birth has not been registered within three months, Child Benefit payments will be backdated to the beginning of the eligibility period.  So, parents will not lose out on any Child Benefit payments as a result of the cyber attack on the HSE systems.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This leave is available to a relevant parent, who is defined as a parent, adoptive parent or person acting in loco parentis.</p><p>The Parental Leave (Amendment) Act 2019 introduced a significant extension to the existing parental leave entitlements, raising the age of the child for whom parental leave may be taken from eight years to twelve. It also extended the parental leave entitlement by 8 weeks, on a phased basis. The last of these increases came into effect on 1 September 2020 and parents are now entitled to 26 weeks leave in total.</p><p>In addition, the Parent&rsquo;s Leave and Benefit Act 2019 introduced two weeks of paid parent's leave for each relevant parent, as defined in the legislation, to be taken in the first year after the birth or adoptive placement of a child. The definition of relevant parent under the Act includes a parent of the child and the spouse, civil partner or cohabitant of a parent of the child.</p><p>Following the commencement of the Family Leave and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2021 on 1 April 2021, an additional three weeks of paid parent's leave has been granted to each relevant parent, and the period in which the leave can be taken has been extended to the first two years after the birth or adoptive placement of a child.</p><p>Section 6 of the Carer's Leave Act 2001 provides that employees with at least one year's continuous service are entitled to take up to 104 weeks of carer's leave to enable them to provide full-time care and attention to a person who is in need of such care.  </p><p>Carer's Leave is unpaid but an employee may also qualify for Carer's Benefit or Carer's Allowance, the payment of which is a matter for the Minister for Social Protection.</p><p>There are no plans to amend any of the family leave provisions at present but they are kept under review.</p></reply>

These services recorded 85% staff as working directly with children (extrapolated figure for all services is 26,294), with with the remaining 15% ancillary staff (extrapolated figure for all services is 4,589).</p>  <p>  Turnover is calculated using four data types:  </p>  <p>  - number of staff working in the service </p>  <p>  - number of staff who left in the past twelve months </p>  <p>  - number of staff working in the facility who had worked there for less than twelve months  </p>  <p>  - number of staff vacancies at the time of completing the survey.</p>  <p>  The national annual staff turnover rate for 2019-2020 was 18%. This is down five percentage points on last year&rsquo;s figure of 23%. Data at a local authority level indicates the highest rate of turnover in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown (38%), and the lowest in Roscommon (11%).  The majority of services (64%) retained all their staff during the 12 months up to the completion of the survey. The proportion of services retaining all staff increased by 5 percentage points on the previous year. This indicates an overall a lower turnover than in previous years. </p>  <p>  These figures should be interpreted in the context of COVID-19, during which time services were in receipt of substantial funding supports which may have contributed to these lower turnover rates for staff.</p>  <p>  My Department is committed to policy development and reform to support the ELC and SAC workforce. This policy reform will be realised through increased investment as commitmented to in First 5, the whole-of-Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families (2019-2028). A Workforce Development Plan will aim to raise the profile of careers in ELC and SAC, establish a career framework and leadership development opportunities and will work towards building a more gender-balanced and diverse workforce. It is expected that the final Workforce Development Plan will be published by the end of 2021.  </p>  <p>  The development of a new funding model is also underway. Led by an Expert Group, the draft Guiding Principles refer to the recruitment and retention of staff with the necessary qualifications; ongoing staff training and development; fair pay and working conditions; and a workforce which feels valued and is motivated to deliver the best possible service to children. It is expected that a report on the Expert Group&rsquo;s recommendations on the new Funding Model will be submitted in November 2021.</p></reply>

Unsuccessful applicants are permitted to apply twice to each of the Irish Research Council&rsquo;s postgraduate programmes.</p>  <p>  An applicant who is a new entrant to the postgraduate degree for which they are seeking funding is entitled to apply for funding for the full duration of the degree. For applicants who have already completed part of the postgraduate degree for which they are seeking funding, the duration of funding to be awarded, if successful, is dependent on the type of degree being pursued and the date of first registration.</p>  <p>  Other support available to students is the statutory based Student Grant Scheme administered by SUSI. The Student Grant Scheme supports eligible postgraduate students with the cost of attending higher education. Budget 2021 provided for enhanced postgraduate supports from the 2021/22 academic year including the fee grant amount rising from &euro;2,000 to &euro;3,500 and the income threshold for eligibility for these grants increasing from &euro;31,500, now &euro;54,240. This is an initial step in meeting part of the Government&rsquo;s commitments regarding SUSI grant support. This increase will allay some of the costs for postgraduate study and give greater certainty for students in terms of supports.</p>  <p>  Apart from the Student Grant Scheme, students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Information on the fund is available through the Access Office in the third level institution attended, and is administered on a confidential discretionary basis.</p>  <p>  The postgraduate office within the higher education institution would also be able to advise on funding supports. </p></reply>

It is these 25 programmes which are delivered in phases of on-the-job and off-the-job training in Training Centres or Institutes of Technology and Technological Universities (depending on phase).  These programmes were those most impacted by the shutdown of on-site learning activity in 2020 and 2021 given the practical nature of the apprenticeships.</p>  <p>  Craft apprentices were prioritised for a return to on-site learning on 8 March 2020.  Delivery of off-the-job phases is continuing, albeit with restricted numbers.  The Government has committed &euro;20m funding to increase the level of craft apprenticeship training capacity and work is underway around the country to put additional workshops in place to support increased activity, regardless of spacing requirements. There is will also be provision for on-site presence for some craft apprentices over the summer months. Appropriate protective measures will be in place and numbers on site will be controlled. This approach to returning on-site over the summer period will assist institutions and providers in organising and managing the safe return of larger numbers in the autumn.</p>  <p>  A plan for re-opening of tertiary education was published on 15 June 2021.  As part of this plan, a new framework is being developed for a safe return to on-site activity for September 2021.  The framework allows institutions and providers to consistently and safely adapt to ongoing changes to COVID-19 guidance and circumstances.  Planning is proceeding on the basis that full resumption of on-site activity is possible, subject to progress in the rollout of vaccinations and the prevailing public health advice at that time. The return to increased levels of on-site activity for apprentices will take place within public health guidelines.</p>  <p>  SOLAS and the HEA are actively working with the education and training providers to identify additional solutions to ensure that craft apprentices are enabled to complete their training as quickly as possible.</p></reply>

From September 2021 the postgraduate fee grant will increase to &euro;3,500 from &euro;2,000. This increase will allay some of the costs for postgraduate study and would give greater certainty for students in terms of supports. In addition the fee income threshold will increase to &euro;54,240 from &euro;31,500 from September 2021.</p>  <p>  SUSI opened its application process for the 2021/22 academic year on March 31 and to date has received over 67,000 applications. I also secured an additional &euro;20m in Budget 2021 to meet anticipated demands on the scheme as a consequence of the Covid pandemic.  Grant applications are submitted online via www.susi.ie. Further information in relation to student grant assistance is also available from this website. The telephone number for SUSI&rsquo;s Helpdesk is 0761 087 874. </p>  <p>  The Student Assistance Fund (SAF) provides financial support to full- and part-time students who are experiencing financial difficulties while attending higher education. Under the Fund, financial support can be provided to assist students who are unable to meet costs associated with day-to-day participation in higher education, including a number of categories such as books and other class material, rent, heating and lighting bills and other utility bills, essential travel, childcare costs etc.  </p>  <p>  In response to the Covid19 pandemic, the SAF allocation for the 2020/21 academic year was doubled from &euro;8.1 million to &euro;16.2 million. Since 2017, an additional &euro;1 million per year has been allocated to the SAF with HEIs asked to prioritise and ring-fence this element of funding for the support of part-time students who are lone parents or members of the other access target groups identified in the National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education. An additional &euro;1 million was added to the fund in 2018 for students attending Professional Masters of Education (PME) courses, who are experiencing financial difficulty. This additional funding was also made available for the 2019/20 year and again in 2020/21. </p>  <p>  In relation to other supports tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education including approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in EU Member States. Further information on this tax relief is available from the Revenue Commissioners at www.revenue.ie.</p>  <p>  Students are encouraged to engage with their institution to discuss any issues in relation to their course, including information on scholarships that may be available directly from the institution attended.</p></reply>

It monitors PSPs compliance in accordance with the provisions of the Property Services (Regulation) Act 2011 and its associated Regulations.</p>  <p>  There is no legislation in place that would allow the PRSA to advise estate agents to request sight of a prospective house buyers exact funds rather than their mortgage approval when arranging viewings or bidding on a property. There are no provisions in the 2011 Act or its associated Regulations relating to agents requesting personal or financial information.</p>  <p>  Following on from the Government&rsquo;s publication of the Plan for Living with Covid-19 and Department of Health and HSE Guidelines, the PSRA, in conjunction with IPAV, the Institute of Professional Auctioneers and Valuers and the SCSI, the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland published the guidance document &lsquo;Property Services Providers Guidance to Implementing the Plan for Living with Covid 19&rsquo; to provide guidance to PSPs on how to safely manage business continuity during the Covid 19 pandemic. This document sets out measures to be taken at the different levels of the Government&rsquo;s plan on Living with Covid-19. This guidance, approved by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, sets out at Level 4 and 5 of the Plan that viewings should only take place where proof of funds was available. This measure was advised to protect the health and safety of all parties and is no longer required as the restrictions in place have been reduced from level 5 to level 3 effective 10 May 2021. At no time where proof of funds was requested, was there a requirement for information on the amount of exact funds approved to be provided. The provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Data Protection Act 2018 continued to apply in the course of the provision of property services. </p>  <p>  The GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018 place obligations on data controllers including PSPs, to ensure that all of the principles of data protection law are complied with. I understand that the PSRA and the Data Protection Commission (DPC), which is an independent body established under the Data Protection Act 2018, have engaged on this issue and the DPC has issued targeted guidance in this area in recent days.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore, Section 61 of the Property Services (Regulation) Act 2011, requires PSPs to retain a record of all offers received in respect of a sale of property other than by auction, for a period of not less than six years. The Minimum Standards Statutory Instrument which was commenced in November 2020, further strengthened the Regulations in relation to the recording of offers, where PSPs are now required to provide written confirmation to each offer or on receipt of an offer and a PSP is not permitted to express or imply to any person, that an offer on a property has been received, unless that offer has been received by the PSP. The PSRA has powers under the Act, to inspect such records as part of an investigation.</p></reply>

The General Scheme of the Criminal Justice (Hate Crime) Bill 2021 was published on 16 April, and is available on the Department's website.</p>  <p>  This is an important step in delivering on the Programme for Government commitment to introduce legislation to address those who target victims because of their association with a particular identity characteristic, and to revise and update the Incitement to Hatred Act. Although incitement to hatred is already an offence, experience has shown that it is difficult to prosecute and there have been very few convictions since the introduction of the 1989 Act.</p>  <p>  As part of the work to prepare this proposed legislation, a comprehensive public consultation was carried out which included a public survey and an opportunity for stakeholders to make formal submissions. In addition, my Department also carried out comparative research on international best practice on hate crime legislation.</p>  <p>  The purpose of this work was to ensure that the legislative proposals presented are evidence-based, proportionate and effective, while respecting important rights to freedom of expression and association.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that all legislative proposals are developed and put forward bearing in mind the provisions of the Constitution and our human rights obligations.</p>  <p>  The right to freedom of expression is a fundamental human right, provided for in the Irish Constitution and in both the European Convention on Human Rights and in the European Charter of Fundamental Rights. However, like other rights in our Constitution, it is not an absolute right, and can be limited or restricted by law. This can only happen where there are compelling reasons, including protecting other fundamental human rights. Any such limitation or restriction must be necessary, proportionate and explicitly provided for in law.</p>  <p>  I am confident the approach taken on reforms in this area will ensure the legislation introduced plays a significant part in delivering a safer, fairer and more inclusive Ireland for everyone. This is the mission of my Department and as Minister I am fully committed to combatting incitement to hatred and hate crime as a key element of this.</p></reply>

In particular, the Government is pursuing a strategy of greater coordination and cooperation on visa matters with the United Kingdom in the context of the Common Travel Area (CTA), which has even greater importance post-Brexit. This is exemplified by the operation of the British Irish Visa Scheme in China and India, which allows for travel to and around Ireland and the UK on a single visa.  </p>  <p>  As part of this greater cooperation, the matter of alignment of those States whose citizens are visa-required is also being kept under review. The greater the extent of alignment between the two jurisdictions, the greater the opportunity to increase the number of tourist and business visits to the CTA.   </p>  <p>  At present, both Ireland and the UK (in common also with EU Member States in the Schengen Area) require citizens of Palestine to be in possession of a visa for travel to their jurisdictions. While there are no current plans to change this, any proposals for change would also need to be considered in this context.</p></reply>

The ruling applies equally in all EU Member States.</p>  <p>  The ECJ ruled that such persons cannot be removed from the host State on foot of domestic legislative provisions and can only be removed on foot of a Removal Order made under Article 15 of the EU Free Movement Directive. This ruling requires a new Removal Order based process to be developed in this State, based on the provisions of Article 15. The required process is currently being developed in my Department.  </p>  <p>  My Department estimates that there are approximately 2,500 cases, which are directly impacted by the ruling in the Chenchooliah case. These cases are being progressed at present, insofar as possible, and that position will continue to apply.  It is also the case that some of the applicants in this cohort will have another immigration application pending. The post-Chenchooliah Removal Order process will only apply in circumstances where all other aspects of a person's immigration case have been refused and the issue of their removal from the State remains under consideration.</p></reply>

This covers a range of behaviours from the lower end of what is considered harassing behaviour right up to the more serious cases of stalking where a person shows up at the victim&rsquo;s home, work or anywhere else the victim happens to be, causing them alarm or distress.  </p>  <p>  In lieu of introducing a distinct offence of stalking, the 1997 Act was strengthened substantially to increase the maximum penalty for harassment to 10 years&rsquo; imprisonment, which reflects the harm caused by those who engage in the most serious forms of harassment.</p>  <p>  This is as high as, and in a number of cases higher than, the penalties available in other jurisdictions looked at, including jurisdictions that have a distinct offence of stalking.</p></reply>

The intention of the programme is to divert children and young people who have engaged in criminal or anti-social behaviour away from the criminal justice system and towards more positive life choices. Children who commit criminal offences are considered for admission to the Garda Diversion Programme.

GYDPs seek to divert young people, who are either involved or are at risk of becoming involved in criminal behaviour, away from future involvement with the criminal justice system. They are primarily targeted at 12 to 17 year old young people in communities where a specific need for the service has been identified.

Such operational matters are under the remit of those members of the legal profession responsible for the legal work involved in buying and selling property. As the Deputy will appreciate, I have no role in such matters. I should also point out that under the Property Registration Authority (Transfer of Departmental Administration and Ministerial Functions) Order (S.I. 574 of 2017), the functions previously vested in the Minister for Justice and Equality under the Registration of Title Act 1964 have been transferred to the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government with effect from 1 January 2018. </p>  <p>  However, more broadly I would like to add, as the Deputy may be aware, that the Justice Plan 2021 commits to reform of the legal sector.</p>  <p>  In March, as provided for under section 34 of the Legal Services Regulation Act, Minister McEntee asked the Legal Services Regulatory Authority (LSRA) to prepare and submit a report within 18 months on the creation of a new profession of conveyancer.  The LSRA has been specifically asked to consider the potential of digital technology to reduce the cost and time in which it takes to carry out a conveyance. A public consultation process to be undertaken by the LSRA as part of this work, will give key stakeholders, including those who avail of conveyancing services, an opportunity to have their say. </p>  <p>  This is an important step in continuing the process of legal services reform to reduce legal costs and provide greater choice for users of legal services.</p></reply>

I understand that representatives of Parkrun recently met with the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media to discuss the resumption of their events when regulations permit. As part of these discussions, Parkrun submitted a COVID-19 Framework which has been reviewed by the Department's Return to Sport Expert Group and feedback has been provided to Parkrun via Sport Ireland. Both Sport Ireland and the Return to Sport Expert Group are supportive of the return of Parkrun and will continue to provide guidance and support to Parkrun as they further progress with their plans to resume. </p>  <p>  While there has been scope to continue with the easing of public health measures, our approach must continue to be cautious, gradual and on a phased basis, with sufficient time between any easing of measures to assess the impact.

The Dutch authorities replied that magistral preparations may only be provided directly to patients or their representative on the basis of a prescription, presented for dispensing. Since April 2020 owing to the travel restrictions and quarantine requirements the Department of Health has been collecting patients prescribed products and delivering them to Irish patient&rsquo;s homes, collections occur approximately every four weeks.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-06-22a.1343.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1614" speakername="Mary Butler" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021062200082#WRY03800"><p>The Nursing Homes Support Scheme, commonly referred to as the Fair Deal Scheme, has been in operation for over 10 years and there is broad agreement that the Scheme operates well and continues to provide appropriate financial assistance where it is required. </p>  <p>  However, it is recognised that the Act, in its current form, does not place caps on the financial assessment of family owned and operated farms or businesses when calculating the means to pay for nursing home care, except in cases where an applicant requires nursing home care due to sudden illness or disability. This places a potentially onerous burden on family successors and could challenge the future viability of these productive assets.</p>  <p>  Therefore, the Department of Health has proposed a policy change to the Scheme, to cap contributions based on farm and business assets at three years where a family successor commits to working the productive asset. The stated policy objective of the legislation is to introduce additional safeguards in the Scheme to further protect the viability and sustainability of family farms and businesses that will be passed down to the next generation of the family to continue to work them as productive assets to provide for their livelihood. </p>  <p>  The definition of relevant business in the 2021 Bill is unchanged from the existing definition in the Principal Act. It has been altered only to remove the qualification that the definition is solely relevant in the context of applicants with relevant businesses who enter care because of sudden illness or disability. All persons with a relevant business can now qualify for the 3-year cap on contributions to the cost of care based on the value of the business, provided that they comply with all of the conditions of the scheme. </p>  <p>  For the purposes of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme (Amendment) Bill, a relevant business means&mdash; </p>  <p>   (a) the business or an interest in a business carried on by a sole trader or by a partnership, including any land, building, machinery or plant used wholly or mainly for the purpose of the business, or</p>  <p>  (b) where a business is carried on by a company, the unquoted shares in or securities of the company, and a reference to a relevant business includes a reference to part of a relevant business.</p></reply>

The proposed corporate and clinical governance arrangements for the new NMH at Elm Park were set out in the Mulvey Agreement, which was finalised in 2016 following an extensive mediation process between the NMH and the St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group, published thereafter and noted by Government in 2017. </p>  <p>  The Mulvey Agreement provides for the establishment of a new company - National Maternity Hospital at Elm Park DAC - which will have clinical and operational, as well as financial and budgetary, independence in the provision of maternity, gynaecology and neonatal services. </p>  <p>  The draft legal framework subsequently developed is designed to copperfasten these arrangements. It provides that the new hospital remains in State ownership and that thus, the State&rsquo;s significant investment will be protected.  The clear legal advice provided to the State is that the draft legal framework ensures that all legally permissible medical services will be provided in the new hospital.</p>  <p>  However, we will continue to examine all options carefully as we move forward towards finalisation of the arrangements. I have been very clear that I will not bring anything to Government unless it provides assurances around all legally permissible services being provided in the new NMH. In addition, the safeguarding of the State&rsquo;s investment must also be put beyond doubt. </p>  <p>  In that context, I intend to engage further with both St Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group and the Religious Sisters of Charity over the coming days and weeks.</p></reply>

Under the scheme, patients receive drugs, medicines, and medical and surgical appliances directly related to the treatment of their illness, free of charge.</p>  <p>  There are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the scheme at this time. However, a review of the current eligibility framework, including the basis for existing hospital and medication charges, will be carried out under commitments given in the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy. </p>  <p>  For people who are not eligible for the LTI Scheme, there are other arrangements which protect them from excessive medicine costs.</p>  <p>  Under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;114 a month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals with ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p>  <p>  Those who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. In the assessment process, the HSE can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family. Those who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of GP consultations. </p>  <p>  Tax relief is also available on the cost of medical expenses. This includes medicines prescribed by a doctor, dentist, or consultant. Relief is at the standard tax rate of 20%, and further information is available at www.revenue.ie.</p></reply>

This places a potentially onerous burden on family successors and could challenge the future viability of these productive assets.</p>  <p>  Therefore, the Department of Health has proposed a policy change to the Scheme, to cap contributions based on farm and business assets at three years where a family successor commits to working the productive asset. The stated policy objective of the legislation is to introduce additional safeguards in the Scheme to further protect the viability and sustainability of family farms and businesses that will be passed down to the next generation of the family to continue to work them as productive assets to provide for their livelihood. </p>  <p>  This change was approved by Government and underwent pre-legislative scrutiny in the last D&aacute;il. Progress on the development of the Bill was negatively impacted by the dissolution of the last D&aacute;il and by the COVID-19 pandemic. The response to the pandemic has been and continues to be a national and public health priority. However, the Programme for Government committed to introducing this amendment to the Nursing Homes Support Scheme and I am pleased to say that Cabinet approved the publication of the Bill on the 11th May. The Bill completed Second Stage in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann 18th-20th May and has been referred to the Select Committee on Health. It is my intention to begin Committee Stage before the end of June.</p></reply>

To contribute towards this objective, Ireland will utilise the sharing mechanisms available through the EU procurement structure. It is expected that COVAX will be central to this sharing mechanism. With the continuing progress of the domestic vaccination program, greater clarity on the available quantities of vaccines doses and the initial timing that these can be shared with COVAX, is becoming apparent. The Department is in current liaison with the Department of Foreign Affairs, the European Commission and COVAX to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s participation, in concert with other Member States, happens in a timely and proportionate manner.</p></reply>

The most recent agreement was the <i>Framework Agreement on the Supply of Medicines to the Health Services 2016-2020</i>(FASPM). </p><p>The HSE has statutory responsibility for medicine pricing and reimbursement decisions, in accordance with <i>The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013</i>. The Act specifies the criteria for decisions on the reimbursement of medicines, including provision for the existence of any framework agreements in place. </p><p>Savings generated from the powers afforded to the HSE under the Health Act 2013 relating to Reference Pricing and Interchangeability of generic medicines falls outside the remit of the FASPM. Similarly, HSE activities to optimise the use of biosimilars in Ireland are separate to this Agreement. </p><p>For example, the prescribing of Best Value Biologic medicines is leading to significant savings for the health service under the Gain-Share Initiative. By December 2020, almost 12,000 patients have switched to a best-value-biologic (BvB), almost 57% of the claims submitted to PCRS for payment was for the BvB alternative to the originator biologic and associated annual savings in excess of &euro;46 million has been achieved.  </p><p>The current FASPM was due to end in July 2020; however, due to COVID-19 it was necessary to implement an extension. The Department of Health, along with our partners in the Department of Public Expenditure and the HSE, agreed with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA) an extension on the terms of the existing 2016-2020. This remains in place until 31 July 2021 to facilitate preparatory work on the successor agreement within the context of the ongoing COVID-19 challenges.</p><p>My Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the HSE are presently engaged in preparatory work with a view to initiating negotiations on a successor agreement later this year. My officials are considering all relevant stakeholders as part of this preparatory work.</p></reply>

However, the matters raised are important objectives within the Department. Securing affordable access to existing and new medicines in a timely manner is a key objective of the Irish Health Service. However, the challenge is delivering on this objective in an affordable and sustainable way. Expenditure on medicines represents one of the largest areas of expenditure across the health service and will continue to grow in the years ahead.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health is fully supportive of domestic policies that maximise efficiency in our medicines usage. The HSE is actively engaged in implementing effective policy levers across a number of domains and under several initiatives, including those under the Acute Hospitals Drugs Management Programme (AHDMP), the Medicines Management Programme (MMP), and within the Primary Care Eligibility &amp;amp; Reimbursement Service (PCERS).</p>  <p>  Foe example, in relation to biosimilar medicines, the AHDMP has a biosimilar strategy in place since 2017. This is making considerable progress using a collaborative approach to bring about changes in prescribing practice.  </p>  <p>  The MMP completed an evaluation process in 2019 for the identification of the best-value biological (BVB) medicines for TNF-α inhibitors under the High-Tech Drug arrangements. In June 2019, a system of gain-share was introduced and is administered by the PCERS with the objective of encouraging the prescribing of the BVB medicines. This has been largely successful in increasing uptake of these medicines.</p>  <p>  While progress has been positive, the Department of Health and HSE are continuously monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of current levers to ensure that the State can capitalise on the most efficient policy approach.</p></reply>

The most commonly used puberty blockers are gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists, which inhibit the release of sex hormones, including testosterone and oestrogen. In addition to their various other medical uses, puberty blockers are used off-label for transgender children to delay the development of unwanted sex characteristics. </p>  <p>  The use of a medicinal product outside of the specific terms of its marketing authorisation (MA) is often described as &ldquo;off-label use&rdquo;. It is the responsibility of the prescriber to satisfy him/herself that off-label use of a medicine is supported by good quality information from the scientific literature. Such off-label use therefore falls within the professional, clinical judgement of the prescriber.   </p>  <p>  Where a product is used by a healthcare practitioner for patients under his care outside of the terms of the MA, such usage is not covered by, nor prohibited by, medicines legislation. The medical decision to prescribe or not prescribe a specific treatment for an individual patient is strictly a decision for the treating clinician, in consultation with their patient. The Department of Health has no role in this clinical decision-making process.</p></reply>

All applicable travellers must reserve and pay for a place in mandatory hotel quarantine.</p>  <p>  The Act identifies those who are exempt from mandatory hotel quarantine, and a full list of exemptions can be accessed on www.gov.ie/quarantine.  </p>  <p>  With effect from 8th May, if a person has travelled abroad for unavoidable, imperative and time-sensitive medical reasons they will not be required to undergo mandatory hotel quarantine on their return to Ireland.  They will be required to present a medical certificate from a registered medical practitioner or from a person holding an equivalent qualification outside the State to the effect that they had an unavoidable, imperative and time-sensitive reason for so travelling. In addition, any carer or dependent travelling with this person will also be exempted from the requirement to undergo mandatory hotel quarantine. </p>  <p>  As of 17th April, passengers who are 'fully vaccinated' and have the documents to confirm this are no longer required to complete mandatory hotel quarantine on arrival in Ireland. Dependents, including children, will also be exempted from the requirement to complete mandatory hotel quarantine in this instance. Please note that the 4 EMA approved vaccines currently accepted have specific definitions for when a person would be considered 'fully vaccinated'.</p>  <p>  Passengers who are fully vaccinated and exempt from hotel quarantine are still subject to other travel restrictions, such as the need to provide a negative pre-departure PCR test and complete a period of self-quarantine at home or wherever specified in their passenger locator form.</p>  <p>  The provisions of the Act allow for travellers to request a review of decisions relating to their quarantine in a designated facility; however, this can only be undertaken once quarantine has begun.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the list of designated states will be subject to change at short notice and passengers are required to check the list before travelling to Ireland, to be sure of their obligations.</p>  <p>  Neither I as Minister for Health nor my Department have any role in decisions relating to whether individual persons must enter mandatory quarantine or whether individual persons are exempted travellers. All such decisions are to be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Act.</p></reply>

In the health sector, the HSE has deployed rapid antigen tests for use for specific indications in the acute hospital setting, and as part of the response to outbreaks in the community setting, supported by appropriate clinical governance and operational arrangements. This includes updating the case definition for SARS-CoV-2 to accept notification of positive results from rapid antigen tests undertaken in the public health system and reporting of such cases to the COVID Care tracker and to the Computerised Infectious Disease Reporting (CIDR) information system developed to manage the surveillance and control of infectious diseases in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Operational planning is also underway in the HSE in relation to the piloting of testing using RADTs in education and childcare settings. This includes development of guidance documentation, a training programme and other related templates and resources to support the testing pathway for educational facilities. The antigen assay to use for the pilot has been selected and stakeholder engagement is ongoing. The Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, supported by the HSE, commenced a rapid antigen testing pilot scheme on the 14th June in NUI Galway, Trinity College Dublin, University College Dublin and University College Cork.</p>  <p>  The HSE&rsquo;s Antigen Validation Project Team has been working with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to supply and implement antigen testing in food processing facilities to supplement the PCR serial testing programme that has been in operation since 21 August 2020. These tests are being carried out under clinical governance arrangements put in place by the Department of Agriculture.</p>  <p>  The HSE has also recently published the report of the Antigen Test Validation Project which validated a number of rapid antigen detection tests (ADTS) intended for testing samples for SARS-CoV-2 antigen. The products evaluated were chosen as those expected to represent the best available products based on the manufacturers claims and other available evidence.</p>  <p>  The &ldquo;Report of the COVID-19 Rapid Testing Group&rdquo; which was chaired at my request by the Government&rsquo;s chief scientific adviser, Professor Mark Ferguson, and published on 1 April 2021, made a number of recommendations for sectors outside the health sector and these are a matter for the Ministers and Departments with responsibility for the sectors concerned. </p>  <p>  Rapid testing has a role to play as another valuable tool in Ireland&rsquo;s battle against COVID-19; however, antigen testing, or other forms of rapid testing, will not replace the requirement for large scale PCR testing in this country which remains the gold standard diagnostic test for SARS-CoV-2.</p></reply>

Quantifying the carbon sequestered in our soils requires scientific research. </p>  <p>The ability of agriculture land to absorb CO2 is influenced by a number of site-specific factors, studies have shown that temperate grasslands can have annual sequestration rates of approximately 1 tonne C per hectare. However, currently, due to large areas of drained carbon rich soils under agricultural management, grasslands act as a net source.</p>  <p>  In the past, the lack of national long-term observational data and field experiments have been recognised as a barrier to quantifying grassland sequestration. The Department has recently announced the establishment of a National Agricultural Soil Carbon Observatory. This significant investment will be used to model GHG emissions and sequestration on a range of agricultural land.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Department is providing up to &euro;850,000 in research funding for two projects investigating how carbon sequestration on agricultural land could provide mitigation options while maintaining agricultural production (Agri-SOC) and understanding the contribution of hedgerows and non-forest woodland patches (NFW) to Carbon stocks in agricultural landscapes (Farm-Carbon).</p>  <p>  The Department is also involved with the EU LIFE IP Peatlands and People project, with a co-funding commitment of &euro;750,000 in support of research into GHG&rsquo;s and carbon sequestration from grassland farming  in peatland. The project will facilitate objectives of Ireland&rsquo;s Climate Action Plan. Research on these projects is currently ongoing and results may provide the scientific basis for the development of measures in the future.</p></reply>

Applicants for GLAS were urged, together with their Advisors, to look at the opportunities afforded by Forestry Schemes when planning for GLAS. </p>  <p>  Forestry is one of the many land use options available to farmers and land owners and the Afforestation Grant and Premium Scheme covers 100% of the cost of establishing new forests and also provides annual premium payments which are paid for 15 years. All forestry schemes are voluntary and land owners have the option to choose between twelve different planting categories within the Department&rsquo;s current Afforestation Scheme. </p>  <p>  Farmers who have planted land under the forestry scheme do not do so using their herd number and, therefore, are not easily cross-checked with GLAS participants.

This amendment did not involve the hook and line fishery.  </p>  <p>  The mackerel Policy sets down that the hook and line fishery for vessels under 15m in overall length receive 400t.  </p>  <p>  In order to amend Mackerel Policy, I must be satisfied that there is satisfactory evidence of changed circumstances to justify a policy review.  If I consider there is a case for review of any aspect policy, it would require due process involving an assessment of all issues arising, including full public consultation.  </p>  <p>  There has been, for the past 20 years or so, intensive competition within the industry for access to and a higher share of the mackerel quota. The EU/U.K. Trade and Co-operation Agreement provides for the transfer of 26% of Ireland&rsquo;s mackerel quota by 2026 to the U.K.  This will only increase demands for higher shares of Ireland&rsquo;s quota from all sectors within the fishing fleet. </p>  <p>  In respect of the linkage between the early closure of the hook and line fishery and the EU/ UK TCA, the Deputy should be aware that the 400t for the hook and line fishery has not been reduced and has remained the same as in previous years.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, the situation is that if there is an increase for any sector in the allocation made available, such as for the hook and line fishery, it must be taken from others who are already facing significant cuts under the EU/ U.K. TCA.</p></reply>

However, we are expecting a further update to the BOM.  Seamless trade with Great Britain is no longer possible, and impacts such as delays, additional costs and, potentially, adjustments to supply chains, are unavoidable.    </p>  <p>  The Department has invested significantly in developing our IT systems to process documentation post-Brexit and to putting resources in place to support this work.   Health certification will be provided through the Department&rsquo;s existing systems - systems that have been specifically developed for Brexit - and through the EU Trade Control And Expert System (TRACES). </p>  <p>  Ongoing consultation and communications are taking place with the industry in order to enhance its readiness. Trials are ongoing and additional trials are planned.  Bilateral engagement continues at technical level between their Department and the UK&rsquo;s Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in order to clarify UK import requirements so that arrangements are in place to provide the necessary certification.</p></reply>

REAP is a pilot initiative designed to trial the results-based model on Irish farms. As this model is expected to feature under the new CAP, REAP will better place Irish farmers and their advisors for participation in the next national agri-environment scheme to follow on from GLAS. </p>  <p>  REAP will be part-funded under the technical assistance measure of Ireland's Rural Development Programme. The pilot nature of the project lead to initial expectations that participant numbers would not exceed 2,000 places. However, participation numbers in the project were increased significantly. Now, almost 5,000 farmers will be supported to undertake environmental commitments to increase the environmental value of existing farm features. This figure is more than double the original participation figure envisioned.</p>  <p>  As REAP was oversubscribed, a ranking and selection process was used to assess applications. This process considered the presence of priority water areas, (as defined by the EPA), and the proportion of Natura and ANC land on the holding. The details of the selection process are listed in section 10 of the REAP terms and conditions. There will be further opportunities for these farmers to engage in agri-environment schemes under the next CAP on which intensive work is underway to design these schemes in consultation with stakeholders.</p></reply>

There is a strong corelation between the EU Action Plan and the targets contained in the Strategy for the Development of the Organic Sector.  I believe the current strategy remains relevant and continues to be a major driver of the growth of the Irish organic food sector.  </p>  <p>  I, along with Minister of State Hackett who has responsibility for the sector, will continue to progress the implementation of the National Organic Strategy 2019-2025 which sets out ambitious growth targets for the sector by aligning it closely with market opportunities. </p>  <p>  The current Programme for Government has set a new target for organic farming, to meet evolving consumer trends in this area. While the EU Commission&rsquo;s objective of reaching at least 25% of the EU&rsquo;s agricultural land under organic farming by 2030 is highly ambitious, there is a commitment to align Ireland&rsquo;s organic land area with that of the current EU average of approximately 7.5% over the lifetime of this Government. The Programme aims to focus on developing domestic and international organic markets, to ensure that farmers have access to premium-paying markets for their produce.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government also focuses particularly on maximising potential opportunities in the organic sector, the supply of quality Irish grains to an expanding food and drinks industry, and opportunities for home-grown proteins in animal feeds.</p>  <p>  The European Commission&rsquo;s Farm to Fork Strategy acknowledges the market for organic food is set to continue growing and organic farming needs to be further promoted. This Strategy recognises that Organic food production has a positive impact on biodiversity and creates jobs opportunities in rural communities.  </p>  <p>  With the re-opening of the Organic Processing Investment Grant Scheme, together with the reopening of the Organic Farming Scheme earlier this year, we are delivering on the Department&rsquo;s Action Plan 2021 targets for further supporting and developing the organic sector.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-06-22a.1682.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021062200088#WREE01100"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 639 and 640 together.</p>  <p>There are likely to be many factors which affect the decisions by landowners not to proceed to planting, despite having received a licence to do so.  In the first place, licences remain in place for three years and circumstances may change in that time. Land may change hands or other land-use opportunities may be availed of, and indeed, some licences may be purely speculative from the outset.  </p>  <p>  I acknowledge that delays in issuing licences for thinning and felling may have some part to play in influencing planting decisions. I take very seriously the need to improve licensing output and it an issue of the utmost importance for Minister of State Hackett, who has responsibility for forestry, and myself.  </p>  <p>  In this regard, Project Woodland, which was launched in February this year, has been set up with the objective of reviewing and improving  the efficiency and effectiveness of the forestry licensing system, as well as the creation of a shared national vision for forestry and the development of a new Forest Strategy. </p>  <p>  Two working groups in particular are looking at the licensing situation. Working Group 1 is tasked with looking at the backlog.  This Group  has examined in detail the cases on hand and is producing specific recommendations for improving output, including a definition of the backlog, which will be brought to the Project Board for consideration. Working Group 4 is concentrating on licensing process improvement. A business analyst has commenced work on an end-to-end process review.  In addition, proposals for a pre-application process and a planning grant  are under development  and will be submitted to the Project Board shortly. The Group is also actively considering how best to conduct a regulatory review of the licensing system. </p>  <p>While these initiatives are being worked on, we continue to issue licences and engage in a process of continuous improvement. The extra resources invested in and new streamlined procedures for dealing with appropriate assessment cases have resulted in gains in output. To 18th June, a total of 1,594 licences have issued, which is  27%  ahead of the same period last year.  In terms of timber volumes, the  Department has issued licences for 3.14 million cubic metres. Overall, 971 tree felling licences have issued to date, of which 47% are private felling licences.  I expect to maintain this momentum for the rest of the year and to reach the target of issuing 4,500 licences, which is a 75% increase on last year&rsquo;s licencing output. </p>  <p>  Communication is another important aspect of Project Woodland and Working Group 3 is working on a new Customer Charter for forestry, and the development of a communication strategy. A review of the organisational structure of the forestry division within the Department will also be carried out and the roles and interaction with COFORD, Teagasc and Coillte will be examined.</p>  <p>  Working Group 2 is also developing a public engagement strategy as part of the development of the new Forest Strategy. It is envisaged that all stakeholders in the forestry sector as well as the general public will be included in this process, and this should help identify both opportunities and barriers to afforestation.  Furthermore, Irish Rural Link has been commissioned by Minister Hackett to conduct a study to determine the level  and type of engagement of communities with forestry and to make recommendations for the future. </p>  <p>  The Forestry Policy group is meeting later this week at which a full update on progress to date will be provided to all stakeholders.</p>  <p>  I believe that the framework now in place under Project Woodland will deliver on its objectives and I am hopeful that this will provide encouragement to farmers and landowners to go into forestry, or to realise the planting licences they have already received,  and to avail of the attractive premiums available under the Department&rsquo;s Schemes. It is a land-use which can be complementary to a productive farming enterprise, and can provide a valuable additional income support stream.</p>  <p>  The Department is also working to ensure that there is integration between Agri-Environment schemes in CAP and the new Forestry Programme.  It is intended that tree planting measures will form part of the new Agri-Environment schemes.  The transitional REAP scheme (a results-based payment approach for grasslands) has for instance tree planting as a complementary action.</p>  <p>  In conclusion, I would like to re-iterate my commitment to forestry and to delivering a service and conditions that will benefit all those involved in the sector and, in particular, landowners and farmers.</p></reply>

This applies equally to Coillte and private applicants.   </p>  <p>  The Department has recently updated its advice to applicants and their advisers on the important role which good quality harvest plans can play in the processing of their licences. This issued last week in the form of a circular to the trade. It is important that all stakeholders study the circular and respond accordingly when making submissions.</p></reply>

Initially, as REAP is a pilot initiative, we were limited to 2,000 places. However, the participation numbers in the project have been increased following engagement with the EU Commission. Now, almost 5,000 farmers will be supported to undertake environmental commitments to increase the environmental value of existing farm features. This figure is more than double the original participation figure envisioned.  </p>  <p>  As REAP was oversubscribed, a ranking and selection process was used to assess applications. This process considered the presence of priority water areas, (as defined by the EPA), and the proportion of Natura and ANC land on the holding. Farmers without Natura on their holding were eligible to apply for REAP and I can advise that some of those applicants were approved to the pilot. </p>  <p>  I can also confirm that an application was received for the persons named. The details of the selection process is outlined in section 10 of the REAP terms and conditions. Any farmer who receives notification to state their application has been unsuccessful may request a review of this decision by writing to the REAP Section at the Department. Full details of the review option and contact details are included in the correspondence that has issued.</p></reply>

The scheme is funded by my Department and is administered through the Local Authorities.</p><p>There was no funding for the Local Improvement Scheme for a number of years until it was relaunched in 2017. Since then, over &euro;68 million  has been allocated to deliver the scheme on over 2,400 roads. The Scheme has benefited over 10,000 residents and landowners. I have indicated previously that I am actively exploring the potential to allocate further funding for the Local Improvement Scheme later this year, resources permitting.</p><p>My Department is not in a position to state the number of eligible LIS roads currently on waiting lists in Local Authorities. My Department does not collect such information on an ongoing basis as it is a matter for each Local Authority to prioritise and select roads for inclusion in the Scheme in any given year, subject to overall policy guidance and funding from my Department. My Department has previously requested an indication of the number of road applications with Local Authorities. However, further engagement with the Local Authorities would be required to arrive at a definitive position and it is likely that the position is quite fluid from year to year. </p><p>Finally, as requested by the Deputy, I have set out in the following table a breakdown, by county, of the number of roads completed in each year and the total funding provided for these roads. This refers to the funding provided from 2017-2020; it does not incorporate the &euro;10.5 million provided in 2021 as this is currently being delivered at Local Authority level. </p><p><b>Number of LIS Roads Upgraded 2017-2020 Amt. of Funding</b> <table>    <tr>       <th></th>       <th>2017</th>       <th>2018</th>       <th>2019</th>       <th>2020</th>       <th>TOTAL</th>       <th>(&euro;m)</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Carlow </td>       <td>20</td>       <td>28</td>       <td>14</td>       <td>15</td>       <td>77</td>       <td>&euro;1.469</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cavan </td>       <td>10</td>       <td>12</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>30</td>       <td>&euro;1.510</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Clare </td>       <td>28</td>       <td>30</td>       <td>12</td>       <td>12</td>       <td>82</td>       <td>&euro;2.867</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork </td>       <td>21</td>       <td>62</td>       <td>20</td>       <td>18</td>       <td>121</td>       <td>&euro;4.652</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Donegal </td>       <td>164</td>       <td>107</td>       <td>35</td>       <td>35</td>       <td>341</td>       <td>&euro;6.531</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway </td>       <td>57</td>       <td>69</td>       <td>36</td>       <td>30</td>       <td>192</td>       <td>&euro;5.025</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerry </td>       <td>41</td>       <td>61</td>       <td>21</td>       <td>10</td>       <td>133</td>       <td>&euro;3.545</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>12</td>       <td>8</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>24</td>       <td>&euro;0.830</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilkenny </td>       <td>16</td>       <td>16</td>       <td>9</td>       <td>6</td>       <td>47</td>       <td>&euro;1.863</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Laois </td>       <td>20</td>       <td>15</td>       <td>7</td>       <td>7</td>       <td>49</td>       <td>&euro;1.881</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Leitrim </td>       <td>18</td>       <td>24</td>       <td>11</td>       <td>10</td>       <td>63</td>       <td>&euro;1.538</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick </td>       <td>17</td>       <td>22</td>       <td>13</td>       <td>8</td>       <td>60</td>       <td>&euro;1.997</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Longford </td>       <td>17</td>       <td>25</td>       <td>15</td>       <td>10</td>       <td>67</td>       <td>&euro;1.275</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth </td>       <td>8</td>       <td>6</td>       <td>6</td>       <td>8</td>       <td>28</td>       <td>&euro;1.000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mayo </td>       <td>86</td>       <td>144</td>       <td>74</td>       <td>53</td>       <td>357</td>       <td>&euro;4.673</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Meath </td>       <td>22</td>       <td>21</td>       <td>12</td>       <td>5</td>       <td>60</td>       <td>&euro;1.900</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Monaghan</td>       <td>21</td>       <td>28</td>       <td>14</td>       <td>9</td>       <td>72</td>       <td>&euro;1.407</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Offaly </td>       <td>20</td>       <td>31</td>       <td>9</td>       <td>14</td>       <td>74</td>       <td>&euro;1.879</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Roscommon </td>       <td>41</td>       <td>91</td>       <td>21</td>       <td>27</td>       <td>180</td>       <td>&euro;1.952</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Sligo </td>       <td>16</td>       <td>22</td>       <td>7</td>       <td>6</td>       <td>51</td>       <td>&euro;1.615</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Tipperary </td>       <td>9</td>       <td>32</td>       <td>21</td>       <td>20</td>       <td>82</td>       <td>&euro;2.241</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Waterford </td>       <td>17</td>       <td>20</td>       <td>3</td>       <td>5</td>       <td>45</td>       <td>&euro;1.843</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Westmeath </td>       <td>23</td>       <td>22</td>       <td>12</td>       <td>12</td>       <td>69</td>       <td>&euro;1.636</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wexford </td>       <td>18</td>       <td>17</td>       <td>11</td>       <td>13</td>       <td>59</td>       <td>&euro;1.666</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wicklow </td>       <td>7</td>       <td>15</td>       <td>10</td>       <td>6</td>       <td>38</td>       <td>&euro;1.543</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>TOTAL </td>       <td>717</td>       <td>932</td>       <td>405</td>       <td>347</td>       <td>2,401</td>       <td>&euro;58.340</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>
