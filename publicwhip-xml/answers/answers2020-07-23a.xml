The Programme for Government &ndash; Our Shared Future indicates that this provision will not be extended beyond that date.</p>  <p>  The original extension took account of the findings of an External Review Group which undertook the review on the operation of the SHD arrangements.  This report, which was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, particularly highlighted that while they had generally been a success in providing a fast-track development consent process for developers of large-scale housing developments, the number of SHD permissions that have commenced development is less than might have been expected. </p>  <p>  In this regard, with a view to influencing the earlier activation of housing related planning permissions, the new Programme for Government &ndash; Our Shared Future commits to introducing a "use it or lose it" condition for all planning permissions of ten units or more.  I intend that the necessary legislation providing for the introduction of the proposed new "use it or lose it" housing-related planning arrangements will be progressed over the coming months.</p></reply>

Of this 982 were under build, acquisition or leasing schemes. </p>  <p>  I intend to target new build social housing in particular, and there are big opportunities for Louth. The total established pipeline of activity under Rebuilding Ireland for Louth at end 2019 was some 1,229 homes across 129 sites, consisting of 663 completed homes and 566 more moving through various stages of approval and getting on-site. I want to work with Louth County Council to expand and accelerate this programme.</p>  <p>  In terms of affordable housing, I will outline my detailed plans in the Autumn having consulted with delivery partners and reviewed progress to date. I would like to see all local authorities, where there is an affordability challenge, engaging with this process and bringing forward ambitious proposals.</p></reply>

There is also provision for the exemption of community halls, which are not licensed to sell alcohol and where the facilities are not used for profit. </p>  <p>  However, the Act provides that where an organisation or club is registered under the Registration of Clubs (Ireland) Act 1904, and is licensed to sell alcohol, all the club buildings, wherever located, are rateable in their entirety. </p>  <p>  As I previously indicated, a waiver of commercial rates was announced earlier this year to all businesses and to the type of clubs referred to by the Deputy, that had been forced to close due to public health requirements, from 27 March 2020, for a three-month period. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that in terms of commercial rates, my Department has been working with colleagues in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on a package of support for local authorities and businesses, including those referred to by the Deputy, in terms of the treatment of commercial rates out to the end September, in the context of the July stimulus package. </p>  <p>  This package will be considered by Government this afternoon and an announcement will follow.</p></reply>

The planning system facilitates the regulation of such short-term letting uses undertaken by the individual carrying out the activity, i.e. the owner/occupier of the house or apartment, rather than the online platforms advertising such properties. </p>  <p>  Under Budget 2020, &euro;2.5m was made available to support planning authorities in the implementation and enforcement of the short-term letting legislation. My Department has been in contact with each of the relevant local authorities in which RPZs are located throughout the year, and has requested regular updates on the enforcement and implementation of the Short Term Letting (STL) Regulations. Notwithstanding the impacts that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the workforce and workload of local authorities over recent months, as well as on the short-term letting market itself, this enforcement and implementation has continued to the extent possible.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government - Our Shared Future includes the specific action to strengthen the regulatory and enforcement mechanisms with regard to short-term lettings, and the approach in this regard will be considered over the coming months.</p></reply>

This Bill will provide the legislative basis for Ireland's new marine planning regime, which includes forward planning, development management and enforcement. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to enact this legislation in nine months and this timeframe reflects the priority that this legislation has been accorded.</p>  <p>  Since the publication of the General Scheme in January, the focus is on further policy development work on the development of certain aspects of the proposed regime and engagement is continuing with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, other Departments and agencies on the drafting of the legal text. </p>  <p>  In terms of next steps, it is intended that Government approval will be sought for certain changes and improvements to the General Scheme.  It is further, expected that General Scheme will be subject to pre-legislative scrutiny of the General Scheme.  These are necessary steps to facilitate the conclusion of drafting and the publication of the Bill.</p></reply>

The legislative underpinning for the Scheme is provided by Part 3 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014 and associated regulations.</p>  <p>  As part of a package of social housing reforms, the Programme for Government commits to maintaining the right of social housing tenants to purchase their home, but signals changes to the current terms of the Scheme, such as requiring tenants to be in situ for 10 years, reduction of the discount to a maximum of 25%, and providing that local authorities will have the first call on purchase of the house. </p>  <p>  In line with the commitment given in the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan on Housing and Homelessness, a review of the operation of the first 12 months of the Tenant (Incremental) Purchase Scheme 2016 has been finalised and a full report has been prepared setting out findings and recommendations. </p>  <p>  I will consider the findings of the Review alongside the commitments in the Programme for Government. The changes outlined in the Programme for Government will necessitate amendments to both primary and secondary legislation and I would hope to be in a position to make those changes as soon as possible.</p></reply>

In this regard, I understand that Bord na M&oacute;na has recently been granted leave by An Bord Plean&aacute;la to apply for substitute consent in respect of its peat extraction operations and has subsequently submitted applications to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for substitute consent to regularise the planning status of its historic peat extraction. </p>  <p>  I note that where substitute consent is granted for such development, this consent only regularises past work that has been carried out. Separate planning permissions for future development, as well as an integrated pollution control (IPC) licences from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), would be required, in addition to the substitute consents.  The IPC licencing process is separate from the planning system and is administered by the EPA, which is under the aegis of the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment.</p>  <p>  Section 30 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 specifically precludes the Minister of Housing, Planning and Local Government from exercising any power or control in relation to any particular planning case with which a planning authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la, is or may be concerned.  Therefore, I am not in a position to comment further on the substitute consent applications or future planning applications by Bord Na M&oacute;na.</p></reply>

Since 2016, the numbers have decreased from 91,600 to 68,693, a reduction of 25%.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to delivering more than 50,000 further social homes, with an emphasis on new builds, and to focus on the delivery of affordable homes.

However, Kerry County Council is actively working with all stakeholders to ensure that any delays are kept to an absolute minimum and that badly needed projects proceed with a view to completion in the most timely manner possible.  </p>  <p>  Since taking up office in late June, I established a High Level Housing Delivery Group of key stakeholders, consisting of representatives of the County and City Manager&rsquo;s Association, the Housing Delivery Co-ordination Office, the Housing Agency, the Irish Council of Social Housing and the Housing Alliance, to drive social housing delivery in 2020, taking account of the impact of Covid-19.  All efforts are being made to make up any lost ground and to avail of delivery opportunities.</p>  <p>   In addition, I have recently launched a campaign in conjunction with the Housing Agency entitled &ldquo;Call for Housing 2020&rdquo; which is a new national call for property owners and developers with vacant properties to make them available to other during this time, in order to optimise the opportunities to deliver new homes immediately.</p></reply>

My Department supports the fire authorities through setting general policy, providing a central training programme, issuing guidance on operational and other related matters and providing capital funding for equipment and priority infrastructural projects.</p><p>In February 2016, my Department announced a five-year Fire Services Capital Programme with an allocation of &euro;40 million, based on an annual &euro;8 million allocation, to be used for the purchase of fire appliances and specialist equipment, building or upgrading of prioritised Fire Stations, an upgrade of the Communications and Mobilisation system and improvements to Training Centres. </p><p>The five-year programme proposed the construction/refurbishment of twenty six fire stations. This included sixteen new builds and ten upgrade/refurbishment projects. Details of the programme are available on my Department's website at the following link: </p><p>www.housing.gov.ie/local-government/fire-and-emergency-management/funding/minister-kelly-announces-new-40-million-euro.</p><p>In order to maximise the available Capital Programme funding, my Department re-assesses the status of projects in the Programme on an annual basis, and some flexibility is normally available to advance projects that are ready and that offer best value-for-money taking account of the state of readiness of projects more generally. </p><p>A total of &euro;46.72m has been spent under 2016 - 2020 Programme to date: &euro;13.55m for new and upgraded fire stations; &euro;14.36m for new fire appliances and &euro;18.81m for other vehicles and equipment.</p><p>Fire station projects completed under the Programme include Drumshanbo, Ballinamore, Templemore, Virginia, Tuam, Graiguenmanagh, Ferbane and Carraroe; with refurbishments at Longford, Ennis, Kilrush and Ennistymon; as well as upgrades of Hacketstown, Clonmel and Dundalk Training Centres. </p><p>A new capital programme for the period 2021-2025 is currently being finalised. Following extensive engagement with fire authorities a number of proposals for station works etc have been received. The  proposals will be evaluated and prioritised on the basis of the:</p><p>-  Area Risk Categorisation of the fire station (population, fire risks, etc.)</p><p>-  Established Health and Safety needs</p><p>-  State of development of the project (is site acquired, etc.) and </p><p>-  Value for money offered by the proposal.</p><p>In recognition of the current economic situation faced by the State as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the speed and extent to which proposed expenditure can stimulate local economies will also be a key consideration in the first few years of the new programme.</p><p>I hope to be in a position to make an announcement on this new programme in the near future.</p></reply>

Under the stewardship of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, the Fund was established to support more compact and sustainable development, through the regeneration and rejuvenation of Ireland&rsquo;s five cities and other large towns, in line with the objectives of the National Planning Framework and National Development Plan (NDP).  This is to enable a greater proportion of residential and mixed-use development to be delivered within the existing built-up footprints of our cities and towns and to ensure that more parts of our urban areas can become attractive and vibrant places in which people choose to live and work, as well as to invest and to visit.</p>  <p>  As part of the first call for proposals under the URDF Waterford City and County Council submitted a bid for exchequer grant funding in respect of a major multifaceted project for the North Quays, Waterford, an area designated as a Strategic Development Zone (SDZ).</p>  <p>  It is intended that the largely transport focussed infrastructural works involved will open up the North Quays site, make it more accessible, and ultimately support the achievement of the broader objectives of the SDZ planning scheme.</p>  <p>  On 26 November 2018, the then Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government announced initial URDF support of &euro;100m for a total of 88 projects across the country, including &euro;6m of initial support for the Waterford North Quays Project.  Furthermore, in June 2019, URDF support of &euro;30m was ring-fenced in respect of the advancement of the overall North Quays Project, pending further clarification of the project detail.  </p>  <p>  This is a very complex and high value project in a strategic development zone, and so it is critical that careful consideration is given to its planning and development, and also in order to establish the correct combination of supports required to facilitate its successful advancement and completion.  At this stage, the project composition, costs, sequencing, and requisite supports must be further clarified so that the appropriate level of &lsquo;whole project&rsquo; URDF support can be established.</p>  <p>  While the advancement of the North Quays Project is, in the first instance, a matter for Waterford City and County Council, my Department is continuing to engage with the local authority to assist further progress on the development of this important project.  </p>  <p>  With regard to the timing of URDF funding, my Department has already recouped &euro;5.7m in respect of costs incurred by Waterford City and County Council on the planning and development of this project, and further funding will be made available as the project advances through its various stages of development.</p></reply>

All local authorities are receiving and processing RIHL applications and are incorporating increased flexibility to accommodate applicants during the COVID 19 Pandemic.  </p>  <p>  As is the case with any lender, local authorities must lend mortgages on prudent basis, taking into account the most recent income and employment data available. This is both for the protection of the lender and the borrower, in particular to seek to ensure that borrowers are not left with unsustainable debt burdens, as a mortgage is a long-term commitment and it would not be appropriate to lend when there is a identifiable risk that the person&rsquo;s income and ability to pay might not return to the level required to support the borrowing requested.</p>  <p>  The Covid-19 situation has had an unprecedented economic impact and unfortunately some applicants for the RIHL have been affected. In order to address this issue, my Department has issued guidance on 21 May to local authorities on the process for dealing with applicants already in the application/approval process whose economic circumstances have changed for the worse. These options could include reducing, suspending or withdrawing the amount that can be borrowed. However, there is no one size fits all approach, it depends on the individual circumstances.</p>  <p>  Nevertheless, the fact that an applicant&rsquo;s income is supported by the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) is a factor that must be taken into account. As noted on Revenue&rsquo;s website, employers&rsquo; participation in the scheme is &lsquo;a declaration which states that, based on reasonable projections, there will be, as a result of disruption to the business caused or to be caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, a decline of at least 25% in the future turnover of, or customer orders for, the business for the duration of the pandemic and that as a result the employer cannot pay normal wages and outgoings fully but nonetheless wants to retain its employees on the payroll.&rsquo;  Given that the ability to repay a mortgage is based upon a careful assessment of an applicant&rsquo;s employment situation, the fact that their employer has declared that they are unable to pay normal wages must be taken into consideration. </p>  <p>  Therefore, on 6 July, my Department issued a Circular including additional guidance on the treatment of persons whose employers avail of the TWSS as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. Where such persons are approved for a RIHL loan, draw down would not commence until their unsupported income post TWSS has returned to the level specified in the original application for a period of time, usually up to three months. This is line with the requirement to lend prudently. Local authorities can, however, use their judgement and knowledge of local employers to advance loans to applicants before the end of this three-month period, where appropriate. </p>  <p>  There are exceptions to this approach. </p>  <p>  In the case of a joint application where only one party is on TWSS, the application can also proceed to drawdown if repayment capacity can be assured based on the other person&rsquo;s income.</p>  <p>  For applicants whose post-TWSS income is lower (e.g. due to reduced hours) than stated on their application, their application can be re-assessed to determine the most appropriate borrowing amount for them.</p>  <p>  In addition, persons currently on the TWSS can continue to apply for a RIHL mortgage based on their pre-TWSS 19 Income.  This will provide clarity to applicants regarding their eligibility for the loan and will enable them to commence the property search.</p>  <p>  Therefore, it is not correct to state that there is a blanket ban on the drawdown of RIHL loans for persons on TWSS. The Guidance of 21 May and the Circular of 6 July are complementary and will remain the approach for local authorities to take.</p></reply>

I recently had a videoconference meeting with the Chief Executive&rsquo;s all of the local authorities during which I highlighted these key priorities.</p>  <p>Since taking up office in late June, I established a High Level Homelessness Taskforce, to provide a forum for engagement with key organisations working to address homelessness. The Taskforce will input on the implementation of the commitments on homelessness in the Programme for Government. </p>  <p>In addition, I have convened a High Level Housing Delivery Group of key stakeholders, consisting of representatives of the County and City Manager&rsquo;s Association, the Housing Delivery Co-ordination Office, the Housing Agency, the Irish Council of Social Housing and the Housing Alliance, to drive social housing delivery in 2020, taking account of the impact of Covid-19.  All efforts are being made to make up any lost ground and to avail of delivery opportunities.</p>  <p>In this context, I recently launched a campaign in conjunction with the Housing Agency entitled &lsquo;Call for Housing 2020&rsquo; which is a new national call for property owners and developers with vacant properties to make them available to other during this time, in order to optimise the opportunities to deliver new homes immediately.</p>  <p>As Minister, I intend to have continuous engagement on housing related matters with all local authorities, including Cavan, Monaghan and Meath, and I aim to visit as many Councils as possible over the coming months.</p>  <p>My Department's officials also meet regularly with local authority housing teams, both individually and collectively, to discuss progress in terms of social housing delivery. Recently such meetings have been held via videoconference; specifically with Monaghan County Council on 21st April and Cavan and Meath County Councils on 21st May.  Further engagements will take place regularly over the rest of the year.</p></reply>

[16507/20] and [17528/20] of 21 and 22 July, 2020, respectively.</p>  <p>  Since 1 January 2014, Irish Water has statutory responsibility for all aspects of water services planning, delivery and operation at national, regional and local levels. The Irish Water Strategic Funding Plan 2019-2024 sets out Irish Water&rsquo;s multi-annual strategic business planning funding requirement of &euro;11bn to 2024, comprised of a &euro;6.1bn investment in infrastructure and assets, including &euro;1.9bn for waste water, and &euro;4.9bn in operating costs. In regard to overall investment, the Programme for Government states that the Government will fund Irish Water's capital investment plan for drinking water and wastewater infrastructure on a multi-annual basis and deliver the &euro;8.5 billion funding package committed to in Project Ireland 2040. This overall funding commitment is key to addressing Ireland's shortcomings in water and waste water infrastructure, including those aspects which are subject to European Commission infringement action.</p>  <p>  As a regulated utility, overall Irish Water expenditure is subject to approval by the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities, while in turn the funding provided by the Exchequer to Irish Water in relation to domestic water services is subject to the annual Budget and Estimates process. The voted provision of almost &euro;1.2 billion included in my Department's 2020 Estimates in respect of Irish Water&rsquo;s domestic water services operational and capital expenditure in 2020 is &euro;74m less that the original Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) determination of Irish Water approved revenue for 2020 which was published in December 2019.</p>  <p>  In making its decision in December 2019, the CRU withheld its determination on the full capital allowance for the revenue control period 2020-24. The CRU will shortly make its full determination on Irish Water's total capital allowance for this period within the coming weeks. Irish Water's future annual exchequer funding amount will continue to be determined through the annual Budget and Estimates process, having regard to the forthcoming CRU revenue determination.</p>  <p>  Further detail in relation to the breakdown of Irish Water's capital investment should be sought from Irish Water. It may be helpful to note that Irish Water has established a dedicated team to deal with representations and queries from public representatives. The team can be contacted via email at Oireachtasmembers@water.ie or by telephone on a dedicated number, 1890 578 578.</p></reply>

Of the 30 projects, Kildare County Council has confirmed that its project on the Naas Inner Relief Road will not now progress, although an element of the housing that was associated with the project has taken place.</p>  <p>  Details of the approvals by local authority area, budget allocation, project description and projected housing delivery are available at www.rebuildingireland.ie/LIHAF.</p>  <p>  Currently, 3 LIHAF projects have completed infrastructure construction. Of the remaining 26, up to the end of June 2020 (and excluding the Naas project), 14 projects have been approved to go to, or are already at, infrastructure construction stage and one is expected to have tender approval and go to construction before the end of Q4 2020.  Local authorities have indicated that work is progressing on the remainder.  </p>  <p>  It&rsquo;s important to note that LIHAF projects involve complex, large scale public infrastructure developments which pave the way for associated housing development.  This requires extensive design, planning, public consultation and procurement processes in advance of the projects moving to construction.</p></reply>

Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) form a key element in the delivery of social housing in Ireland and have a well demonstrated capacity in both the construction of new homes and in the areas of property and tenancy management.  </p>  <p>  Approved Housing Bodies are now involved in the initial phase of Cost Rental projects. Respond and Tuath, two of the largest Tier-3 AHBs, are jointly leading the delivery of 50 Cost Rental homes at Enniskerry Road, Stepaside, D&uacute;n Laoghaire&ndash;Rathdown, as part of a mixed-tenure development that also includes 105 traditional social homes. The AHBs are being supported in this work by DLR County Council, the Housing Agency, the Housing Finance Agency, and my Department. This is the first Cost Rental development in the State and construction began in July 2019, with completion provisionally scheduled for Q3 2021, prior to the onset of Covid-19.</p>  <p>  Earlier this year, representatives of the Housing Alliance, a group of six of the largest AHBs, met with my Department to discuss ways to make rental more affordable for households with income above social housing limits. These proposals have fed into the ongoing work of the inter-departmental/agency Cost Rental Working Group, which is developing methods for the consistent and sustainable delivery of Cost Rental at scale. I view the AHBs as potentially being key partners in this area and look forward to engaging with them further as we advance Cost Rental. However, I do not envisage that much needed social housing would be used for this purpose.</p></reply>

Cost Rental is not intended to overlap with or replace traditional social housing for low-income households</p>  <p>  In 2019 an inter-departmental multi-agency Cost Rental Working Group was convened in order to assess methods for the consistent and sustainable delivery of Cost Rental at scale. The Group brings together representatives of relevant Government Departments, State agencies, and local government. The Group is evaluating potential funding models and operational matters such as tenant eligibility.</p>  <p>  This work will be assisted by a recently initiated research consultancy sponsored by the European Investment Bank on behalf of my Department. The EIB has extensive experience in supporting the delivery of affordable housing across Europe and the Report is scheduled for completion in December.</p>  <p>  Ireland's first Cost Rental development is currently under construction at Enniskerry Road, Stepaside, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown. The project is being undertaken by two Approved Housing Bodies, Tuath and Respond, with the assistance of DLR County Council. The mixed-tenure development comprises 50 Cost Rental homes alongside 105 social housing homes. </p>  <p>  A second pilot project sponsored by my Department is under development for a site at Emmet Road, Inchicore (the former St Michael&rsquo;s Estate). The project is being led by Dublin City Council, which owns the site. The project is currently at the design stage.</p>  <p>  Another proposed Cost Rental development is at Shanganagh Castle, Shankill, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, where DLR County Council is working in partnership with the Land Development Agency on the Council-owned site. On 13 July planning permission was granted to develop 597 homes on this site of which it is anticipated approximately 300 will be cost rental housing which will be provided alongside Affordable Purchase and social housing homes.</p>  <p>  These three developments utilise public lands for Cost Rental housing. This allows the homes on these sites to benefit from lower land costs, which assist in lowering the rent ultimately paid by the tenants, while also retaining the homes for this purpose into the longer term.</p>  <p>  I plan to outline further details around "Cost Rental" in the Autumn taking on board the input from the aforementioned Group and the experience from the pilot projects, as part of a broader announcement on affordable housing. </p></reply>

This includes the potential for a &lsquo;Shared Accommodation&rsquo; or &lsquo;Co-Living&rsquo; format, which comprises professionally managed rental accommodation, where living accommodation, that may comprise individual rooms, is rented within an overall development, that must also include access to shared or communal facilities and amenities, but not shared bathroom or toilet facilities.</p>  <p>  Between 2018 and June 2020, only a small number of co-living bedspaces were approved by An Bord Plean&aacute;la under the Strategic Housing Development application process and there have been no such developments completed in Dublin to date.

The planning system facilitates the regulation of such short-term letting uses undertaken by the individual carrying out the activity, i.e. the owner/occupier of the house or apartment, rather than the online platforms. </p>  <p>  Under this Short-Term Letting legislation applicable in rent pressure zones:</p>  <p>  -  Short term letting is defined as the letting of a house or apartment, or part of a house or apartment, for any period not exceeding 14 days.</p>  <p>  -  Homesharing (the letting of a room or rooms in a person&rsquo;s principal private residence) continues to be permissible on an unrestricted basis and is exempted from the new planning requirements.</p>  <p>  -  Homesharers are allowed to sub-let their entire principle private residence (house or apartment) on a short term basis for a cumulative period of</p>  <p>  -  90 days where they are temporarily absent from their home.</p>  <p>  -  Where the 90 day threshold is exceeded, change of use planning permission is required.</p>  <p>  If a person homeshares their principal private residence in a rent pressure zone and wishes to avail of the new planning exemptions, they need to register this with their local planning authority and fulfil specified reporting obligations.</p>  <p>  However, where a person owns a property in a rent pressure zone which is not their principal private residence and intends to let it for short term letting purposes, s/he is required to apply for a change of use planning permission unless the property already has a specific planning permission to be used for tourism or short-term letting purposes.</p>  <p>  The broader regulation of tourism activity, including the possible development of a new regulatory or licensing/registration system for commercial platforms and short-term letting agents, was recommended in the final Working Group report on the regulation of short-term letting. The Programme for Government - Our Shared Future includes the specific action to strengthen the regulatory and enforcement mechanisms with regard to short-term lettings, and the approach in this regard will be considered over the coming months. Though some elements of potential regulation may be outside the remit of my Department, I look forward to engaging with my cabinet colleagues on how best this issue can be tackled jointly.</p></reply>

The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once-off in nature.</p>  <p>  The income bands are expressed in terms of a maximum net income threshold for a single-person household, with an allowance of 5% for each additional adult household member, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%; and 2.5% for each child, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%.</p>  <p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced at that time also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.</p>  <p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support. The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources.</p>  <p>  However, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is under way. The review will also have regard to current initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and cost rental and will be completed when the impacts of these parallel initiatives have been considered.</p></reply>

The National Planning Framework (NPF) is Ireland&rsquo;s long-term national spatial planning strategy to accommodate projected future population and economic growth over a 20-year period to 2040.</p>  <p>  The other principal element of Project Ireland is the current National Development Plan (NDP), which sets out a &euro;116 billion public capital investment envelope in support of the NPF, to 2027. The aligned and shared vision of the NPF in tandem with the NDP, is an integrated, &lsquo;joined-up&rsquo; planning and investment strategy, focused on a series of ten shared national outcomes.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to review of the National Development Plan (NDP) to be brought forward from 2022, to set out an updated NDP for the period to 2031.  The Programme for Government also confirms that the updated NDP will remain aligned with the spatial planning strategy in the NPF.  Accordingly, it is not proposed to review the NPF at this time.</p>  <p>  Further to the NPF, a Regional Spatial and Economic Strategy (RSES) was prepared by the Regional Assembly for the Eastern and Midland Region in 2019.  In accordance with Section 11 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 as amended, review of the Meath County Development Plan must be consistent with both the NPF and the relevant Regional Strategy.  The Meath County Development Plan process is underway.</p>  <p>  In line with all statutory planning processes in Ireland, the Meath County Development Plan process was extended for a period of 8 weeks from late March 2020 further to legislation enacted in response to the Covid 19 pandemic.  This period of extension ceased during May.</p>  <p>  Given that the NPF is not being reviewed at present, that the RSES for the Eastern and Midland Regional Assembly area has been in place since 2019 and that the Meath County Development Plan review is underway, the process will not be stalled in view of the commitment to review and extend the National Development Plan.</p></reply>

The figure of &euro;12.4 million relates to 2019 Exchequer funding and included a provision of &euro;4.5 million for Rented Accommodation Inspection. This funding was a subvention from my Department for local authorities to aid their inspections of private rental accommodation and the enforcement of the minimum standards Regulations.</p>  <p>  From 2004 to 2016, by way of Ministerial Order, a portion of the fee income collected by the RTB for the registration of tenancies was set aside to be allocated to local authorities for the purpose of the performance of their functions under the Housing Acts in relation to private rented accommodation standards inspections. Since 1 July 2016, the RTB has retained 100% of its fee income to defray its costs.</p>  <p>  Since 2018, my Department has used the RTB subhead to provide direct Exchequer funding to local authorities to assist them with their work as it relates to inspections of rental accommodation, with the RTB having no role in either the inspections or the funding.</p>  <p>  In 2019, my Department sought permission from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to have the Rental Accommodation Inspection aspect of the RTB subhead removed and renamed, without affecting the funding provided to the organisation, and to be set up as a separate subhead reflecting the fact that the RTB no longer has a role in the subvention of these local authority inspections.</p>  <p>  Permission was granted and the change took effect in the 2020 Estimates with the creation of the A.25.1 Rental Accommodation Inspection subhead. So while the RTB funding appears to have decreased year on year, it is only because the inspections were included in 2019 and excluded in 2020. The Exchequer funding for operational costs incurred by the RTB has in fact increased by &euro;2m in 2020.</p>  <p>  The provision for rental accommodation inspections has also increased, from &euro;4.5 million in 2019 to &euro;6m this year.</p></reply>

From its introduction in 2012 to the end of June 2020, 691 families have remained in their homes under the Scheme. As of end-June 2020, 1,342 applications were active.</p>  <p>  A review of the MTR scheme undertaken in 2017 introduced a range of improvements to the eligibility criteria and its administration.

In addition, new structures and arrangements were put in place to encourage a greater number of entities to take part in the scheme.</p>  <p>  The implementation of the recommendations of the Review means that MTR is available to provide a long-term solution for more households in mortgage distress, where appropriate.

This funding was initially introduced to tackle long term vacant units and is now increasingly targeted at ensuring minimal turnaround and re-let times for local authority vacant stock. During 2019, expenditure of some &euro;26.6 million was recouped to local authorities under the Voids Programme.</p>  <p>  Cavan County Council has received &euro;1.65 million in funding under the Voids Programme from 2014 to 2019, supporting 137 units being returned to use.

Firstly, on 26 May, there was an initial call for proposals for COVID-19 Voids funding for vacant units which were required for the emergency accommodation of qualified households arising from the need to prevent, limit, minimise or slow the spread of COVID-19. The majority of works approved under this element of the programme are complete. Cavan County Council submitted 8 properties for assessment under the Covid-19 Voids Programme and have received approval for all 8 properties. Monaghan received approval for 6 units. A second call for proposals, under the non-Covid specific voids programme, will issue shortly and any funding submission received from local authorities will be actively considered.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that there is no minimum local contribution sought from LAs under the voids programme and capped funding can optimized to cover 100% of the costs incurred.</p>  <p>  It is also important that local authorities increasingly move toward a preventative maintenance approach to the management of their housing stock and my Department is working with local authorities to this end.</p></reply>

My Department is, however, focused on ensuring that existing housing stock is utilised to its fullest extent including a targeted, effective and co-ordinated approach to identifying and tackling vacancy across Ireland.</p><p>In that context, Pillar 5 of <i>Rebuilding Ireland</i>, set out a range of measures to assist in meeting housing needs by ensuring that our existing housing stock is used to the greatest extent possible. Key to this was the publication of the <i>National Vacant Housing Reuse Strategy</i>, published in 2018, which contains a range of objectives and key actions to be pursued in partnership with stakeholders and agencies across the housing sector to address vacancy in our housing stock.  The Strategy is underpinned by a number of supports and guidance available to bring vacant housing stock back into use including:</p><p><b></b>- <b>The Repair and Leasing Scheme (RLS)</b>, which was to assist private property owners, local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) in utilising existing vacant housing stock throughout the country.  The scheme is targeted at owners of vacant properties who cannot afford or access the funding needed to bring their properties up to the required standard for rental property.  Since its introduction the scheme has facilitated 165 homes being brought back into use and tenanted.</p><p>- <b>The Buy and Renew Scheme</b>particularly focuses on older vacant homes to help tackle the problem of dereliction and improve the appearance of the community.  It provides the option for suitable properties to be purchased rather than leased, if that is the preference of the owners. Since its introduction the Buy &amp;amp; Renew Scheme has facilitated local authorities purchase 529 vacant properties for social housing purposes.</p><p>- In December 2018 my Department published the <b>Bringing Back Homes Manual for the Reuse of Existing Buildings</b>.<b></b>Revitalising our main streets through well-designed refurbishment of residential units, particularly above shops, could help to rejuvenate smaller town centres and city streets as well as produce more houses.  The Bringing Back Homes manual is available to download at www.housing.gov.ie/housing/home-ownership/vacant-homes/bringing-back-homes-manual-reuse-existing-buildings.</p><p>To support this work at local authority level, the Department has secured funding for each local authority to support the work of a Vacant Homes Office. The provision of central funding reinforces the capacity of the Department&rsquo;s Vacant Homes Unit to liaise with and seek information/statistics from a dedicated contact point within each local authority. The Vacant Homes Office plays a key role in the co-ordination of this work within each local authority.</p></reply>

The research paper is focused on rental payment affordability and the potential incidence of arrears during the first three months of the pandemic among non-supported private market renting households, that is, among renting households which do not receive a housing subsidy. Changes in consumption patterns arising from public health measures are also considered in the paper. The preliminary research findings do not identify a significant rent arrears problem emerging during the first three months of the pandemic.</p><p>My Department recently published a Guidance Document on COVID-19 supports for landlords and tenants, which sets out the emergency rental measures and income and other supports available to tenants and landlords during the emergency period.  The Guidance document is available at:</p><p>and a list of Frequently Asked Questions has been developed and is available at:</p><p>The RTB is encouraging all customers who may require assistance or advice, including in relation to any threatened eviction, to contact them via their web chat service as there may be delays to their phone lines during the emergency period. The webchat service can be accessed at the following link: .</p><p>Under the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme, a tenant sources their own accommodation in the private rented market. The tenancy agreement is between the tenant and the landlord and is governed by the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, as amended.  HAP-supported tenancies are afforded the same protections as all private rented tenancies.  The accommodation sourced by tenants should be within the prescribed maximum HAP rent limits, which are based on household size and the rental market within the area concerned.  Each local authority has statutory discretion to agree to a HAP payment up to 20% above the prescribed maximum rent limit in circumstances where it is necessary, because of local rental market conditions, to secure appropriate accommodation for a household that requires it.  It is a matter for the local authority to determine if the application of the flexibility is warranted on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>My Department is aware that some HAP recipients are making payments directly to their landlords, beyond the amount of HAP being paid on their behalf. There is no legislative provision precluding HAP supported households contributing towards the monthly rent to their landlord beyond that of their HAP payment. However, decisions in relation to HAP, including the suitability of HAP accommodation, is solely a matter for the local authority concerned and local authorities have a responsibility to ensure that tenancies are sustainable and are advised not to provide HAP support to tenancies where the household would not be in a position to meet the rental costs being sought.</p><p>Where HAP tenants are not financially impacted by the COVID-19 measures, they are expected to continue to pay their HAP differential rent.  However, if tenants&rsquo; circumstances change, the local authority should reassess those tenants and adjust their differential rent accordingly. Local authorities have been requested to ensure that HAP tenants newly in receipt of DEASP supports be facilitated in remaining in their HAP tenancies. If amendments cannot be made immediately to a tenant&rsquo;s differential rent amount, any arrears accumulating from the date of approval of the new DEASP support should be rectified at a later date.  This will not affect the HAP payment to the landlord.</p><p>The DEASP Rent Supplement scheme continues to play a key role in supporting families and individuals in private rented accommodation, with the scheme currently supporting approximately 20,580 recipients. The scheme provides short-term income support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source. The scheme ensures that renters experiencing a temporary loss of employment during the COVID-19 emergency can continue to meet their rental commitments.</p><p>Until the end of June approximately, 7,000 new customers have been provided Rent Supplement support since the introduction of the former Government&rsquo;s COVID-19 emergency response; in addition, there are currently approximately 940 pending applications awaiting a decision or in the process of providing the necessary documentation to the officer dealing with their claim. The DEASP response to the COVID-19 emergency has ensured the flexibility of the Rent Supplement scheme via specific measures to prevent undue delays in processing applications despite the large number of new cases received over a relatively short timeframe. The 2/3 day turnaround of applications ensures that customers do not build up rent arrears and officers attempt to ensure that a person's rental obligations are met in full.</p><p>The DEASP Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme offers a safety net within the overall social welfare system by providing assistance to those whose means are insufficient to meet their own needs and those of their dependents.  The main purpose of the scheme is to provide immediate and flexible assistance to those in need who do not qualify for payment under other State schemes.  There are several payments within the scheme including once-off exceptional needs payments  which can cover rent arrears.</p><p>Where a person has a change of circumstances, such as a loss of income, they should notify the relevant local authority in the case of a HAP claim, or the DEASP for Rent Supplement to assess the level of any payment that can be made.</p><p>Subject to Cabinet approval, I aim to introduce residential tenancy legislation in the Houses of the Oireachtas before the summer recess to further protect tenants who have been economically impacted by the pandemic.</p></reply>

The report </font>reflects a comprehensive engagement with relevant stakeholders in the region, setting out the analysis of the challenges facing the Midlands region, and for Bord na <font color="#212121">M&oacute;na </font>workers and their families and communities, <font color="#212121">arising from an accelerated exit from peat harvesting. </font><font color="#212121"> </font><font color="#212121">The report contains</font>important recommendations, including examining the renewable energy potential for the two power stations. As stated in the Government response to the Commissioner's report, the Department and ESB will commission a study to examine the potential for using the existing infrastructure in the West Offaly and Lough Ree power plans as an energy hub in the Midlands. </p><p>The decision of the ESB, in November 2019, to close West Offaly and Lough Ree Power stations followed an extensive review of all options and was based on the key planning, climate and commercial issues associated with generation at the sites. My Department has been informed by the company that the current planning permissions for the two sites include an obligation to decommission the power plant and to remediate the sites by the end of 2022 and that, prior to any development opportunity taking place, ESB must satisfy the legal obligation to remediate the existing sites.</p><p>As recommended in the Just Transition Commissioner's progress report, ESB engineering teams are considering alternative uses for which the existing site and facilities might be utilised. However, for clarity, the power plant equipment cannot be used for any purpose beyond December 2020 as neither the planning consents nor environmental licenses cover any such use. </p><p>The Government is acting on a number of the recommendations set out in the Commissioner's report, and is committed to preparing an implementation plan to address the remainder. <font color="#212121">A number of actions to implement the recommendations are already underway. This includes &euro;20 million for a new energy efficiency retrofitting scheme in the Midlands, &euro;5 million for peatland rehabilitation outside of the Bord na M&oacute;na estate, and &euro;6 million for a dedicated new Just Transition Fund with ESB agreeing to contribute an additional &euro;5 million to this Fund. </font></p></reply>

Of course, the Deputy will understand that this obligation on travel agents and tour operators, at a time when there is very little incoming business, is causing severe cash flow difficulties for the sector, many of which are small, local high street businesses.  For that reason, and without cutting across the consumer entitlements provided for in the Directive, the Government introduced a State guarantee for Refund Credit Notes issued for booking cancelled because of Covid-19.  The customer is still entitled to cash, of course, but if they are willing to accept a Refund Credit Note, the State will guarantee its value if the issuer goes out of business, but otherwise the Note can be used against a new booking at another time or redeemed for cash from the issuer in 9 months.  Each customer who chooses to accept the Refund Credit Note helps support a local business, without putting their consumer rights at risk.  Of course, many people are in circumstances where they need their cash back immediately, and that remains their legal entitlement.</p></reply>

We are all in agreement that the aviation industry is crucial to Ireland's long term economic wellbeing, and it will have a very important role to play in our economic recovery.  As the Report confirms, aviation is a large employer in Ireland, is an key enabler of our tourism sector and the global connectivity it provides underpins our position as a small island economy trading successfully on the global stage.  </p>  <p>  The Report contains a number of recommendations aimed at job retention, route supports and supports for our airports, including Shannon Airport.  All of these are being examined and will be considered in the context of the Government's plans to aid broader economic recovery.  I am conscious of the importance of developing measures that get the sector back on its feet as soon as possible, in a safe and sustainable manner.</p>  <p>  I know that Shannon Group has been severely impacted by the economic impacts of COVID-19, and the Group has asked for a range of supports from Government to help mitigate the impact of the crisis on both Shannon Airport and Shannon Heritage.  The Deputy may be aware that Government only recently approved the provision of &euro;6.1m in emergency grant funding to enable Shannon Airport complete its Hold Baggage Screening project. </p>  <p>  I met with the Shannon Group CEO recently, and I am fully aware of the challenges faced by Shannon Airport and Shannon Heritage.  Minister of State Naughton also met with the Chairperson and CEO in recent days and assured them of her ongoing support for Shannon.  It is our intention that the Company will be well positioned operationally to contribute to the post-pandemic recovery, particularly given the importance of Shannon Airport to the economy of the Midwest and Western regions.</p></reply>

All of these figures are subject to error margins which mean that they (particularly for the smaller sports) should be treated with some caution.</p><p>The current National Sports Policy, running from 2018 to 2027 includes measures aimed at increasing the rates of volunteering in sports, led by Sport Ireland. These measures also focus on increasing volunteering among groups currently underrepresented among existing volunteers, with the aim of increasing capacity across the sporting sector.

I understand that about 90% of the commercial bus operators have suspended their services or are providing significantly reduced services at present. My Department has engaged with the Coach Tourism &amp;amp; Transport Council of Ireland (CTTC) on a regular basis in relation to the impact of Covid-19 on licensed bus operators.</p><p>From my Department's engagement with the CTTC, and indeed from the NTA's regular engagement with them throughout the crisis, I understand the very difficult business environment that licensed bus operators are now dealing with.  Indeed, across Government we are acutely aware that Covid-19 presents huge challenges for many business sectors.</p><p>It is critical for the sector to be functioning so that it can carry the passengers that we need to return to work and to other activities as they re-open. Many of these operators provide essential transport services for people who need to get to work and are vital to ensure economic recovery. </p><p>That is why on 25 June the Government approved temporary funding supports, in accordance with EU and national legislation, for the licensed bus sector. Licensed operators provide essential transport services for people who need to get to work and are vital to ensure economic recovery. The support package is aimed at ensuring the continued operation of essential licensed bus services for a period of up to six months. The measure will be restricted to operators where a clear public interest justification supports such intervention and will be targeted at compensating the gap between specified costs and the revenues generated on the services. The National Transport Authority (NTA), as the public transport licensing agency, will administer the support through the establishment of contracts between the NTA and the relevant operators.</p><p>This is, of course, additional to the wider programme of Government supports for impacted businesses were introduced, including new schemes of wage subsidies, rates waivers, re-start grants, lending facilities, equity injection, and business advisory supports for example. </p><p>With the commencement of Phase 3 of the <i>Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business</i>on 29 June 2020, changes to the existing public transport social distancing restrictions were agreed, allowing a move from 2 metres social distancing to utilising 50% of the passenger-carrying capacity of fleet. Alongside this change, the wearing of a face covering when using public transport is now mandatory, with the exception of those who cannot do so for health reasons or due to young age. This will help to underpin public transport services provided by both public and commercial licensed operators during these unprecedented times, with a view to safeguarding public transport capacity in Phases 3 and 4 of the <i>Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business</i>.</p></reply>

Under the EU Package Travel Directive, travel agents and tour operators are required to provide their customers with a full cash refund when a holiday is cancelled due to exceptional circumstances, which of course Covid is.  However, the travel agents and tour operators are having difficulties securing refunds themselves from their suppliers to pass onto their customers, and indeed where flights take place - irrespective whether a travel agent's customer has cancelled - the airlines are not obligated to provide a refund at all.  This is causing considerable financial strain in the travel trade sector.</p>  <p>  The State is providing financial backing for a Refund Credit Note scheme, under which travel agents and tour operators can issue credit notes to their customers instead of cash - if the customer agrees - and the financial value of that credit note is guaranteed by the State.  This is a measure designed to give assurance to consumers about the safety of accepting a credit note, and help the industry alleviate the cash flow drain it is experiencing.   The challenge is to ensure that consumer rights are protected and at the same time that viable business and their workers are kept going.</p>  <p>  Minister of State Hildegarde Naughton has recenty met with representatives of the Irish Travel Agents Association to discuss ongoing issues, and the particular difficulties the sector is facing are well understood. The Government continues to deliberate about concerns around international travel advice and consumer rights are among the issues under discussion. It is not feasible to suspend all flights into/out of Ireland, as essential trade and business travel needs to continue given its importance to the Irish economy.</p></reply>

My Department is maintaining close contact with the Central Bank of Ireland and Banking and Payments Federation Ireland &ndash; the BPFI - as the lending industry works to address the difficulties the Covid-19 situation is causing for both borrowers and lenders. In this context, the Central Bank has advised that it expects all regulated firms to take a consumer-focused approach and to act in their customer's best interests at all times, including during the Covid-19 pandemic. The Central Bank has also advised that it continues to monitor this situation and the impact of COVID-19 very closely to ensure that lenders are continuing to take a consumer-focused approach and are acting in their customers&rsquo; best interests at all times.  </p><p>Lenders continue to process mortgage applications and have supports in place to assist customers impacted by COVID-19. The BPFI has published a Covid-19 support information document which customers can consult, or customers can contact their lender directly, if they have any queries or concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on their mortgage application.</p><p>However, within the parameters of the regulatory framework governing the provision of mortgages, the decision to grant or refuse an individual application for mortgage credit is a commercial decision to be made by the regulated entity and it is not appropriate or possible for me to instruct lenders in that regard.  Also it may be the case that a loan offer from a lender may contain a condition that would allow the lender to withdraw or vary the offer if, in the lender&rsquo;s opinion, there is any material change in circumstances prior to drawdown. In such cases, the decision to withdraw or vary the offer is also a commercial and contractual decision for the lender.</p><p>Regarding the regulations governing mortgage credit, the European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016, which transposed the Mortgage Credit Directive into Irish law, require lenders to make a thorough assessment of the consumer&rsquo;s creditworthiness.  The assessment must take appropriate account of factors relevant to verifying the prospect of the consumer being able to meet his or her obligations under the credit agreement and must be carried out on the basis of information on the consumer&rsquo;s income and expenses and other financial and economic circumstances which is necessary, sufficient and proportionate.  The Regulations further provide that a lender should only make credit available to a consumer where the result of the creditworthiness assessment indicates that the consumer&rsquo;s obligations resulting from the credit agreement are likely to be met in the manner required under that agreement.  In addition, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 imposes &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer and Suitability&rsquo; requirements on lenders.  Under these requirements, lenders are required to assess affordability of credit and the suitability of a product or service based on the individual circumstances of each borrower and in this regard I welcome the recent statement from the pillar banks that they will assess mortgage applications from people in receipt of the temporary wage subsidy scheme on a case by case basis. </p><p>However, if a consumer if not satisfied with the way a regulated entity is dealing with his/her mortgage application or drawdown then, under the provisions of the Central Bank Consumer Protection Code, s/he can make a complaint to the lender.  If the consumer is still unhappy with the position following the outcome of the internal complaints process, then s/he can make a complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO).  Clear information on how to make a complaint to the FSPO may be found at this link: </p><p>.</p></reply>

However, I strongly believe that all sectors must play their role in assisting customers in these difficult times. In view of this, my officials and I have engaged with the insurance industry through Insurance Ireland with regards to motor insurance reliefs during the COVID-19 restrictions. </p>  <p>  At a meeting on 17 April with Insurance Ireland, I called on insurers to be pro-active and generous in relation to their treatment of motor insurance customers during this period. In this regard, I pointed out that a combination of the very profitable part of this market over the last 12 months and what is likely to be a significant reduction in claims for this period due to the travel restrictions that are in place, provided a strong case for premium refunds, thus providing some financial relief to their customers in this extraordinary time. On 24 April, Insurance Ireland announced that a number of their members (Allianz, AXA, FBD, RSA and Zurich) had signed up to commitments on premium reliefs for motor customers.  In addition, Liberty Insurance wrote to me directly informing me of discounts that they would apply to their customers.  </p>  <p>  It would appear that insurers have applied a flat rate across all policyholders rather than looking at the situation in a more granular fashion.  I do understand that a case can be made that those who have been cocooning deserved a larger refund, due to their cars being off the road altogether.  However, the methodology of the premium relief process is a matter outside of my control and it is important to note that each insurer has a different mix of customers and different claims experience and that the financial supports, such as refunds or discounts, applied by each insurance company will reflect their own individual claims experience to date. While, it should also be noted that these are voluntary commitments and neither I, nor the Central Bank, have any role in adjudicating these matters, I continue to expect that all insurers will be pro-active and think of the longer term interests of their market and customers. </p>  <p>  In conclusion, on renewal policyholders have the option to shop around for better prices and service from their insurer and I strongly encourage all consumers to shop around.  In this regard, I believe that consumers will remember and favour those companies that have made steps towards meeting their needs at this difficult time.</p></reply>

The scheme is available to eligible employers across all sectors, excluding the Public Service and Non-Commercial Semi-State Sector. This includes businesses that have closed due to the Covid-19 restrictions and those that continue to operate and employ their workforce. </p><p>As the public health restrictions are eased, the challenge for the economy and enterprises is evolving. Having regard to the novel circumstances surrounding the re-opening of the economy as well as the need to avoid the risk of forcing otherwise viable firms to close, in early June it was announced that the TWSS will remain until the end of August. Work has been ongoing and is at an advanced stage around how best to support employers into the more medium term. The position of various sectors, including the sector mentioned by the Deputy, will be taken into account in this process.  As per the commitment in the Programme for Government, it is planned that the July Jobs Initiative will set out a pathway for the future of the TWSS.</p><p>In relation to other direct support measures, I would draw the Deputy's attention to a recent publication by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, which outlines the key financial supports and resources that are being made available to help all businesses and sectors impacted by Covid-19.

This allowed lenders to quickly to provide substantial and rapid relief to impacted borrowers during a fast moving and evolving public health crisis. While Government has welcomed this important support provided by members of the BPFI for their business and consumer customers, it is ultimately a decision to be made by the individual finance lenders.</p><p>Payment breaks are a widespread support being offered by lenders across the European Union and have been implemented on both a legislative and voluntary basis. The European Banking Authority (EBA) issued guidelines on their operation on 2 April 2020, with the aim of clarifying the regulatory treatment of payment moratoria across the EU.The EBA Guidelines prescribe the criteria which both voluntary and legislative moratoria must meet in order for relevant loans not to be classified as defaulted or otherwise forborne. One of the conditions stipulated is that the moratorium envisages only changes to the schedule of payments, namely by suspending, postponing, or reducing the payments of principal amounts, interest, or of full instalments, for a predefined limited period of time. No other terms and conditions of the loan should be changed. In addition, the application of payment breaks cannot be company specific and must be broadly applied.</p><p>The Central Bank expects all lenders to develop strategies and operational capability to continue to support borrowers who cannot return to full capital and interest after the end of the payment break. This will include offering forbearance as required and restructuring of loans in the event of long-term affordability issues. I would also call on borrowers in this position to engage as early as possible with their lenders.</p></reply>

The construction of new social homes on local authority sites involves the design of the housing being undertaken either by the local authority itself, or by an externally recruited design team working under the local authority's direction.  Once designed, the delivery of the housing is then tendered and contracted to building firms.</p>  <p>  The process of tendering publicly funded construction projects is managed in line with public procurement arrangements.  The precise type and size of the building firms that can tender and win public contracts, cannot be predetermined. Local authorities apply due diligence in selecting the winning tenderer, including being satisfied that the project can be implemented successfully.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to working with the construction sector to ensure the number of new build homes continues to grow to deliver on the ambitious housing programme.  The process of local authority-led designs and building firms being contracted via public tendering arrangements, will play a vital part in delivering on this ambition.</p>  <p>  In addition to local authority designed projects on their own sites, local authorities and AHBs have also worked successfully with the construction sector and with major building firms in getting delivery of new social homes through turnkey solutions.  In many cases, the developments being supported through these turnkey arrangements would not go ahead without the certainty of the end purchaser and they are particularly beneficial where local authorities have limited or no lands available for housing in an area.</p></reply>

The 2011 Regulations do not provide local authorities with any discretion to exceed the limits that apply to their administrative areas.</p><p>  Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI, Universal Social Charge and Pension-Related Deductions within the meaning of Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009. The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once-off in nature.</p><p>  The income bands are expressed in terms of a maximum net income threshold for a single-person household, with an allowance of 5% for each additional adult household member, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%; and 2.5% for each child, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%.</p><p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced at that time also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.</p><p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support. The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources.</p><p>  However, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is underway. The review will also have regard to current initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and cost rental and will be completed when the impacts of these parallel initiatives have been considered.</p></reply>

Section 3.2.3 of the Guidelines suggests that in areas &ldquo;under major urban influence&rdquo;, planning authorities may define &ldquo;rural generated&rdquo; housing need for &ldquo;Persons who are an intrinsic part of the rural community&rdquo; and for &ldquo;Persons working full-time or part-time in rural areas&rdquo;.</p><p>The National Planning Framework (the NPF) and in particular National Policy Objective (NPO) 15 of the NPF fully supports the the sustainable development of rural areas by encouraging growth and arresting decline in areas that have experienced low population growth or decline in recent decades, while simultaneously indicating the need to manage the development of certain areas around cities and towns that are under strong urban influence, in order to avoid over-development of those areas.</p><p>National Policy Objective 15 is supplemented by National Policy Objective 19, which aims to ensure that a policy distinction is made between areas experiencing significant overspill development pressure from urban areas, particularly within the commuter catchment of cities, towns and centres of employment, on the one hand, and other remoter and weaker rural areas where population levels may be low and or declining, on the other.  NPF Policy NPO19 is aligned with the established approach whereby considerations of social (intrinsic part of the community) or economic (persons working full or part time) need may be applied by planning authorities in rural areas under urban influence.</p><p>The 2005 Sustainable Rural Housing Guidelines are framed in the context of the National Spatial Strategy (NSS) 2002.  Given changes in policy since then, as well as other factors, there is merit in reviewing aspects of the  2009 Ministerial Guidelines on Sustainable Rural Housing, which I am considering in the context of broader rural development and settlement. In the meantime, the NPF objectives together with the 2005 Guidelines, enable planning authorities to continue to draft and adopt county development plan policies that enable planning applications to be considered and planning permission to be granted for houses in rural areas.</p></reply>

Local authorities are under a statutory obligation to levy rates on any property used for commercial purposes.</p>  <p>  In order to support the local government sector, my Department continues to keep local authority income, expenditure and cash flow generally under review and will work with all local authorities on both collective and individual issues arising.</p>  <p>  The County and City Management Association (CCMA) has estimated the loss of non-rates income for 2020 to be in the region of &euro;91 million.  This is under consideration by my Department, as part of the revised estimates under preparation.</p>  <p>  It is not possible to accurately calculate the loss of income from commercial rates in 2020 at this stage in the year, due to the range of payment plans available to ratepayers and the variety of payment patterns from different sectors of ratepayers.  This is coupled with the fact that the second moiety has only been due since 1 July and is payable until the end of the year.  Accordingly, the information sought in the question in relation to reduction of rates income for 2020 is not available in my Department.  In order to support the local government sector generally, I will ensure that my Department will continue to keep local authority income, expenditure and cash flow generally under review.</p>  <p>  On 2 May 2020, a waiver of commercial rates was announced to all businesses that have been forced to close due to public health requirements, from 27 March 2020, for a three-month period. The costs involved to be met by the Exchequer.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government - Our Shared Future, commits to reviewing the treatment of commercial rates for the remainder of the year, as a priority action. This process is underway in my Department in the context of the forthcoming July stimulus. The previously announced waiver forms part of this consideration, as does enhancement of the supports available for enterprise.

References to third level courses generally include PLC but the context of any specific reference needs to be considered.</p>  <p>  PLC courses are full time programmes for learners who have completed their second level education, and for adults returning to education. PLC courses aim to provide participants with specific vocational skills and adopt an integrated approach, focusing on technical knowledge, core skills and work experience. Typically, courses last one to two years and are generally at levels 5 and 6 on the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ). </p></reply>

The &euro;168 million package of supports for further and higher education institutions and students, announced this week, includes &euro;15m to assist students to access technology such as laptops and &euro;3m for student mental health and well-being. These supports are additional to work already ongoing in these areas.</p>  <p>  In the area of mental health and well-being, a National Framework on Student Mental Health and Suicide Prevention has recently been developed by a working group, which included representatives from the HEA, USI, National Office of Suicide Prevention, Psychological Counsellors in Higher Education in Ireland, the HSE as well as from the Department. It is expected that the Framework will be published in the coming weeks, thus providing an invaluable resource to the third-level institutions.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2020 funding of &euro;2 million was provided by the Government for student mental health and wellbeing initiatives in the higher education sector. Each higher education institution will benefit from this funding, which will enable them to enhance the range of services they are currently offering to their students. The objective of the initiative is to enhance the capacity, for example by providing funding for the recruitment of additional counsellors, and to reduce waiting time for students by supplementing the funding that institutions already invest in the provision of services to students. </p>  <p>  A working group has been established to examine connectivity issues impacting on further and higher education. The group&rsquo;s key aims are to identify connectivity challenges in relation to broadband, data, networks and devices, to develop solutions for challenges and work through their resolution with third parties and to provide advice and guidance to other groups in relation to technology and connectivity. The group has facilitated the distribution of devices to learners in need, and the provision of student-friendly data packages for those with connectivity issues. It is also exploring longer term provision of devices and student-friendly mobile packages.</p>  <p>  In relation to third-level examinations, higher education institutions are autonomous institutions with regard to management of their academic affairs, including their assessment of students. As such, neither I nor my Department have any role in relation to this particular matter. </p></reply>

Otherwise, he/she would be assessed as a dependent student, i.e. assessed with reference to parental income and address. </p><p>A student&rsquo;s status for grant purposes is defined at their first point of entry to an approved further or higher education course or at their point of re-entry to an approved course following a break in studies of at least three years, and continues to apply for the duration of their studies. </p><p>When considering whether a student meets the conditions to be assessed independently of his or her parents, the grant awarding authority (SUSI) is obliged to satisfy itself beyond doubt that an acceptable degree of proof of independent living in the relevant period has been submitted by the grant applicant. The onus is on the grant applicant to provide the necessary documentary evidence as requested by the grant awarding authority.  </p><p>Applicants who do not meet the criteria to be assessed as an independent student for grant purposes, or who cannot supply the necessary documentation to establish independent living for the required period, may still apply to SUSI to have their grant eligibility assessed as a dependent student. The relevant information, including details of parental income, would be required by SUSI to determine grant eligibility as a dependent student. </p><p>Further information regarding class of applicant (independent or dependent) and the types of documentation accepted as evidence of living independently from parents is available from SUSI&rsquo;s website:  </p><p>If the student in question considers that he has been unjustly refused a student grant or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, he may appeal this decision to SUSI within the statutory time limit of 30 days of his decision letter. </p><p>Where an individual applicant has an appeal turned down in writing by SUSI and remains of the view that the scheme has not been interpreted correctly in his case, an appeal form outlining the position may be submitted online by the applicant to the independent Student Grants Appeals Board within the required timeframe of 30 days.</p></reply>

The purpose of this process is to allow as many students as possible to progress to employment, further education and training, or higher education in a way that is fair and equitable to all Leaving Certificate students. </p><p>When my predecessor announced that students would be provided with the opportunity to receive Calculated Grades, he announced that the results would be as close as possible to the traditional date for release of Leaving Certificate results. At no time was 13 August announced as the date of release of Calculated Grades results.</p><p>On 16 July, I announced that students will receive their Calculated Grades on 7 September. This is the earliest possible release date given the rigorous and robust quality assurance checks required to ensure the process has executed with equity and fairness to all students and to ensure that the 2020 results enjoy the same status as those of previous years. </p><p>CAO first round offers are expected to issue on 11 September 2020.

However while I would hope that accommodation providers would show flexibility to students in the current times, agreements between students and accommodation providers are a private matter and neither I nor my Department have any remit to issue instructions in relation to the rental market.</p></reply>

This week my Department issued payments valued at &euro;97 million to 313,800 people for the pandemic unemployment payment.  This represents a decrease of almost 100,000 in the last 2 weeks.</p><p>To be eligible for the pandemic unemployment payment a person must have been in employment immediately prior to the 13th March and lost their income from employment due to the onset of the pandemic.  Self-employed people must have suffered a collapse in their trading income to the extent that they are available to take up other full-time work.</p><p>A two-level payment structure to link the pandemic unemployment payment to gross prior earnings was recently introduced so that it remains a strong support but is fair and targeted.  Where an employee's gross weekly earnings were &euro;200 or higher there is no change to their rate of payment.  If their gross weekly earnings were under &euro;200 the rate of the pandemic unemployment payment was adjusted to &euro;203.  Where a person is self-employed their average weekly income for 2018 was used to determine their rate of payment for the pandemic unemployment payment.  This is the last tax year for which complete data on self-employed income is available. </p><p>Any person who feels that the assessment of their earnings, based on returns already submitted to Revenue, is inaccurate can ask for a review of their case with further details available on www.gov.ie.</p><p>Where an individual&rsquo;s rate is reduced to the flat rate &euro;203 per week and their family circumstances are that they have adult or child dependents it may be more financially beneficial to apply for a jobseekers payment.  The jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit for the self-employed schemes provide a social insurance contribution-based support for people who have lost work and are unable to find alternative full-time employment.  If a person does not meet the qualifying conditions of the scheme they may be eligible to apply for the means tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance scheme.  The maximum weekly rate of payment for these schemes is &euro;203 and increases may also be paid for any qualifying adults and children.</p><p>The Enterprise Support Grant has recently been extended and will be made available to small business owners who transition from the pandemic unemployment payment to re-open their business.  The grant, of up to &euro;1,000, will be payable to self-employed micro enterprises which employ fewer than 10 people, have an annual turnover of less than &euro;1 million and are not eligible for support from the COVID 19 Business Restart Grant or other similar business reopening grants.  The Department is developing the systems to put it into effect and will communicate how to access the grant in the coming weeks.</p><p>The Government has set employment recovery as its top priority and a key element of the July Stimulus Package will be enhancing the supports available to people who lost their employment to assist people back into work.</p><p>I trust that this clarifies the matter.</p></reply>

According to the records of my Department, they have a total of 389 paid full-rate Irish social insurance contributions.  Since their contributions fall short of the requisite 520 paid full-rate contributions, they do not qualify for standard State pension (contributory) based solely on their Irish social insurance record.</p><p>Under European Union regulations, the insurance records of other Member States can be combined to satisfy the 520-contribution condition and give entitlement to a proportional or pro rata pension.  The person&rsquo;s Irish and EU (German and UK) contributions were combined to establish their entitlement to an EU pro rata State pension (contributory).  They have 2,209 contributions and credits, composed of 389 Irish paid full-rate contributions, 36 Irish credited contributions, and 1,784 EU contributions.</p><p>The rate of entitlement is based on the proportion of Irish full-rate social insurance contributions to the person&rsquo;s total combined Irish and EU social insurance contributions.  The greater the number of Irish contributions paid by a person, the higher their weekly rate of EU pro rata State pension entitlement.  This is published on the gov.ie website.  Conversely, a greater amount of full-rate EU contributions would yield a lower rate of pro rata pension. </p><p>The person&rsquo;s pension entitlement has been calculated correctly under the provisions of both Irish and European Union legislation.  How their entitlements to pensions in Germany and the UK are calculated is a matter for the pension authorities in those countries.</p><p>The person concerned qualified for an EU pro rata State pension (contributory) at the current weekly rate of &euro;47.80 and was notified in writing of this decision on 29 April 2019.  They were provided with a copy of their social insurance record on which the decision was based.  The person appealed this decision to the independent Social Welfare Appeals Office.  They will be notified in writing of the outcome of the Appeals Officer's review.  </p><p>Social security provisions have existed in EU law for more than 30 years, and are contained in Regulations (EC) No 883/2004 and 987/2009.  As such, Ireland and other EU Member States are bound to abide by these regulations as they are applied to pension payments.  Social insurance contributions made in other EU countries may be used to determine eligibility for contributory pensions, but cannot be used to increase the rate of payment.  Any changes to this system would have a significant impact on the Social Insurance Fund and consequently the Exchequer.</p><p>While the State pension non-contributory is not payable to a person residing outside of the state, a customer can go abroad in exceptional circumstances for a limited period. The Department will review their entitlement when they return.  </p><p>I hope this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</p></reply>

To date, approximately 15,900 cases have been provided additional flexible payment arrangements, i.e. have received support in excess of the prevailing 2016 rent limits.  </p><p>In the context of the Covid emergency, for persons to be eligible for Rent Supplement, once it has been confirmed that they are a bona fide tenant, the two standing qualification criteria apply:</p><p>- The customer was in receipt of Rent Supplement in the last 12  months before the date of application; or,</p><p>- The customer was living in private rented accommodation prior to the Covid emergency (at least 4 weeks), could afford their rent at the beginning of the tenancy and were now unable to continue to pay the rent because of a substantial change in their circumstances. </p><p>The principal underlying criteria for access to the Scheme have not changed: an applicant receiving a primary social welfare payment or reduced income with an identifiable rental commitment can apply.  Rent supplement&rsquo;s core customer message remains in line with previous policy, and is supported by the existing customer information available explaining the Scheme&rsquo;s objectives and criteria.  Where a tenant approaches the Department for support towards their rental commitments, the application will be considered by the officer dealing with their case. </p><p>The overarching Covid-19 response in the case of rent supplement is to provide a flexible case-by-case driven solution for customers, providing temporary income support during the emergency for their housing costs.  The scheme has not fundamentally changed, and I am satisfied that the appropriate information is available to both officers and the general public with respect to the scheme.</p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

To be eligible for the pandemic unemployment payment a person must have been in employment immediately prior to the 13th March and lost their income from employment due to the onset of the pandemic.  Self-employed people must have suffered a collapse in their trading income to the extent that they are available to take up other full-time work.</p>  <p>  Changes were announced to the structure of the pandemic unemployment payment which means that it continues to be a strong support but is also fair and targeted.  Payment is now linked to prior earnings.  Where an employee's gross weekly earnings were &euro;200 or higher there is no change to their rate of payment.  If their gross weekly earnings were under &euro;200 the rate of the pandemic unemployment payment was adjusted to &euro;203.  Where a person is self-employed their gross average weekly income for 2018, the last tax year for which verifiable data on self-employed income is available, is used to calculate the rate of the pandemic unemployment payment.  Any person who feels that the assessment of their earnings, based on returns already submitted to Revenue, is inaccurate can ask for a review of their case with further details available on www.gov.ie.  Combining employee and self-employed income could potentially reduce average weekly earnings in the case of employee earnings, particularly where an employee has relatively small amounts of self-employment income, as the respective earnings would then be assessed over a full year.  The nature of self-employment is such that it is not possible, for Revenue and PRSI purposes, to attribute self-employment income to any particular week, and earnings are assessed on a full-year basis. </p>  <p>  Where an individual&rsquo;s rate is reduced to the flat rate &euro;203 per week and their family circumstances are that they have adult or child dependents, it may be more financially beneficial to apply for a jobseekers payment.  The jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit for the self-employed schemes provide a social insurance contribution-based support for people who have lost work and are unable to find alternative full-time employment.  If a person does not meet the qualifying conditions of the scheme they may be eligible to apply for the means tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance scheme.  The maximum weekly rate of payment for these schemes is &euro;203 and increases may also be paid for any qualifying adults and children.</p>  <p>  The Enterprise Support Grant has recently been extended and will be made available to small business owners who transition from the pandemic unemployment payment to re-open their business.  The grant, of up to &euro;1,000, will be payable to self-employed micro enterprises which employ fewer than 10 people, have an annual turnover of less than &euro;1 million and are not eligible for support from the COVID 19 Business Restart Grant or other similar business reopening grants.  The Department is developing the systems to put it into effect and will communicate how to access the grant in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the matter. </p></reply>

The person concerned was born in 1956. The new Programme for Government &ldquo;Our Shared Future&rdquo; states that the planned increase in the State pension age (to 67 years) next year will be deferred.  This will require amendment to primary legislation which will be introduced later this year.</p><p>Future pension entitlement will depend on factors such as a person&rsquo;s social insurance record, their attachment to the workforce, and their countries of employment.  It is advisable that all contributors maintain their social insurance record as fully as possible over their working life.  </p><p>Under current eligibility conditions an individual must have 520 full-rate paid contributions in order to qualify for State pension (contributory). Credits cannot be used to satisfy this condition. 520 full-rate contributions equate to 10 years of full-rate insurable employment.</p><p>The person&rsquo;s social insurance record indicates that much of their working life has been spent in self-employment.  Under current social welfare legislation, a qualifying condition for State pension (contributory) for self-employed contributors is that all self-employment liabilities must be paid in full. Failure to discharge any outstanding liabilities for any years of self-employment contributions may result in a delay in the date of eligibility for State pension (contributory).</p><p>The person concerned should apply for State pension (contributory) approximately 6 months before reaching pension age.  Their entitlement to pension will then be determined on the basis of the eligibility conditions in force and they will be notified in writing of the decision.  Deciding Officers must remain within the provisions of the governing legislation when determining pension entitlements.</p><p>An alternative to the State pension (contributory) is the means-tested, residency-based State pension (non-contributory).  Social welfare legislation provides that the means test takes account of the income and assets of the applicant and spouse/civil partner/cohabitant as applicable.  Income and assets include income from employment, self-employment, occupational pensions, maintenance payments as well as property owned (other than the family home) and capital such as savings, shares and other investments.  Applicants with assessed weekly income of less than &euro;262.50 (at current rates) may qualify for a State pension (non-contributory).</p><p>I hope this clarifies the position for the Deputy.  </p></reply>

My Department is intensively engaging with all relevant stakeholders on these issues. The current licensing difficulties are as a result of the changes made to internal Appropriate Assessment Procedures (AAP).  These were introduced in response to important Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) decisions and their subsequent interpretation by the Forestry Appeals Committee (FAC) and others.  These findings meant that in order to grant licences which fully meet environmental requirements, fundamental changes to the licensing system were unavoidable.  All licence applications are subject to a statutory public notification system.  </p>  <p>  I accept the current changes to procedures are very significant and they have been challenging to implement such is the scope and breadth of them, which has unfortunately meant that there have been delays in issuing licences.  It has taken substantial resources and effort to introduce a robust and workable system, which meets the legislative requirements, and I believe we now have that in place.  My Department's licensing decisions are being confirmed at the Forestry Appeals Committee, which gives confidence in these revised procedures. </p>  <p>  My Department has a detailed project plan in place for dealing with the current backlog and new applications, which includes significant investment in extra resources required to deliver the plan. These resources are a combination of additional ecologists, forestry inspectors and administrative staff where required. </p>  <p>  The project plan is a targeted, process-driven approach which prioritise files in a manner which will result in an increased number of licences being issued in the short-term and will deliver a return to expected timelines in the longer term.  Applicants who have or are prepared to submit a Natura Impact Statement, where appropriate, will be prioritised.  </p>  <p>  A Project Management Board, with a dedicated Project Manager, will oversee and monitor delivery.  There will be a continuous review of the process, in order to effect efficiencies. A communication plan to keep stakeholders fully and regularly informed of progress, with a dedicated central resource to deal with queries, is a key element of the project.  While much of the success of the project plan lies with my Department, stakeholders also need to engage with it.  This will require a commitment from forestry companies to submit only applications which have a realistic chance of being planted, to ensure all applications are of the required standard and quality, and to submit NISs in accordance with the guidance provided.</p>  <p>  In terms of improvements to the current approval system, a comprehensive reivew which involved extensive stakeholder consulation, was conducted by Mr. Jim Mackinnon, CBE, and his recommendations are outlined in the Mackinnon Report. There is a commitment under the Programme for Government to implement the Mackinnon Report, and  to review the forestry appeals process to ensure that it is aligned with other comparable appeals processes. I am considering how best this might be achieved and expect to be announcing some efficiencies in this regard in the coming weeks. </p>  <p>  The Forestry Appeals Committee (FAC) is operationally independent of my Department. Additional resources have been assigned to the FAC over past months, including additional administrative resources and personnel with planning expertise, to assist with administering appeals.  Resource needs will continue to be monitored.</p>  <p>  I am more than aware that the current situation is challenging, but it is a temporary disruption which, when resolved, will make for a better, more sustainable and fit-for-purpose forestry licensing system for many years to come.</p></reply>

I am assured however that Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in light of operational demand, to ensure their optimum use.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that it is not proposed to establish a specialist or dedicated public transport policing unit in County Cork or anywhere else in the country at this time. Instead, Garda&iacute; deploy a wide range of operational measures aimed at tackling public-order offences and anti-social behaviour in all contexts, including the policing needs of the rail or transport network and its stakeholders. The legal framework that assists the Garda&iacute; in tackling this type of crime includes provisions under the Criminal Damage Act 1991; the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994; the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003; and the Intoxicating Liquor Acts 2003 and 2008.</p>  <p>  In terms of safety on public transport, I understand that Garda management engages with transport operators and that a range of regional and local operations have been put in place to address incidents and issues that have arisen at specific locations.  I am further informed that there is ongoing communication between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the respective control centres, and access to good quality CCTV can provide assistance to Garda&iacute; when investigating serious incidents.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been allocated an unprecedented budget of &euro;1.88 billion for 2020, as well as capital funding of over &euro;116 million for this year.  This level of funding is enabling sustained, ongoing recruitment of Garda members and staff and, as a result, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is a growing organisation.  Garda numbers are now at their highest ever, with approximately 14,700 members and almost 3,000 Garda staff nationwide.  These additional resources will further strengthen An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s response to all forms of crime, including that which takes place on public transport.</p>  <p>  With specific regards to Cork, I am further advised by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that as of 30 June 2020, the latest date for which figures are available, there are 730 Garda members in the Cork City Division, 357 in the Cork North Division and 312 Garda members in the Cork West Division.</p>  <p>  In addition, Garda Civilian Staff figures for County Cork on 30 June 2020 show 112 Staff for the Cork City Division, 34 Staff for the Cork North Division and 35 Staff for the Cork West Division.</p></reply>

Work is continuing on the reforms needed for an optimum level of compliance with the Convention's requirements.</p>  <p>  The National Disability Inclusion Strategy (NDIS) 2017 &ndash; 2021 contains a wide range of practical commitments to improve the position of people with disabilities in Ireland. It provides a mechanism for joined-up working to deliver on Ireland&rsquo;s commitments to implementing the UNCRPD. The NDIS Steering Group, which oversees and monitors the implementation of the Strategy, has an important role in guiding progress in this area. The Group recently carried out a mid-term review of the Strategy which examined how the Strategy is aligned with the articles of the Convention and how the Strategy could be revised and built upon in order to continue progressive realisation of the aims of the Convention. Arising from the mid-term review, a commitment was made that the Department of Justice and Equality will develop a CRPD implementation plan, that will include monitoring structures and metrics as appropriate. </p>  <p>  Of particular relevance to Article 12 of the Convention is the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015, which provides a modern statutory framework to support decision-making by adults with capacity difficulties. The Act was signed into law on 30 December 2015 but has not yet been fully commenced.  The 2015 Act will abolish the current Wards of Court system by repealing the Lunacy Regulation (Ireland) Act 1871. Part 6 of the 2015 Act provides that adults currently in wardship will transition to the new decision-making support arrangements provided for in the Act on a phased basis over 3 years from the commencement of Part 6 of the Act.</p>  <p>  New administrative processes and support measures, including the setting up of the Decision Support Service within the Mental Health Commission (a body under the Department of Health), must be put in place before the substantive provisions of the 2015 Act can be commenced. The Decision Support Service is working towards being operational and ready for the commencement of the main provisions of the Act in 2020.  This lead-in timeframe ensures that the necessary staff resources, processes, IT system, expert panels, codes of practice and regulations will be in place so that the Decision Support Service will have the capacity to be up and running effectively. </p>  <p>  The Government continues to take practical measures to improve the lives of people with disabilities.  The Report of the Make Work Pay Group was published in April 2017 and many of its recommendations have been implemented. In addition, the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities 2015-2024 includes positive action measures to support the recruitment of people with disabilities in the public service and in the wider economy.</p>  <p>  In addition to the practical measures outlined, the Deputy will be aware of a number of legislative developments to support the implementation of the Convention.</p>  <p>  In the first instance, my colleague the Minister for Health is progressing Heads of a Bill to provide legislative clarity on the issue of deprivation of liberty. A report of a recent public consultation on these draft legislative provisions is nearing completion, and every effort is being made to progress this legislation as quickly as possible. </p>  <p>  In order to strengthen Ireland&rsquo;s laws on liberty and security of the person as they relate to persons with a disability and to ensure that Ireland fully complies with Article 14, the Government has been working towards enacting specific legislation. The previously stated Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016 and the ADMC each have an important role in this regard. In addition, a stand-alone Bill on Deprivation of Liberty is being progressed. The Bill will provide procedural safeguards to ensure that people are not unlawfully deprived of their liberty in relevant facilities. </p>  <p>  An approach has been developed to provide for situations in which an individual lacks the capacity to consent to their care arrangements (which amount to a deprivation of liberty) and will provide a legal basis for these care arrangements to be authorised by a body to be established within the health service.  The authorisation will not cover any other decision to be made in relation to that individual e.g. financial decisions or consent to medical treatment. Work to refine the draft legislative proposals is ongoing and complicated policy issues that have arisen are being resolved, in consultation with an Advisory Group and relevant stakeholders.</p>  <p>  The Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016, which contains key legislative amendments needed for compliance with the Convention, was published in December 2016. The Bill includes provisions to establish the monitoring framework required by Article 33 of the Convention to promote, protect and monitor implementation of the Convention. It requires the involvement and participation of civil society, in particular, persons with disabilities, in the monitoring process. </p>  <p>  Published in December 2016, the Bill&rsquo;s stated purpose was to address remaining legislative barriers to Ireland&rsquo;s ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD).  The opportunity was also taken to progress other miscellaneous amendments to statute law. The Bill amends:</p>  <p>  - the Juries Act to accommodate (i) deaf persons who need the services of a sign language interpreter and (ii) persons with mental illness being subject to a functional capacity test - the Electoral Act to repeal the prohibition on a person of unsound mind from standing for election to the national and European parliament - the National Disability Act to (i) change the status of NDA staff from public to civil servants, in line with all other bodies in the Justice Vote and (ii) to provide information and advice including statistics to the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC)  - the Equal Status Act to elaborate the principle of refusal of &ldquo;reasonable accommodation&rdquo; on grounds of cost - the Disability Act to bring civilian staff of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na within the scope of Part V of that Act which contains measures applicable to the public service including employee quotas - the IHREC Act to create a statutory basis for IHREC to (i) keep under review the law and practice relating to the protection of persons with disabilities, and (ii) to that end appoint an advisory committee, and (iii) apply to the Court of Appeal to appear as amicus curiae (friend of the court).</p>  <p>  The Bill was at Committee Stage when it lapsed with the dissolution of the D&aacute;il and Seanad in January 2020. A decision is now required as to whether the lapsed Bill should be revisited, or if a new Bill should be drafted. This will be a decision for the new Minister for Children, Disability, Equality and Integration once the transfer of functions from the Minister for Justice and Equality has taken place. </p>  <p>  The monitoring framework for implementation of the Convention will include both the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) and the NDA and will be governed by a formal Memorandum of Understanding.

In the context of the current COVID-19 Pandemic response, the HSE advised on 22 June 2020 that an additional 324 acute beds have opened since March, bringing the current total of acute beds in the system to 11,597 excluding critical care capacity. It should be noted that this is the total current bed capacity. However, beds are unavailable when they are temporarily closed for reasons such as infection control, maintenance/refurbishment, or staffing shortages. </p>  <p>  The HSE&rsquo;s Critical Care Programme Census from September 2019 reported that there were 255 adult critical care beds in public hospitals. At an early stage of the Covid-19 pandemic, additional funding was provided to the HSE to increase the number of critical care beds. 42 critical care beds have been funded since March in addition to the baseline critical care capacity already identified in hospitals.</p>  <p>  In line with the HSE&rsquo;s Critical Care Major Surge Preparedness Planning Framework, surge plans for further capacity for each Hospital Group have been developed in order to create additional capacity if required.</p>  <p>  A major part of the Government's Action Plan in response to Covid-19 was to substantially increase the capacity of public healthcare facilities to cope with the anticipated additional demand. In order to urgently ramp up capacity for acute care facilities, an arrangement was agreed with the private hospitals to use their facilities as part of the public system on a temporary basis, to provide essential services. A Heads of Terms of Agreement between the HSE and the Private Hospitals was agreed at the end of March 2020 and all 18 of the acute private hospitals signed up to it. Under the arrangement, all patients in the private hospitals were treated as public patients and their treatment was prioritised based on clinical need.</p>  <p>  The agreement was reviewed at the end of May and the Government decided that the existing arrangement should not be extended beyond the end of June. It has however mandated the HSE to negotiate a new arrangement with private hospitals which would provide the HSE with full access to private hospital capacity in the event of a surge of Covid-19 and separately with ongoing agreed access, to enable the HSE to meet essential and elective care needs.</p>  <p>  My Department has been advised by the HSE that as of the 3rd July, 12,959 patients had been discharged from private hospitals having undergone an inpatient procedure since the arrangement between the HSE and private hospitals came into force. In the same period 53,609 daycase procedures took place in private hospitals, as well as 85,658 diagnostic appointments and 52,096 outpatient appointments. Utilisation rates show that for the period 17-23 June 2020, 47% of private inpatient beds were in use, and for the period 24-30 June there was a 43% utilisation rate.</p>  <p>  Under the agreement, payment to the private hospitals is on a cost only Open Book model whereby the hospitals are reimbursed only for the operating costs properly incurred during the period. The costs covered are limited to normal costs of operating the hospital. The hospitals will only receive their actual operating costs when these have been verified. The final cost will be verified by independent firms of accountants appointed by the HSE and the private hospitals and there will be an arbitration mechanism in place in the event of any disagreement. At the time of the agreement the cost only open book model was the most effective way of ensuring the arrangement was value for money for the State. </p>  <p>  In terms of costs incurred, at 30th June private hospital expenditure was &euro;294.3m. The expenditure is based on the actual costs for April-20 (&euro;97.5m), actual costs for May (&euro;91.6m), estimated final cost for June (&euro;89m), consultants costs for April &ndash; June (&euro;14.5m) and consultants expenses for April &ndash; June (&euro;1.7m).</p>  <p>  The actual costs submitted for May were &euro;91.6m against the estimated &euro;111m and the HSE are recording an estimated final cost for June of &euro;88.9m against the estimated June costs of &euro;108.9m.</p>  <p>  For primary care services, the response to Covid-19 was predominantly based around the reallocation of resources and the more effective use of existing capacity rather than through an expansion of capacity.  This included new ways of working such as greater use of digitally enabled healthcare and enhanced integration of care pathways as well as the repurposing of a network of Primary Care and Health Centres as Community Assessment Hubs (CAHs).   The gross cost of CAHs is estimated to be &euro;7.37m as of 3rd July 2020.</p>  <p>  In relation to supports for General Practice, measures were put in place to help maintain regular essential services, and for the provision of Covid-19-related services without charge to the public. A range of special fees to GPs were introduced from 16 March including fees for the provision of remote consultations, respiratory assessment clinics and extended opening hours and it has been agreed that the majority of these will continue until 10 August. </p></reply>

Funding for a further 40 adult critical care beds, and two paediatric critical care beds, was provided as part of the response to Covid-19 in March 2020. The acute hospital system and critical care service has coped effectively during recent months, and this reflects the success of public health measures in flattening the curve.  The additional demand for critical care was met by surge ICU capacity, with clinical staff redeployed from other hospital services and locations. Training was provided to over 1,500 nursing staff to allow them to provide support to critical care as required. </p>  <p>  The capital cost of a critical care bed has several determining factors. However, a survey undertaken by the HSE of active and recently completed projects suggests that critical care beds can cost up to &euro;1m.

However, in order to provide the Deputy with more detail on costs associated with additional critical care beds, including associated staffing and equipment costs, I have asked the HSE to respond directly to him with any additional information that may be available.</p></reply>

Sl&aacute;intecare is about delivering a health and social care service that meets the needs of our population and attracts and retains the very best healthcare professionals, managers and staff.  The plan is to deliver a universal health service that offers the right care, in the right place, at the right time, by the right team with a priority focus on keeping people well, developing primary and community services within a national policy context, and ensuring we have the right hospital capacity for the needs of our citizens.</p><p>Key recommendations of the Oireachtas Sl&aacute;intecare report were to set up a Programme Implementation Office to oversee and enable the implementation of  Sl&aacute;intecare, to develop a detailed implementation plan for the reform programme and devise a detailed implementation programme project plan for each year of the plan, identifying key milestones which can be monitored across sectors.  Following the publication of the all-party Oireachtas Sl&aacute;intecare report, the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy was agreed by Government in August 2018 setting out an initial set of key actions for a three-year period.  The Sl&aacute;intecare Executive Director was appointed in September 2018, a small team was recruited from within the public sector to form the Sl&aacute;intecare Programme Implementation Office during late 2018 and early 2019.</p><p>A detailed Action Plan for 2019 was developed for implementation, based on the Implementation Strategy and was published on the 13 March 2019. This 2019 Sl&aacute;intecare Action Plan set out detailed timeframes for 138 projects that were to be progressed in 2019, as the first full year in the implementation of the Sl&aacute;intecare vision, and firmly established a programmatic approach to the delivery of the Sl&aacute;intecare strategy.  </p><p>A progress report on the implementation of the 2019 Sl&aacute;intecare Action Plan was approved by the Government in April 2020.  Of the 138 projects for the period up to December 2019, 112 were on track, 24 have been progressed with minor challenges, and 2 with significant challenge. This work was carried out by many stakeholders, including from the Department of Health, the HSE, the voluntary and community bodies and key partners. It represents a concerted effort to deliver on the all-party vision and provided a strong foundation for moving forward into 2020, and beyond. During 2019, a series of important Sl&aacute;intecare reform Government decisions were made, including the agreement:</p><p>1. on the geographies for the six new regional health areas which is a first major step towards restructuring our health services in line with recommendation in the Oireachtas Committee report, which is informing the development of a detailed business case for consideration by Government;</p><p>2. to support the findings of the Independent Review Group established to examine private activity in public hospitals with the decision and announcement that all future consultant appointments, from mid-2020, will be to the new Sl&aacute;intecare Consultant contract for public only work;</p><p>3. on revised GP contractual arrangements in April 2019, which will see a &euro;210 million investment (40% increase) in General Practice over the next four years of which &euro;80 million will be available for the management of chronic diseases, like diabetes and COPD, through family doctors. This is expected to benefit more than 400,000 patients;</p><p>4. on the strengthening of the HSE with the formal appointment of the Health Service Executive (HSE) Board in June 2019 and the introduction of a new HSE Chief Executive Officer.</p><p>The 2019 Action Plan report setting out the progress against all the planned 138 projects can be found on the Department of Health website (link: <i></i>).</p><p>The experience of the first full year of implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare (2019) informed Sl&aacute;intecare&rsquo;s ongoing approach.  The 2020 Action Plan was drafted by the Sl&aacute;intecare Programme Implementation Office through the Sl&aacute;intecare/HSE Joint Action Programme governance, and the Department of Health&rsquo;s business planning process, in anticipation of a submission to the Minister and the incoming Government following the general election of February 8th, 2020. </p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in major disruptions to routine health services. The response to the COVID-19 pandemic necessitated a singular and urgent focus on one priority, a highly focussed health and social care workforce, clear public messaging, societal engagement and real-time decision-making that facilitated rapid change and implementation. As has been noted in several quarters, many of the initiatives and changed ways of working that have been successfully and rapidly implemented over the past three months in response to the pandemic have been wholly aligned with the spirit of the Oireachtas Sl&aacute;intecare Report.  The implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare now operates within a different context, but the principles of Sl&aacute;intecare are even more relevant at this time.</p><p>Key programmes that have progressed during the first half of 2020 include developing a specification for the three elective hospitals in Dublin, Cork and Galway, to be procured as part of the National Development Plan, as well as determining the roll out of the Sl&aacute;intecare Community Healthcare Networks and Specialist Hubs, to be staffed and geographically dispersed over one quarter of the country during 2021, with a view to covering the whole country by 2023.</p><p>The draft Programme for Government was published on June 15th, 2020. It reaffirms the commitment to the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare and pledges to accelerate the process.A revised Sl&aacute;intecare Action Plan 2020 &ndash; 2021 is being developed factoring in the learnings from COVID-19, the new context within which the health system operates and the agreed Programme for Government.</p></reply>

Face coverings should be used properly, in line with the guidance and to wash hands before putting them on and taking them off. </p><p>On 15 June, the Government and the National Transport Authority launched a national communications campaign  which outlines best practice for the use of face coverings in retail outlets, on public transport and in other public locations in which it is difficult to maintain social distancing or where this distance cannot be guaranteed, and are communicating to the public about:</p><p>- who should wear face coverings </p><p>- in what settings, and how to wear and remove face coverings correctly.</p><p>Guidance on how to make and safely use face coverings is available on gov.ie/facecoverings and the HSE website. </p><p>As I am sure the Deputy can appreciate, the evidence relating to the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the discussion around face coverings, masks and shields is constantly evolving.

It is fully accepted that admission to an age-appropriate facility is in the best interest of the child. This is reflected in the Programme for Government which commits to work to end the admission of children to adult psychiatric units by increasing in-patient beds, as well as examining the model of assigning these beds. </p>  <p>  Where a child requires admission to an in-patient unit, a bed in a Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) unit is sought in the first instance. A decision to admit to an adult unit is made only if a CAMHS admission is not feasible. Where such admissions take place, HSE Standard Operating Procedures apply. An admission to an adult unit must be advised to the Mental Health Commission and is generally to a separate area in the adult unit with appropriate supervision. </p>  <p>  The vast majority of child admissions to adult units are for children in the 16-17 age bracket. The HSE advises that admission to an adult unit may often be more appropriate for the individual and to avoid any impact on younger children in CAMHS in-patient units. Children admitted to adult units are provided with special supports by the HSE.  The HSE Service Plan allows for some operational flexibility surrounding emergency placements in Adult Units, particularly where very short-term placements take place.  Full account is taken of all relevant factors such as the preferences of all those involved, and geographical factors relating to access or visiting. In this context, the HSE continues to closely monitor on a weekly basis all child admissions to adult units with a view to minimising this practice. </p>  <p>  Progress in this area has been significant since 2008 when there were 247 such admissions to adult units. This was reduced to 50 HSE admissions in 2019, despite a background of increasing demands overall on CAMHS services.  In 2008, 25% of admissions were to CAMHS inpatient beds whereas in 2019 this had increased to 86% such admissions. It is important to note that the number of admissions does not necessarily equate to the actual number of children admitted in any given year, as an individual child may be admitted on more than one occasion. </p>  <p>  In 2019, there was a total of 358 HSE CAMHS admissions, of which 308 (86%) were to age-appropriate units and 50 (14%) of admissions of children were to Adult Units. Of the 50 admitted to Adult Approved Centres, 47 or 94% were 16-17 years old, with 48% (24) of these discharged either the same day or within 3 days, and 82% (41) within a week. </p>  <p>  In terms of bed days used, 96% of bed days used in 2019 were in CAMHS In-patient Units. Performance generally continues to be in line with the HSE Service Plan target figure of 95%, with the length of stay being kept to a minimum. </p>  <p>  The HSE indicates that there were 12 admissions of those under age 18 to adult units for the period from January to end May, 2020.</p>  <p>  I recently met with the HSE to review various issues relating to mental health, including CAMHS. Bearing in mind all the circumstances, I am satisfied at present that where children have to be placed short-term in adult mental health units, the HSE makes the necessary arrangements to protect these young people and aid their recovery. I will, however, continue to work with the HSE to continue this decrease in admissions to adult units.</p></reply>

Consequently, it will not be necessary to establish whether a mental health difficulty is &lsquo;primary&rsquo; for an individual to access the support of a mental health team. A shared case management approach may be required for particularly complex patients.</p><p>On this basis, the policy recommends that a tiered model of integrated service provision for individuals with a dual diagnosis (e.g. substance misuse with mental illness) be developed to ensure that pathways to care are clear.</p><p>With regards service provision by NGOs, the policy recognises that the voluntary and community sector organisations are key partners in the design and development of the HSE&rsquo;s mental health services at national and local level, as well as referral partners for primary mental healthcare. Their services extend to therapeutic and other recovery supports for individuals and FCS and can, therefore, help to reduce the use of inappropriate referrals to specialist mental health services. </p><p>The policy recommends that where Voluntary and Community Sector organisations are providing services aligned to the outcomes in this policy, operational governance and funding models should be secure and sustainable. In addition, the policy also contains recommendations to ensure more integrated linkages between HSE mental health services and the VCS sector.</p></reply>

On Thursday 25 June the Government confirmed the move to Phase 3 of the Roadmap from Monday, 29 June 2020. Information and advice about the restrictions that have been eased as part of Phase 3 and the measures that are now in place are available on the Government website at <i></i>.  </p><p>Gatherings of 50 people (indoor) and 200 people (outdoor) are permissible in line with the public health guidance on mass gatherings, which is also available on the Government website at <i></i>. The limits will increase to 100 (indoors) and 500 (outdoors) in phase 4.  This will be subject to continued progressive improvements in the health indicators identified in the Framework for Future Decision-Making described in the Roadmap.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, religious buildings and places of worship may also now be reopened, in line with public health guidelines. The Government has exempted places of worship from the regulations restricting numbers on mass gatherings. The exemption applies to places of worship only and not to any gatherings that may take place after the religious ceremony such as wedding receptions. </p><p>Detailed Covid-19 Guidance has been developed for religious services. The Cabinet Committee reviewed the guidance, which state that an assessment should be carried out for each premises to determine how many can attend within the requirements of social distancing.  </p><p>The Cabinet Committee decided that where the size of the premises allows for a capacity of greater than 50 this may be permitted only where:</p><p>- Social distancing guidelines are adhered to </p><p>- The premises can be subdivided into distinct sections (cordoned or marked appropriately) of not more than 50 persons in each section </p><p>- There is a minimum of 4m between sections </p><p>- Each section has its own entrance/exit route</p><p>- There are separate arrangements for elements of the service involving close contact, e.g. the distribution of Holy Communion </p><p>- Strictly no movement of people between sections before, during or after the service</p><p>- The premises is well-ventilated.</p><p>Account must also be taken regarding the risk of congregation by people outside before and after any services, having regard to outdoor overall limits on mass gatherings and arrangements for staggered exiting after ceremonies</p><p>The use of face coverings is strongly recommended for such indoor settings.</p><p>Specific guidance for funeral directors has been developed by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) and is available on the HPSC website at <i></i>.

Since then, HSE Disability Services have been working to develop national guidance on the part of the disability sector to direct how all day services can be delivered. The Guidance to support the Framework for the Resumption of Adult Disability Day Services was published by the HSE on 9 July 2020. </p><p>In developing the guidance document to guide providers, the HSE worked closely with service providers through representative organisations such as the National Federation of Voluntary Service Providers, Disability Federation of Ireland and the Not for Profit Association, in addition to Inclusion Ireland, who represent people with intellectual disabilities and their families.</p><p>The guidance document seeks to support the safe return of services in the context of ongoing public health guidance. It also recognises that the impact of public health guidance will result in services being provided at a reduced level and will require changes in how people are supported, increased use of technology where appropriate and more use of outreach supports.</p><p>Day services will gradually resume during the month of August. Service providers are already working to get day services ready to reopen safely, and in line with public health guidance. Service providers will be in touch with all families and service users during the month of July to discuss when they may expect the resumption of their service and what that service will consist of.</p><p>I want to acknowledge the many challenges experienced by individuals and their families over this difficult time. Families across the country have had their routines upended due to the impact of COVID-19 and I hope that this will be the first step towards returning to some sense of normalcy.</p><p>The Guidance to support the Framework for Resumption of Adult Disability Day Services is available on the New Directions website: <i>www.hse.ie/newdirections</i>. The HSE have also issued monthly communications updates for service users and their families, the latest leaflet &ldquo;Adult Disability Day Services and COVID-19 - What&rsquo;s Happening?

These teams will now oversee and support the reshaping of disability services as a result of COVID 19. </p><p>A critical focus at this time is the assurance of value for money in delivering on the required patient services and population health needs to effectively manage COVID-19 infection within the Irish context.Accordingly, the financial implications of measures taken to mitigate impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak are matters which the Department of Health will continue to keep under review in conjunction with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, as the situation evolves.</p></reply>

As part of its recommendations in this area, the Committee called for the HSE to become a more strategic and patient-focused &lsquo;national centre&rsquo; carrying out national level functions, and the establishment of regional bodies with responsibility for the planning and delivery of integrated care at a regional level.</p><p>The new Programme for Government, Our Shared Future, recommits to this core Sl&aacute;intecare recommendation, stating &ldquo;<i>Enhanced governance and accountability in the health service is a key component of Sl&aacute;intecare reform. The HSE Board is now in place and we must now bring forward detailed proposals on the six new regional health areas to deliver services for patients locally that are safe, high quality and fairly distributed</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>As agreed, when the new Regional Health Areas geographies were announced last summer, a business plan for the establishment of these health areas was expected to be brought to Government for its approval in 2020. </p><p>The intention was that this plan would set out the high-level organisational design for the health system, including: the respective roles, functions, responsibilities and accountabilities of the Department of Health, HSE centre and new regional structures; the relationship between these entities; and the overall legal construct.

This programme of work will be given further consideration in the coming weeks to take account of the Programme for Government commitment and any new considerations relating to COVID-19.</p><p>As part of the HSE's work on this, it is now reviewing the HSE Corporate Centre with a view to providing recommendations on a more strategic national centre which will have greater clarity of role and can better complement and support the health services and regions going forward. These changes will also enable greater decision-making to happen at the front line. </p><p>It will be important that there is significant engagement with all key stakeholders across the health and social care sector to ensure that any structural changes do not unduly cause disruption and loss of focus on service delivery. This will be even more important now given the challenges facing the health service as a result of COVID-19.</p></reply>

A draft programme plan was considered by the programme sponsors in early 2020, prior to the onset of the COVID-19 emergency.  In April 2020, recognising the need for a robust programme plan to support a reform of this scale, the Sl&aacute;intecare Programme Implementation Office engaged contractors to work with Sl&aacute;intecare, HSE and DOH to validate (insofar as possible) the draft programme plan for the service reconfiguration and development of the Regional Health Areas and develop recommendations to enhance the plan based upon international learnings and insights. This work was overseen by the programme sponsors and was completed in May. This report, including the enhanced programme plan, is being considered and finalised. As agreed, when the new Regional Health Areas geographies were announced last summer, a business plan for the establishment of these health areas is expected to be brought to Government for its approval.  The intention was that this plan will set out the high-level organisational design for the system, including: the respective roles, functions, responsibilities and accountabilities of the Department of Health, HSE centre and new regional structures; the relationship between these entities; and the overall legal construct. These proposals should also outline a timeline for the establishment of regional organisations and for any legislative changes required to realise the Sl&aacute;intecare vision.  Preliminary work on establishing a process to develop detailed proposals has been undertaken but this work was paused as a result of COVID-19. This programme of work will be given further consideration in the coming weeks in consultation with the Minister to take account of the Programme for Government commitment and any new considerations relating to COVID-19.</p></reply>

One policy measure used to address observed differences between population profiles and promote equitable distribution of available funding is population-based (needs-based) resource allocation. Often referred to as population-based funding formulas, the aim of these frameworks is to adjust capitation funding across the population according to variation in need and the cost of providing required services and supports.</p><p>Policy makers are considering the options for implementing population-based resource allocation in Ireland. A review is currently being conducted by the Centre for Health Policy and Management, Trinity College Dublin that aims to inform Irish health care policy by describing models of population-based resource allocation and synthesising evidence about their implementation and impact. Three questions are addressed as part of this review:</p><p>1. What are the key concepts and methodological approaches related to population-based resource allocation?</p><p>2. How are population-based resource allocation policies specified and realised?</p><p>3. What is known about the implementation or impact of population-based resource allocation policies?</p><p>This review is expected to be finalised in the coming months.</p><p>The HSE 2020 National Service Plan specifies:</p><p>Work with the National Health Intelligence Unit to support population health planning and needs assessment in the context of the new regional health areas to develop capacity to support health and well-being services to deliver on health and wellbeing priorities (Health Service Executive 2019)</p><p>This work by the HSE had been put on hold during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p></reply>

As part of the COVID-19 emergency response eHealth technologies were deployed at pace and scale to support healthcare workers.  The Contact Tracing App was developed to complement manual contact tracing, informing of the spread of Covid-19 symptoms and providing a trusted source of news, information and guidance.  Telehealth solutions have also been deployed and have emerged as a significant eHealth response to Covid-19. Current digital integration and existing digital infrastructure are at various states of maturity across the healthcare system and a national  programme of work continues to be in place by the HSE to upgrade and install ICT infrastructure across many health settings.</p>  <p>  My Department fully supports the implementation of the eHealth Strategy and the cross-party Sl&aacute;intecare eHealth deliverables including the Electronic Health Record.  Plans to deploy an acute EHR initially into the New Children's Hospital are progressing and the procurement exercise for that is currently underway. The Electronic Health Record is a long-term project subject to continuing government approval for further deployments into additional healthcare settings.    </p>  <p>  In relation to funding, the overall capital investment in eHealth and ICT has increased by &euro;10m to &euro;95m in 2020 and the projected investment for 2021 is &euro;120m.</p></reply>

However, funding for the provision of primary care services was increased in Budget 2020 in order to help deliver on the vision of Sl&aacute;intecare. </p>  <p>  The NSP 2020 allocated approximately &euro;1.08bn for primary care services (including &euro;160m for social inclusion), an increase of &euro;37m on the 2019 closing budget.  This allocation serves to meet a variety of costs associated with the delivery of primary care therapy services, dental services, orthodontic services, audiology services, ophthalmology, podiatry and so on.  It also covers property management and lease costs associated with primary care facilities and a range of other services including paediatric homecare packages, immunisation services, GP training and GP Out of Hours Services.     It does not however include expenditure associated with the Primary Care Reimbursement Service nor wider social care expenditure on services for older people, mental health or disabilities. </p>  <p>  The primary care allocation for 2020 included &euro;10m, building to an intended full-year investment of &euro;60m in 2021, to provide for the enhancement of primary and community services as part of the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare.  This funding will target the development of Community Healthcare Networks and the recruitment of up to 1,000 therapists, nurses and other professionals in the sector, thus further improving access to primary care services for those that need them.  </p></reply>

It sets out the vision to deliver a healthcare system for the population of Ireland.  The plan aims to deliver a universal health service that offers the right care, in the right place, at the right time, by the right team with a priority focus on keeping people well, developing primary and community services within a national policy context, and ensuring we have the right hospital capacity for the needs of our citizens. The Report recommended an additional investment of &euro;10 million per annum into palliative care services over the first five years of the Report's lifespan.</p>  <p>  A total of &euro;100.6 million has been allocated in the National Service Plan 2020 for palliative care services this year.  This represents an increase of more than 30% on provision for palliative care in 2017 when the Sl&aacute;intecare Report was adopted by Government.  The additional funding this year includes provision for  49 specialist palliative care inpatient beds in new hospices opening in Mayo, Waterford and Wicklow, and 6 new beds in an existing hospice unit in Kildare.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government identifies the north east (Cavan and Drogheda) and midlands as regions where additional hospices are required. The HSE is closely working with local hospice groups to progress these developments. Once these planned hospices are open, there will be an inpatient unit in every region of the country, providing a hub for the existing specialist palliative community homecare teams in every HSE area and supporting the discharge of patients from acute hospitals.</p>  <p>  Since the publication of the Sl&aacute;intecare report, a second paediatric consultant with a specialist interest in palliative care has been appointed. These consultants provide clinical support to parents and children in three children's hospitals in Dublin, while also providing support to paediatric units around the country. The Programme for Government commits to an increase in resources for the HSE's Children's Palliative Care Programme.</p></reply>

This trend was reflected in cancer services, with a lower number of GP referrals of cases of suspected cancer to Symptomatic Breast Disease Clinics and Rapid Access Lung and Prostate Clinics.</p><p>The National Cancer Control Programme, in collaboration with HSE Communications and with the support of various stakeholders, commissioned a communications campaign on cancer detection. The video involved, which detailed the signs and symptoms of cancer, aimed to assure the public that cancer diagnostic services remained open, and to encourage people to call their GP, or other health services, if they had any concerns.  It was launched in early May and featured on social media.  It was also disseminated through various cancer stakeholders.</p><p>A second video was targeted at ensuring that current cancer patients undergoing treatment continued to attend their appointments. The campaign aimed to reassure patients that, although some aspects of their treatment may have changed (location or  frequency of attendance), they would continue to be treated safely in the context of Covid-19.</p><p>The most recent data shows that referrals for breast clinics are now similar to pre-Covid rates, while referrals for prostate and lung Rapid Access Clinics, as well as to other symptomatic cancer services, are increasing. </p></reply>

However, the HSE has now resumed consideration, focusing on health protection in the first instance. </p>  <p>  I am committed to awarding consultants status to the Specialists as soon as it is feasible to do so. It is not possible to be definitive in terms of a timeline, given that consideration of the new structures has to take account of the changed circumstances brought about by COVID-19. Also, similar to new entrant consultants taking up the Slaintecare Contract,  it will be necessary to amend the FEMPI Acts to enable pay increases for the Specialists, given that they currently prohibit pay increases for serving public servants. </p></reply>

In light of these unprecedented challenges, the HSE, at the outset, had to reassess its operation of Home Support Services nationally, to ensure that the assessed needs of those clients with the highest priority were and still are being met. The HSE, working with its approved home support service providers are endeavouring to maintain essential support services during this unprecedented public health emergency.  In this context, the HSE has set out a prioritisation process for home support, which looks at delivering a service based on priority need across 4 priority categories.   </p>  <p>  As a result of that review of prioritisation, a number of clients with lower priority needs had their home support service temporarily ceased or reduced with the support of family members and/or alternative forms of volunteer provided local supports. In these cases, each client was contacted to advise of the assessment and decision, alternative support available and assistance given to ensure that essential requirements continue to be provided. The HSE continues to review both those clients whose home support service may have been temporarily suspended and those clients of higher priority currently in receipt of home support services. </p>  <p>  The HSE is in the process of restoring services, where capacity exists. In order to maximise the capacity available, consideration has to be given to balancing delivery of service against suspended clients, clients assessed and waiting on commencement of home support services and the continued requirement to meet the needs of higher priority clients currently in receipt of services. </p>  <p>  The level of funding available for the Department of Health in 2021 and the quantum of services to be provided by the HSE, including home support will be considered as part of the national Estimates and budgetary process and National Service Planning.</p></reply>

Services are only allowed to operate if they are registered with HIQA and they are inspected regularly to ensure that they maintain a high level of care.  HIQA has significant and wide-ranging powers, up to and including, the cancellation of the registration of a nursing home, where it has significant concerns about the quality of governance and oversight in such services. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that registered providers must provide appropriate medical and health care, including a high standard of evidence-based nursing care in accordance with professional guidelines. Furthermore, regulations provide that a nursing home must have a person in charge. In cases where the person in charge is also the registered provider, that person may be a registered medical practitioner with required experience. Where the registered provider is not the person in charge, the person in charge must be a registered nurse with the required qualifications and experience.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the fact that the primary legal responsibility lies with individual providers, as recommended by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) on 31 March 2020, the HSE has further strengthened its national and regional governance structures to support the response of nursing homes to COVID-19. The HSE has established 23 COVID-19 response teams at CHO level, which are providing nursing homes with medical, nursing, staffing and other supports. The teams are composed of consultant geriatricians, clinicians, infection prevention control experts and senior nurses.</p>  <p>  Finally, on foot of a NPHET recommendation, on 23 May 2020, a COVID-19 Expert Panel on Nursing Homes has been established. The purpose of the Panel is to examine the national and international responses to COVID-19 and provide immediate real-time learnings and recommendations in light of the expected ongoing impact of COVID-19 over the next 12-18 months.  On 13 July I published the Panel&rsquo;s interim report. I expect to receive the Panel's final report this month.</p></reply>

All of those in the at-risk groups aged from 6 months up, including healthcare workers, will be able to access the vaccination without charges.  All children aged from 2 to 12 years inclusive will also have access to vaccination without charges.</p><p>This expanded programme will ensure that those most vulnerable to the effects of influenza will have access without charges.  This is in line with the advice of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee, which has not recommended a programme of vaccination of the whole population, and represents a significant step forward in providing vaccination without charges.  The expansion will be accompanied by a comprehensive communications campaign to encourage the greatest possible take-up.</p><p>The final cost of the expansion will depend on the outcome of negotiations with service providers - GPs and pharmacists.  However, we have estimated that an additional cost of approximately &euro;40 million will arise when all factors are accounted for. </p></reply>

In order to urgently ramp up capacity for acute care facilities, an arrangement was agreed with the private hospitals to use their facilities as part of the public system on a temporary basis, to provide essential services. A Heads of Terms of Agreement between the HSE and the Private Hospitals was agreed at the end of March 2020 and all 18 of the acute private hospitals signed up to it. Under the arrangement, all patients in the private hospitals were treated as public patients and their treatment was prioritised based on clinical need. </p>  <p>  The agreement was reviewed at the end of May and the Government decided that the existing arrangement should not be extended beyond the end of June. It has however mandated the HSE to negotiate a new arrangement with private hospitals which would provide the HSE with full access to private hospital capacity in the event of a surge of Covid-19 and separately with ongoing agreed access, to enable the HSE to meet essential and elective care needs.</p>  <p>  To ensure services are re-introduced in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, the HSE launched its Strategic Framework for &lsquo;Service Continuity in a Covid Environment&rsquo; on 24 June.  Its implementation will ensure service resumption is done in an integrated way. This will involve a phased approach to ensure community services are strengthened. The Framework will also consolidate new ways of working and build on international knowledge. The HSE is currently developing a Service Continuity Roadmap for the resumption of services across the health system.  </p>  <p>  In terms of increasing elective care activity, the HSE is seeking to optimise productivity through alternative work practices such as telemedicine and the use of alternative settings including community facilities and alternative outpatient settings.</p></reply>

The Guidance to support the Framework for the Resumption of Adult Disability Day Services was published by the HSE on 9 July 2020. </p>  <p>  In developing the guidance document to guide providers, the HSE worked closely with service providers through representative organisations such as the National Federation of Voluntary Service Providers, Disability Federation of Ireland and the Not for Profit Association, in addition to Inclusion Ireland, who represent people with intellectual disabilities and their families.</p>  <p>  The guidance document seeks to support the safe return of services in the context of ongoing public health guidance. It also recognises that the impact of public health guidance will result in services being provided at a reduced level and will require changes in how people are supported, increased use of technology where appropriate and more use of outreach supports. The HSE is committed to maximising the support that can be provided within these restrictions and providers are exploring options such as the use of other community facilities to augment capacity. </p>  <p>  Day services will gradually resume during the month of August. Service providers are already working to get day services ready to reopen safely, and in line with public health guidance. Service providers will be in touch with all families and service users during the month of July to discuss when they may expect the resumption of their service and what that service will consist of.</p>  <p>  I want to acknowledge the many challenges experienced by individuals and their families over this difficult time. Families across the country have had their routines upended due to the impact of COVID-19 and I hope that this will be the first step towards returning to some sense of normalcy.</p>  <p>  The Guidance to support the Framework for Resumption of Adult Disability Day Services is available on the New Directions website: www.hse.ie/newdirections. The HSE have also issued monthly communications updates for service users and their families, the latest leaflet &ldquo;Adult Disability Day Services and COVID-19 - What&rsquo;s Happening? July 2020&rdquo; is available at the above link.  </p>  <p>  In relation to additional funding and capacity, the Government has agreed to allocate substantial additional funding to the Health Vote to meet the costs associated with the implementation of the measures outlined in the National Action Plan in response to COVID-19. </p>  <p>  The HSE, through the Community Healthcare Organisations (CHOs) is actively engaging with any Section 38 and Section 39 disability service providers who are experiencing financial challenges, including access to cash acceleration, where appropriate, to maintain continuity of service provision where cash flow issues arise.  Organisations receiving funding from the HSE should raise any concerns in relation to financial issues that may have implications for continuity of service provision with the relevant Community Health Care Organisation (CHO) responsible for the service arrangements. </p>  <p>  The HSE has also agreed a structured approach to addressing the financial challenges of Section 39 service providers due to COVID-19. The objective of the programme is to provide a structured governance process and modus operandi through which Section 39 partners experiencing financial difficulties due to the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency can engage through the HSE to ensure, where appropriate, continuity of essential services provided by these agencies. The HSE has also developed a methodology to provide a pro forma approach to support decision making in respect of Section 39 Organisations that have made submissions to the HSE for both financial and non-financial supports during the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>  <p>  The HSE has advised the Department that it has given Section 38 and Section 39 providers of disability services and supports assurance that budget allocations confirmed to each provider via the relevant CHO, will remain in place to year end, subject to co-operation with the HSE and compliance with the relevant Service Arrangements.</p>  <p>  Other supports provided by CHOs to Section 38 and Section 39 organisations providing disability specialist services between March and May 2020 include PPE; Infection Prevention and Control support, advice and training; Public Health advice/support with regard to suspected/positive cases; Isolation facilities allied to testing, funding for emergency residential placements, logistics in the form of transport and Accommodation.  In addition, COVID response teams were put in place to assist and support residential service providers during the pandemic. These teams will now oversee and support the reshaping of disability services as a result of COVID 19. </p>  <p>  A critical focus at this time is the assurance of value for money in delivering on the required patient services and population health needs to effectively manage COVID-19 infection within the Irish context.   Accordingly, the financial implications of measures taken to mitigate impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak are matters which the Department of Health will continue to keep under review in conjunction with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, as the situation evolves.</p></reply>

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) and in accordance with World Health Organisation guidelines, and the National Action Plan. </p><p>The trajectory of the disease means there is now an opportunity for increasing the provision of non-covid care including more routine care. NPHET has since revised its recommendation on the pausing of all non-essential health services, with a recommendation that the delivery of acute care be determined by appropriate clinical and operational decision making. </p><p>Application of the essential risk mitigating steps set out in the guidance developed under the auspices of the NPHET Expert Advisory group will have operational implications, which will impact on throughput.  </p><p>Where possible, hospitals are working to find innovative ways to enable service provision, which include virtual clinics for some outpatient department appointments. The HSE website provides details on services currently available and operational in each hospital on its website. This information is reviewed frequently and provides up-to-date announcements on services available at each site ().</p><p>To ensure services are re-introduced in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, the HSE launched its Strategic Framework for &lsquo;Service Continuity in a Covid Environment&rsquo; on 24 June.  Its implementation will ensure service resumption is done in an integrated way. This will involve a phased approach to ensure community services are strengthened. The Framework will also consolidate new ways of working and build on international knowledge. The HSE is currently developing a Service Continuity Roadmap for the resumption of services across the health system. </p><p>As the system continues to deliver Covid-19 and non-Covid 19 care side-by-side over a more prolonged period, my Department and the HSE will continue to work closely together to protect essential non-Covid 19 acute care and progress the provision of more routine non Covid-19 care.</p><p>The NTPF currently collects and collates information in respect of the Inpatient, Day Case, Planned Procedure (IDPP) and Outpatient (OP) Waiting Lists. National waiting lists data by hospital site and by specialty is published by the NTPF on their website (. ) and is publicly available.</p><p>The information requested by the deputy concerning the number of patients on IPDC and outpatient waiting lists in CHO9 is outlined in the attached document.</p><p>  ">IPDCOPD</p></reply>

Approximately 770 additional beds have been provided to date. The National Development Plan provides for the addition of the full 2,590 beds by the earlier date of 2027.</p><p>Since December 2017, an additional 25 beds have opened in University Hospital Limerick. A capital budget of &euro;19.5 million has been approved for the provision of a modular 60-bed inpatient ward block at the hospital, with funding of &euro;10 million allocated in 2019. This important project will go some way towards addressing the acknowledged lack of bed capacity in the region. </p><p>In relation to the specific proposals referred to by the Deputy, I have asked the HSE to respond directly. </p><p>The Deputy may wish to note that my Department wrote to the HSE on 29th June to request the development of a comprehensive Winter Plan for winter 20/21 taking account of the additional challenges presented by Covid 19. It is expected that the plan will be available in late August. It is recognised that providing a safe, efficient emergency department service will be extremely challenging in 20/21. The Covid 19 pandemic is likely to fundamentally change the provision of scheduled and unscheduled care in our hospitals with greater challenges in terms of infection prevention and control. This will require greater social distancing in waiting and treating rooms, use of PPE, testing for Covid 19, greater requirement for isolation facilities and will require the minimisation of the use of trolleys in the provision of care to patients. </p><p>The 2020/21 Winter Plan will have to provide for the safe delivery of emergency care services in a Covid-19 environment. It will prioritise the further integration of acute and community care pathways to shift care to community settings in line with the vision set out in Sl&aacute;intecare. The Winter Plan will seek to reduce attendances at EDs by offering alternatives in the community, including support for Community Intervention Teams, Frailty Intervention Teams and home care services. Initiatives to provide more care in the community will focus on older people and those with chronic diseases. It will also seek to reduce the number of people receiving care on trolleys by having capacity available to admit patients in a timely manner.</p></reply>
