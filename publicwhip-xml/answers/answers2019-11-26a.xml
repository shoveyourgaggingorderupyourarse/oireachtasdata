The HSE service best suited to an individual patient is determined by the level of the intellectual disability and of the mental health difficulty.</p><p>The mental health policy, A Vision for Change, recommended the development of mental health<i></i>intellectual disability (MHID) teams, to provide population-wide coverage and ensure fair and equal access to mental healthcare for people of all ages with an intellectual disability and autism.</p><p>In 2017, the HSE&rsquo;s national mental health service, in co-operation with social care services, initiated a new service improvement programme, to develop both adult and CAMHS MHID services nationally, and to further the operationalisation of A Vision for Change for this speciality. </p><p>Increased Government investment in mental health has enabled this person-centred MHID team model of care, to ensure consistent service delivery. This model is being adopted nationally and will augment existing mental health teams, as needed. </p><p>Since 2012, the Government has added &euro;315 million to the mental health budget. This is an increase of 45% over this time. This investment has enabled the enhancement of specialist mental health services in areas such as MHID, eating disorders and ADHD.</p><p>A Vision for Change also recommended the development of acute beds and day hospital services for MHID treatment. 10 beds have been specifically dedicated for MHID in the new 170-bed state-of-the-art complex in Portrane, which will replace the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum. The new facility will modernise the forensic mental health service in Ireland. The complex will also contain a 10 bedroom forensic child and adolescent mental health unit and a 30 bedroom intensive care rehabilitation unit will be co-located on the site.</p><p>Investment in acute MHID services will continue to be prioritised and developed as part of the HSE MHID service improvement programme, in conjunction with HSE social care and Section 38 and 39 voluntary agencies. The development of innovative acute treatment services including therapeutic respite for children with intellectual disabilities and significant mental health and behavioural support needs, will also be explored. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-11-26a.13.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019112600056#WRA01200"><p>Ambulance turnaround times provide the time interval from ambulance arrival time at a hospital, to when the ambulance crew declares readiness to accept another call. The performance target for 2019 is that 95% of all ambulances have an interval of less than 60 minutes from arrival at the ED to when the ambulance crew declares readiness to accept another call. As of September 2019, 87.3% of ambulances at Midlands Regional Hospital Tullamore achieved a turnaround time of 60 minutes of less. </p>  <p>  When the emergency care system at Hospitals are under pressure, there is the potential for delay in the transfer of care of patients from ambulance to Emergency Department personnel.  An Ambulance Turnaround Framework was developed which sets out the process that alerts management, to increases in emergency demand and activity resulting in the delayed transfer of care of patients and delays in the release of ambulance resources. A management process is then employed to ensure the timely release of all ambulance resources in a safe manner allowing timely service delivery to patients.</p>  <p>   My Department has engaged extensively with the HSE this year to identify mitigating actions to bring down trolley numbers and waiting times in the ED in the face of growing demand. The HSE Winter Plan was launched on Thursday 14 November in preparation for the anticipated increase in demand over the winter period and is supported by an additional &euro;26m in winter funding nationally, with specific funding allocated to the Winter Action Teams to support initiatives at local level. </p>  <p>  I have been assured that the HSE is committed to ensuring that patient care remains seamless and that patients are clinically handed over in a safe, professional and timely manner; with the safety and dignity of the patient being of paramount importance.</p></reply>

The number of patients attending Emergency Departments continues to increase year on year. HSE figures show that for the first ten months of 2019, the number of patients attending Naas Hospital decreased by 1%, however, the number of attendances of patients over the age of 75 increased by 6% compared to the same period in 2018. Similarly, admissions in Naas Hospital decreased by 2.1% while admissions of patients over the age of 75 increased by 3.5% compared to the same period last year. This reflects increasing demand for unscheduled care, especially by patients in the 75 years and over age group. The HSE has indicated that people in this age cohort attending hospital emergency departments are more likely to be admitted and generally stay twice as long as the general population. </p>  <p>  The HSE Winter Plan was launched on Thursday 14 November in preparation for the anticipated increase in demand over the winter period. Th Government has allocated an additional 26m to fund the Plan.  Nine Winter Action Teams, each aligned to a Community Healthcare Organisation and associated acute hospitals and Hospital Groups, have prepared Integrated Winter Plans. These plans focus on demand management and reduction, staffing availability, timely access to the most appropriate care pathway for patients, and appropriate timely discharge from acute hospitals. Each Action Team has set out a range of initiatives it will undertake within its area to implement the Plan. </p>  <p>  I am confident that with the immediate measures being undertaken under the Winter Plan and the strategic approach undertaken by the Government under Sl&aacute;intecare that progress will be made in addressing the difficulties in the emergency departments.</p></reply>

The Government is committed to addressing this deficit and transforming how we deliver health services by implementing the vision set out in the Sl&aacute;intecare Action Plan. I am determined that we develop a more comprehensive and integrated community and primary care system and shift the focus of our system so that the majority of healthcare is provided, where possible, either at home or close to home in the community.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s commitment to reform can be seen in Budget 2020 with the allocation of &euro;10m to provide for the enhancement of Community Services, building to a full-year allocation of &euro;60m in 2021.  This significant investment by Government will enable the recruitment of up to 1,000 therapists, nurses and other frontline staff.  North Dublin, like the rest of the country, will benefit from this investment which will support the development of a more integrated and comprehensive primary and community care system.  </p>  <p>  Turning specifically to the situation in North Dublin, I understand that the recruitment of six OTs has been approved by the local Head of Service for Primary Care to fill vacancies that currently exist.  Derogation from temporary employment controls has been sought and once received all vacant posts will be offered out as appropriate and without delay.  It is expected that waiting time swill be reduced significantly once extra resources are in place. </p>  <p>  I also understand that North Dublin, along with other CHOs, are implementing local action plans to address waiting times and that these include a focus on long waiters, cross cover arrangements and maximisation of the supports available from administrative staff and OT Assistants.  </p></reply>

The number of patients attending emergency departments continues to increase year on year.

This reflects increasing demand for unscheduled care, especially by patients in the 75 years and over age group. </p>  <p>  There are a number of factors which may affect the waiting times for older patients. In particular, people in the older age category presenting to EDs are more likely to have complex needs and be admitted then the population generally. </p>  <p>  In preparation for the anticipated increase in demand over the winter period the HSE Winter Plan was launched on Thursday 14 November. Nine Winter Action Teams, each aligned to a Community Healthcare Organisation and associated acute hospitals and Hospital Groups, have prepared Integrated Winter Plans.

Each Action Team has set out a range of initiatives it will undertake within its area to implement the Plan. </p>  <p>  There are challenges facing the emergency departments in our hospitals. The Government is tackling these issues through providing funding of &euro;26m for the immediate measures being undertaken in the Winter Plan this year, through the Sl&aacute;intecare Strategy and the investment being made in accordance Project Ireland 2040.  These measures are addressing the issues of access to healthcare and capacity in the system. </p>  <p>  I am confident that together with the more immediate measures being undertaken under the Winter Plan and the strategic approach undertaken by the Government under Sl&aacute;intecare and Project Ireland that progress will be made in addressing the difficulties in the emergency departments.</p></reply>

However, I am pleased to say that an alternative developer has been identified, and a Letter of Intent to develop a centre via operational lease was issued in July 2019.I understand that a review of the existing building design and planning conditions has been undertaken and that a new planning application to amend the existing grant of planning has been submitted. </p><p>The Rathdrum Primary Care Centre is further advanced and I understand that the HSE is in contract discussions with the developer. </p><p>Unfortunately, it is not possible at this stage to provide a definitive operational date for the two centres. Nonetheless, delivering these projects is representative of this Government's support for the development of the primary care sector.  There are now 128 Primary Care Centres in operation with a further 20 centres expected to open by the end of 2020.  </p><p>These modern, well-equipped and accessible premises support the development of primary care services in line with the vision of Sl&aacute;intecare.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-11-26a.33.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1261" speakername="Jim Daly" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019112600056#WRA03200"><p>Homecare is an increasingly important part of the supports enabling older people to remain in their own homes and communities for as long as possible and for facilitating their discharge from acute hospitals.  While we have seen significant investment in recent years in home support there is unmet need and demand is growing for the service.  Nationally, at the end of August 7,255 people had been assessed and were waiting for either new or additional home support services.</p>  <p>  The HSE has assured the Department that those people who are on a waiting list are reviewed, as funding becomes available, to ensure that individual cases continue to be dealt with on a priority basis within the available resources and as determined by the local front line staff who know and understand the clients&rsquo; needs, and who undertake regular reviews of those care needs to ensure that the services being provided remain appropriate. In addition, people being discharged from acute hospitals, who are in a position to return home with supports, are prioritised.  </p>  <p>  We have made improved access to home support services a priority and an additional investment of &euro;52 million brings the total funding for home supports to approximately &euro;487 million in 2020.  Next year the HSE aims to deliver over 19.2 million hours of home support, representing a substantial increase of 1 million hours more than this year&rsquo;s target.    </p>  <p>  Delayed Transfers of Care is a complex and challenging issue and a wide range of factors may contribute to this, including process and service-related matters. The Report of the Independent Expert Review of Delayed Discharges, published last year, highlights the complexities involved. The latest data available (19th November) indicates that nationally there were 29 people in hospital classified as delayed and waiting funding for a home support package. This is represents about 4% of all cases. Nevertheless, home support along with other community measures are a long established and recognised feature of support timely egress from our acute hospitals. </p>  <p>  The importance of these supports is further recognised in the HSE's recently published winter plan. The Winter Plan provides additional resources to facilitate a reduction in Delayed Transfers of Care by supporting the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, Transitional Care and Home Supports. &euro;2 million of this funding has been allocated for the provision of an additional 1,110 home support packages with 600 of these allocated across the CHOs to deal specifically with clients assessed and waiting for home supports.</p>  <p>  Following the 2018 publication of the Independent Expert Review of Delayed Discharges, an implementation group has been established by the HSE to progress the recommendations.

The number of patients attending Emergency Departments continues to increase year on year. HSE figures show that for the first ten months of 2019, the number of patients attending Beaumont Hospital increased by 0.9% and the number of attendances of patients over the age of 75 increased by 7.1% compared to the same period in 2018. However it should also be highlighted that the number of patients recorded as waiting on trolleys in Beaumont Hospital decreased by 1.6% this year compared to 2018 and have remained consistently low throughout 2019.</p>  <p>  In relation to the Mater University hospital, HSE figures show that for the first ten months of 2019, the number of patients attending the Hospital increased by 2.5%, however, the number of attendances of patients over the age of 75 decreased by 1.6% compared to the same period in 2018. </p>  <p>  The figures for both hospitals show the continued high level of demand for services at emergency departments. </p>  <p>  The HSE Winter Plan was launched on Thursday 14 November in preparation for the anticipated increase in demand over the winter period. The Government has provided additional funding of &euro;26m to support the implementation of the Plan.  Nine Winter Action Teams, each aligned to a Community Healthcare Organisation and associated acute hospitals and Hospital Groups, have prepared Integrated Winter Plans. These plans focus on demand management and reduction, staffing availability, timely access to the most appropriate care pathway for patients, and appropriate timely discharge from acute hospitals.  Each Action Team has set out a range of initiatives it will undertake within its area to implement the Plan. </p>  <p>  I acknowledge the challenges that are facing the emergency departments in our hospitals. In addition to the immediate measures being undertaken in the Winter Plan the Government through the Sl&aacute;intecare Strategy is addressing the issues of access to healthcare. The Sl&aacute;intecare Action Plan for 2019 has a specific workstream on access and waiting lists. The Government is also increasing investment in health infrastructure and capacity in the system in line with Project Ireland 2040. </p>  <p>  I am confident that together with the more immediate measures being undertaken under the Winter Plan and the strategic approach undertaken by the Government under Sl&aacute;intecare that progress will be made in addressing the difficulties in the emergency departments.</p></reply>

There are now 70 CAMHS teams nationally, compared to 49 in 2008, and 3 Paediatric Liaison Teams. All aspects of CAMHS nationally are being improved by the HSE under its annual Service Plans. This includes better out-of-hours and 7/7 day cover, progression of Day Hospital care, developing specialist teams such as Eating Disorders, and improved Prevention and Early Intervention services.</p>  <p>  HSE Mental Health services will receive &euro;1.026 billion in funding in 2020, an increase of &euro;315m since 2012. </p>  <p>  The national CAMHS waiting list has reduced by around 500 so far this year, from around 2,500 in December 2018 to around 2,000 in August 2019. </p>  <p>  There were 63 children awaiting an appointment for the Balbriggan and Swords CAMHS teams at the end of October last, of which, 31 (or just under half) are waiting up to 3 months and 50 (or 80%) are waiting up to 6 months with the remainder waiting between 6 and 12 months.</p>  <p>  CAMHS in North County Dublin, which includes Balbriggan and Swords, serves one of the fastest growing catchment areas in Ireland, including a significant young population.  Based on Census data, Balbriggan CAMHS serves an under 18 population of nearly 18,000 and Swords CAMHS serves an under 18 population of around 25,000. </p>  <p>  Both North County Dublin CAMHS teams have reported higher volumes of referrals this year, of up to 10% to the end of October last along with increased levels of more acute presentations. Both teams have had staffing challenges during this year. This has been addressed by the HSE with posts being replaced and filled across Nursing, Occupational Therapy, Speech and Language Therapy, Psychology, Social Work and Administration support.</p>  <p>  This will greatly assist the teams in reducing waiting lists in a defined, coordinated and sustainable manner.  The CAMHS service will continue to strive to reduce waiting lists across all of North Dublin.</p></reply>

The performance target for 2019 is that 95% of all ambulances have an interval of less than 60 minutes from arrival at the ED to when the ambulance crew declares readiness to accept another call. As of September 2019, 77.6% of ambulances at Mayo University Hospital achieved a turnaround time of 60 minutes of less. </p>  <p>  When the emergency care system at Hospitals are under pressure, there is the potential for delay in the transfer of care of patients from ambulance to Emergency Department personnel.  An Ambulance Turnaround Framework was developed which sets out the process that alerts management, to increases in emergency demand and activity resulting in the delayed transfer of care of patients and delays in the release of ambulance resources. A management process is then employed to ensure the timely release of all ambulance resources in a safe manner allowing timely service delivery to patients.</p>  <p>  My Department has engaged extensively with the HSE this year to identify mitigating actions to bring down trolley numbers and waiting times in the ED in the face of growing demand.

All HPV vaccines available in the EU are authorised by the European Medicines Agency (EMA).  </p>  <p>  The HPRA has advised that the specific HPV vaccine trial has not been identified in this query.  This response is therefore only made in relation to the HPV vaccine that been chosen by the HSE for use in current HPV schools immunisation programme, which is Gardasil 9.  The EMA website provides information on the authorisation of Gardasil 9 including information for the public and product information for healthcare professionals. </p>  <p>  The safety of HPV vaccines have been studied for over 13 years.  Over 1 million people have been studied during clinical trials since the vaccine was licensed in 2006.  No country has raised concerns about the safety of the HPV vaccine.  There is no scientific evidence in Ireland or in any other country that the HPV vaccine causes any long-term medical condition.</p>  <p>  All international bodies have continually reported that the vaccines used in Ireland have no long-term side effects.  Most people have no problems after the vaccine.  The HPV vaccine has many of the same, mild side effects as other vaccines.  Some people have an area of soreness, swelling and redness in their arm where the injection was given.  This is nothing to worry about as this usually passes after a day or two.  Some people may get a headache, feel sick in their tummy or have a slight temperature.  If this happens, paracetamol or ibuprofen will help.  Occasionally, some people may feel unwell and faint after getting their injection.  To prevent this, they should sit down and rest for 15 minutes after the vaccination.  Severe allergic reactions to vaccines are very rare.  School vaccination teams are trained to treat any severe allergic reaction.  If you are worried, you should talk to your GP or a member of the school vaccination team.</p>  <p>  All medicines, including vaccines are subject to on-going review and evaluation of all available data from a range of sources, including systematic scientific literature review, to consider any impact that their data may have on the overall assessment of the benefits and risks of a medicinal product.  </p>  <p>  The HPRA and the EMA continually monitor adverse events to vaccination.  The HPRA operates a national adverse reaction reporting system, which members of the public and healthcare professionals are encouraged to submit any suspected adverse reactions to.  All Reports received by the HPRA are routinely transmitted to the EMA's adverse reaction database for inclusion in global signal detection and monitoring activities.</p></reply>

The therapist in conjunction with the parents or carer will determine the severity of the child&rsquo;s difficulties and prioritize for therapy accordingly. </p>  <p>  Many children can have their speech and language needs adequately met through uni-disciplinary Speech and Language therapy services in Primary Care. Children with more complex needs requiring multi-disciplinary intervention, are referred to specialist disability services.</p>  <p>  I have been advised by the HSE that the following measures are in place to reduce waiting times to access Speech and Language Therapy services in County Meath.</p>  <p>  A cross divisional monthly Speech and Language referral forum is in operation. Between August and November 2019 this resulted in 99 children being moved from the Disability waiting list, to have their therapy service provided in Primary Care, where the waiting list is less lengthy. This ensures that children with complex needs continue to receive specialist Disability services but in a more timely manner, whilst those who can have their needs met in Primary Care benefit from the shorter waiting times. </p>  <p>  Two vacant Speech and Language therapy posts were filled with both new staff starting work in November. The HSE expect that to see an improvement in waiting times in early 2020 following the induction of these two therapists. The HSE also allocated 1 WTE new Speech and Language Therapy post to County Meath under Progressing Disability for Children and Young People Progamme and this post has been assigned to the Trim Network where waiting times are longest. </p>  <p>  The Speech and Language therapy services in County Meath monitor all staff&rsquo;s statistics on a monthly basis (based on agreed caseloads), and are subject to review and supervison by the Speech and Language Therapy Manager. In addition the Speech and Language Therapy services in County Meath regularly review and update service models to ensure adherence to best, evidence-based practice. </p>  <p>  The service have also implemented 'Parent Power', a programme of workshops that run regularly throughout the year to support parents in managing their child's communication at home whilst awaiting one to one Speech and Language Therapy. These workshops were designed based on solution focused interviews with a cohort of parents awaiting services, to ensure they would meet the needs of families in this area.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge that timely access to Speech and language Therapy is vital for every child&rsquo;s development and I understand how delays in accessing assessment and intervention are a source of great concern for both children and their families. While not addressing all needs, the filling of the new post and the two vacant posts along with the other initiatives I have outlined will have a significant positive impact in reducing waiting times for Speech and Language Therapy services in County Meath over the course of the next year.</p></reply>

In 2018, DCCAE obtained Cabinet approval to prohibit or restrict the cultivation of GM crops in Ireland, enabling Ireland to opt out of the cultivation of GMO crops approved for cultivation elsewhere in the EU. </p>  <p>  DAFM is responsible for GM animal feeds, the coexistence of authorised GM crops alongside non-GM crops and the seed certification related to GM products.  DAFM&rsquo;s sole responsibility in relation to the deliberate release of GM crops relates to the implementation of coexistence measures in the event that commercial GM crops are authorised for cultivation alongside conventional crops.  DAFM has advised that there is only one GM crop authorised for cultivation in the EU, namely GM maize &lsquo;MON 810&rsquo;, which is mainly grown in Spain for animal feed. MON 810 is not suited for cultivation in Ireland. </p>  <p>  The Department of Health&rsquo;s remit in this area relates to policy on the safety of food.  The Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) provides scientific and technical advice; it is the Competent Authority responsible for the implementation of GM food legislation in Ireland. Under Regulation (EC) No. 1829/2003, only EU-authorised GM foods may be placed on the market in Ireland.  Stringent traceability and labelling rules must be observed for the marketing of these foods.  The FSAI coordinates annual checks to ensure that any authorised GM foods present on the Irish market are labelled as required.  There is no indication at present that EU legislation related to GM foods will change in the immediate future. </p>  <p>  GM crops, food and feed are subject to a comprehensive risk assessment by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and subsequent regulatory votes by Member States before they are authorised for use in the EU.  The risk assessment is designed to ensure GM crops and GM food and feed do not pose a risk to human health, animal health and the environment.</p></reply>

The changes to the Scheme will come into effect as soon as the legislative process is successfully complete. The Department will progress this as quickly as possible, however, the timeline for completion of the legislation will also depend on how it passes through the Houses. The General Scheme was sent to the relevant Joint Committee and the Department participated in pre-legislative scrutiny on 13 November 2019. The Department looks forward to the report of the Committee following from this engagement. In the meantime, engagements with the Office of the Attorney General will continue with a view to progressing the legislative development process. </p>  <p>  It is intended that this proposed policy change, the 3 year cap, will be extended to eligible existing participants in long term residential care so that they are not disadvantaged, but that there would be no retrospective recoupment of contributions for those who have paid contributions over and above the 3 year period.</p></reply>

A GP referral to a gynaecologist is the standard pathway of care for the management of endometriosis in Ireland.  This is similar to the pathway in place for the management of other gynaecological conditions. </p>  <p>  Information provided by the HSE indicates that endometriosis is a difficult condition to diagnose and treat because of the variation of presentations, impacting the physical and mental wellbeing of patients at varying levels. Treatment may include pain medications, hormone treatment and surgical interventions.  The time to diagnose endometriosis varies by patient due to its varying and ambiguous symptom presentation. The HSE's National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme has advised that the best way to help the majority of patients with endometriosis is to improve access to gynaecology services. </p>  <p>  As such, I am advised that the Programme has developed a plan to increase the capacity and reduce waiting times for women awaiting general gynaecology, which includes patients with endometriosis. The plan aims to re-orient general gynaecology service to an ambulatory (see and treat) model rather than the traditional outpatient referral model. The HSE anticipates that funding available to the Programme in 2020 will support the establishment of three ambulatory services and future sites are envisaged.  </p>  <p>  The Programme has advised that the provision of training in the management and diagnosis of endometriosis forms an integral part of the specialist medical training programme provided by the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. In addition, some clinicians may have developed a subspecialty interest in the disease and may treat patients who have a more complex form of the disease. </p></reply>

In the consultant category there has been an increase of over 600 whole time equivalents in the past five years, while for nurses and midwives the figure is over 3,500. </p>  <p>  This incremental growth in frontline staffing numbers is ongoing, and in the 12-month period to end October 2019, there continued to be increases with circa 150 additional consultants and 650 extra nurses and midwives. </p>  <p>  Regarding consultants, the recommendations of the 2017 Sl&aacute;intecare Report re-orientates the Irish health system towards one that prioritises fair and equal access to consultant led care for all patients. My Department recently published the de Buitl&eacute;ir report, following the establishment of a Group to examine how to give effect to the Sl&aacute;intecare recommendation on the removal of private practice from the public hospital system.  The recommendations of this report provide the pathway to deliver on the Sl&aacute;intecare vision of a consultant delivered model of care and addressing issues with regard to safe staffing levels. </p>  <p>  The Government is committed to the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare.  In this regard, my Department, together with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the HSE, recently met with both the IMO and the IHCA, and will be seeking to continue to engage with both bodies on Sl&aacute;intecare and the de Buitl&eacute;ir report.  As the Taoiseach outlined recently to the House, progress is being made between my Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of An Taoiseach on the approach to implement the de Buitl&eacute;ir recommendations.  It is through the implementation of this major reform that issues in relation to Consultant recruitment, retention, pay and other conditions will be addressed.</p></reply>

In a recent press release, the Irish College of General Practitioners stated it had received the highest ever number of applications for its 2020 GP training programme. </p>  <p>  Currently there are 2,508 GPs contracted to provide services under the GMS Scheme and as at 1 November 2019, 22 panels, or less than 1%, are vacant.   </p>  <p>  In relation to the vacant GMS panel in Milltown Co Kerry, the HSE has repeatedly advertised this GMS list of 380 patients in an effort to put in place a permanent GP to serve the practice.  However, the financial viability of a practice of this size is a challenge for GPs and it has not been possible to find a replacement.</p>  <p>  As a result of this, the HSE wrote to the GMS patients served by this practice in early November 2019 advising them that the practice would close in December 2019 and providing them with information on how to find an alternative GP.</p>  <p>  In light of the community reaction to this announcement, Cork Kerry Community Healthcare held a meeting with the local community and public representatives on Monday November 18 to listen to local concerns and to discuss any possible additional measures that could be taken to attract a GP to the GMS contract in Milltown.  Cork Kerry Community Healthcare has also postponed the closure of the practice to early 2020 to provide time to the local community to work on possible additional measures.</p></reply>

This is in recognition of the need to ensure that general practice is compatible with doctors&rsquo; family commitments.</p>  <p>  In addition, the number of medical graduates undertaking GP training has increased from 120 in 2009 to 192 filled places in 2019, with a further increase expected next year. In a recent press release, the Irish College of General Practitioners stated it had received the highest ever number of applications for its 2020 GP training programme. </p>  <p>  I am confident that the measures outlined in the Agreement with GPs on contractual reform and service developments will make general practice more sustainable and a more attractive career option for doctors, thus increasing GP capacity and helping to ensure that all patients have access to GP services.</p>  <p>  In relation to the availability of GP services in Carlow and Kilkenny, as this is an operational issue I have asked the HSE to reply to the directly to the Deputy in relation to this issue.</p></reply>

Similarly, admissions in University Hospital Limerick decreased by 11.3%. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the decrease in attendances and admissions at UHL there has been an increase of 16% of the number of patients waiting on trollies as compared to this time last year.   There are a number of factors which may affect the waiting times for older patients. In particular, people in the older age category presenting to EDs are more likely to have complex needs and be admitted then the population generally. Consequently, a higher number of these patients may have to be accommodated on trolleys, pending their admission to a ward. There are also issues around delayed discharges of care which can cause congestion within hospital emergency departments. In the case of UHL there has been an increase of 185% in the number of delayed discharges of care. </p>  <p>  The HSE Winter Plan was launched on Thursday 14 November in preparation for the anticipated increase in demand over the winter period. The Government allocated an additional &euro;26m to fund the implementation of the Plan. Nine Winter Action Teams, each aligned to a Community Healthcare Organisation and associated acute hospitals and Hospital Groups, have prepared Integrated Winter Plans. These plans focus on demand management and reduction, staffing availability, timely access to the most appropriate care pathway for patients, and appropriate timely discharge from acute hospitals. Each Action Team has set out a range of initiatives it will undertake within its area to implement the Plan. </p>  <p>  In relation to UHL a capital budget of &euro;19.5 million has been approved for the provision of a modular 60-bed inpatient ward block at the Hospital, with funding of &euro;10 million allocated in 2019. The HSE have advised that the enabling works are complete, and the main contractor is now commencing work. This important project will go some way towards addressing the acknowledged lack of bed capacity in the region.  </p>  <p>  I acknowledge the challenges that are facing the emergency departments in our hospitals. In addition to the immediate measures being undertaken in the Winter Plan, the Government through the Sl&aacute;intecare Strategy and the investment being made in accordance Project Ireland 2040, is addressing the issues of access to healthcare and capacity in the system. </p>  <p>  I am confident that together with the more immediate measures being undertaken under the Winter Plan and the strategic approach undertaken by the Government under Sl&aacute;intecare and Project Ireland that progress will be made in addressing the difficulties in the emergency departments.</p></reply>

The HSE service best suited to an individual patient is determined by the level of the intellectual disability and of the mental health difficulty.</p><p>The mental health policy, A Vision for Change, recommended the development of mental health<i></i>intellectual disability (MHID) teams, to provide population-wide coverage and ensure fair and equal access to mental healthcare for people of all ages with an intellectual disability.</p><p>In 2017, the HSE&rsquo;s national mental health service, in co-operation with social care services, initiated a new service improvement programme, to develop both adult and CAMHS MHID services nationally, and to further the operationalisation of A Vision for Change for this speciality. </p><p>Increased Government investment in mental health has enabled this person-centred MHID team model of care, to ensure consistent service delivery. This model is being adopted nationally and will augment existing mental health teams, as needed. </p><p>Since 2012, the Government has added &euro;315 million to the mental health budget. This is an increase of 45% over this time. This investment has enabled the enhancement of specialist mental health services in areas such as MHID, eating disorders and ADHD.</p><p>A Vision for Change also recommended the development of acute beds and day hospital services for MHID treatment. 10 beds have been specifically dedicated for MHID in the new 170-bed state-of-the-art complex in Portrane, which will replace the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum. The new facility will modernise the forensic mental health service in Ireland. The complex will also contain a 10 bedroom forensic child and adolescent mental health unit and a 30 bedroom intensive care rehabilitation unit will be co-located on the site.</p><p>Investment in acute MHID services will continue to be prioritised and developed as part of the HSE MHID service improvement programme, in conjunction with HSE social care and Section 38 and 39 voluntary agencies. The development of innovative acute treatment services, including therapeutic respite for children with intellectual disabilities and significant mental health and behavioural support needs, will also be explored.</p></reply>

There are also issues around delayed discharges of care which can cause congestion within hospital emergency departments.</p>  <p>  The HSE Winter Plan was launched on Thursday 14 November in preparation for the anticipated increase in demand over the winter period. The Government allocated an additional &euro;26m to fund the implementation of the Plan. Nine Winter Action Teams, each aligned to a Community Healthcare Organisation and associated acute hospitals and Hospital Groups, have prepared Integrated Winter Plans. These plans focus on demand management and reduction, staffing availability, timely access to the most appropriate care pathway for patients, and appropriate timely discharge from acute hospitals. Each Action Team has set out a range of initiatives it will undertake within its area to implement the Plan. </p>  <p>  I acknowledge the challenges that are facing the emergency departments in our hospitals. In addition to the immediate measures being undertaken in the Winter Plan, the Government through the Sl&aacute;intecare Strategy and the investment being made in accordance Project Ireland 2040, is addressing the issues of access to healthcare and capacity in the system. </p>  <p>  I am confident that together with the more immediate measures being undertaken under the Winter Plan and the strategic approach undertaken by the Government under Sl&aacute;intecare and Project Ireland that progress will be made in addressing the difficulties in the emergency departments.</p></reply>

However, the latest NTPF Outpatient figures show that the number of patients waiting has decreased by 2,277 since August 2019.</p>  <p>  Budget 2020 announced that the Government has further increased investment in tackling waiting lists, with funding to the NTPF increasing from &euro;75 million in 2019 to &euro;100 million in 2020. </p>  <p>  My Department is working with the HSE and National Treatment Purchase Fund to develop the Scheduled Care Access Plan 2020.

Of these, 28% (148) are waiting 3 months or less, 66% (351) are waiting 9 months or less and 79% (419) are waiting 12 months or less. </p>  <p>  I am aware that Cork University Maternity Hospital have made considerable improvements to their Outpatients Waiting List over the past year. As a result of the hard work of their dedicated staff and their positive engagement with the NTPF, the Outpatient Waiting List at Cork University Maternity Hospital has decreased by 66% (-2,182) when compared to the same period last year. </p>  <p>  The NTPF figures show that at the end of October there were 1,115 patients the outpatient waiting list. Of these, 70% (780) are waiting 3 months or less and 91% (1,012) are waiting 6 months or less. </p>  <p>  The NTPF has advised my Department that they have approved a number of IPDC and Outpatient proposals for Cork University Maternity Hospital in 2019, providing up to 1,720 procedures and appointments for patients. These initiatives include providing additional capacity at Cork University Maternity Hospital to facilitate 2-day (weekday) theatre service for the rest of this year to assist with addressing the longest waiters.  </p>  <p>  More broadly, Budget 2020 announced that the Government has further increased investment in tackling waiting lists, with funding to the NTPF increasing from &euro;75 million in 2019 to &euro;100 million in 2019. The year-on-year increases to the NTPF since Budget 2017 reflect this Government&rsquo;s priority to improve waiting times for patients to access hospital treatment. The Department of Health is working with the HSE and NTPF to develop the Scheduled Care Access Plan 2020, which will include gynaecology services.</p>  <p>  In this regard, I would encourage all hospital groups and individual hospitals to engage with the NTPF to identify waiting list proposals for the remainder of this year and for 2020.</p></reply>

This comprised &euro;20 million continuing cost in 2019 of developments initiated in 2018, combined with &euro;35 million for further new developments. </p>  <p>  To date, the HSE has requested allocation of &euro;40.246 million of this funding, which has been approved. In addition, &euro;3 million has been paid to Pobal for the Community Mental Health Fund. An amount of &euro;11.754 million remains under consideration.</p>  <p>  The new development investment has enabled the HSE Mental Health Services to progress initiatives agreed in the National Service Plan 2019. Initiatives such as e-mental health pilot programmes and an annual increase in psychiatric nurse undergraduate places continue to be developed and implemented with this funding. The relocation of the National Forensic Mental Health Service to Portrane is another significant investment undertaken by HSE Mental Health Services.</p>  <p>  Budget 2020 saw the Government continue this commitment to mental health by increasing funding by &euro;39m to &euro;1.026bn. This represents an increase of over &euro;315 million since 2012, or 45%.  </p>  <p>  This significant additional Government funding has provided for over 1,800 new development posts for mental health services, including CAMHS. Enhancement of the specialist CAMHS service, including improving access and reducing waiting lists, remains a priority for the Government. We have reduced the CAMHS waiting list by around 500 since December 2018, to around 2,000 today.</p></reply>

My Department has engaged extensively with the HSE this year to identify mitigating actions to bring down trolley numbers and waiting times in the ED in the face of growing demand.</p><p>The HSE Winter Plan was launched on Thursday 14 November in preparation for the anticipated increase in demand over the winter period. The Government allocated an additional &euro;26m to fund the implementation of the Plan. Nine Winter Action Teams, each aligned to a Community Healthcare Organisation and associated acute hospitals and Hospital Groups, have prepared Integrated Winter Plans. These plans focus on demand management and reduction, staffing availability, timely access to the most appropriate care pathway for patients, and appropriate timely discharge from acute hospitals. </p><p>Each Action Team has set out a range of initiatives it will undertake within its area to implement the Plan.  The Integrated Winter Plan for University Hospital Limerick will be delivered by Winter Action Team 3 (WAT 3). The initiatives for WAT 3 include:</p><p>- additional home support hours to facilitate early hospital to community transfers;</p><p>- additional aids and appliances to facilitate early hospital discharges and ED avoidance;</p><p>- mobile doctor service units to manage increase demand for home visits and facilitate ED avoidance;</p><p>- low level Domiciliary Rehab team in Limerick city to facilitate early discharge and ED avoidance;</p><p>- added Triage nursing support in Shannondoc to support ED avoidance;</p><p>- added Registrar in UHL to assist in addressing workflow and improve PET times;</p><p>- added Health Care Assistants support in UHL to provide staffing at ward level to support additional surge patients. </p><p>It should also be noted in relation to UHL a capital budget of &euro;19.5 million has been approved for the provision of a modular 60-bed inpatient ward block at the Hospital, with funding of &euro;10 million allocated in 2019. The HSE have advised that the enabling works are complete, and the main contractor is now commencing work. This important project will go some way towards addressing the acknowledged lack of bed capacity in the region</p><p>In addition to the immediate measures being undertaken in the Winter Plan the Government through the Sl&aacute;intecare Strategy is addressing the issues of access to healthcare. The Sl&aacute;intecare Action Plan for 2019 has a specific workstream on access and waiting lists. The Government is also increasing investment in health infrastructure and capacity in the system in line with Project Ireland 2040. </p><p>I am confident that together with the more immediate measures being undertaken under the Winter Plan and the strategic approach undertaken by the Government under Sl&aacute;intecare that progress will be made in addressing the difficulties in the emergency departments.</p></reply>

The Expert Group also concluded that a person&rsquo;s means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card. This position remains unchanged.</p>  <p>  However, every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines.  The HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income threshold where they face difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness. Social and medical issues are also considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services. </p>  <p>  With regard to persons suffering from cancer and other serious medical conditions the HSE also has a system in place for the provision of medical cards in response to emergency situations i.e. in circumstances where persons are in need of urgent or on-going medical care that they cannot afford and also for persons in palliative care who are terminally ill. These medical cards are promptly issued on receipt of an application, which should include a medical report from a health care professional involved in the person&rsquo;s care. In addition, since 1 July 2015, the HSE adopted the position that all children under 18 years of age with a diagnosis of cancer are awarded a medical card.  This card is valid for a period of 5 years.</p></reply>

There has been no change to this figure advised to Government.</p>  <p>  An independent review into the cost escalation associated with the new children&rsquo;s hospital construction project was commissioned by the HSE and carried out by PwC. The PwC report makes clear that the Guaranteed Maximum Price established through the two-stage tender process does not provide a contractual ceiling on the project&rsquo;s cost and significant residual risks remain. These include national construction inflation in excess of 4%, any changes in scope, legislative changes and the Sectoral Employment Order. </p>  <p>  The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board manages the project, actively monitoring the performance of the contract. It also has a focus on identifying and managing risks, preventing further cost increases to the greatest extent possible.

In recent years, my Department has worked with the HSE and National Treatment Purchase Fund and made considerable improvements to improve access for patients waiting for high volume procedures and life limiting procedures including cataracts. </p><p>At the end of July 2017, the number of people waiting for a cataract procedure was 10,024. Since then the numbers waiting have consistently improved and at the end of October 2019 they stand at 4,480. Of these, 494 patients are waiting over 9 months which represents a reduction of 90% when compared to July 2017, when the number waiting over 9 months stood at 4,371.</p><p>A key development to improve access to Ophthalmology services was the opening of a stand-alone high-volume consultant-led cataract theatre by the University of Limerick Hospital Group in Nenagh Hospital in 2018, with the intention that it would facilitate patients from surrounding geographical areas to avail of their treatment there. In this context, the HSE has advised that University of Limerick Hospital Group is working collaboratively with the South South-West Hospital Group to review over 1,000 patients on Ophthalmology waiting lists that may be suitable for cataract procedures in Nenagh.</p><p>More broadly, Budget 2020 announced that the Government has further increased investment in tackling waiting lists, with funding to the National Treatment Purchase fund increasing from &euro;75 million in 2019 to &euro;100 million in 2019. The year-on-year increases to the National Treatment Purchase Fund since Budget 2017 reflect this Government&rsquo;s priority to improve waiting times for patients to access hospital treatment. The Department of Health is working with the HSE and National Treatment Purchase Fund to develop the Scheduled Care Access Plan 2020, which will include ophthalmology services.  <b></b></p><p>In this regard, I would encourage all hospital groups and individual hospitals to engage with the NTPF to identify waiting list proposals for the remainder of this year and for 2020.</p></reply>

My Department has engaged extensively with the HSE this year to identify mitigating actions to bring down trolley numbers and waiting times in the ED in the face of growing demand.</p><p>The HSE Winter Plan was launched on Thursday 14 November in preparation for the anticipated increase in demand over the winter period. The Government allocated an additional &euro;26m to fund the implementation of the Plan. Nine Winter Action Teams, each aligned to a Community Healthcare Organisation and associated acute hospitals and Hospital Groups, have prepared Integrated Winter Plans. These plans focus on demand management and reduction, staffing availability, timely access to the most appropriate care pathway for patients, and appropriate timely discharge from acute hospitals. </p><p>Each Action Team has set out a range of initiatives it will undertake within its area to implement the Plan.  The Integrated Winter Plan for University Hospital Limerick will be delivered by Winter Action Team 3 (WAT 3). The initiatives for WAT 3 include:</p><p>- additional home support hours to facilitate early hospital to community transfers;</p><p>- additional aids and appliances to facilitate early hospital discharges and ED avoidance;</p><p>- mobile doctor service units to manage increase demand for home visits and facilitate ED avoidance;</p><p>- low level Domiciliary Rehab team in Limerick city to facilitate early discharge and ED avoidance;</p><p>- added Triage nursing support in Shannondoc to support ED avoidance;</p><p>- added Registrar in UHL to assist in addressing workflow and improve PET times;</p><p>- added Health Care Assistants support in UHL to provide staffing at ward level to support additional surge patients. </p><p>It should also be noted in relation to UHL a capital budget of &euro;19.5 million has been approved for the provision of a modular 60-bed inpatient ward block at the Hospital, with funding of &euro;10 million allocated in 2019. The HSE have advised that the enabling works are complete, and the main contractor is now commencing work. This important project will go some way towards addressing the acknowledged lack of bed capacity in the region</p><p>In addition to the immediate measures being undertaken in the Winter Plan the Government through the Sl&aacute;intecare Strategy is addressing the issues of access to healthcare. The Sl&aacute;intecare Action Plan for 2019 has a specific workstream on access and waiting lists. The Government is also increasing investment in health infrastructure and capacity in the system in line with Project Ireland 2040. </p><p>I am confident that together with the more immediate measures being undertaken under the Winter Plan and the strategic approach undertaken by the Government under Sl&aacute;intecare that progress will be made in addressing the difficulties in the emergency departments.</p></reply>

I would like to assure the Deputy that the Government is committed to the continued development of GP capacity to ensure that patients across the country continue to have access to GP services and has taken a number of measures to improve GP recruitment. </p>  <p>  The recent Agreement on GP contractual reforms will see an increase in expenditure on GP services of &euro;210 million annually by 2023, providing significant increases in capitation fees for participating GPs, and increases in supports for rural practices and practices in urban areas of deprivation.  </p>  <p>  Improved family friendly arrangements are also an important feature of the revised contractual arrangements, with an increase in the locum rate for maternity and paternity cover, and an increase in the paternity leave allowance from 3 days to 2 weeks. This is in recognition of the need to ensure that general practice is compatible with doctors&rsquo; family commitments.</p>  <p>  In addition, the number of medical graduates undertaking GP training has increased from 120 in 2009 to 192 filled places in 2019, with a further increase expected next year.

This year marks the 20th anniversary of the inaugural meeting of the British-Irish Council and it was agreed that the Council continues to be a valued institution of the Good Friday Agreement - it is a vital institution offering opportunities to engage on matters of mutual interest across our respective competencies.</p>  <p>  The Summit provided an opportunity for Ministers to update the Council on their actions regarding Brexit and discuss the latest domestic political developments across their jurisdictions along with topics of mutual interest such as the economy, trade and ongoing relations with the EU.  </p>  <p>  The Council discussed the political situation in Northern Ireland, and regretted that Northern Ireland will not be represented politically at this important forum until the Executive is restored.</p>  <p>  The Summit also heard from Health Ministers from each administration who met that morning to discuss Health and Social Initiatives to Combat Substance Misuse &ndash; in particular, the enhanced, innovative addiction treatment and rehabilitation services which will be central to tackling problematic drug and alcohol use in Dublin&rsquo;s North East Inner City.</p>  <p>  There were no discussions specifically relating to quotas and tariff free trade between Ireland and the UK or on the future relationship between Ireland and the UK in the areas of education and research.</p>  <p>  While I did not have a dedicated bilateral meeting with Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, over the course of several conversations during the Summit we discussed our respective perspectives on the British Irish Council, political developments and agreed that we want to see the Good Friday institutions up and running again as soon as possible.  </p>  <p>  I had a bilateral meeting with First Minister Sturgeon, during which we discussed Brexit, political developments and the ongoing review of bilateral relations between Ireland and Scotland.</p></reply>

The balance of payments is a complex accounting system which summarises economic transactions between Ireland and the rest of the world in a specific time period.  The compilation of the balance of payments is based primarily on enterprise surveys.  The framework includes also actual data and estimates of flows between resident and non-residents in the household, government, and non-profit institutions sectors.</p><p>In this context, workers&rsquo; remittances are all transfers between Irish resident households and non-resident households.  A household is considered to be Irish resident if they have been present for one year or more in Ireland. </p><p>Remittance information is difficult to compile for National Statistics Offices and is usually based on administrative sources and modelling rather than direct collection.  The current CSO data are estimated using Revenue data.  Pay of non-national workers is used to estimate disposable income and to derive a remittance amount.  The approach using indirect data sources is recognised as a standard approach in the IMF Guide for Compilers and Users of International Transactions in Remittances.  The CSO is currently investigating new approaches to deriving remittance information.</p><p>The CSO currently makes no estimate for remittances made to Irish resident households from non-resident households.  This is because: firstly, sources from which to compile such estimates are not readily available; secondly, it is believed that where such remittances are made, they are small in the context of the balance of payments and therefore there is not a pressing requirement to impute a value for them. </p><p>Data on remittances are published by Eurostat for all member states.  The outflows from Ireland are presented in the table below for years 2016-2018 and the first two quarters of 2019. <table>    <tr>       <th></th>       <th>2016</th>       <th>2017</th>       <th>2018</th>       <th>2019Q1*</th>       <th>2019Q2* </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Country</td>       <td>&euro; millions</td>       <td>&euro; millions</td>       <td>&euro; millions</td>       <td>&euro; millions</td>       <td>&euro; millions</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Brazil</td>       <td>9</td>       <td>9</td>       <td>8</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Bulgaria</td>       <td>6</td>       <td>6</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>China</td>       <td>14</td>       <td>15</td>       <td>16</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>4</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Czechia</td>       <td>17</td>       <td>17</td>       <td>16</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>4</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Estonia</td>       <td>7</td>       <td>7</td>       <td>8</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Hungary</td>       <td>28</td>       <td>28</td>       <td>28</td>       <td>7</td>       <td>7</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>India</td>       <td>42</td>       <td>43</td>       <td>44</td>       <td>11</td>       <td>11</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Latvia</td>       <td>50</td>       <td>50</td>       <td>49</td>       <td>12</td>       <td>12</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Lithuania</td>       <td>92</td>       <td>92</td>       <td>92</td>       <td>23</td>       <td>23</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Malaysia</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mexico</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Nigeria</td>       <td>17</td>       <td>17</td>       <td>16</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>4</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Philippines</td>       <td>32</td>       <td>32</td>       <td>32</td>       <td>8</td>       <td>8</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Poland</td>       <td>339</td>       <td>342</td>       <td>341</td>       <td>85</td>       <td>85</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Romania</td>       <td>39</td>       <td>40</td>       <td>40</td>       <td>10</td>       <td>10</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Slovakia</td>       <td>37</td>       <td>37</td>       <td>36</td>       <td>9</td>       <td>9</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Turkey</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Thailand</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>of which</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>EU28</td>       <td>615</td>       <td>621</td>       <td>618</td>       <td>154</td>       <td>154</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Extra-EU28</td>       <td>160</td>       <td>163</td>       <td>161</td>       <td>37</td>       <td>40</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Asia</td>       <td>97</td>       <td>97</td>       <td>101</td>       <td>25</td>       <td>29</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Africa</td>       <td>26</td>       <td>27</td>       <td>28</td>       <td>7</td>       <td>7</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>America</td>       <td>10</td>       <td>10</td>       <td>12</td>       <td>3</td>       <td>3</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total</td>       <td>777</td>       <td>784</td>       <td>779</td>       <td>191</td>       <td>194</td>    </tr> </table> <blockquote><i>Source: CSO* Data not yet published</i></blockquote></p></reply>

These vehicles were delivered in 2001 and 2002. Subsequent contracts in 2002 and 2005 saw a further 25 and 15 vehicles respectively delivered, bringing the fleet to its current strength of 80 vehicles. The MOWAG Armoured People Carrier has been the cornerstone of Irish Defence Forces deployments overseas offering essential force protection to Defence Forces personnel. All of the 40 initial vehicles delivered in 2001 and 2002 are still in active service. </p>  <p>  In 2016 a contract was signed with General Dynamics European Land Systems &ndash; Mowag for a multi-year mid-life maintenance and upgrade programme of the MOWAG APC fleet at a cost of &euro;55m plus VAT. The terms of this contract allows for changes to the scope of work and configuration of certain variants of vehicles to be agreed between the parties during the lifetime of the contract.  The first 29 refurbished vehicles have been delivered in 2018 and 2019 and a further 9 are scheduled for delivery early in 2020.

Future equipment priorities for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service are considered in the context of the White Paper on Defence as part of the capability development and equipment priorities planning process.  The principal aim over the period of the White Paper will be to replace and upgrade, as required, existing capabilities in order to retain a flexible response for a wide range of operational requirements, including response to security risks and other emergencies, both at home and overseas.</p>  <p>  The mid-life upgrade programme for the Army&rsquo;s fleet of eighty MOWAG Armoured Personnel Carriers will extend the utility of the fleet and provide greater levels of protection, mobility and firepower. 29 vehicles have already been upgraded and delivered to the Defence Forces during 2018 and 2019. The remaining vehicles due for upgrade will be delivered between 2020 and 2022. A significant investment of &euro;68m incl VAT has been made on this programme. The terms of this contract, signed in 2016 allows for changes to the scope of work and configuration of certain variants of vehicles to be agreed between the parties during the lifetime of the contract. </p>  <p>  Additionally, twenty-four 4 x 4 Armoured Utility Vehicles were acquired in 2017, and in 2018 delivery was taken of ten new armoured logistic vehicles. These measures with a combined cost of &euro;13.5m inclusive of VAT will provide essential force protection overseas. A capability requirement for additional Armoured Utility Vehicles has been identified and a procurement process is expected to commence in 2020 for these vehicles. </p>  <p>  The Government is currently investing in updating the Air Corps fleet of aircraft with the replacement of the existing five Cessna aircraft with three larger and more capable fixed wing utility Pilatus PC 12 aircraft which are being equipped for ISTAR (Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance). It is expected that the three aircraft will be delivered during 2020 at a cost of &euro;43m inclusive of VAT.  Planning is also underway to replace the CASA Maritime Patrol aircraft and a tender competition recently been completed in my Department and a preferred bidder has been identified. </p>  <p>  The on-going Naval Service ship replacement programme is evidence of the Government's commitment to investment in the Naval Service. The most significant investment of recent years by the Defence Organisation has been on the procurement of the new Off-Shore Patrol Vessels for the Naval Service. This programme has seen the delivery of three new Naval Service vessels since 2014. The L&Eacute; Samuel Beckett was commissioned in May 2014, L&Eacute; James Joyce was commissioned in September 2015 and L&Eacute; William Butler Yeats was commissioned into service in October 2016.</p>  <p>  In June 2016, a contract for an additional sister ship was agreed, bringing investment in the new ships programme to some &euro;270 million inclusive of VAT since 2010. This fourth ship, named L&Eacute; George Bernard Shaw was commissioned into service in May 2019. </p>  <p>  The P50 class vessels, 20 and 18 years old this year, now fall into the category of ship requiring a mid-life refurbishment / extension programme.  Due to their age profile, much of the auxiliary equipment onboard is coming to the end of its useful life or is becoming obsolete and requires to be replaced in a structured manner.   </p>  <p>  The Mid-Life Extension Programme of L&Eacute; R&oacute;is&iacute;n commenced in March 2019, with an initial dry-docking phase to be followed by an extended period of equipment upgrade and refit works. Works are progressing as planned. L&Eacute; Niamh&rsquo;s extension programme is due to commence in 2020.  Over the course of their extension programmes, L&Eacute; R&oacute;is&iacute;n and L&Eacute; Niamh will be out of operation for a period of some twelve months each. Contracts to the value of the &euro;7.6m inclusive VAT have been awarded for the main works associated with the upgrade to L&Eacute; R&oacute;is&iacute;n. </p>  <p>  In addition, planning is ongoing for the replacement of the current Naval Service flagship L&Eacute; Eithne with a multi role vessel. </p>  <p>  With regard to Defence Forces communications systems, there is continued investment in the development of suitable network enabled communications in order to meet the challenges of an increasingly complex operational environment.</p>  <p>  The examples given, whilst not exhaustive, demonstrate my commitment to update and upgrade the Defence Forces equipment and capability, within the financial envelope available. In accordance with the National Development Plan, the capital allocation for Defence was been increased to &euro;113 million for 2020, an increase of &euro;7 million from 2019. The National Development Plan provides for a total of &euro;541 million for Defence over the period 2018-2022. This level of capital funding will allow the Defence Organisation to undertake a programme of sustained equipment replacement and infrastructural development across the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service as identified and prioritised in the Defence White Paper and builds on the significant investment programme over recent years. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Defence Forces have the necessary modern and effective range of equipment available to them, including vehicles and communication systems, which is in line with best international standards in order to fulfil all roles assigned to them by Government.</p></reply>

The Commission proposal was the starting point for discussions that have been ongoing in the Council and European Parliament since then. The European Parliament is required to give its consent to the overall final MFF agreement. </p>  <p>  I am aware that the European Parliament has published a number of Resolutions on the MFF proposals since early 2018, most recently its Resolution of 10 October, which reiterated its position that the next MFF should be 1.3% of EU 27 GNI.</p>  <p>  At the October European Council, Heads of State and Government (HoSG) exchanged views on the MFF based on a Finnish Presidency discussion paper which proposed an MFF in the range of 1.03% - 1.08% of EU 27 GNI (including the European Development Fund). HoSG called on the Presidency to submit a Negotiating Box with figures ahead of the European Council on December 2019. </p>  <p>  In the course of the discussions to date, the Government has said that Ireland is open to contributing more to the EU budget, provided that European Added Value is ensured and that our core interests - particularly CAP - are met. We will continue to seek to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s priorities are protected. The final overall level we can support will depend on the proposed balance between the main policy areas. </p>  <p>  Ireland is likely to see significant growth in our contributions as part to the next MFF, largely as a result of our continued economic growth. The exact level of contributions will depend on the final MFF negotiations, in particular the overall level of expenditure and the Own Resources to be applied. </p></reply>

The aims of the Eastern Partnership are to promote peace and stability in the region and to enhance economic and political integration between the participating countries and the EU. </p>  <p>  Ireland welcome&rsquo;s the policy of the Government of Georgia towards peaceful conflict resolution based on the fundamental principles of international law and support Georgia&rsquo;s peace initiative &lsquo;A Step to a Better Future&rsquo; aimed at improving the humanitarian and socio-economic conditions of people residing in the Georgian regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. </p>  <p>  However, Ireland remains concerned that 10 years after the Russia-Georgia war, the occupation of these regions still continues and that the security, human rights and humanitarian situation on the ground is deteriorating.  Ireland regrets reports of recent escalations along the Administrative Boundary Line between Tbilisi-administered Georgia and South Ossetia, including the temporary detainment of EU Monitoring Mission staff by a South Ossetian patrol. Additionally, continuing reports of &lsquo;border creep&rsquo;, the installation of barbed wire fences, and arbitrary detainment of Georgian citizens is of deep concern to Ireland.</p>  <p>  The Geneva International Discussions aimed at settling the conflicts have made little progress to date however we remain fully supportive of this format and encourage the participants to engage in good faith in order to find  solutions for the safety and humanitarian needs of the population affected by the conflict.</p>  <p>  Finally, Ireland shares the concerns of our EU Partners over the new security and humanitarian concerns which have emerged in the regions affected by the conflict. Of particular concern is the decision in Sokhumi of 4 April 2019 that provides for the punishment by death, under certain circumstances, of the so-called export/import and/or transit of drugs and we reiterate our opposition to the use of the death penalty in all circumstances.</p></reply>

This is a once-off measure that will apply in 2020 only, in respect of service carried out in 2019. It is based on the design of the existing Fisher Tax Credit (s472BA of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997) and will provide an income tax credit of &euro;1,270 to permanent members of the Irish Naval Service who spent at least 80 days at sea on a naval vessel in 2019. </p>  <p>  As I outlined in my recent Finance Bill 2019 Report Stage speech, the intention is that this tax credit will act as a temporary device as we prepare for other measures in the context of future discussion on public pay. The Naval Service has particular challenges with regard to recruitment and retention, a fact that was acknowledged by Deputy McGrath during the Report Stage debates. As such, I believe it is appropriate that this measure is introduced at this time and with the particular restrictions that I have specified.</p></reply>

It is essential to review all tax reliefs, credits and incentives in order to ensure that they are properly targeted and, if necessary, re-focused in order that they can achieve their intended socio-economic objectives. A feature of the OPFTC was that it could be claimed by multiple individuals in respect of a single child, resulting in a considerable annual cost of over &euro;141 million by 2013, attributable to over 104,000 claimants. This was unsustainable and the OPFTC was therefore replaced by the SPCCC from 1 January 2014. Since then, only one credit is available in respect of any qualifying child, and an individual who is a primary claimant in respect of more than one qualifying child can only receive one credit.  Agreement as to who will be the primary carer of a child is a matter for the parents or guardians, and is defined for the purpose of the credit as being the person who the qualifying child is resident with for the greater part of the year.  Where the custody of a child is shared equally between two individuals, the legislation provides that the primary claimant shall be the person in receipt of the child benefit payment from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection. However this is a secondary provision, and the main criteria for allocation of the credit is the residence provision.  If a child is resident with one parent for the greater part of the year (i.e. for a period greater than 6 months), that person should qualify as the primary carer of the child and therefore be entitled to claim the credit in their own right as primary claimant. If the primary claimant does not wish to claim the credit they may surrender their entitlement to a secondary claimant.</p><p>In 2017, the most recent year for which data are available, the cost of the SPCCC was almost &euro;94 million, attributable to over 67,000 claimants. These figures, and costs for each year going back to 2004, are published in the Cost of Tax Expenditures document on Revenue&rsquo;s website at the link: <i></i>Issues concerning this credit are outlined in detail in the review of the SPCCC conducted by my Department in 2015 contained in the Report on Tax Expenditures, available online at the link:<i></i></p><p>I am satisfied that the SPCCC in its current form is targeting limited State resources to where they are most needed. However, I am conscious of the significant contribution made by taxpayers generally to the rebalancing of the public finances, and of the challenges that individuals continue to face notwithstanding the improving economic conditions.  </p><p>It is the Government&rsquo;s position that earners start to pay the marginal rate of tax at too low an income level and it is committed to reducing excessive tax rates for low and middle income earners while also keeping the tax base broad. As a result of changes in recent Budgets, USC rates have been reduced to 0.5%, 2% and 4.5%.  The income level at which taxpayers begin to pay the higher rate of tax has also been increased by &euro;2,500 and there have been increases in both the Home Carer Tax Credit and the Earned Income Tax Credit.</p></reply>

Shortly after the introduction of VAT, Revenue allowed the zero rate to be applied to certain food supplement products (vitamins, minerals and fish oils). This concessionary approach expanded as the market developed over the years and resulted in the zero rating by Revenue of further similar products, including products other than vitamins, minerals and fish oils.</p>  <p>  Revenue has acknowledged that the scope of its concessionary approach broadened progressively over time to the point that it had become increasingly difficult to maintain an effective distinction between food supplement products that could benefit from the zero rate and those that were standard rated. Revenue acknowledges that this concessionary approach was unsatisfactory and led to diverging and inconsistent practices, and there were continuous efforts by elements in the industry to expand its scope.</p>  <p>  Following complaints from the Irish Health Trade Association (IHTA), Revenue conducted a comprehensive review of the VAT treatment of food supplement products, including getting an expert report on the definition of food for the purposes of the VAT Consolidation Act. The expert prepared a detailed, scientific report that concluded that food supplement products are not conventional food. Based on the expert report and its own legal analysis, Revenue concluded that the status quo was no longer sustainable. Following the review, Revenue engaged with my Department concerning policy options that might be considered in the context of Finance Bill 2018. The relevant legislation was not changed in Finance Bill 2018 and therefore Revenue issued new guidance in December 2018 which removed the concessionary zero rating of various food supplement products with effect from 1 March 2019.</p>  <p>  Following representation from Deputies and from the industry, I wrote to Revenue outlining my plans to examine the policy and legislative options for the taxation of food supplement products in the context of Finance Bill 2019. Revenue responded by delaying the withdrawal of its concessionary zero rating of the food supplement products concerned. This allowed time for my Department to carry out a public consultation on the taxation of food supplement products. </p>  <p>  The public consultation ran from 18 April to 24 May 2019 and sought input from a wide range of interested parties, including from health and nutrition experts and the Minister for Health. In total, 121 submissions were received. This included submissions from individuals, businesses, lobby groups and a political party. The results of the consultation were included in the 2019 Tax Strategy Group paper on VAT. The options set out in the TSG paper are the only options available; either the standard rate is maintained, or the reduced rate is introduced.</p>  <p>  I am making provision in Finance Bill 2019 to apply the 13.5% rate of VAT to all food supplement products, which will take effect from 1 January 2020. Foods for specific groups such as infant follow-on formulae and infant foods, foods for special medical purposes and specially formulated foods (e.g. total diet replacement for weight control) will remain zero rated.

The review also included an examination of the outstanding recommendations of the 2015 Thornhill review of the Local Property Tax. It included a consultation process to enable all interested parties and individuals to submit their views on the future of the LPT. </p><p>The Review Group found significant but geographically uneven increases in residential property price levels which made it difficult to identify a scenario that would deliver on the condition I set that there should be relative stability for all taxpayers in their LPT liabilities and that any increases should be modest, affordable and fair.</p><p>Having considered the findings of the review report, I decided to defer the valuation date from 1st November 2019 to 1st November 2020, and this was effected by ministerial order (S.I. No. 166/2019 - Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (Section 13(3)) Order 2019). This gave sufficient time for the Budgetary Oversight Committee to consider the review report in the context of the Committee&rsquo;s recommendations in its report on LPT of 21 March 2018.  Importantly, as a result of my decision, the LPT bills of those liable for the tax will not be increasing in 2020.  </p><p>I met with the Committee in June to discuss the review of the Local Property Tax. The Committee also had a separate meeting with officials of my Department. I received the Committee's scrutiny report on the LPT review in September. In order to bring this matter forward we will need to introduce amending legislation and the Committee&rsquo;s report will provide a valuable input to that work. I will revert to Government with proposals for changes to the Local Property Tax in a timely way. Any such change would need to be legislated for early in 2020 so that the Revenue Commissioners can be in a position to have the necessary administrative and technical arrangements in place in time in respect of the 2021 LPT year.</p></reply>

There may be a number of factors related to this, including undoubtedly smaller operators not seeking to continue to do business because of requirements to seek a new authorisation as a result of the decision of the UK to exit the EU.  However, it is also possible that the difficult financial position that a number of non-life insurers have found themselves in because of the problems being experienced from the unstable claims environment may also be a factor.  </p><p>Regardless of what these figures suggest, I believe that if we are to attract new non-life insurers to operate into the Irish market, we must continue to implement the recommendations of the Cost of Insurance Working Group (CIWG).  In particular, I believe it is important to emphasise that the single most essential challenge that must be overcome if there is to be a sustainable increase in the availability and affordability of insurance is to bring the levels of personal injury damages awarded in this country more in line with those awarded in other jurisdictions.

In this regard, the work of the Cost of Insurance Working Group (CIWG), particularly its Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance Report highlights these difficulties. Therefore, there is a clear understanding of the impact of this problem on businesses across the country.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, neither I, nor the Central Bank, have any influence over the pricing of insurance products.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance, which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules, which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products. A further constraint is the fact that, for constitutional reasons, the Government cannot direct the courts as to the award levels that should be applied.</p>  <p>  The Deputy should note however that through the work of the CIWG, there is a recognition that the single most essential challenge, which must be addressed if we are to overcome the current cost and availability problems, is to provide for a sustainable reduction in insurance costs.  As you are aware, the Government with the support of all parties in the Oireachtas prioritised the passing of the Judicial Council Act 2019.  This Act provides for the establishment of a Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee upon the formal establishment of the Judicial Council.  This Committee is tasked with introducing new guidelines to replace the Book of Quantum. </p>  <p>  A key step to moving this matter forward is for the Chief Justice to make the necessary appointments to the Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee.  I therefore welcome last week&rsquo;s announcement by Chief Justice Clarke that he has designated the seven judges that will sit on this Committee.  I understand that the designate committee will commence its activities on an informal basis shortly.  This is an important development as it demonstrates that the Judiciary are giving this matter the priority I believe it deserves.

These Regulations transpose Article 30 of the Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive and make legislative provision for the obligation that was first established in 2016, that corporate entities must obtain and hold information on their beneficial ownership &ndash; that is, the people who ultimately own or control the company.</p>  <p>  The Regulations also provide for the establishment of a central register of beneficial ownership information. This central register is operated under the aegis of the Companies Registration Office and began accepting filings on 29 July 2019.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the Regulations is to prevent the use of corporate entities as vehicles for money laundering or terrorist financing and to provide competent authorities with access to information on the true ownership and control of corporate entities. Therefore, the obligation to file information with the central register applies to all companies formed under the Companies Act and societies registered under the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts, with the exception of companies listed on regulated markets that are subject to disclosure requirements consistent with European Union law or subject to equivalent international standards which ensure adequate transparency of ownership information.</p>  <p>  The remit of the Department of Finance was to develop the necessary Regulations in cooperation with the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation as part of the measures taken to transpose the Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive. While the relevant legislation was signed by myself as Minister for Finance, the register is maintained by a &ldquo;Registrar of Beneficial Ownership of Companies and Industrial and Provident Societies&rdquo;, as provided for under Regulation 18 of SI 110/2019, who has been appointed by the Minister for  Business, Enterprise and Innovation.</p></reply>

These changes were brought in to help tackle fraud and exaggerated claims, but also to align the law with GDPR requirements (e.g. deletion of CCTV footage).  These amendments were made as part of the Central Bank (National Claims Information Database) Act 2018. </p>  <p>  I believe that one of the key achievements of the CIWG is increased coordination and cooperation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the insurance industry with regard to tackling fraud.  This includes the reporting of suspected fraud, as well as to how that fraud is recorded on the PULSE system.  There has also been recent successes under Operation Coatee, which targets insurance-related criminality.  In addition, Garda Commissioner Drew Harris has decided for operational reasons to investigate insurance fraud at the divisional level, rather than establish a centralised insurance investigation unit, which may not be in a position to investigate incidents at a local level to the same extent.  This approach is aligned with a general divisional-focused Garda model and the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (GNECB) will guide divisions and provide training in the investigation of insurance fraud. </p>  <p>  I might conclude by saying that since the CIWG started its  work in 2016, I believe that many insurers are taking a much more robust approach to challenging questionable claims.  This can be seen in recent media reports detailing personal injuries cases which have been dismissed by the courts after extensive investigations surrounding the circumstances of the claim.  This trend is encouraging in terms of tackling the problem of dubious or exaggerated claims from the personal injuries litigation system.</p></reply>

A progressive system ensures that the burden of taxation falls most heavily on those with a higher ability to pay.

These estimates have been generated by reference to 2020 incomes as calculated on the basis of actual data for the year 2017, the latest year for which returns are available, adjusted as necessary for income, self-employment and employment trends in the interim. The estimates are provisional and may be revised. They assume no behavioural change by taxpayers.</p><p>Prior to the introduction of the USC, the Irish income tax base had narrowed to a point where over 45% of income earners in the State were exempt from income tax and just over 13% were liable to the higher rate of income tax. When initially introduced in 2011, the entry threshold to USC was &euro;4,004, with the result that just over 12% of income earners were exempt from a charge on their income. Notwithstanding the subsequent increase in the entry threshold from &euro;4,004 to &euro;13,000, of the three Irish charges on income (income tax, USC and PRSI), the USC currently has the broadest base. This is because, in general, entry into liability for the USC starts at income of &euro;13,000 per year (compared with &euro;16,500 for income tax and generally &euro;18,304 (&euro;352 per week) for PRSI). The USC base is broad because there are no credits and very few reliefs.</p><p>It is the Government&rsquo;s position that earners start to pay the marginal rate of tax at too low an income level and it is committed to reducing excessive tax rates for low and middle income earners while also keeping the tax base broad. As a result of changes in recent Budgets, USC rates have been reduced to 0.5%, 2% and 4.5%.  The income level at which taxpayers begin to pay the higher rate of tax has also been increased by &euro;2,500 and there have been increases in both the Home Carer Tax Credit and the Earned Income Credit.</p></reply>

In answering the Deputy&rsquo;s current parliamentary question I have used content included in this note where relevant.</p><p>Under CRD IV rules, deferred tax assets (DTAs), which are substantially made up of tax losses in the case of the Irish banks, are being phased out over a 10-year period which commenced in 2014. Accordingly, tax losses still make up a material portion of the transitional CET1 ratios of the Irish banks. It should be noted that transitional CET1 ratio is the ratio which the regulator uses when assessing compliance with the minimum ratio set for the bank.</p><p>In the Technical Note referred to above, it was estimated that the removal of DTAs from the banks&rsquo; balance sheets would have the following impact on the December 2017 CET1 ratios as follows: <table>    <tr>       <th>Transitional CET1</th>       <th>AIB</th>       <th>BOI</th>       <th>PTSB</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Ratio as reported</td>       <td>20.8%</td>       <td>15.8%</td>       <td>17.1%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Pro-forma ratios with DTAs removed</td>       <td>17.1%</td>       <td>14.0%</td>       <td>14.8%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Reduction in CET1 ratios</td>       <td>(3.7%)</td>       <td>(1.8%)</td>       <td>(2.3%)</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>As fully loaded CET1 ratios are calculated with the DTAs deducted in their entirety from regulatory capital, the removal of DTAs would not impact on the reported ratio in the reporting period in which they were removed. However, for subsequent reporting periods, fully loaded ratios would be negatively impacted as they would not have benefitted from the usage of the DTAs in the scenario where the banks continue to be profitable. This also applies beyond the transitional period.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware of the significant increase in regulatory capital which the banks are now required to hold since the financial crisis. It is not possible to estimate the potential reaction of the regulator should the DTAs be removed from the banks&rsquo; balance sheets in terms of addressing the impact of this on capital. However, as the impact would be significant, with the reported ratios at AIB, BOI and PTSB being reduced by an estimated 18%, 11% and 13% respectively, it would no doubt be a matter carefully considered. </p><p>In addition, it is difficult to estimate the precise impact of the removal of DTAs on the pricing of retail customer products. However, one of the key criteria used by banks when pricing products is the return on equity (ROE). ROE is an important metric for a number of stakeholders, including the regulator, when assessing the financial performance of a bank. Accordingly, should a bank be required to hold more capital arising from the removal of DTAs, this could put upward pressure on interest rates say, for example, in relation to loan products to ensure the bank is achieving an adequate ROE.</p><p>As a separate matter, it is important to highlight that the DTAs are a valuable asset on a bank&rsquo;s balance sheet and the State benefits from this as it sells down its stakes in the banks. The original Technical Note estimated that the value of the DTAs, under current rules and on a discounted cash flow basis, was c. &euro;2.283bn with the State&rsquo;s share being c. &euro;1.227bn (54%) reflecting its relative shareholdings in the banks.</p><p>During Committee Stage of Finance Bill 2019, I committed to providing the FinPERT Committee with updated figures on the Technical Note provided in August 2018. The updated figures will reflect the position at end-2018. Work is ongoing in this regard, and this information will be provided to the Committee members in due course. </p><p>For the convenience of the Deputy the following link is to the original Technical Note referred to above: </p><p><i></i></p></reply>

Tacsa&iacute; na h&Eacute;ireann, in respect of its the Report on Motor Insurance.  It also met with the Hotels Federation of Ireland, IBEC, ISME, the Vintners&rsquo; Federation of Ireland (VFI), the Licensed Vintners Association (LVA), the Retail Grocery Dairy &amp;amp; Allied Trades Association (RGDATA), Chambers Ireland, the Law Society of Ireland, and the Health and Safety Authority, Insurance Ireland, a number of CEOs from insurers operating in the employer liability and public liability insurance market and representatives from Lloyd&rsquo;s of London as part of its consultations on the Report on Employer and Public Liability Insurance.  In addition, submissions received from all interested parties were considered as part of the process.</p><p>Following publication of the two reports, in January 2017 and January 2018 respectively, the CIWG has continued to meet so as to ensure that progress is being made related to the implementation of the various recommendations by the relevant Departments and bodies, which make up its membership.  The purpose of its meetings has therefore been to discuss issues related to implementation, including the Personal Injuries Commission&rsquo;s recommendations, as well as to take stock of developments in the wider insurance reform agenda.  The Minister of State, in his capacity as Chair of the CIWG, has also had an &ldquo;open door&rdquo; policy in relation to meeting various stakeholders such as businesses and community groups that have been experiencing difficulties in affording or being able to avail of insurance.  </p><p>I think it is also important to mention that the relevant Ministers of State, as Chairs of the CIWG, have appeared before the FIN-PER Joint Oireachtas Committee to update them on the CIWG&rsquo;s work, including progress it has made in relation to implementing its recommendations.  This has happened on seven occasions since 2016 and I believe that this demonstrates the importance the CIWG places on ensuring the Oireachtas has been informed and involved throughout its work.</p><p>Finally, I would like to commend the CIWG and its members regarding the work they have been taking to ensure that necessary reforms to the insurance sector are being carried out in line with the mandate that was given to it at the outset.  I believe that these reforms are having a significant impact with regard to private motor insurance (CSO figures from October 2019 show that the price of motor insurance is now 27.1% lower than the July 2016 peak).  However, I believe more needs to be done and in this context, I believe that the CIWG is as relevant now as it ever has been and it is likely to continue to meet into 2020 as implementation of remaining recommendations continues.  The issue of the cost and availability of insurance, in particular to certain businesses and community groups, remains a priority for the Government.</p></reply>

Moreover, in accordance with the EU Regulatory requirement, stakeholders at local, regional and national level will continue to have a key role in the planning, monitoring and delivery of these programmes.</p>  <p>  There are currently no plans or proposals before the Minister in relation to the current or future administration of European Regional Development Funds in Ireland.</p>  <p>  However, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has commissioned a Review of Structures for the management of European Regional Development (ERDF) for the next programming round, for the period 2021 to 2027. The amount of funding available through the ERDF is expected to be reduced; the level of co-financing required to draw down these funds is expected to increase; and activities eligible for support has been concentrated further. Against this background, it is timely and appropriate to undertake a review of the structures in place for the administration of these funds, which have remained essentially unchanged since 2000. It is important to emphasise that, at this early stage in the exploratory and deliberative process, there are no recommendations on structures before the Minister.</p></reply>

The Scheme includes low riverside defences, an early flood warning system and new dam management procedures for the ESB dams at Carrigadrohid and Inniscarra. The Scheme will facilitate public realm improvements on a scale not previously seen in Cork city centre, making it more attractive to live in, work in, visit and invest in.</p><p>The current estimated whole life cost of the Scheme is circa &euro;140m (2016 figures), although this is likely to be revised upwards when the various design changes introduced after the Public Exhibition feedback, and inflation, are taken into account. The final approved cost of the Scheme will only be known following the works tender process.</p><p>The option of a tidal barrier has been examined in detail by the project design team and is deemed not to be currently necessary or viable, and not likely to become viable for 50 years or more. If and when a tidal barrier becomes necessary and viable, the optimum location is likely to be at Great Island, where it would protect the wider urban areas in the harbour and have the least impact on the environment and navigation. The cost of a barrier at this location has an estimated whole life cost of in excess of &euro;1.5bn. </p><p>Lower estimates put forward by other groups have been reviewed by the OPW and its consultants who can confirm that they are based on a concept barrier design which is neither technically viable nor likely to be environmentally acceptable and do not include for all whole life costs. In any event, a tidal barrier will not provide improved protection against fluvial flooding in Cork and would not have prevented the extreme flooding which occurred in Cork in 2009.</p><p>Further information on the option of a tidal barrier for Cork is available in the &lsquo;Supplementary Report: Option of Tidal Barrier&rsquo; which can be downloaded from the project website:</p><p><i></i></p></reply>

In the 2018/19 school year there were over 117,500 children, including over 13,000 children with special educational needs, transported in over 5,000 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country covering over 100 million kilometres annually at a cost of over &euro;200m in 2018. </p>  <p>  The purpose of the School Transport Scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school.  Children are generally eligible for school transport if they satisfy the distance criteria and are attending their nearest school as determined by the Department/Bus &Eacute;ireann, having regard to ethos and language. </p>  <p>  The annual charge for school transport services is &euro;100 per annum for primary children and &euro;350 for post primary children with a maximum family charge of &euro;220 for primary children only or &euro;650 overall.</p>  <p>  Children who are eligible for school transport and who hold valid medical cards (GMS Scheme) are exempt from paying the annual charge.  In addition, there is no charge for children who are eligible for school transport under the terms of my Department's School Transport Scheme for children with Special Educational Needs.</p>  <p>  In general the unit cost for transporting mainstream children is some &euro;1,000 per annum, while the unit cost for transporting children with special educational needs is &euro;7,000 or &euro;9,000 when the provision of escorts are included.</p>  <p>  In 2018, receipts from school transport charges amounted to some &euro;15.9m or about 8% of the total cost of the scheme provided by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the Department.</p>  <p>  The school transport scheme is a demand-led service based on the number of eligible children who apply to avail of transport.  It is not possible to estimate the detail requested by the Deputy</p></reply>

With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level.  </p>  <p>  In April 2018, the Government announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the four years from 2019 to 2022, including a new 800 pupil post-primary school to serve the Kilcoole and Greystones school planning areas as a regional solution which is due to be established in 2020.</p>  <p>  A patronage process is run after it has been decided, based on demographic analysis, that a new school is required.  This patronage process is open to all patron bodies and prospective patrons. Parental preferences for each patron, from parents of children who reside in the school planning areas concerned, together with the extent of diversity currently available in these areas, are key to decisions in relation to the outcome of this process. </p>  <p>  The Online Patronage Process System (OPPS) has been developed by my Department to provide objective information to parents and guardians which will allow them to make an informed choice in expressing a preference for their preferred model of patronage for their child&rsquo;s education.   </p>  <p>  The patronage process for new schools is overseen by an external independent advisory group, the New Schools Establishment Group (NSEG). Following their consideration of my Department&rsquo;s assessment reports, the NSEG will submit a report with recommendations to me for consideration and final decision. </p>  <p>  The Online Patronage Process System (OPPS) closed for parental preferences on the 4th October 2019 for the six post-primary schools to be established in 2020, including the school referred to by the Deputies. It is anticipated that the successful patrons will be announced in the coming weeks. The assessment reports and the NSEG recommendations will be made available on my Department's website. It will subsequently be a matter for the successful patron to make arrangements for enrolment for the following September. </p></reply>

Through the Schools Broadband Access Programme the Department provides for the supply of internet connectivity for all recognised primary and post primary schools, and some 98% of schools are included in this scheme. All post-primary schools and some special schools are now included in the 100Mbps programme. The primary broadband scheme operates off existing infrastructure on the whole and the providers on the Primary Broadband Framework access this infrastructure to deliver the service to the schools. The Department does not put in place such infrastructure. </p>  <p>  The school referred to by the Deputy was recently included in mini competition run by my Department and the service to that school has been awarded to a provider of high speed broadband. The provider is currently working to provide this service to the school. The school will be contacted by the provider in due course to arrange the installation.</p>  <p>  Under the current primary schools programme the Department continually reviews the availability of services and upgrades schools where the opportunity arises, in line with contractual and budgetary requirements. A recent drawdown from the Framework of Providers of Broadband Services saw some 1,600 primary schools awarded download speeds of 30Mbps or greater (the baseline download speed required under the National Broadband Plan). Those schools have now been upgraded to that connectivity. This represents more than one third of all primary schools. This is a significant improvement over recent years, given that less than 100 primary schools were on those speeds in 2012.

The FSD was extended in 2018 to cover students studying on a part-time basis;</p>  <p>  - Students are also able to apply for financial support through the Student Assistance Fund (SAF); and</p>  <p>  - The Programme for Access to Higher Education (PATH) has allocated a number of 1916 Bursaries to NAP target groups such as students with disabilities and students who wish to undertake their studies on a part-time basis.</p>  <p>  All eligible undergraduate students are covered by the Free Fees Initiative whereby the State provides funding towards tuition fees for students undertaking approved courses in eligible higher education institutions. Under the rules of the initiative, tuition fees are not paid in respect of students undertaking a repeat year of study at the same level. However, this condition may be waived where there is evidence of exceptional circumstances, such as cases of certified serious illness. Decisions in such cases are made at a local level in each higher education institution in line with the criteria of the scheme. A similar approach applies in respect of grant support. In this regard, SUSI cannot extend funding past the normal duration of the course, unless the applicant is repeating the same year of a course under exceptional circumstances.</p></reply>

With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level. </p><p>Major new residential developments in a school planning area have the potential to alter demand in that area. In that regard, as part of the demographic exercises, my Department engages with each of the local authorities to obtain the up-to-date information on significant new residential development in each area.  This is necessary to ensure that schools infrastructure planning is keeping pace with demographic changes as there is a constantly evolving picture with planned new residential development</p><p>Where demographic data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, depending on the circumstances, be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:</p><p>- Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,</p><p>- Extending the capacity of a school or schools,</p><p>- Provision of a new school or schools.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, in April 2018 the Government announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the next four years (2019 to 2022). This announcement followed nationwide demographic exercises carried out by my Department into the future need for primary and post-primary schools across the country.</p><p>While the announcement did not include a new school for the Malahide_Nevinstown and Portmarnock school planning areas, the following new schools were established in recent years to serve the Malahide_Nevinstown and Portmarnock school planning areas:</p><p>- A new 1,000 pupil post-primary school (Malahide Portmarnock Educate Together Secondary School) established in 2018; and</p><p>- A new primary school (Malahide Portmarnock Educate Together NS) established in 2014.</p><p>The requirement for new schools will be kept under on-going review and in particular will have regard for the increased rollout of housing provision as outlined in Project Ireland 2040. </p><p>Under Project Ireland 2040, my Department continues to make progress to increase the infrastructural capacity in the schools sector, in order to meet demographic and other demands.</p><p>The Capital Programme details the school projects that are being progressed under Project Ireland 2040. I wish to advise the Deputy that the current status of large-scale projects being delivered under Project Ireland 2040 may be viewed on my Department's website, and this information is updated regularly. In addition, a list of large-scale projects completed from 2010 to date may also be viewed on the website. </p><p>The Capital Programme also provides for devolved funding for additional classrooms, if required, for schools where an immediate enrolment need has been identified or where an additional teacher has been appointed. Details of schools listed on this programme can be found on my Department's website and this information is also updated regularly.</p></reply>

This initiative, by my colleague the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, puts Ireland among the group known as &ldquo;50 for Freedom&rdquo;, which stems from an ILO initiative to encourage member countries to ratify the Protocol by the end of 2019.</p><p>Domestically, the Second National Action Plan to Prevent and Combat Human Trafficking was launched in 2016. The Action Plan involves a victim-centred and human rights based approach with the ultimate aims of preventing human trafficking, ensuring an effective criminal justice response and delivery of supports to victims.</p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has also committed significant resources to the investigation and prosecution of human trafficking in Ireland. A specialised Garda Unit, the Human Trafficking Investigation and Co-ordination Unit (HTICU), has been has been in place since 2009 to conduct investigations into human trafficking and provide advice, support and where necessary, operational assistance to investigations at district level. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is also active in relation to trafficking gangs through work targeting organised crime - targeting their finances, their use of the internet and by working closely with other jurisdictions.</p><p>A number of State bodies also provide care and practical support to victims including the HSE, the Legal Aid Board, the Immigration Service and Tusla. My Department also provides funding to several NGOs for their work to provide support to victims of trafficking.</p><p>The Deputy may also wish to note that action is also being taken to raise public awareness in Ireland and help members of the public identify the signs of human trafficking. More information is available on the &ldquo;Blue Blindfold&rdquo; website: , maintained by my Department.</p><p>With regard to the report referred to by the Deputy, I note that the US State Department downgraded Ireland from a Tier 1 to a Tier 2 ranking in its 2018 annual Trafficking in Persons (TIPs) Report.  Ireland is among 14 EU and EEA States which the US State Department considers as Tier 2. The other relevant states are: Bulgaria, Croatia, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Malta, Poland, Romania and Slovakia.</p><p>My Department continues to work closely with all relevant agencies in terms of following up on the recommendations outlined in the report.</p><p>As set out in the Annual Report of the Anti-Human Trafficking Unit of the Department of Justice and Equality, there were 64 recorded incidents of human trafficking in Ireland in 2018. Of this total, 13 are recorded as having occurred outside the jurisdiction and 51 are recorded as having occurred within the jurisdiction. I am informed An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to vigorously pursue a number of cases where action was initiated prior to 2018, and have commenced action in a number of new cases. </p></reply>

The capital budget for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has also been significantly increased - a total of &euro;92 million was provided this year, representing a 50% increase on capital investment in 2018. Capital investment will increase further to &euro;116.5 million in 2020.</p><p>With regard to the Garda fleet specifically, an overall investment of &euro;46 million has been agreed by Government between 2016 and 2021. &euro;10 million was made available for the Garda fleet this year. A further &euro;9 million will be provided next  year as part of an overall investment of &euro;46 million in the Garda fleet between 2016 and 2021.</p><p>It is important to be clear that under Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 as amended, the Garda Commissioner has responsibility for management of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. He is responsible for the allocation and efficient use of Garda resources, in light of operational demands.  As Minister I have no direct role in these matters. I understand however, that Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review, to ensure their optimum use.</p><p>The Deputy will appreciate that the size of the Garda fleet can fluctuate somewhat, as vehicles are added to and removed from the fleet.  However in general, I am informed by the Garda authorities that the size of the Garda fleet has increased in recent years and is currently stable: including Divisions and National Units, the fleet on 1 January 2019 included 2,765 vehicles.  As of 15 November 2019 the total strength of the fleet including Divisions and National Units is 2,775.</p><p>I am assured that the allocation of Garda vehicles is made on the basis of identified operational demands and that the allocation of Garda vehicles is monitored and reviewed on a continual basis. These are operational questions for policing experts and my Department is not involved. </p><p>It may also be noted that Garda management has informed me that this year's funding is being used for the purchase and fit-out of over 300 vehicles, of which 289 vehicles have been allocated to date. I understand that orders have been placed for a further 59 vehicles which will be allocated before the end of this year or in Quarter 1 2020.  As a result, the Garda authorities consider that it is likely that the Garda fleet will be slightly larger at the end of the year compared to the total number of vehicles at the beginning of the year.</p><p>Further, my intention is that a further &euro;1 million funding for the fleet will be included in additional funding to be provided to the Garda Vote before the end of the year.</p><p>It is also important to point out that the age profile of the Garda fleet has significantly improved in recent years due to ongoing Government investment - 22% of the Garda fleet is now less than two years old, as compared to only 5% in 2012.  And over 80% of the Garda fleet is now less than 6 years old.</p><p>Finally, the Deputy may be interested to know that the Garda authorities are developing a Fleet Strategy, which I expect to set out detail on matters including, for example, the optimum size and composition of the fleet.  I expect that the new Governance function in my Department will engage with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in that regard, as the process continues.</p><p>The number of Garda vehicles attached in each Garda Division in each of the years 2010 to 2018 and to date in 2019 is provided at the link, as requested by the Deputy.

Capital investment will increase further to &euro;116.5 million in 2020.</p>  <p>  The Garda Commissioner has responsibility for management of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and is primarily responsible for the effective and efficient use of these resources.  I understand however, that Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review, to ensure their optimum use. </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that the Garda District and Station Rationalisation Programme developed and implemented in 2012 and 2013 resulted in the closure of a number of Garda stations nationwide.   I am informed by the Garda authorities that one station in the Fingal area was closed under that programme, namely Rush Garda station.  I am further informed that the Garda authorities further advise that they are not aware of any other disused Garda stations in the Fingal area. </p>  <p>  Finally and as the Deputy may recall, the Programme for Government contained a commitment to reopen six Garda Stations on a pilot basis to determine possible positive impacts that such openings will have on criminal activity, with special emphasis on burglaries, theft and public order. </p>  <p>  Rush Garda station is included in the project along with Ballinspittle, Co. Cork, Bawnboy, Co. Cavan, Donard, Co. Wicklow, Leighlinbridge, Co. Carlow and Stepaside in Co. Dublin. </p>  <p>  The Office of Public Works has responsibility for the provision and maintenance of Garda accommodation. As a result, all works to the Garda estate involve close cooperation between the OPW and the Garda authorities. I am informed by the OPW and Garda authorities that the refurbishment of Rush Garda Station will be completed and the station handed over to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by the end of 2019.</p></reply>

For example, my Department offers accommodation and related services. The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection pays a weekly personal allowance to each resident and covers any exceptional needs.  The Department of Education and Skills provides school places for children resident in the centres.  Children also have access to the free pre-school scheme, the Early Childhood Care and Education programme.  In addition, children attending school may access the State school transport system.  The HSE provides mainstreamed health services to residents.  </p>  <p>  Regulation 5 of the 2018 Regulations provides that where a resident has been working for a reasonable period of time (12 weeks), the Daily Expenses Allowance (paid weekly by DEASP) can be reduced or withdrawn and the applicant may be required to make a contribution towards the cost of their accommodation and related services. Schedule 2 of the Regulations sets out the charging schedule, which is calculated on the basis of the applicant's earnings and is capped at the cost to the State of providing the accommodation.  My Department in consultation with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection is currently examining how best to introduce an appropriate charging mechanism with the least administrative burden.</p></reply>

Management of the courts is the responsibility of the Courts Service which is independent in exercising its functions under the Courts Service Act 1998. </p>  <p>  The ADM (Capacity) Act 2015 provides a modern statutory framework to support decision-making by adults with capacity difficulties. It provides for the establishment of new administrative processes and support measures, including the setting up of the Decision Support Service (DSS) within the Mental Health Commission (a body under the Department of Health).</p>  <p>  Some provisions of the Act were commenced in October 2016 and progress has been made on preparing for the establishment of the DSS and commencement of the remainder of the Act. </p>  <p>  A high-level Steering Group comprising senior officials from the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Health, the Mental Health Commission and the Courts Service, together with the Director of the DSS, is overseeing the establishment and commissioning of the DSS and this work is ongoing.</p>  <p>  The Director of the DSS is working towards being operational and ready for the commencement of the main provisions of the Act. This lead-in timeframe ensures that the necessary staff resources, processes, IT system, expert panels, codes of practice and regulations will be in place so that the  Service will have the capacity to be up and running effectively. There are many complex strands to this work, including involvement of multiple organisations, and the situation is being kept under ongoing review as the preparatory work on implementation moves forward.</p>  <p>  The commencement of Part 8 of the Act, which provides for a legislative framework for advance healthcare directives, is a matter for the Minister for Health.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to work closely with the Mental Health Commission and the Director of the DSS to deliver the full implementation of the Act. </p>  <p>  When the Act is fully commenced, the law will be changed from the current &ldquo;all or nothing&rdquo; status approach to a flexible functional definition, whereby capacity is assessed only in relation to the matter in question and only at the time in question.</p>  <p>  The Act provides for a functional definition of capacity which takes an issue-specific and time specific approach, focusing on the particular time when a decision has to be made and on the particular matter to which the decision relates.  This allows for situations where the loss of capacity is temporary or partial and where there may be fluctuations in capacity.</p>  <p>  Under the Act, the current adult wards of court system will be phased out and replaced by a less intrusive system which offers a continuum of options to support people in maximising their decision-making capability.  Part 6 of the 2015 Act provides for the phased transition from adult wardship to this new support framework. It provides for the review by the wardship court of the capacity of all current adult wards within three years of the commencement of that Part of the Act.  Following a review of his or her capacity, the ward will be discharged from wardship and depending on the outcome of the review the wardship court may: </p>  <p> - Declare that the ward does not lack capacity and immediately discharge the ward from wardship and order that the property of the former ward be returned to him/her.</p>  <p> - Declare that the ward lacks capacity unless a suitable person is made available as co-decision maker to make one or more decisions. Once a co-decision making agreement is registered the court shall immediately discharge the ward from wardship and order that the property of the former ward be returned to him/her. If there is no suitable person to act as co-decision maker or the co-decision making agreement has not been properly registered within a period set down by the court, then the court shall make orders as appropriate under Part 5 to appoint a decision making representative and order that the property of the former ward be returned to him/her once a decision making representative has been appointed. </p>  <p> - Declare that the ward lacks capacity even if a suitable person is made available as co-decision maker to make one or more decisions.  The court shall make orders as appropriate under Part 5 to appoint a decision making representative and order that the property of the former ward be returned to him/her once a decision making representative has been appointed.</p></reply>

This legal framework requires that any proposed community CCTV scheme must:</p><p>- be  approved by the local Joint Policing Committee,</p><p>- have the prior support of the relevant local authority, which must also act as data controller, and</p><p>- have the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner.</p><p>This is the legal basis for all community CCTV schemes, regardless of how they are funded and these key legal requirements have not changed since 2006.  The option to establish a Community CCTV scheme is available to groups that meet these legal requirements, anywhere in the country.</p><p>Since 2017, my Department has administered a grant aid scheme supporting groups wishing to establish a community-based CCTV system in their area.  To date, 22 applications have been approved under the scheme, involving approved grants totalling more than &euro;560,000. The location of the CCTV schemes which have been approved for funding are as follows: </p><p>- Carrick on Shannon, Co. Leitrim</p><p>- Cranmore, Co. Sligo</p><p>- Arklow, Co. Wicklow</p><p>- Courttown/Riverchapel, Gorey and Wexford Town, Co. Wexford </p><p>- Abbeyfeale, Adare, Askeaton, Caherconlish, Cappamore, Castleconnell, Croom, Foynes, Kilmallock, Newcastlewest, Pallasgreen, Patrickswell, Murroe and Rathkeale, Co Limerick</p><p>- Monaghan Town, Co. Monaghan</p><p>- St Mullins, Co. Carlow</p><p>I can confirm that an application for CCTV grant aid from the area referred to by the Deputy was received in my Department earlier this year.  This application was refused in July 2019 as it did not meet the 3 statutory requirements for Community CCTV. The applicant was notified by letter of this decision - but I would emphasise that it remains open to them to reapply for funding once they apply for and secure the approvals required by the law for all Community CCTV systems.</p><p>Eligible groups, including community groups and local authorities nationwide, can apply for grant-aid of up to 60% of the total capital cost of a proposed CCTV system, up to a maximum total of &euro;40,000.</p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, earlier this year I expanded the grant aid scheme to cover not only new CCTV systems but also to allow funding applications for extension or upgrade of existing Community CCTV systems which are incomplete or obsolete.  Applicants can now also seek a once-off grant of up to &euro;5,000 for minor maintenance costs.</p><p>The scheme remains open for applications from interested groups in 2019 and all fully completed applications received before the end of 2019 will be considered.  Further, I am also pleased to announce that I have recently approved extension of the CCTV grant aid scheme for a further year in 2020.</p><p>I must emphasise that grant funding can be considered only for CCTV systems which meet the legal requirements for CCTV, in other words CCTV systems which have been approved by the relevant Joint Policing Committee, the relevant Local Authority (also acting as Data Controller) and which have received the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner.</p><p>If the Deputy is aware of groups wishing to avail of the scheme, further details are available to download from my Department's website - www.justice.ie and support and guidance is available to help interested groups through a dedicated email address fundsadmin-comm-based-cctv@justice.ie.</p></reply>

I have the utmost sympathy for the Ludlow family who feel the pain of his loss every day. It is a matter of profound regret that, in common with so many troubles related deaths, nobody has yet been brought to justice for his murder. </p>  <p>  The Barron Commission of Inquiry carried out an extensive investigation into the circumstances of the Seamus Ludlow case and Judge Barron submitted his report to the then Taoiseach in 2004.  The report was referred to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, a sub-committee of which held a series of public hearings and issued a report in March 2006.  </p>  <p>  That there were serious failures in the original Garda investigation is beyond question.  In the course of the sub-committee hearings, the then former Garda Commissioner Pat Byrne, the then Commissioner, Noel Conroy,  and the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Michael McDowell, apologised to the Ludlow family for the way in which they had been treated by the Garda&iacute; at the time.</p>  <p>  There have been four separate Garda investigations: the initial (and flawed investigation); in1979/1980; in 1996/1999; and following the Barron Report. The Garda investigation is not closed and if further evidence comes to light that might permit a prosecution then expect that the matter would be re-considered by the DPP.  </p>  <p>  A second Coroner&rsquo;s inquest into Mr Ludlow&rsquo;s death was directed by the Attorney General, in September 2005 which returned a verdict of unlawful killing.  </p>  <p>  Neither I, nor my predecessors have been of the view that this case meets the statutory threshold for the establishment of a Commission of Investigation. There are litigation proceedings underway in relation to this which are due to be heard before the Court of Appeal at a future date.  As this matter is before the Courts, I cannot add anything further.</p>  <p>  I again extend my deepest sympathies to the Ludlow family.</p></reply>

The Standards were prepared by a Standards Advisory Group, established in 2017 and comprising officials from my Department, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the HSE National Office for Social Inclusion as well as representatives from UNHCR Ireland, AkiDwA, the Children's Rights Alliance, the Core Group of Asylum Seekers and Refugees, the Jesuit Refugee Service and SPIRASI.  The Standards will come into force in January 2021.</p>  <p>  The Standards address a range of themes including accommodation; food and catering; individual, community and family life; health and wellbeing; governance; and meeting the special reception needs of applicants.  They build upon the important work of the 2015 McMahon Report and implement the requirements of the EU recast Reception Conditions Directive, which we voluntarily opted into last year.</p>  <p>  I am committed to developing a robust independent inspection process to monitor and ensure compliance with the Standards following their implementation.  It is important to note, however, that at present all accommodation centres are subject to regular unannounced inspections by both staff of my Department and an independent inspector. </p>  <p>  The on-going public procurement process for accommodation was also designed to ensure that all centres will adhere to the National Standards.</p>  <p>  Work on the development of a suitable inspection process for the Standards is underway.

The offence of theft provided for by this legislation would, based on the broad nature of the offence, include the theft of &lsquo;scrap metal&rsquo; and &lsquo;catalytic converters.&rsquo;  Maximum sentences of 10 years are provided for in the case of offences of theft and handling of stolen property; while maximum sentences of 5 years are provided for the offence of possession of stolen property. </p>  <p>  Irish law relating to the sale and purchase of scrap metal is a matter for the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and arises under the Waste Management Act 1996. The Waste Management (Facility Permit and Registration) (Amendment) Regulations 2014 (S.I. No 320 of 2014) apply to the sale and purchase of scrap metals and were designed to improve the traceability of such scrap metal sales.  The regulations impose an obligation on businesses to apply due diligence measures to ensure the traceability of any waste purchased. </p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy may wish to note that officials from my Department are also involved in the Metal Theft Forum, which is a collaborative working group between State stakeholders and industry representatives to improve information sharing around the issue of metal theft.  The Forum is chaired by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and includes representatives from my Department, the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, the EPA, An Post and a wide range of non-State representatives including telecoms companies, the ESB and others.</p></reply>

This scheme applied to non-EEA persons who commenced their presence in the State lawfully under a student permission with a limited right to work and who maintained that lawful presence for at least two years.</p><p>The scheme permits qualifying persons to remain in the State with a right to work for 2 years on Stamp 4S conditions. After two years, if a person had adhered to the terms of their permission they may be granted a permission to reside in the State for a further year under Stamp 4 conditions. </p><p>My Department stopped accepting applications under this scheme on 20 January, 2019.</p><p>One of the criteria of this scheme was that the applicant must be able to support themselves without recourse to State funds and be tax compliant. </p><p>The access provided to holders of a Stamp 4 to the Irish employment market and the tangible benefits enjoyed by holders of this status are an acknowledgement by the State that, over time, those who migrate to Ireland contribute increasingly to society and the economy and have earned this status and the stability it brings. </p><p>A person with a stamp 4 permission can:</p><p>- Take up employment and are not required to hold an Employment Permit.</p><p>- They can work in a profession, subject to conditions of the relevant professional or other bodies.</p><p>- They can establish and operate a business.</p><p>- They may access state funds and services as determined by Government departments or agencies.</p><p>If a person wishes to stay in Ireland past the expiry date of their immigration permission, they must apply to renew their permission and registration before they expire.</p><p>A decision to grant childcare support to a Stamp 4 holder is made by the Government Departments and agencies who administer the childcare support scheme and will be determined by those agencies.  If a person with a Stamp 4S permission is approved for the subsidy, this will not negatively impact the requirement under the Student Scheme that the applicant must be able to support themselves without recourse to State funds. </p></reply>

While we cannot yet know the form that Brexit will take, these measures aim to assist businesses in identifying key risk areas and practical preparatory actions regardless of the circumstances of the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU. </p>  <p>  InterTradeIreland&rsquo;s [ITI] Brexit Advisory Service provides a focal point for SMEs working to navigate any changes in cross-border trading relationships arising as a result of Brexit. As part of this service, ITI has organised a series of awareness-raising events focused on improving knowledge of customs processes and procedures and identifying actions that can be taken in areas such as logistics and supply chain management. As of 8 November, more than 5,300 SMEs have directly engaged with the Brexit Advisory Service this year.</p>  <p>  ITI&rsquo;s Brexit Planning Voucher aims to enable businesses to seek professional advice on how best to plan and prepare for Brexit. This support helps businesses obtain advice on specific areas such as tariffs, currency management, and regulatory and customs issues. Vouchers are worth up to &euro;2,250 (inclusive of VAT) each. To 8 November, 2,054 applications have been submitted for the Voucher, 1,747 of which have been approved. </p>  <p>  ITI has also launched a further financial support in the form of the Brexit Implementation Voucher, which offers financial support up to &pound;5,000/&euro;5,625 (inclusive of VAT), with InterTradeIreland paying 50% towards implementing critical changes in relation to Brexit matters. As of 8 November, there have been 54 applications, of which 40 have been approved.</p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) are the first-stop-shop for anyone seeking guidance and support on starting or growing their business, including businesses in the border counties. The LEOs have organised various events to enable companies to learn about the potential impacts and opportunities of Brexit. As of 8 November, 1,198 LEO clients have received one-to-one mentoring solely focused on Brexit. Since February, the LEOs have also been offering customs training workshops to support businesses trading with third countries in advance of the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU. To 8 November this year, there have been 1,456 training participants.</p>  <p>  The LEOs also engage in a number of other schemes to help businesses prepare for Brexit. The Technical Assistance Grant for Micro Export is offered as an incentive for LEO clients to explore and develop new market opportunities. As of 8th November, 800 LEO clients have been approved assistance under the grant.</p>  <p>  In addition, the six LEOs in the Border region are working together with their Northern Ireland counterparts under the EU Co-Innovate Programme.  The aim of Co-Innovate is to give SMEs from the manufacturing and tradable services sectors in the eligible regions the tools and tailored support to help them to innovate, differentiate and compete successfully.  This month, it was announced that over &euro;1 million of R&amp;D funding has been awarded through Co-Innovate. </p>  <p>  The Brexit Loan Scheme was launched in March 2018. It provides relatively short-term working capital, up to three years, to eligible businesses with up to 499 employees to help them innovate, change or adapt to mitigate their Brexit challenges. The scheme is open to eligible businesses from all regions of the country, including those in the Border counties. Dublin aside, the most recent quarterly report shows that the border region is the most active region in terms of eligibility applications for the scheme. As of 18 November, there have been 892 eligibility applications received, of which 804 have been approved and 212 loans progressed to sanction at bank level to a value of &euro;46.6 million. It should be noted that 159 of total applications received relate to repeat/duplicate applications, as eligibility expires after six months. </p>  <p>  The Future Growth Loan Scheme opened for eligibility applications in April 2019. This scheme provides a longer-term facility, 8-10 years, of up to &euro;300m to support strategic capital investment for a post-Brexit environment at competitive rates. This scheme has been jointly funded by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to make available loans of &euro;100,000 (&euro;50,000 for primary agriculture) to &euro;3 million, with loans of under &euro;500,000 being provided on an unsecured basis.  The scheme is open to eligible Irish businesses, including those in the primary agriculture and seafood sectors, to support strategic, long-term investment in a post-Brexit environment.  As of 18 November, there have been 2,031 eligibility applications received, of which 1,925 have been approved and 595 loans progressed to sanction at bank level to a value of &euro;122.5 million. </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland [EI] has established a Prepare for Brexit online portal and communications campaign, as well as an online &ldquo;Brexit SME Scorecard&rdquo; to help Irish businesses self-asses their exposure to Brexit and a &ldquo;Be Prepared Grant&rdquo; to support SME clients in planning to mitigate risks arising from Brexit.  It has also launched a new Eurozone Strategy to help SMEs broaden their export footprint beyond the UK.</p>  <p>  EI&rsquo;s Customs Insights course helps businesses looking at customs for the first time to understand the key customs concepts, documentation and processes. The course advises on the key actions companies can take to prepare for Brexit and highlights the various supports available. To 8 November, there have been 1,916 Customs Insights Course participants. </p>  <p>  In quarter one of this year, I launched nine new Regional Enterprise Plans to 2020, including Plans for the North East and the North West. These Plans build on the very strong progress made on employment creation under the Regional Action Plan for Jobs 2015-2017. The new Plans will ensure that regional stakeholders continue to work together to help achieve the Government&rsquo;s 2020 targets for regional employment taking account of new and emerging opportunities and challenges, including Brexit. </p>  <p>  In order to help build enterprise capability, under the Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF) Enterprise Ireland invested in seven successful projects in the Border region with a total funding allocation of more than &euro;10.6 million. This funding will help drive enterprise development and job creation in the Border Region. Enterprise Ireland will continue to engage with its clients to ensure they have the supports required to prepare for any kind of Brexit scenario. </p>  <p>  In June, at a visit to the recently opened Cavan Digital Hub, I announced that a further &euro;45 million is to be made available under a new third call of the REDF. The closing date for submission of eligible projects under this latest call was 25 September 2019. On 20 October 2019 an Evaluation Panel comprised of representatives from EI, my Department and other public and private bodies began to evaluate eligible projects. The evaluation of eligible projects has now been completed and the selected projects by the Evaluation panel will be recommended for funding to EI&rsquo;s Investment Committee/Board for approval and I intend making an announcement on the successful projects before the end of the year.</p>  <p>  My Department and I have also participated in the whole-of-Government 'Getting Ireland Brexit Ready' public information campaign. This campaign features workshop events throughout the country, aimed primarily at the businesses and people most impacted by Brexit, including events in Monaghan and Donegal. In addition to these events, Enterprise Ireland has rolled out a series of Brexit Advisory Clinics to help businesses across the country, including events in Dundalk, Letterkenny and Cootehill. In the last few weeks, the LEOs have held Brexit related events in Monaghan, Drogheda and Cavan.</p>  <p>  While I have seen a very positive uptake of the supports available, I am conscious that the lasting uncertainty around the Brexit process may be leading businesses to defer their Brexit preparations.  The UK&rsquo;s exit from the EU will bring change for Irish businesses and I want businesses, particularly those around the Border counties to know my Department and agencies are here to help.</p></reply>

A quota of 250 employment permits was introduced initially for meat processing operatives. This quota has been increased twice with provision made for a further 500 and 750 bringing the total to 1,500 permits.  As part of the ongoing review of the occupation lists, my Department is currently considering a further business case submitted by meat industry employer representatives for an additional quota for meat processing operatives and is engaging with officials in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in this regard.  I expect recommendations arising from the ongoing review to be presented for my consideration in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  On 9th September 2019, my officials contacted the named company to inform them that the quota of 1,500 permits for Meat Processing Operatives had been exhausted.  My officials explained that the company could withdraw some or all of its six employment permit applications, and apply for a 90% refund of the fees, or the relevant applications could remain in their current position in the processing queue pending the completion of the consideration of the request for a further extension to the quota.  My officials inform me that the named company have, to date, sought a refund for one application.</p></reply>

No. 110 of 2019) were made by the Minister for Finance and provide that the Central Register of Beneficial Ownership of Companies and Industrial and Provident Societies (RBO) is the central repository of such information held by companies and industrial and provident societies. While the CRO homepage provides a link to the RBO, the RBO is a separate website and a statutorily separate Register from the Companies Registration Office. Obligations under S.I. No. 110 of 2019 on anti-money laundering and terrorist financing are legally separate to company law requirements under the Companies Act 2014.</p>  <p>  The numbers filing increased steadily throughout last week as the deadline of November 22 approached. As of November 22 2019 126,060 companies had successfully registered beneficial ownership details. This represents 55% of the total. There are many thousands of submissions currently at processing stage and the RBO expect the numbers registered to increase further. Further breakdown by size of company is not available at this time. The focus of the RBO staff is on processing the many thousands of submissions already received.</p>  <p>  While I am sympathetic to the challenges being faced by small and micro enterprises in meeting their filing obligations, companies and industrial and provident societies have been legally obligated to be in possession of much of the information required for central filing since November 2016. The RBO was very concerned to ensure that relevant entities were aware of their obligations to file with the Register and undertook an extensive Public Awareness Campaign, in the period leading up to and around the opening of the Register on 29 July and in the period leading up to and around the deadline date.</p>  <p>  Due to technical difficulties with the RBO portal on the evening of November 22, I understand some companies and industrial and provident societies may have been unable to file Beneficial Ownership details for a period of time. Any submissions filed with the RBO by midnight on November 25 will be treated by the RBO as having been received on time.</p>  <p>  With regard to companies and industrial and provident societies that have missed the deadline for filing, I expect a practical and proportionate approach will be taken by the Registrar on a case by case basis to deal with those particular circumstances where companies and industrial and provident societies who have attempted to file in time with the RBO may have missed the deadline.</p></reply>

Ireland is now an international outlier on private medicine in public hospitals. Other countries with strong public hospital systems do not tolerate the inefficiencies and perverse incentives that arise with having a stream of private patients. The Sl&aacute;intecare and the de Buitl&eacute;ir reports together present an opportunity to design a public hospital service with a coherent vision, with the patient and the public good at its heart. I have committed to reverting to Government with proposals in this regard over the coming months. </p>  <p>  As part of its consideration on the recommendations contained within the report, my officials consulted with the a number of bodies including the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) on the implications of the recommendations. The NTPF was asked to consider the impact on capacity and waiting lists. The NTPF has advised my Department waiting times will decrease because of a reordering of queuing and a deprioritisation of private patients and will result in a modest increase in capacity. This work is ongoing and I will revert to Government in due course.</p></reply>

The Act specifies criteria for decisions on the reimbursement of medicines.</p>  <p>  HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) for the HSE and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions </p>  <p>  As a country, we invest heavily in medicines, to the tune of almost &euro;2 billion annually. As of October 2019, there have been 29 new medicines and 5 new indications for existing medicines approved for reimbursement in the public healthcare system. The approvals to date represent an additional investment by the HSE over five years of approximately &euro;220m in providing access to new and innovative treatment for Irish patients. It is expected that over 3,000 patients will benefit from access to these new medicines over the next 5 years </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the significant progress on drug costs achieved from price reductions under the pricing framework agreed with industry and commercial negotiations conducted by the HSE, the Health Service is still facing very significant challenges in relation to the affordability of medicines.  The industry continues to develop very expensive products, particularly in the high-tech medicines area and the costs involved are a challenge for health systems even in countries with much greater resources than Ireland. </p>  <p>  The Government wants new and innovative medicines to be available to our citizens as quickly as possible, but this can only be achieved if medicines are priced by the pharmaceutical industry in a viable and sustainable manner. "League tables" comparing speed of reimbursement in Ireland with that of other countries are often misleading since several countries have quite different and often less rigorous assessment arrangements than Ireland. Furthermore, many of the newer products being licenced are falling well short of cost-effectiveness thresholds, with limited clinical benefits. </p>  <p>  The current process for assessing applications works very well where the new medicines have strong evidence of clinical effectiveness and are priced in a cost-effective manner. Delays in reimbursement decisions for new products do occur in cases where the evidence of clinical effectiveness is weak, and where prices are set well outside of cost effectiveness parameters. </p>  <p>  The HSE strives to reach a decision in as timely a manner as possible. However, because these commitments are often multi-million euro investments on an on-going basis, it must ensure that the best price is achieved. This can lead to a protracted negotiation and deliberation process. </p>  <p>  My Department and the HSE are working on making greater efficiencies in medicines usage through a range of initiatives both domestically and internationally to ensure the greatest possible access to new treatments for patients in Ireland.  </p>  <p>  The HSE&rsquo;s Medicines Management Programme (MMP), incorporating the Preferred Drugs initiative, is overseeing the implementation of a number of actions to bring about greater value for the taxpayer through cost-effective provision of medicines. These measures include the designation of preferred products with a focus on high-cost prescribing areas, in particular optimising the use of biosimilars.  </p>  <p>I and officials have also been engaging over the past number of years with a number of voluntary EU forums.  In June 2018, I signed the Beneluxa Initiative on Pharmaceutical Policy. This Agreement is in line with my objective to work with other European countries to identify workable solutions, in an increasingly challenging environment, to secure timely access for patients to new medicines in an affordable and sustainable way.  In June 2019, Ireland became a Founding Member of the International Horizon Scanning Initiative which is being established as part of the work programme of Beneluxa.</p></reply>

During the 16 days when the Air Corps will not accept taskings, the Irish Coast Guard will provide reserve cover for the National Ambulance Service. The Irish Community Rapid Response (ICRR), has agreed to provide additional cover using a second helicopter which will be based in Roscommon Hospital and will be tasked in the usual way, to 112/999 calls by the National Emergency Operations Centre, within the National Ambulance Service.  This is in line with current National Ambulance Service priorities whereby the most appropriate and safe services are provided for patients and staff. </p>  <p>  This does not affect the current Munster Hems service in the South of Ireland.</p></reply>

As you are aware, the Programme for a Partnership Government and the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation strategy contain commitments to expanding the role of community pharmacy in managing patient health in the community.</p>  <p>  Work has been done in recent years on wider healthcare roles for pharmacies, including the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland&rsquo;s Future Pharmacy report, on the expansion of professional pharmacy practice. It is clear from this and other work that there is potential to increase the range of both private and publicly funded health services delivered through community pharmacy. Important new services, such as influenza vaccination and emergency contraception, have already been introduced.</p>  <p>  To be funded by the taxpayer, new public health services in community pharmacy, as elsewhere, should improve health outcomes and provide value for money and benefits for patients. Any new or transferred services should be based on sound evidence, with matching improvements in governance and administration.</p>  <p>  I have discussed these and other issues with the Irish Pharmacy Union (IPU). My officials expect to engage in discussions with the IPU on future contractual and service arrangements early in the New Year.</p></reply>

In this regard, the Government is committed to improving waiting times for hospital appointments and procedures. </p>  <p>  The National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) supply additionality to HSE core activity in order to reduce waiting times experienced by patients for a hospital appointment, operation or procedure.  In this context, the NTPF has advised my Department that they have approved a number of Outpatient proposals for ENT in 2019, which to date has provided over 4,400 patient appointments.</p>  <p>  The latest National Treatment Purchase Fund figures show that there are 65,696 patients on the ENT Outpatient waiting list. Of these, 53% (34,507) are waiting 12 months or less. Overall, the ENT Outpatient waiting list has decreased by 0.6% (-383) when compared to the same period last year.</p>  <p>  The figures for October also show that there are 4,401 patients on the ENT IPDC waiting list. Of these, 63% (2,759) are waiting 6 months or less, 75% (3,286) are waiting 9 months or less and 82% (3,608) are waiting 12 months or less. Overall, the ENT IPDC waiting list has decreased by 18% (-971) when compared to the same period last year.</p>  <p>  More broadly, Budget 2020 announced that the Government has further increased investment in tackling waiting lists, with funding to the NTPF increasing from &euro;75 million in 2019 to &euro;100 million in 2020. </p>  <p>  My Department is working with the HSE and National Treatment Purchase Fund to develop the Scheduled Care Access Plan 2020. The National Service Plan 2020 will set out HSE planned activity level for the year ahead, while the NTPF will work with the hospital system to provide additionality to improve access to inpatient/daycase treatment and with a particular focus on hospital outpatient services. </p>  <p>  In this regard, I would encourage all hospital groups and individual hospitals to engage with the NTPF to identify waiting list proposals for the remainder of this year and for 2020.</p></reply>

Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy, a standardised approach to managing scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures, since January 2014, has been developed to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care.

There are many reasons for this, such as a patient undertaking the application process for NHSS, awaiting assessment for a home support package, homelessness, ward of court application, and the availability of resources.</p>  <p>  When possible, the HSE will use transitional care to accommodate the patient during the period between discharge and the finalisation of new care arrangements, but there can often be a delay, especially in cases where the patient and family are coming to terms with the new circumstances.</p>  <p>  This year, services are being stretched more than ever, with demand consistently outstripping supply, and we have seen an increase the number of delayed transfers of care. While the HSE maximises the use of resources, prioritising those requiring discharge from acute hospitals, there is a growing demand for egress support. In response, and in the context of planning and preparing for the challenges of the winter period, the Department and the HSE have been considering a comprehensive approach to the current the high-level of DTOCs. However, recognising the urgency of the situation, approval was provided to the HSE to begin actions immediately to the value of &euro;5m in 2019.  As part of these measures the HSE released a significant number of funding approvals within NHSS in September, and provided additional home care and transitional care beds.</p>  <p>  In addition, the HSE Winter Plan was launched on Thursday 14 November. The aim of the Winter Plan is to ensure that service providers are prepared for the additional external pressures associated with the winter period, including the prolonged holiday period, severe winter weather, seasonal influenza, and the spread of norovirus and other healthcare associated infections.</p>  <p>  Nine Winter Action Teams, each aligned to a Community Healthcare Organisation and associated acute hospitals and Hospital Groups, have prepared Integrated Winter Plans. These plans focus on demand management and reduction, staffing availability, timely access to the most appropriate care pathway for patients, and appropriate timely discharge from acute hospitals.</p>  <p>   The HSE Winter Plan is supported by an additional &euro;26m in winter funding nationally. This winter funding will support access to the Fair Deal scheme, and will provide additional home support and transitional care to facilitate timely hospital discharge and reduce congestion in EDs over the winter period.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Deputy's specific question, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly with the requested information.</p></reply>

As research has developed, there has been more awareness of this condition over the past number of years. When diagnosed and treated early, it has a very good recovery rate. It has been diagnosed in only a small number of people worldwide.</p>  <p>  Most cases of BIA-ALCL have been diagnosed in patients who have implants, or have had tissues expanders manufactured by Allergan, with a specific textured surface called "BIOCELL." These implants and expanders have not been used in Ireland since December 2018.</p>  <p>  The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) has been updating my Department on this matter as further research is published and as evidence continues to emerge at both a European and international level and while the risk of developing BIA-ALCL has been shown to be more common than first thought, it still remains an uncommon condition.</p>  <p>  The Health Service Executive (HSE) has decided to communicate publicly on this matter in order to increase general awareness of BIA ALCL, ensure that women in Ireland are fully informed on this issue and are given the appropriate advice and follow up as required. My Department has been and continues to work alongside the HSE in this regard.</p>  <p>  The 8 national cancer centres are writing directly to their patients who have had breast implants or tissue expanders, including those who received Allergan &lsquo;BIOCELL&rsquo; and patients without Allergan &lsquo;BIOCELL&rsquo; breast implants/ tissue expanders.  The distribution of these letters is an ongoing process, with letters being sent directly by the 8 cancer centres to their patients. As this is an ongoing communication process, I cannot inform the Deputy how many letters have issued. </p>  <p>  The letters and the information on the HSE&rsquo;s website, advise all individuals to be breast aware; describing the signs and symptoms to be aware of and monitor for and what to do if a patient finds a swelling or lump.  It is important to note that for patients without any symptoms- no further action is needed apart from routine follow-up.</p>  <p>  Dedicated telephone lines have been set up in the 8 cancer centres to provide assurance, encourage women to be breast aware and when necessary allocate clinical review. The phone numbers are included in each patient&rsquo;s letter.</p>  <p>   In December 2018, a French medical device notified body (which evaluates the conformity of products) decided not to renew the CE Certificates for certain breast implants and tissue expanders produced by the company Allergan. The HPRA made information available publicly when the product was withdrawn. The HSE advisory was issued in response to increased understanding of the incidence of the condition based on International studies over the past year. </p>  <p>  This current HSE patient advisory programme was initiated in August last based on the evolving understanding of the disease internationally.  Since then, my Department has been engaging with a range of national stakeholders, including the HSE, HPRA, clinical representatives and the private hospital sector on this issue to ensure that appropriate action is been taken.</p></reply>

The management of the cases transferred to the SCA when the National Treasury Management Agency (Delegation of Claims Management Functions) (Amendment) Order 2013 (S.I. no 405 of 2013) was signed by the then Taoiseach on 15 October 2013.  As such, I have no role as regards the conduct of this or future cases, including as regards the issue of costs relating to them. </p>  <p>  However, the Programme for a Partnership Government includes a commitment to &ldquo;&hellip;put in place a scheme, on a no-fault basis, that will respond to the needs of people with disability arising from vaccination" and work is progressing with regard to this.  An Expert Group was established in June of last year, under Judge Meenan, to examine the law in relation to personal injuries arising in the healthcare context and to explore alternative mechanisms by which claims could be managed more effectively, particularly from the perspective of the person on whose behalf a claim has been made.  A report from this Expert Group is expected in the coming weeks, the recommendations of which will be taken into account as part of the development of a vaccine compensation scheme.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Health Research Board recently completed a review of the evidence on vaccine injury redress programmes in other jurisdictions and this report will also be considered in conjunction with the Expert Group&rsquo;s recommendations. </p>  <p>  Since 2012, the Department of Health, the HSE, and the Department of Education and Skills, and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection have worked together to provide a wide range of services and supports for those affected.  The HSE&rsquo;s Advocacy Unit acts as liaison with service and support providers and other Government Departments to facilitate access to required services.  It is in regular contact with individuals affected and regularly meets with representatives of SOUND (Sufferers of Unique Narcolepsy Disorder).  Regional co-ordinators have been appointed to assist individuals by providing advice, information and access to local services. </p>  <p>  The ex-gratia health supports include: </p>  <p>  - clinical care pathways to ensure access to diagnosis and treatment;</p>  <p>  - multi-disciplinary assessments led by clinical experts;</p>  <p>  - counselling services for both the individuals and their families;</p>  <p>  - discretionary medical cards for those who have been diagnosed;</p>  <p>  - physiotherapy and occupational therapy assessments. </p>  <p>  Treatment and individual medical needs are reassessed over time to take account of changes in their condition or circumstances.  </p>  <p>  In conjunction with the above, a centre of excellence for narcolepsy (based in St. James&rsquo;s Hospital) for treating all forms of narcolepsy in adults as well as children transitioning from paediatric services has been in development.  A sleep lab is now complete at this facility, with equipment installed and commissioned.  Additional sleep technicians have also been recruited.  The sleep lab has opened and completed its first sleep studies in July 2019.  Sleep studies are now continuing on a regular basis.  A consultant neurologist with specialist interest in sleep medicine and two consultant respiratory physicians with specialist interest in sleep medicine have been appointed.  They have all commenced their full-time positions and are seeing narcolepsy-related referrals in the clinic.  A dietician has also joined the service as part of its multidisciplinary team.</p></reply>

The primary purpose of the proposals in relation to calorie postings is to ensure that calorie information is available at the point of choice for food sold in restaurants, takeaways and other food service businesses. Its objective is to ensure that consumers will be empowered to make an informed choice about the food they consume and will have the information they need to manage their calorie intake. An industry consultation will be initiated shortly and it is intended that the draft General Scheme will be finalised in early 2020.</p></reply>

This is a hugely important step in developing a health-led approach and in delivering on a key commitment in the national drugs strategy.</p>  <p>  However, we cannot be complacent about the dangers of drugs. Therefore, the Department of Health is providing funding of &euro;100,000 to the HSE in 2020 to develop a national harm reduction campaign to raise awareness of the risks associated with drug use. This will include information about club drugs, festival drug use, newer drugs as well as cannabis. </p>  <p>  I am strongly supportive of measures that will reduce harm for people who take drugs.</p></reply>

Reimbursement is for licenced indications which have been granted market authorisation by the European Medicines Agency or the Health Products Regulatory Authority.</p>  <p>  HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE).</p>  <p>  As a country, we invest heavily in medicines, to the tune of almost &euro;2 billion annually. In 2019 to date, the HSE has approved 36 new drugs and newly licensed indications for existing drugs for reimbursement in the public healthcare system. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the significant progress on drug costs achieved from price reductions under the IPHA Agreement and commercial negotiations conducted by the HSE, the Health Service is still facing very significant challenges in relation to the affordability of medicines.  The industry continues to develop very expensive products, particularly in the high-tech medicines area and the costs involved are a challenge for health systems even in countries with much greater resources than Ireland. The Government wants new and innovative medicines to be available to our citizens as quickly as possible but this can only be achieved if medicines are priced by the pharmaceutical industry in a viable and sustainable manner.  </p>  <p>  My Department and the HSE are working on making greater efficiencies in medicines usage through a range of initiatives both domestically and internationally to ensure the greatest possible access to new treatments for patients in Ireland.   </p>  <p>  The HSE&rsquo;s Medicines Management Programme (MMP), incorporating the Preferred Drugs initiative, is overseeing the implementation of a number of actions to bring about greater value for the taxpayer through cost-effective provision of medicines. Among the initiatives being pursed are improvements in practices for the procurement of drugs in hospitals and the designation of preferred products with a focus on high-cost prescribing areas, in particular optimising the use of biosimilars.  </p>  <p>  Department officials and I have also been engaging over the past number of years, with a number of voluntary EU forums.  In June 2018, I signed the Beneluxa Initiative on Pharmaceutical Policy. This Agreement is in line with my objective to work with other European countries to identify workable solutions, in an increasingly challenging environment, to secure timely access for patients to new medicines in an affordable and sustainable way.  In June 2019, Ireland became a Founding Member of the International Horizon Scanning Initiative which is being established as part of the work programme of Beneluxa.</p></reply>

The aim of the Winter Plan is to ensure that service providers are prepared for the additional external pressures associated with the winter period, including the prolonged holiday period, severe winter weather, seasonal influenza, and the spread of norovirus and other healthcare associated infections. The Plan is supported by an additional &euro;26m in winter funding nationally. This winter funding will support access to the Fair Deal scheme and will provide additional home support and transitional care to facilitate timely hospital discharge and help reduce congestion in EDs over the winter period.</p><p>Nine Winter Action Teams, each aligned to a Community Healthcare Organisation and associated acute hospitals and Hospital Groups, have prepared Integrated Winter Plans. These plans focus on demand management and reduction, staffing availability, timely access to the most appropriate care pathway for patients, and appropriate timely discharge from acute hospitals. Each Action Team has set out a range of initiatives it will undertake within its area to implement the Plan.  </p><p>The funding which has been allocated to the WATs will support initiatives at local level including: </p><p>- Additional medical, nursing, therapies support, pharmacy and lab staff to improve patient experience time, improve senior clinical decision making, reduce length of stay, and facilitate weekend discharges;</p><p>- Additional Aids and Appliances to facilitate timely discharge;</p><p>- Additional home support hours to facilitate early hospital to community transfers;</p><p>- Communications to facilitate hospital avoidance and public health awareness;</p><p>- Implementing Frail Intervention Therapy Teams for admission avoidance and reduced admissions of patients over - 75;</p><p>- Additional Flu testing kits to improve PET.</p><p>In addition to the immediate measures being undertaken in the Winter Plan the Government through the Sl&aacute;intecare Strategy is addressing the issues of access to healthcare. The Sl&aacute;intecare Action Plan for 2019 has a specific workstream on access and waiting lists. The Government is also increasing investment in health infrastructure and capacity in the system in line with Project Ireland 2040. </p><p>I am confident that together with the more immediate measures being undertaken under the Winter Plan and the strategic approach undertaken by the Government under Sl&aacute;intecare that progress will be made in addressing the difficulties in the emergency departments.</p></reply>

In addition, an aggregate report by the Royal College will make recommendations, where appropriate, with the aim of improving care for women.</p>  <p>  I am happy to report that the RCOG review is nearing completion. The overriding focus throughout this process has been to ensure that review results are communicated to women and families in the most appropriate and sensitive way possible. </p>  <p>  On 9 September, the HSE sent a letter to all 1,038 participants in the review to provide them with options about how they may choose to receive their report. The process of communicating individual reports to women or next of kin has been ongoing since the 23 September. This has been a large-scale process and, although it has taken longer than originally planned, is expected to complete in the coming days.   </p>  <p>  A core principle underpinning this process has been to ensure that individual participants would have had an opportunity to receive their results in advance of publication of the Expert Panel&rsquo;s Aggregate Report. In keeping with this principle, the Minister for Health will bring the aggregate report to Government, and publish it, once he has received assurance that all women or next of kin have had the opportunity to receive their individual report.</p>  <p>  While the aggregate report has not yet been received, the Royal College in a letter to the Minister for Health in September advised that, based on the provisional findings of its Review, the performance characteristics of the CervicalCheck Screening Programme that fall within the scope of the Review appear to be broadly in line with experience in the UK.</p>  <p>  It has always been expected that a significant proportion of women in this review will receive results which disagree with their original review result. This is in line with international experience. For example, in one review of the English Cervical Screening Programme, 45% of slide reviews disagreed with the original review result.</p>  <p>  This reflects the reality that no matter how closely a review panel tries to reproduce the original screening conditions, the conditions of a review are different &ndash; the fact that a review includes records of a patient known to have a serious condition, such as cancer, will heighten vigilance and increase reports of abnormality. Finding discrepancies on review does not imply that the same findings should have been made under routine conditions.</p></reply>

In this regard, the Government is committed to improving waiting times for hospital appointments and procedures. </p><p>The latest published National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) figures for October show that there are 3,969 patients on the Cardiology Inpatient and Daycase (IPDC) waiting list. Of these, 75% (2,964) are waiting 6 months or less and 86% (3,429) are waiting 9 months or less. With regard to cardiology long waiters, there are 341 patients waiting over 12 months, which is a 13% decrease when compared to the same period last year. </p><p>The latest NTPF figures show that there 651 patients on the Cardio-Thoracic Surgery IPDC waiting list.

The Health budget increased by &euro;1.2 billion on 2019, a substantial additional level of funding, particularly bearing in mind that Budget 2020 was framed in a no deal Brexit scenario. The amount allocated follows an extensive process of engagement between my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which considered both the funding requirements and the fiscal position. These types of engagements are a normal part of the Budgetary process and happen with Departments across Government. All Departments put forward spending proposals but are required to operate within the amounts proposed by Government and determined by the D&aacute;il. </p>  <p>  The issue of health funding is a major policy challenge for both the Irish and international Governments.  Despite welcome increases annually, the need for effective financial management remains crucial as the health service deals with a larger and older population, with more acute health and social care requirements, increased demand for new and existing drugs and the rising costs of health technology.  The costs associated with these service pressures will increasingly need to be managed not solely through annual increased Exchequer allocations but also through improved efficiencies, productivity and value from within the funding base.</p>  <p>  Under legislation the Health Service Executive is required to set out in the National Service Plan, the type and volume of health and social care services to be provided having regard to the funding available. The Health Service Executive were directed that the 2020 Plan was to be developed and implemented within the statutory limit determined and that expenditure controls and savings measures were fully achievable next year. As part of this process to secure the most effective delivery of services possible within the resources available the Health Service Executive were required to ensure that the greatest value possible was achieved from the entirety of the resources that were allocated.</p></reply>

Since 2017, all forestry licence applications received have been subject to a statutory public notification system and are subject to a statutory appeal system operated by the FAC. </p>  <p>  Most appeals have been in connection with our Appropriate Assessment (AA) procedure.  The Habitat Directive (Article 6.3) requires that where a plan or project is likely to have a significant effect on a Natura site, either individually or in-combination with other plans or projects, it must undergo an appropriate assessment of its implications for that Natura site.  </p>  <p>  Currently, we are amending the AA procedure in order to introduce a robust and workable system which will address the issues now faced.  Introducing this system involves the recruitment of additional ecological expertise and changes in procedures for the forestry inspectorate.  Last week, the Department advertised for ecologists and we also have access to external ecological support, which will be supplemented in due course.  Inspectors have already undergone training and will receive appropriate support in delivering these new procedures; they are not on a work to rule. A categorisation of files affected by these requirements is also underway in order to best assess further action needed and by whom. </p>  <p>  I am fully aware of the concerns of applicants, such as the person named, and other stakeholders in the sector, in relation to the AA process.  My officials are in regular communication with stakeholders and they have been fully apprised of the issues involved and of my Department&rsquo;s efforts to address them.  They have also been advised of steps they can take to ensure that applications received are completed to an acceptable standard and to take account of any issues relating to sensitive habitats.</p></reply>

Previously, my Department had been identifying eligible areas using a range of socio-economic indicators such as family farm income, population density, percentage of working population engaged in agriculture, and stocking density.  </p><p>From 2019, eligible areas must instead be designated using the following list of bio-physical criteria:</p><p>- Low temperature </p><p>- Dryness</p><p>- Excess soil moisture</p><p>- Limited soil drainage</p><p>- Unfavourable texture and stoniness</p><p>- Shallow rooting depth</p><p>- Poor chemical properties</p><p>- Steep slope </p><p>In tandem with the process to designate relevant lands under these biophysical criteria, Member States were also required to undertake a fine tuning process. This process was required to identify areas where significant natural constraints were identified with reference to the above-listed biophysical criteria, but where objective criteria, such as arable land use or stocking density levels, would indicated that these constraints have been overcome.</p><p>Finally, Member States could also identify areas for inclusion as Areas of Specific Constraint where it is necessary for land management to be continued in order to conserve or improve the environment, to maintain the countryside, to preserve the tourist potential of the area, or to protect the coastline.</p><p>This three-phased process was a lengthy project, involving protracted technical engagements with the EU DG for Agriculture and Rural Development and the Joint Research Centre in the EU Commission. The technical process was completed in late 2018 and, at that time, further to a series of consultation meetings with key stakeholders, I published full details in relation to the outcome of the review project, which can be summarised as follows. </p><p>The vast majority of land that was eligible under the existing Scheme remains eligible under the new approach. Some 700 townlands that would have previously been eligible are not eligible under the new designation. Farmers impacted financially by this change will receive a degressive phasing out payment in 2019 and 2020. Over 2,000 townlands will now be eligible under the new approach and will be eligible to receive a payment for the first time in 2019. </p><p>An independently chaired Appeals Committee was appointed to examine any requests received by my Department for a full review on the status of a townland under the 2019 ANC Scheme. This process is currently under way and it is anticipated that the process will be completed in the coming weeks.  An appeal has been submitted to the Committee for the townland in question.  Given the independent nature of the appeals process, it is a matter for the Committee to decide on the most appropriate approach to resolving the appeals received.</p></reply>

To date, my Department has approved over 2,000 applications under the TAMS II Scheme and has already paid approximately &euro;19 million to farmers for this technology.</p>  <p>  As agriculture is responsible for approximately 99% of ammonia emissions, it is vital that the agri-food sector continues to build on the good work achieved to date. The Code will support them in achieving this objective.</p></reply>

The area of land under organic production has expanded dramatically as a direct result of my Department's investment. Latest figures indicate that there are now some 72,000 hectares under organic production, an increase of nearly 50% on the position at the start of the Programme in 2014.</p>  <p>  As a further vote of confidence in the organics sector by this Government, my colleague Minister Doyle established an Organics Strategy Group last year comprising relevant stakeholders and state bodies. Part of the remit of the Strategy Group was to consider the case for a possible re-opening of the Organic Farming Scheme. They recommended that it should be re-opened but on a targeted basis. The sectors targeted were areas for which there is a clear market demand, and which are critical to the further development of the Organic Sector, namely horticulture, cereals and dairy.  This recommendation acknowledged that the budget was very limited given the success of the current scheme and the overall spending within the RDP.</p>  <p>  The terms and conditions of the Scheme state that an applicant must reach a minimum ranking of 25 marks to be deemed eligible for consideration for inclusion in the Scheme.  They further state that the number of applications to be accepted into the Scheme will be determined by funding and that the submission of a valid application does not guarantee entry to the Scheme. </p>  <p>  No changes were made to the minimum ranking of 25 marks - it is the same as in previous OFS under the current RDP. Once applicants reached the minimum ranking of 25 and met the other eligibility criteria, they were then assessed under the Ranking and Selection system in accordance with the criteria agreed by the Organic Sector Strategy Group.</p>  <p>  The person named, although eligible for consideration, did not score high enough to be selected in this tranche.  Their score was below the minimum score that was ultimately accepted into the Scheme. It should also be noted that their major enterprise was not one of the targeted enterprises identified by the Organic Strategy Group.  </p>  <p>  It is important to note that this is a targeted re-opening and that I fully expect that there will be a new Organics scheme under the next CAP. I would encourage all stakeholders to make their views known on the shape of this future scheme as part of the wider CAP consultation process.</p></reply>

In addition, there are 7,313 active greyhound owners. The total number of people deriving economic benefit from the sector is estimated at 12,371.  It is an industry that is ingrained in the social and cultural networks of rural Ireland.</p>  <p>  It is worth noting that the Greyhound Sector has undergone a series of reforms in recent times.  The Greyhound Racing Act 2019 which was signed by the President on 28 May 2019 strengthens the legal basis for the industry, with a view to fortifying the integrity of the greyhound racing sector and improving provision for greyhound traceability. Bord na gCon will continue to invest significant resources into regulation and greyhound welfare and it intends to devote more resources to welfare, re-homing and traceability. </p>  <p>  Any suspension of funds would have immediate consequences for employment in the sector and could have unintended consequences for the welfare of dogs used for racing and coursing.

Suckler farmers also benefit, of course, from the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) and Greening payments under CAP Pillar I.</p><p>In 2019, a further &euro;20 million of exchequer funding was made available through the Beef Environmental Efficiency Programme, to encourage farmers to measure the weaning efficiency of their suckler cows.</p><p>The Beef Exceptional Aid Measure (BEAM) has provided temporary exceptional adjustment aid to farmers in the beef sector in Ireland subject to the conditions set out in EU Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/1132. </p><p>BEAM is funded by a combination of EU aid and Exchequer support, provided in light of the difficult circumstances that Irish beef farmers have been facing as a result of the market volatility. Over 34,500 farmers had applied for BEAM at its closing date of 20 September, representing potential commitments of up to &euro;78 million.</p><p>In recognition of the important income support role played by the ANC scheme, the total allocation for the scheme has been increased by &euro;48m over the last two budgets (&euro;25m in Budget 2018 and &euro;23m in Budget 2019). In both 2018 and 2019, payment rates in the scheme were increased, with a targeting of increases corresponding to the different level of constraint in the different categories of land in the scheme.</p><p>In Budget 2020, I have provided almost &euro;85 million in targeted schemes to support sustainable beef farming. This includes almost &euro;45 million for the Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP), and a further &euro;40 million for targeted supports. I intend to consult with stakeholders as to the use of these funds.  </p><p>In addition, in the event of a No-Deal Brexit, my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform confirmed in Budget 2020 that a Brexit contingency fund of &euro;650 million will be available to support our most vulnerable sectors, to be activated in tranches as the full impacts emerge. &euro;110 million will be made available through my Department in the first tranche, of which &euro;85 million will be provided in immediate supports for beef farmers. This will, of course, be supplemented by any exceptional aid provided from the EU under the CMO regulation.</p><p>There have been a series of formal negotiations with beef sector stakeholders, facilitated by my Department, since early August, culminating in an agreement being reached between stakeholders on Sunday 15 September.</p><p>The full text of the Agreement and updates on work progressed to date is available on my  Department's website:  </p><p>The Agreement involves a number of interventions which will provide immediate benefit for beef producers, as well as a range of strategic measures which seek to address structural imbalances in the sector.</p><p>Beef producers will benefit from an immediate increase in a range of bonuses. This will increase the level of bonus being paid on certain animals, as well as significantly increasing the number of animals which are eligible for a bonus. The cumulative effect is that over 70% of all steer and heifers slaughtered will now be eligible for a bonus on top of the base price paid.</p><p>A number of actions in the area of market transparency, beef promotion and strengthening the position of the farmer in the supply chain are included in the Agreement. These measures set a course towards greater clarity for all stakeholders involved in the beef supply chain, primarily farmers.</p><p>My Department is also proactively engaging with several potential beef Producer Organisations, which have to potential to strengthen the bargaining power of beef farmers in the supply chain.  Two beef producer organisations have been formally recognised by my Department in recent weeks.</p><p>I have established a Beef Market Taskforce to provide the leadership to develop a sustainable pathway for the future of the beef sector in terms of economic, environmental and social sustainability. It was deeply regrettable that the first meeting scheduled for 14 October was unable to proceed. However the independent chair and Department officials continue to engage proactively with Taskforce members with a view to enabling its important work to progress. </p><p>Trade Missions play an important role in promoting the Irish agri-food sector and in market development, and I have been very active on this front in recent years as we strive to gain and develop a presence in as many global markets as possible. A significant achievement was gaining access to the Chinese market for beef in 2018 and expanding this access to 14 further beef plants in 2019.  Access was also achieved for beef to Qatar, Kuwait and Ukraine in 2018 and improved conditions for export agreed with Japan in 2019.</p><p>I am very aware of the significant difficulites facing beef farmers as a result of a sustained period of low prices.  However, I believe that the range of financial and developmental supports available, coupled with the prioritisation of optimising access to third country markets is the correct path to continue on and I plan to support the sector by building on this work.</p></reply>

Cannabis (which includes hemp) is listed in schedule 1 of the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2017, as amended which means it is subject to the strictest level of control. </p>  <p>  Earlier this year, my Department concluded a broad consultation which included relevant bodies/agencies in an examination of growing hemp commercially. The consultation included the Departments of Health, Justice and Law Reform, the Health Products Regulatory Authority, Teagasc and the two representative bodies for Hemp. </p>  <p>  A clear view arising from respondents in the consultation involved in regulation is that the domestic hemp industry should continue to be controlled and regulated by the Department of Health and that the current stringent controls in relation to growing hemp should continue. This strict regulation is in line with the situation in many other countries. </p>  <p>  An oversupply of industrial hemp in the European market has resulted in current low value for the majority of products from hemp. A number of large scale hemp processing facilities in Europe have failed and the lack of processing facilities in Ireland, which are required to be in close proximity to hemp growers, is also an issue. </p>  <p>  Officials of my Department have met with industry representatives on a number of occasions and it is clear from all of those consultations that further in-depth research and financial analysis is required to be undertaken by the industry in order to determine if the establishment of processing facilities in Ireland is commercially viable.  While my Department remains available to assist, it must be borne in mind that any development in this area must be industry-led.</p></reply>

The Plan has been informed by the work of the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly and the All Party Committee on Climate Action.</p><p>The Plan sets out over 180 actions, together with over 600 sub-actions, and embraces every relevant sector: electricity, enterprise, housing, heating, transport, agriculture, waste and the public sector. </p><p>The plan has a strong focus on implementation, with clear timelines and steps needed to achieve each action, assigning clear lines of responsibility for delivery. A Climate Action Delivery Board<b></b>has been established and will hold each department and public body accountable for the delivery of actions set out in the plan. </p><p>Amongst the ambitious actions which are being pursued under this plan are: </p><p>- Move to 70% renewable electricity by 2030; </p><p>- Deliver a new Retrofit Plan to retrofit 500,000 homes, with large groups of houses being retrofitted by the same contractor to reduce costs, underpinned by smart finance options, and easy pay back methods;</p><p>- Deliver an intensive programme of retrofitting to install 400,000 heat pumps in homes and businesses; </p><p>- Bring 950,000 electric vehicles onto our roads and deliver a nationwide charging network; </p><p>- Eliminate non-recyclable plastic and impose higher fees on the production of materials which are difficult to recycle, and implement measures to ban single-use plastic plates, cutlery, straws, balloon sticks and cotton buds; </p><p>- Establish a new micro-generation scheme, allowing homeowners to generate their own electricity and sell what they don&rsquo;t use back to the national grid; and </p><p>- Every public body to be given a climate action mandate.</p><p>The publication of the first progress report on 31 October 2019 demonstrates robust delivery of the actions set out in the Plan. A completion rate of 85% has been achieved, incorporating 149 measures across sectors. The Climate Action Delivery Board will continue to monitor progress and identify challenges to delivering the remaining actions not yet achieved. </p><p>I am confident that the Climate Action Plan will ensure Ireland meets the multi-faceted challenges that climate change presents both at home and abroad, and will contribute to the global effort to lower emissions and meet the goals of the Paris Agreement.</p></reply>

However, I have been provided with an update on the current status of these refuelling stations by Gas Networks Ireland. There is one operational public CNG refuelling station which is located in Dublin port. The next public refuelling station will be located at Cashel, Co. Tipperary. Construction of this station has been completed and commissioning is planned for January 2020. A further eight stations have been contracted in 2019 and it is forecast that six of these will be delivered in 2020. There are also three private CNG refuelling stations which are located in Dublin, Cork and Shannon Co. Clare. </p>  <p>  The Green Connect project, which is also being developed by Gas Networks Ireland, has been approved for funding from the Connecting Europe Facility Transport Fund. The project spans a five year period from 2019 to 2024. It is a follow on project from the Causeway Programme to complete a national network of CNG refuelling stations along the core road network in Ireland. The project includes the delivery of 21 additional CNG refuelling stations. Two further CNG refuelling stations are to be provided by Gas Networks Ireland's GRAZE project supported by the Climate Action Fund.</p>  <p>  The development of electric vehicle recharging points is being supported through a grant of up to &euro;600 for the installation of a home charge point, a grant of up to &euro;5,000 for Local Authorities to install on-street charge points and accelerated capital allowances to support businesses installing charge points. </p>  <p>  Budget 2020 provided &euro;6 million in funding to my Department to support the development of this charging infrastructure with &euro;4 million allocated to the home charge point grant and &euro;2 million to the on-street charge point grant. The Climate Action Plan, which was published in June, also sets out a range of actions to support the delivery of charging infrastructure for electric vehicles. These actions include expanding the home charger grant to include locations with shared parking such as apartments.</p>  <p>  Funding of &euro;10 million from the Climate Action Fund is supporting the ESB to develop a nationwide, state-of-the-art electric vehicle fast charging network, with the ESB also investing &euro;10 million. This project includes the installation of 140 fast chargers consisting of 90 150kW chargers (each of which will be capable of charging two vehicles simultaneously) and upgrading 50 existing standard chargers to 50kW chargers The project will also involve replacing over 500 existing standard charge points with next generation high reliability models. This is a multi-annual project and is expected to be fully completed by 2022.</p>  <p>  In addition, new regulations being developed by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government will require provision to be made for charge points in new domestic and non-domestic buildings with over 10 car parking spaces and those undergoing major refurbishments. The regulations will also require non-domestic buildings with over 20 car parking spaces to install charging facilities.</p></reply>

The Guidelines require, amongst other things, that Member States carry out a detailed mapping exercise to identify as far as reasonably possible those areas where intervention is required. </p>  <p>  Having consulted with industry on an ongoing basis, my Department recently conducted a final public consultation to close the mapping exercise in advance of the award of the NBP contract. Over 180 submissions were received from a variety of stakeholders, including 30 from large and small commercial telecommunications operators, with the remainder from local authority broadband officers and members of the public. </p>  <p>  Following evaluation of the submissions and receipt of a positive State aid decision on 15 November, responses have been issued to the submissions from the commercial operators. </p>  <p>  Having evaluated the submissions received, approximately 38,000 premises were removed from the intervention area as commercial operators provided evidence that these premises can now access a high speed broadband service from an existing network. These premises relate to network deployment detailed in submissions received from eir (34,000 premises) regarding its fibre rural network and SIRO (4,000 premises) as part of its wider fibre network rollout, which were evaluated as meeting the assessment criteria published by the Department.</p>  <p>  In addition, approximately 37,000 premises originally identified as being served by commercial operators have now been included in the intervention area for the NBP, as commercial operators' plans to serve these premises have not materialised.</p>  <p>  The map has also been updated for approximately an additional 2,000 premises identified in the latest Ordinance Survey Ireland data. The final Intervention Area now covers 537,596 premises.</p></reply>

The price that NBI can charge for connecting each home or business and the monthly rentals, are fully regulated by the contract with the Minister. Prices charged must also be benchmarked to the regulated prices allowed by ComReg each year to ensure prices remain in line with urban areas over the 25 years of the contract. The initial maximum connection charge to a home that NBI is allowed to charge is &euro;100. This charge is paid by the broadband service provider (e.g. eir, Sky, Vodafone, or a local broadband provider) to NBI. Thereafter the maximum monthly wholesale charge for a home buying a 150Mbps service is capped at &euro;30. This is similar to the charge levied by eir&rsquo;s wholesale division in urban areas. </p>  <p>  It was a requirement under the State Aid rules that subsidy could only be awarded to a wholesale only network provider of broadband services. This will ensure that consumers have the choice of many retail broadband providers similar to consumers in urban areas. Similar to offers available in urban areas, consumers in rural areas will also be able to buy multiple services through bundled packages including broadband, fixed and mobile voice, TV and other services from retail operators, in what will be a competitive market. This will ensure choice and competition in the market for broadband, to the benefit of all residential and business consumers.</p></reply>

This includes the guidelines set down by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). These guidelines have been endorsed by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the European Commission and provide scientifically-based exposure limits that are applicable to both public and occupational exposure from electromagnetic fields (EMF). </p>  <p>  The ICNIRP Guidelines apply up to a frequency of 300 gigahertz (GHz), well above the maximum frequencies being considered for 5G. ComReg, the independent telecoms regulatory authority, ensures that licensed mobile operators comply with their licence conditions and do not exceed these guidelines. </p>  <p>  An Irish Government commissioned report published in 2016 reaffirmed the conclusions of an earlier 2007 report, that there is insufficient evidence to establish a causal relationship between exposure to low-frequency electromagnetic fields and adverse health effects.</p>  <p>  Nevertheless, public exposure to non-ionising radiation is an issue that is kept under review. As Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, I assigned a new statutory function to the Environmental Protection Agency earlier this year to provide general information to the public in this regard, to monitor international scientific developments and provide independent advice to my Department in this area.

Works on those roads are funded from the Council's own resources supplemented by State road grants. The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.  </p>  <p>  Applications for funding under the Department's Bridge Rehabilitation Scheme are invited on an annual basis for consideration for funding in the subsequent year. Councils are made aware of the conditions and are asked to submit applications in order of priority. Donegal County Council recently submitted its bridge rehabilitation funding application and Castlefinn Bridge was not included in this application. The Department will examine applications from all local authorities and Councils will be notified of their allocations early in the new year.</p>  <p>  Larger scale bridge upgrade works fall under the Specific Grant category and applications need to comply with project appraisal requirements. A Specific Grant application has not been received in relation to Castlefinn Bridge. </p>  <p>  It is important to reiterate that the role of Exchequer grants for regional and local roads is to supplement local authorities in their spending in this area and it is open to Donegal County Council to fund work on this bridge from its own resources.</p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from local authorities' own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.</p>  <p>  Before the recession, local authorities could apply on a regular basis for grants for Specific  (schemes costing less than &euro;5m) and Strategic Improvement Grants (schemes costing more than &euro;5m) for the strengthening, widening or realignment of regional and local  roads.   However, the extent of the cutbacks in grant funding during the crisis meant this grant scheme had to be curtailed from 2013 because expenditure on maintenance/renewal was falling well short of what was required to adequately maintain the regional and local road network. </p>  <p>  The current Capital Plan does provide for the gradual build-up in funding for the road network but it will take some time yet to reach the level required even for the  basic maintenance and renewal of the network.  For this reason, there continues to be limited scope for funding new or additional projects under the Specific and Strategic Grant Programmes.  </p>  <p>  Any projects proposed by local authorities for consideration under these Grant Programmes are assessed by the Department on a case-by-case basis.  All projects put forward by local authorities for consideration must comply with the requirements of the Public Spending Code and the Department's Capital Appraisal Framework (CAF).  Given the limited funding available for RLR improvement works it is important for local authorities to prioritise projects within their overall area of responsibility with these requirements in mind. </p>  <p>  As required under the project appraisal process Meath County Council submitted a Preliminary Appraisal in relation to improvement works on the R156 in October this year.  In view of budgetary constraints all applications received from local authorities have to be assessed taking into account competing projects and the available budget.</p></reply>

This action was taken following a reported malfunction of a number of lifejackets which are a key piece of personal protective equipment.  An investigation is underway into the malfunctioning lifejackets which involves the Coast Guard, the supplier and the manufacturer.  It is hoped to identify the cause and provide for a speedy, effective and safe solution.</p>  <p>  This action is being taken in compliance with Coast Guards SAR assurance obligations as set out in the National SAR Plan to ensure safety of Coast Guard boat crews. The National SAR Committee met on Monday 18 November and was briefed on the matter.  In the meantime, from a SAR coverage point of view, the Coast Guard is deploying various contingencies based on an assessment of risk.  All shoreline and cliff rescue services remain in place, along with the four Search and Rescue Coast Guard helicopters.  The RNLI, Community Inshore Rescue Boats, and Naval Service will continue to assist particularly in those areas of greatest risk until the issue has been resolved.</p>  <p>  As regards other concerns raised previously, the Irish Coast Guard addressed these at the time through a programme of both internal and external testing. Along with independent testing through a UK based Testing Laboratory regarding the EN ISO standards applicable and assurances received from the manufacturer of the lifejacket in question.</p>  <p>  As regards broader issues of safety in our national search and rescue service, I would draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to the recent review of our National Search and Rescue Framework which was published in July last and the publication of a new National Search and Rescue Plan. The review was chaired independently by Sir Alan Massey, ex CEO of the UK&rsquo;s Maritime and Coastguard Agency.  </p>  <p>  The Report welcomed the establishment by the IRCG of a new Safety, Quality and Compliance (SQC) section, and appointing therein a dedicated Health and Safety Officer to provide oversight of the SMS, working with the Department&rsquo;s Safety Officer(s) to embed and improve Health and Safety policy, procedures, goals and objectives.  Further, the IRCG has committed to implementing an effective SMS, applicable to the specific needs of the IRCG and in line with the mandatory requirements of ISO 45001:2018 - Occupational Health and Safety Management Systems (SMS Revision &amp;amp; Accreditation &ndash; SRA - Project). This work is already helping inform other entities within the SAR system who are seeking to improve their Safety Management Systems. The recent issue with lifejackets and the response to that is evidence of safety management in action.</p>  <p>  At a national level, the new National SAR Plan delivers a new mechanism of assurance in relation to standards and practices and oversight of the overall Search and Rescue system. This includes a support network to assist those involved in search and rescue to develop minimum standards and practices and to embed principles of continuous improvement and safety within their organisations. It also creates a new Search and Rescue Regulators&rsquo; Forum, a unique initiative which brings transport regulators in the Search and Rescue domain together to exchange good practice and seek to improve the overall system assurance mechanisms.</p></reply>

Previously, DCYA had administered the Higher Capitation appraisal process, but this change was necessary when the process transitioned to Pobal.</p>  <p>  In some cases, as part of the process, applications have to be referred back to Early Learning and Care (ELC) providers for a number of reasons including confirmation of qualifications from a third party accredited body or institution. Until these applications are resubmitted with correct details and rechecked, they cannot be approved and paid. Once these applications are  resubmitted to Pobal, with correct details, they are dealt with as a priority.</p>  <p>  As response to this change and considering the significant pressure on services, the decision was made that ELC providers whose applications had not yet been processed and who were also in receipt of the first preliminary payment on 23rd August 2019, would receive an additional preliminary payment on 1st November 2019. This payment was for a four-week period that took ELC providers to 20th November 2019. The payment was based on a child&rsquo;s Full Time Equivalent (FTE) numbers for the week ending 18th November 2019 using the max FTE cap for services which were approved for higher capitation last year.</p>  <p>  A further preliminary payment was made on 8th November 2019 for any ELC service providers whose application had still not been processed at that stage. This payment was for a four week period that took ELC service providers to the 22nd November 2019. ELC service providers who had not previously been approved for the Higher Capitation rate but had submitted an application for the 2019/2020 programme year that had not been processed, received a preliminary payment on 29th October 2019. This payment was for an eight week period. An additional preliminary payment was also made to these services on 8th November and this payment was for a four week period.</p></reply>

Regrettably these timelines were later than had been indicated the previous year, due to a combination of resourcing issues and a delay in closing off the 2018/2019 programme year. I understand the frustration the timelines and delays have caused.</p>  <p>  Pobal officials began processing applications for the programme year 2019/2020 in October 2019, in line with the announced schedule. Pobal is currently processing a large volume of applications, and is working to approve applications and release funding as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  Considering the significant pressure on services, my Department made the decision that early learning and care providers whose applications had not yet been processed and who were also in receipt of the first preliminary payment on 23rd August 2019, would receive an additional preliminary payment on 1st November 2019. This payment was for a four-week period that took early learning and care providers to 20th November 2019. The payment was based on a child&rsquo;s Full Time Equivalent (FTE) numbers for the week ending 18th November 2019 using the max FTE cap for services which were approved for Higher Capitation last year.</p>  <p>  A further preliminary payment was made on 8th November 2019 for any early learning and care service providers whose application had still not been processed at that stage. This payment was for a four week period that took service providers to the 22nd November 2019. Service providers who had not previously been approved for the Higher Capitation rate but had submitted an application for the 2019/2020 programme year that had not been processed, received a preliminary payment on 29th October 2019. This payment was for an eight week period. An additional preliminary payment was also made to these services on 8th November and this payment was for a four week period.</p>  <p>  As part of the School-Age Childcare strand of the 2019 Capital Grants Programme, it was a condition for services to register with Tusla in order to receive the full grant amount, as registration with Tusla is now a legal requirement for school-age childcare services. As the registration process for many services had not yet been completed at an earlier stage in the year, services who were approved for school-age childcare capital funding and had engaged with the registration process had part of their grant released prior to completion of registration, with the remainder being withheld until the registration process was complete.</p>  <p>  Officials in my Department have been in contact with colleagues in Pobal for clarification on the details you have raised on behalf of the service in question. In response, Pobal confirmed that there are outstanding issues on the service's Higher Capitation and School Age Childcare Capital applications. I would therefore urge the service to engage with Pobal with the intention of resolving these issues. As Pobal are the administrators of both the Capital and Higher Capitation payments, they are the most appropriate point of contact for queries concerning such applications.</p></reply>

The key objective of AIM is to support early learning and care providers to deliver an inclusive pre-school experience, ensuring that children with a disability can meaningfully participate in the ECCE programme, thereby reaping the benefits of quality pre-school education.</p><p>AIM provides a range of supports, both universal and targeted. In many cases, the universal supports provided through AIM, which include staff training, are sufficient to enable the full participation of a child with a disability. Having reviewed the needs of a child in the context of the early learning and care setting, an Early Years Specialist may provide advice on strategies to support the child's inclusion. In some cases, the Early Years Specialist may recommend funding for additional assistance, either to allow for an additional staff member or to enable a reduction in the adult to child ratio.</p><p>In order to minimise any delays in the provision of supports, early learning and care providers are encouraged to submit applications for support (Access and Inclusion Profile) as early as possible.  For the programme year that began in September 2019, the window for applications opened on 1st May.</p><p>Since the September 2019 programme call opened on May 1st, the average response time from submission of an Access and Inclusion Profile to conducting an observation visit for a child or children in the ECCE programme - which is necessary to determine the level of need - has been 26 days. This is within the expected timeline as per the Access and Inclusion Profile guidance, which states that, following a review of the information provided, a member of the Better Start Access and Inclusion team will contact the pre-school within 4-6 weeks of submission.</p><p>Once an observation visit has taken place, an Early Years Specialist within Better Start completes a report, which goes through a review and appraisal process. On average the time from observation to final decision is 23 days. Therefore, in total, from application to decision it takes on average 49 days to process an AIM application.</p><p>AIM payments for additional assistance (AIM Level 7) are made in line with the payments schedule published in August 2019 (see table). The first payment run was completed on 13 September 2019, three weeks after the commencement of the 2019/2020 ECCE programme year.  Weekly catch-up payments are also facilitated to minimise the timeframe for services from approval to payment. In order to make an AIM Level 7 payment there must be an approved registration for the AIM child which reflects the level of AIM support awarded.  Early learning and care services are informed of this requirement as part of the decision notification process and regular communications (including timelines) are published on the PIP provider portal.</p><p>With regard to the back-dating of AIM funding for an additional staff member, it should be noted that this type of support is only one of a range of supports provided under AIM. Where an application for AIM support is submitted, an Early Years Specialist determines the most appropriate type of support, depending on the needs of the child in the context of the early learning and care setting. The most appropriate support may not be an additional staff member. It would therefore not be appropriate for an additional staff member to be recruited until funding for this purpose is approved.</p><p>In cases where a child has additionally complex needs or complex medical needs such that he or she could not reasonably be expected to attend the preschool service for an observation visit without AIM targeted supports already being in place, the observation visit may be delayed until after the supports are in place at the discretion of the Better Start Early Years Specialist Service. In such situations, targeted supports can be approved prior to an observation visit, but approval by the Better Start Early Years Specialist Service is required, and payment in relation to targeted supports cannot be backdated to a date before the date on which approval is given.</p><p>In cases where a child has been allocated AIM Level 7 support in the first year of the ECCE Programme, and the child continues the ECCE Programme in the same early learning and care setting, provided there are no changes e.g. to the adult-child ratio in the room, approval for the second year of funding may be granted without a second visit to the setting. (An observation visit will have taken place in the first year of the child's participation.)</p><p><b>AIM Level 7 Payment Schedule</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Payment Date</th>       <th>% paid</th>       <th>Cumulative paid</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>13th September 2019 </td>       <td>25% of contract value</td>       <td>25 % of contract value</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>11th October 2019 </td>       <td>12.5% of contract value</td>       <td>37.5 % of contract value</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>29th November 2019 </td>       <td>12.5% of contract value</td>       <td>50 % of contract value</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>10th January 2020 </td>       <td>12.5% of contract value</td>       <td>62.5% of contract value</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>21st February 2020 </td>       <td>12.5% of contract value</td>       <td>75% of contract value</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>27th March 2020 </td>       <td>12.5% of contract value</td>       <td>87.5% of contract value</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>22nd May 2020 </td>       <td>12.5% of contract value</td>       <td>100 % of contract value</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p><b>Please Note:</b></p><p>- Payments may vary throughout the year, if there are any changes to approved funding.</p><p>- Catch up payments will be made to services on a weekly basis.</p><p>- This schedule is for information purposes only.

This extra investment has supported a doubling of capacity in the sector, including both Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) and the provision of childcare to the  0-3 age group.</p>  <p>  One of the key priorities for my Department's capital programme is to support childcare providers to extend their existing services, or to establish new services, where need or demand exists. </p>  <p>  My Department allocates capital funding on an annual basis.  Providers are invited to submit applications setting out their grant request.  All applications are appraised in a fair and impartial manner and on the basis of the quality of their application.  Four providers in Co. Wicklow were allocated capital grants in 2019 to enable them to extend their services.</p>  <p>  Finally, if the Deputy is aware of any specific cases of parents having difficulty accessing childcare places, the Wicklow County Childcare Committee will be pleased to assist them.</p></reply>

Measures already undertaken and which will continue over the years ahead include:</p>  <p>  - Introducing a minimum qualification requirement in law which ensures that all staff must have at least a Level 5 qualification in early childhood care and education</p>  <p>  - Incentivising the recruitment of graduates. 25% of those working in the sector now have degrees in early childhood education and care </p>  <p>  - Establishing the Better Start Quality Development Service that provides mentoring and training to services all across the country.</p>  <p>  - Providing Learner Fund Bursaries and payments for participation in Continuing Professional Development, to support the upskilling of those working in the sector. </p>  <p>  - Funding the provision of training in areas such as the curriculum and inclusion. </p>  <p>  - Expanding and strengthening the Tusla Early Years Inspectorate, which is the statutory regulator of the sector. The number of inspections carried out by Tusla each year is nearly double what it was 5 years ago.</p>  <p>  - Creating a register of providers, and giving Tusla the power to deregister providers and to attach conditions to their registration.</p>  <p>  - Introducing &ldquo;education-focused inspections&rdquo; for the ECCE programme that are carried out by the Department of Education and Skills Inspectorate on behalf of my Department.</p>  <p>  - Supporting the 30 City and County Childcare Committees - including Wicklow County Childcare Committee - to assist my Department in ensuring that schemes and other initiatives we operate nationally meet local needs. </p>  <p>  - Introducing (in 2019) the regulation of school age childcare for the first time.</p>  <p>  - Consulting on a Draft Childminding Action Plan (published in August 2019 for the purpose of public consultation), which sets out how we propose to introduce the regulation of childminding over the years ahead and to open up a full range of supports for childminders, including supports for quality and safety. </p>  <p>  In addition, First 5, our Whole-of-Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families, which I published last year, sets out a wide range of further measures that I - working in collaboration with my colleagues in Government - intend to take. These include, for example, the Workforce Development Plan, work on which began earlier this year and which will set out a detailed plan of actions to achieve a graduate-led workforce in early learning and care settings by 2028. In relation to school-age childcare, following the initial Regulations introduced earlier this year, a public consultation took place in summer 2019 which will inform the development over the period ahead of comprehensive Regulations and a quality improvement framework for school-age childcare settings.</p>  <p>  Following the recent broadcast of the RT&Eacute; investigation, Behind Closed Doors, I wrote to the Chair of Tusla to ask what additional powers the Tusla Early Years Inspectorate might need. Following Tusla&rsquo;s reply, my Department is now examining legislative options, which may include mechanisms to inform parents of inspection findings at an earlier stage, to require services to display prominently their inspection status, and to alert parents in relation to the operation of unregistered services.</p>  <p>  Additional powers for Tusla must form part of a multi-faceted approach that also includes: additional training for those working in the sector, with a renewed focus on the child protection training that is already under way; strengthened advisory supports before and after inspections; supporting the Garda Vetting process for the sector; and additional information for parents. In short, we need to keep strengthening the quality agenda we have been successfully pursuing over recent years.</p></reply>

Medical Assessors are assigned to specific schemes on a daily basis.</p>  <p>  The length of time taken for each scheme for desk assessments varies depending on the complexities of the case and the volume of documents submitted, Domiciliary Care Allowance is one such example. Therefore it is not feasible to allocate a fixed time for each case as they are unique in their own way even with clients of similar diagnosis. The Medical Assessor will take the time as required to read, analyse and evaluate each case in the assessment and arrives at the clinical opinion for capacity for work or the need for full time care. Furthermore, the Medical Assessor will take the time to prepare the narrative for the reasoning in the event of a not eligible opinion. </p>  <p>  My department has efficiently reduced waiting times for medical assessments of claim applications in all schemes to between one to four weeks.</p>  <p>  I hope this satisfactorily clarifies the concerns raised by the Deputy.</p></reply>

Between July 2015 and October 2019, some 247,296 jobseekers had commenced their engagement period with the JobPath service.  Of this number, 52% were unemployed for over three years.  This group, in particular, faces significant barriers when seeking to enter or return to employment in the labour market.</p><p>The numbers of clients to engage with the JobPath service for the first three years and their employment outcomes are set out in Table 1 below. It should be noted that many clients who are currently engaged with JobPath are still in the first phase of the service. They have not had sufficient time with the service to have gained employment nor sustain that employment for up to 52 weeks. Furthermore, as many clients who have commenced employment will have done so less than 52 weeks ago the numbers sustaining employment for 52 weeks is expected to increase over time. This is particularly relevant for those clients who commenced an engagement with the service in 2018. </p><p>The number of Jobseekers engaged with JobPath and the number of current subsequent engagements is set out in Table 2 below.  </p><p>The number of registration fees paid in respect of JobPath referrals since 2015 as well as the number of registration fees paid in respect of the same person twice, three and four times are set out in Table 3 below. Registration fees are incurred when a client engages with the JobPath service and agrees a personal progression plan. However, due to the validation process there is a time difference between the date of the client engagement and the payment of the registration fee.  </p><p>I trust that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p><p><b>Table 1: Jobseekers engaged with JobPath &amp;amp; Outcomes Years 1 - 3  </b></p><p>For the purposes of the JobPath Contracts 2015 and 2016 are considered to be Contract Year 1, however, for convenience the table below is presented by calendar year.   <table>    <tr>       <th>Contract   Year</th>       <th>Year</th>       <th>Jobseekers engaged with the JobPath service </th>       <th>Number of Job Starts (One per referral*)  </th>       <th>Numbers who sustained 52 weeks Employment (to date)</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Year 1</td>       <td>2015</td>       <td>6,591</td>       <td>1,659</td>       <td>644</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Year 1</td>       <td>2016</td>       <td>65,461</td>       <td>14,413</td>       <td>5,432</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Year 2</td>       <td>2017</td>       <td>74,869</td>       <td>21,618</td>       <td>8,762</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Year 3</td>       <td>2018</td>       <td>60,848</td>       <td>14,505</td>       <td>3,021</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>*Jobseekers may have multiple job starts during an engagement period, however, for the purposes of the above statistics only one job start per referral has been counted. </p><p><b>Table 2: Jobseekers engaged with JobPath &amp;amp; the current number of re-engagements </b> <table>    <tr>       <th></th>       <th></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total number of Jobseekers engagements with JobPath July 2015 - End-October 2019</td>       <td>247,296</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total number of Jobseekers to complete at least one full engagement period with JobPath.</td>       <td>138,446</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total number of Jobseekers currently engaged with service for the 2nd time having  previously  completed one full engagement period.</td>       <td>27,490</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total number of Jobseekers currently engaged with service for the 3rd time having previously completed two full engagement periods.</td>       <td>1,555</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p><b>Table 3: Registration Fees Processed for payment July 2015 - End October 2019</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Registration Fees Processed for payment July 2015 - November 2019</th>       <th>Total Number of  Unique Clients</th>       <th>Total Registration Fees paid </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>1 registration fee paid only</td>       <td>156759</td>       <td>156759</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2 registration fees paid only</td>       <td>42060</td>       <td>84120</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>3 registration fees paid only</td>       <td>1972</td>       <td>5916</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>4 registration fees paid only</td>       <td>14</td>       <td>56</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Totals </td>       <td>200805</td>       <td>246851</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-11-26a.1241.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019112600073#WRS05800"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 479 and 489 together.</p>  <p>  Increasing pension age, to moderate the increase in pension duration, is a means by which pensions can be made sustainable in the context of increasing longevity.  In order to provide for sustainable pensions and to facilitate a longer working life, legislation passed in 2011 provides for an increase in the State pension age in three separate stages.  In 2014, the State pension age was standardised at 66.  This will be increased to 67 in 2021 and 68 in 2028.  The Roadmap for Pensions Reform 2018-2023 has stated that future changes in State pension age after 2035 will be based on research into life expectancy. </p>  <p>  This sustainability is vital, if the current workers, who fund State pension payments through their PRSI, are to receive a pension themselves when they reach retirement age.  It is the only feasible solution which does not involve reducing pension rates to pensioners (which would result in an increase in the rate of poverty among older people), or reducing other significant areas of Government expenditure (such as other payments made by my Department). </p>  <p>  In most cases, it is hoped that workers will continue to work up to State pension age, and so the question of claiming a social protection payment would not arise.  Where this is not possible and a person ceases their employment before reaching State pension age, they may apply for either the jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit or jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance schemes.  Jobseeker&rsquo;s payments are currently paid to eligible jobseekers aged 18 to 66 years subject to the person satisfying the general scheme conditions. Social Welfare legislation states that jobseeker payments may be made until the person reaches pensionable age provided they satisfy the necessary contribution conditions.   </p>  <p>  It is important to note that there is no legally mandated retirement age in the State, and the age at which employees retire is a matter for the contract of employment between them and their employers.  While such a contract may have been entered into with a retirement age of 65, in the context of the previous State pension arrangements, there is no legal impediment to the employer and employee agreeing to increase the duration of employment for one or more years, if both parties wish to do so.  In this regard, the Workplace Relations Commission has produced a Code of Practice on Longer Working and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) has published guidance material for employers on the use of fixed-term contracts beyond normal retirement age.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputies. </p></reply>

These contracts are reviewed annually to ensure they are fit-for-purpose in the context of the Irish labour market, as well as providing value for money for taxpayers.</p>  <p>  Indecon, in its reviews of the LES and Job Clubs published last January, recommended that the Department consider the introduction of multiannual contracts and a competitive procurement process for future provision of these services. The Department has also received legal advice to the effect that renewing the LES and Job Clubs contracts annually, without any movement towards competitive procurement, is no longer sustainable.  </p>  <p>  This, combined with the closure of the JobPath contracts to new referrals at the end of 2020, provides my Department with the opportunity to review all contracted public employment services. The aim is to design and introduce a comprehensive model that will incorporate various models of response and be fit for purpose for the Irish labour market from 2021 onwards. </p>  <p>  In September, my Department published a Request for Tender for consultancy services, to provide advice, support and assist with the procurement of contracted public employment services in Ireland, covering the period 2021-2025.  It is anticipated that the successful tenderer will provide the Department with a final report in the second quarter of 2020.  In the interim, no changes will be made to the current contracting process for Local Employment Services for 2020.</p>  <p>  As part of the review of Local Employment Services officials from my Department are currently holding a series of engagements with Local Employment Servicers and Job Clubs across the State in order to hear the views of those currently providing activation services on the ground on behalf of the Department. Their views will feed into the Department&rsquo;s considerations in developing an appropriate contracted public employment service for the future. </p>  <p>  I am on the record in recognising the valuable work performed by Local Employment Services. It is my view that, within the parameters of current procurement rules, any future procurement process give due recognition to the ability to deliver high quality, locally-based services. </p>  <p>  Indeed, it is in everyone's' interests - jobseekers, service providers and the State - to ensure, insofar as it is possible, that experienced employment service providers with a strong community ethos continue to form a core part of our employment services infrastructure.</p></reply>

If there is no change in State pension age, the proportion of a person's life spent in retirement will increase to levels where current workers will no longer be able to support current pensioners.</p>  <p>  This sustainability is vital, if the current workers, who fund State pension payments through their PRSI, are to receive a pension themselves when they reach retirement age.  Therefore, the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2011 provided that State pension age will be increased gradually to 68 years.  This began in January 2014 with the abolition of the State pension (transition) which was available to people aged 65 who had retired and who satisfied the PRSI qualifying conditions.  This measure standardised the State pension age for all at 66 years.  This is in keeping with similar measures being employed by most EU and OECD countries. </p>  <p>  My Department's current estimate is that the net annual cost of restoring the State pension (Transition) would be &euro;150.5m including PRSI foregone and secondary benefits.  Thus the high level estimated cost for the period 2020 - 2026 would be well over &euro;1 Billion.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

Pension increases are entirely a matter for the scheme trustees and the sponsoring employer.  Matters directly related to the sponsoring employer referred to in the details supplied come under the remit of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment. </p>  <p>  Scheme trustees have a range of duties and responsibilities under trust law, under the Pensions Act 1990, as amended, and under other relevant legislation.  The duties of pension scheme trustees include administering the scheme in accordance with the law and the terms of the trust deed and scheme rules as well as ensuring compliance with the requirements that apply to these schemes.  Trustees must act in the best financial interest of all scheme members, whether active, deferred or retired, and must serve all beneficiaries of the scheme impartially. If there is a conflict of interest then a person&rsquo;s duty as a trustee must take precedence over other interests. </p>  <p>  Measures were introduced in 2015 to facilitate engagement between the trustees of a pension scheme and groups representing the interests of pensioner and deferred scheme members.  Changes to guidance issued by the Pensions Authority require the trustees of a pension scheme to notify groups representing the interest of scheme members of proposals to issue a direction under section 50 of the Pensions Act to restructure scheme benefits.  This affords the representative group an opportunity to make a submission to the trustees of a pension scheme in relation to proposals to restructure scheme benefits.  These changes facilitate engagement between groups representing the interests of pensioner and deferred scheme members and the trustees of a pension scheme. </p>  <p>  Groups representing the interests of pensioners and deferred scheme members have a right to appeal a section 50 direction by the Pensions Authority to the High Court on a point of law. </p>  <p>  The Pensions Authority is the regulatory body charged with the supervision of pension schemes and has the necessary powers under statute to investigate the conduct of a pension scheme should it become aware that a scheme is not in compliance with the provisions of the Pensions Act.  Where a pension scheme member is of the view that the scheme is not in compliance with legislative requirements he or she may make a formal complaint to the Pensions Authority. </p>  <p>  Any questions relating to access to the State's industrial relations machinery are a matter for the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The means test plays a critical role in determining whether or not an income need arises as a consequence of a particular contingency &ndash; such as disability, unemployment or caring.  This ensures that the recipient has a verifiable income need and that resources are targeted to those who need them most.  </p>  <p>  By its nature, the means test takes account of the income a person or couple has in terms of cash, property - other than the family home - and capital.  It does not take account of a person&rsquo;s expenditure. In line with most social assistance payments, deductions permitted for disability allowance include PRSI, union dues and superannuation (pension contributions).  </p>  <p>  Introducing a rent or mortgage disregard for disability allowance would have significant budgetary implications, and would give rise to inconsistencies in how means tests are applied across schemes.  It would also significantly increase the complexity of the means assessment.  </p>  <p>  In relation to means testing, disability allowance has the highest capital disregard of any scheme operated by the Department.  A recipient can have up to &euro;50,000 in savings and still receive the full rate of payment.  This is compared to &euro;20,000 for most social welfare payments. In addition to this, disability allowance recipients may work and earn up to &euro;120 per week without their payment being affected.</p>  <p>  It should also be noted that people receiving disability allowance may also be eligible for secondary benefits such as free travel, fuel allowance, the household benefits package, living alone allowance and the telephone support allowance. Depending on their circumstance, recipients may also be entitled to rent supplement or housing assistance payment, to help meet housing expenses.  </p>  <p>  Any changes to the means assessment for disability allowance would have to be considered in the overall policy and budgetary context. </p></reply>

The Building Regulations apply to the design and construction of a building or to an extension or material alteration of a building. These regulations set out the minimum performance requirements that a building must achieve. Building Regulations and procurement processes are performance based.  As such there cannot be a target set for specific construction materials. The requirements of the Building Regulations are set out in 12 parts classified as Parts A to M. In support of these the department has issued Technical Guidance Documents (TGD A - M) which provide technical guidance on how to comply with the building regulations in practical terms.  </p>  <p>  TGD D (Materials and Workmanship) requires &ldquo;proper materials&rdquo;. This means materials that are fit for the use for which they are intended and for the conditions in which they are to be used, and includes materials which comply with an appropriate Irish Standard.</p>  <p>  The National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) have issued the Timber Frame Dwellings Standard, IS 440, which sets the requirements for construction of timber frame dwellings. TGD A (Structure) recognises and takes account of the IS 440 timber frame standard for dwellings. NSAI facilitates industry standards committees in the area of timber construction materials. </p>  <p>  The Office of Public Works is leading an action of the Climate Action Plan to develop a roadmap to promote greater use of lower-carbon building material alternatives in construction.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is leading a range of additional actions to work with industry stakeholders to increase the use of low carbon materials, taking into account international best practice. </p></reply>

The building regulations set the minimum performance requirements that a building must achieve, to provide for the health, safety and welfare of people in and about buildings. The building regulations apply to the design and construction of a building, material alterations or extensions of a building, provision of certain services, fittings and equipment and the material change of use of a building. The requirements of the building regulations are set out in 12 parts classified as Parts A to M. Technical Guidance Documents (TGDs) provide guidance on how to comply with the building regulations in practical terms. Where works are carried out in accordance with the guidance, this will, prima facie, indicate compliance with the requirements of the building regulations. </p><p>Part B/TGD B of the building regulations deals with Fire Safety.  Part B approaches fire safety in buildings from 5 perspectives; </p><p>-  the provision of a satisfactory means of escape for people in the event of a fire, and</p><p>-  the limiting of fire spread over internal linings, and</p><p>-  the stability of buildings in the event of a fire, and</p><p>-  the limiting of fire spread over external surfaces and to another building, and</p><p>-  the provision of access and facilities for firefighters.</p><p>A full and comprehensive review of Part B &amp;amp; TGD B, 2006 has been ongoing for a number of years now. </p><p>Following a consultation process on the Part B/TGD B 2006,  and in the interests of clarity a decision was made, in 2014, to develop TGD B into two volumes: Volume 1 : Buildings other than dwelling houses and Volume 2: Dwelling Houses<i>.</i></p><p>In 2017, a new Part B/ TGD B Volume 2 was published and came into force on 1 July 2017. This applies to dwelling houses.</p><p>Work is progressing on Volume 1 - Buildings other than dwelling houses at present, this volume will include student accommodation, apartments, offices, etc. The issues and ongoing reports on the Grenfell fire are important sources of information for this work. The review also considers common and emerging building trends, international developments and events, matters relating to external fire spread, external fire resistance, internal fire resistance, cladding systems, sprinklers, etc. It is intended to publish a draft for public consultation in 2020.</p><p>In parallel with the full review, my Department is preparing additional guidance to TGD B 2006 on open plan apartments, which will be published shortly. Currently there is no guidance in the TGD on this increasingly popular form of apartment design. This will provide both local authorities and industry with greater clarity on how to demonstrate compliance with Part B for open plan apartments, promote greater consistency across the country and streamline the process for demonstrating compliance.</p><p>Separately, following the Grenfell Tower fire tragedy, in June 2017, I established a Fire Safety Task Force to examine fire safety in Ireland.  As part of the work of the Task Force, my Department requested fire services to identify medium-to-high rise (greater than eighteen metres, or greater than six storeys in height) buildings fitted with cladding systems.  Fire services were also asked to consider whether use of their power under section 18(6) of the Fire Services Acts 1981 and 2003 &ndash; to require the person having control over the building to carry out a fire safety assessment of the building, including the cladding system &ndash; was warranted.  </p><p>Countrywide, fire safety assessments were required in respect of 210 buildings &ndash; including 103 residential buildings.  To support these assessments, as part of the work of the Task Force, guidance was developed and issued in December 2017.  The guidance provides information on methods and standards to be used in assessment of cladding systems, as well as interim fire safety measures for application, pending completion of remedial works to cladding systems, where necessary.  The guidance will be of assistance to those carrying out assessments, as well as to fire services who appraise assessments provided to them in respect of identified buildings.</p><p>The most recent information provided to my Department by fire services indicates that, so far, eight buildings have been identified where some remedial works to cladding systems will be necessary.  </p></reply>

In parallel to this, local authorities were invited to submit their bids under the programme for the funding of projects in their functional area. The development of such a multi-annual funding programme was a key recommendation of the report on the National Taking-in-Charge Initiative that was published by my Department in December 2018.  </p>  <p>  The programme will enable the progressive resolution, on a priority basis, of substandard Developer-Provided Water Services Infrastructure, commonly called DPI, much of which was installed in housing estates during the building boom of the late 1990&rsquo;s and early 2000&rsquo;s.  These privately owned and temporary facilities provide mostly wastewater treatment with a small number providing drinking water. </p>  <p>  The closing date for bids under the programme was 18 September 2019. A total of 19 local authorities with Developer Provided Infrastructure in estates in their areas made applications under the programme for support. Donegal County Council included the estates listed in the details supplied in its application. </p>  <p>  My Department is currently completing a preliminary evaluation and clarification process on the bids received with the local authorities. The intention is to shortly set up an Expert Panel to independently evaluate the bids and recommend suitable projects for funding.  This evaluation will take place over the coming months.  Membership of the Panel will include departmental, stakeholder and independent representation in the Chair.  </p>  <p>  The Expert Panel will make recommendations to me on the suitability of projects for funding under the programme based on the criteria set out in the Framework document issued to local authorities when requesting proposals.  The Panel will report to my Department when its examination of the bids is concluded. I expect to be in a position to make announcements in early 2020 on approvals and allocations once that process is concluded and has been considered by my Department.</p></reply>

This is In addition to a huge level of activity under the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) and Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS), as well as the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF) and the Serviced Sites Fund (SSF).  In relation to social housing alone, the Social Housing Construction Status Report for Quarter 2 2019, for example, which was referred to in my previous reply, lists some 200 build projects and phases of projects for the 2 local authority areas, with over 3,000 associated homes. Each of these schemes has frequent contact points between my Department and the relevant local authority.</p><p>Many different Business Units in my Department would engage multiple times per week with officials in both local authorities. This correspondence could be broadly categorised as follows:</p><p>-  Emails and letters in relation to applications for funding approval, including multiple exchanges of correspondence on files, documents, maps and drawings;</p><p>-  Correspondence related to various stages after initial approval;</p><p>-  Emails and letters in relation to affordable housing, including both general and specific proposals, guidance, circulars and funding;</p><p>-  Queries, responses and updates on status of overall social and affordable housing programmes, and specific schemes including projects at proposal stage;</p><p>-  Funding drawdown at various stages, including submission of, validation of and queries on invoices and payments;</p><p>-  Arrangements for quarterly technical meetings to discuss existing and planned housing delivery programmes, including follow up correspondence and clarifications;</p><p>-  Routine exchanges on queries on implementation of programmes between officials and local authority housing teams and the development of pipeline future activity; and</p><p>-  Arrangements for meetings, including National and Regional Housing Summits, the Cork Social Housing Task Force meetings, including preparation of briefing, statistics, reports which include information on proposed and ongoing activity.</p><p>I trust that this information is helpful and that the Deputy can appreciate that the related correspondence could extend to thousands of records.

My Department supports fire authorities through setting general policy, providing a central training programme, issuing guidance on operational and other related matters and providing capital funding support for equipment and priority infrastructural projects. </p>  <p>  In February 2016, my Department announced a five-year Fire Services Capital Programme with an allocation of &euro;40 million, based on an annual &euro;8 million allocation, to be used for the purchase of fire appliances and specialist equipment, building or upgrading of prioritised Fire Stations, an upgrade of the Communications and Mobilisation system and improvements to Training Centres. The five-year programme proposed the construction or refurbishment of twenty six fire stations. This included sixteen new builds and ten upgrade or refurbishment projects.</p>  <p>  The Fire Services Capital Programme forms an important part of my Department&rsquo;s strategy to support fire authorities in the development and maintenance of a quality fire-fighting and rescue service. The prioritisation and effective management of these resources is, in the first instance, a matter for each of the fire authorities based on their assessment of local needs and requirements.  My Department works closely with fire services around the country to progress priority projects.</p>  <p>  In order to maximise the Capital Programme funding available, my Department re-assesses the status of projects in the capital programme on an annual basis and priority can be adjusted to bring forward more advanced projects offering best value-for-money taking account of the state of readiness of projects in the programme more generally.</p>  <p>  While a fire station project for Maynooth is not included in the five year programme referred to above, Kildare County Council wrote to my Department in 2017 requesting that a station in Maynooth be considered in any future capital programmes. I understand that the Council was in the process of identifying a suitable site at that time. </p>  <p>  All requests for funding from my Department&rsquo;s Fire Services Capital Programme are considered in the context of the available resources, local authorities&rsquo; priorities, the value for money offered by proposals and the totality of requests from fire authorities.

My Department&rsquo;s role is to ensure that there are adequate structures and supports in place to assist the authorities in providing such accommodation, including a national framework of policy, legislation and funding. </p>  <p>  In line with the commitment in Rebuilding Ireland, and reflecting the disappointing level of overall funding drawdown in recent years, the Housing Agency, in 2017, commissioned a review of funding for Traveller-specific accommodation.  This review had regard to targets contained in local authority Traveller Accommodation Plans (TAPs) and actual delivery, the current status of accommodation funded and funding provided for accommodation maintenance and other supports.   </p>  <p>  Following its consideration of the review, the National Traveller Accommodation Consultative Committee recommended the establishment of an independent expert group to review the effectiveness, implementation and operation of relevant legislation and to put forward proposals to improve delivery of Traveller accommodation nationally.  The Expert Group submitted its report in July 2019.</p>  <p>  The 32 recommendations made by the Expert Group to accelerate the delivery of Traveller accommodation are comprehensive and wide ranging, and include proposals aimed at:  </p>  <p>  -  addressing research deficiencies, including how information is gathered and used; </p>  <p>  -  removing any potential delays and obstacles in the planning system in terms of delivery; </p>  <p>  -  increasing resources and delivery capacity; and</p>  <p>  -  strengthening governance arrangements.</p>  <p>  I am currently considering the report and recommendations of the Expert Group, with a view to implementing appropriate actions and policies that will improve the delivery of Traveller accommodation nationally. The priority is to ensure that full use is made of the increasing level of funding available for investment in Traveller accommodation. The report has been published and is available on my Department's website at the following link: </p>  <p>  www.housing.gov.ie/sites/default/files/publications/files/2019_july_expert_review_group_traveller_accommodation-final_reportrt_00.pdf.</p>  <p>  In the context of the 32 recommendations, my Department is also liaising with key stakeholders on issues arising. The Expert Group&rsquo;s report has also been shared with the National Traveller Accommodation Consultative Committee and members of the Committee are considering the report and will provide submissions to my Department, as appropriate.  </p>  <p>  I am working to complete this process as soon as possible and set out a road map for implementation of agreed recommendations, with a view to accelerating and increasing the delivery of much needed Traveller accommodation, drawing on the increasing funding available. </p></reply>

This funding is being made available in areas where local authorities have demonstrated a requirement for affordable housing and the viability to deliver such housing from their sites. </p><p>The first call for proposals under the SSF in June 2018 was specifically aimed at providing funding opportunities to 11 local authorities, where it was identified that the greatest affordability pressures existed.  Approval in principle was issued in December 2018 for funding for 10 infrastructure projects in Dublin and Cork with &euro;43 million funding, which will support the delivery of 1,400 affordable homes. Details of these projects can be found on the Rebuilding Ireland website at  .</p><p>Following the first call under the SSF, and in order to target affordable interventions, local authorities were asked to complete financial/economic assessments of each of their sites to assess whether the provision of affordable homes was economically viable.  Local authorities were also asked to assess the broader housing affordability within their area. </p><p>A second call for proposals under the SSF issued to 19 local authorities (including Westmeath County Council) in April 2019 and was based on the aforementioned economic assessments.  31 submissions were received from 15 local authorities.  Westmeath County Council elected not to make a submission under this SSF call.Approval in Principle was issued in August 2019 for the funding of 25 infrastructure projects in 13 local authorities across 9 counties with &euro;84 million funding.

In parallel to the announcement local authorities were invited to submit their bids for the funding schemes or projects in their functional areas, with the deadline for receipt of proposals set as 14 March 2019.</p>  <p>  The new multi-annual programme includes Measure 6 &ndash; Community Connection (Water and Wastewater) Networks. This new measure facilitates the continued expansion of the coverage of piped water supplies and central wastewater collection systems by extension off the public (Irish Water) network where it is technically and economically viable to do so. </p>  <p>  Mayo County Council made a number of bids under Measure 6, including a proposal for the Downpatrick Head Group Water Scheme. </p>  <p>  An Expert Panel was put in place to support the evaluation process. In addition to providing an expert perspective, the Panel brought independence, openness and transparency to the bids evaluation process which was done on a national prioritised basis. The Expert Panel&rsquo;s membership included Departmental, stakeholder and independent representations.  </p>  <p>  The Expert Panel made recommendations to the Department on the suitability of schemes and projects for funding based on objective criteria, which are set out in the Framework document issued to local authorities when requesting proposals. Nationally local authorities made bids for funding for 41 Community Water Connection projects under measure 6 (a). The Expert Panel concluded that 24 of these bids fulfilled the objective criteria set out in the Framework document and recommended them for funding under the programme.</p>  <p>  The Panel, in considering the Downpatrick Head Group Water Scheme bid, concluded that: </p>  <p>  '... based on collectively considering the bid for this scheme, against the criteria for the measure in the Framework including the number of houses benefiting (with a low density of houses involved), estimated cost and unit cost per house, this proposed scheme is unviable. The Panel recommends that the local authority engages with the promoters to consider alternative lower cost solutions (e.g. private wells for which, subject to terms and conditions, a separate grant is available)'.</p>  <p>  In considering the recommendations of the Expert Panel the Minister accepted these in full when announcing the approvals and allocations under the multi-annual rural water programme on 15 October 2019.</p>  <p>  I understand at present, that officials from Mayo County Council are considering alternative options that may assist the Downpatrick Head Group Water Scheme with a substitute solution.</p></reply>

It was intended to restore all designated raised bogs within 3 cycles, with the first cycle operating for the duration of the Management Plan. </p>  <p>  This programme can now be accelerated due to the announcement in Budget 2020 of &euro;5m for peatlands restoration. This funding will allow for restoration measures to be undertaken on approximately 1,800 hectares in 2020 on up to 9 raised bog designated sites across 7 counties and the installation of an Eddy Covariance Flux tower on a bog to measure surface to atmospheric fluxes (CO2, Methane, turbulent energy, moisture etc.). 23 other raised bog designated sites have been identified for restoration works over the next 5 years or so under the programme. </p></reply>

The Wildlife Acts afford protection to a range of habitats and species and provide for regulation and control of activities that impinge on biodiversity, such as hunting and trade.</p>  <p>  The legislative framework in place to protect our natural heritage is further strengthened by the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011 SI No 477/2011, which also fall under the remit of my Department. These Regulations transpose the EU Birds Directive and the EU Habitats Directive into national law, and provide for protection of certain habitats and species across the European Union, giving a framework for specific measures to be taken to target areas of concern in each Member State. </p>  <p>  The main instruments provided for are the designation of Special Protection Areas (SPA), aimed at the protection of threatened species of birds, and Special Areas of Conservation (SAC), aimed at protecting other animal species and habitats. Ireland is required under the terms of the EU Birds Directive to designate Special Protection Areas (SPAs) for the protection of endangered species of wild birds. </p>  <p>  A programme to identify and designate SPA sites in Ireland commenced in 1985 and a review of the Irish network of SPA sites identified at that time a number of sites that required re-notification. The necessary SPA survey work was undertaken and all of Ireland&rsquo;s list of over 150 SPAs have been notified to landowners and published in a fashion that is consistent with the requirements of the Birds Directive.</p>  <p>  The SPA referred to in the question was selected for designation as it met a number of conditions relating to protection of listed species. Sites can only be designated on solid scientific grounds, where there is evidence-based justification for doing so. </p>  <p>  There are no plans in my Department, at this time, to undertake further scientific surveys in the SPA concerned. </p></reply>
