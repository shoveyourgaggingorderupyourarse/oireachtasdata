To achieve this ambition, several renewable energy generation technologies will be required including onshore wind, solar and offshore wind. This multi-technology approach not only increases our renewable energy production capacity, but also enhances our energy security by diversifying our sources of renewable energy.   The 2019 Climate Action Plan included indicative additional installed capacities of 1.5GW of solar, approximately 4GW of additional onshore wind and 3.5GW of offshore wind by 2030. The Programme for Government has since increased the offshore target to 5GW by 2030, and a long-term plan to take advantage of at least 30GW of floating wind thereafter. </p>  <p>  All three technologies will be supported via competitive auctions under the Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS). Other renewable energy technologies are also eligible for support. The first RESS auction, RESS 1, was held last year and awarded supports to approximately 80 new onshore wind and solar projects. The second RESS auction, RESS 2, is planned to be held next year. My officials are working to finalise the auction design and my aim is to accelerate the current auction timetable and deliver a second onshore RESS auction.</p>  <p>  My Department is also developing the first of a series of RESS auctions specific to offshore wind. The terms and conditions of this first auction, ORESS 1, will shortly be published for public consultation. At least two further offshore wind auctions are planned this decade to achieve our 2030 offshore targets.</p>  <p>   </p></reply>

This landmark legislation sets a legally-binding framework for Ireland to achieve the national climate objective of a transition to a climate resilient, biodiversity rich, environmentally sustainable and climate neutral economy by 2050 at the latest. Under the new legislation, my Department will prepare for Government a Climate Action Plan, which  must be updated every year so that our actions keep step with the trajectory required to achieve our targets. In addition, a national long-term climate action strategy will be prepared at least every 5 years.</p>  <p>  The Department will also have a lead role in transforming our energy sector to a high-renewable, low-carbon system. This will include achieving 70% renewable electricity through increased onshore and offshore wind, solar, microgeneration, and grid system infrastructure. We will also need to reduce the use of fossil fuels in our homes and make them more energy efficient. This will mean a large-scale roll-out of home retrofits and the installation of heat pumps. </p>  <p>  The circular economy offers an alternative to today&rsquo;s linear - &lsquo;take-make-waste&rsquo; - model of production and consumption, in which we extract great quantities of natural resources to make things that we may use only once before throwing them away. In a circular economy, resources are kept in use for as long as possible, the maximum value is extracted from them while in use, then recovered and repurposed into new products and materials at the end of each lifecycle. The forthcoming All-of-Government Circular Economy Strategy and related legislation will provide an overall national policy framework for the circular transition and will include measures to improve Ireland&rsquo;s circularity performance.</p>  <p>  My Department is also supporting universal access to high-speed broadband for better connected communities with service providers properly regulated, and strengthened cyber security. A fully connected digital economy and society will enhance Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness, lead to the creation of more quality employment opportunities and provide a better quality of life for individuals, communities and businesses.</p></reply>

It is assisted in its statutory role by EirGrid which is responsible for the day-to-day management of the electricity transmission system.   The CRU has advised me that they have identified specific challenges to ensuring continued electricity security of supply, which they are currently in the process of addressing. </p>  <p>  These challenges include lower than expected availability of some existing power stations; anticipated new power stations not being developed as planned; expected growth in demand for electricity including due to the growth of data centres; and the expected closure of power stations that make up approximately 25% of conventional electricity generation capacity over the coming years. </p>  <p>  These challenges do pose an increased risk of the electricity system not being able to meet demand. However, to date, I would note that electricity customers have not been impacted. There is a range of actions being taken by the CRU and EirGrid to ensure this continues to be the case. </p>  <p>  The actions being progressed include maximising the availability of existing generators; development of new generation capacity, including temporary generation capacity in advance of winter 2022; making changes to the grid connection rules for data centres; and working with large energy consumers to, where possible, reduce their electricity demand during peak periods. </p>  <p>  In relation to this winter, I understand that the key challenge relates to a number of power stations that are not currently in operation due to a combination of planned maintenance and unplanned outages.

Surveying is underway in these areas and it is anticipated that they will be provided with access to high speed broadband under the National Broadband Plan in 2023.</p><p>While substantial progress has been made to date, the Covid 19 pandemic has had an impact on the delivery of the fibre network resulting in delays on delivery of aspects of the programme. My Department has worked closely with NBI to put in place a remedial plan under the Contract to address the impacts of the Covid 19 pandemic on the project for 2021. The impact on future years continues to be assessed.  NBI is putting in place mitigation measures to address the impact of the pandemic on the programme to date. These include</p><p>- Increasing the rate of pole replacement and duct remediation per month</p><p>- Bringing in more resources to NBI</p><p>- Purchasing more materials earlier</p><p>- Bringing in more subcontractors</p><p>These measures are helping to address delays and ensure that the National Broadband Ireland's build programme gets back on track and is building momentum month on month.</p><p>I understand that commercial operators in Dun Laoghaire are also continuing to upgrade their broadband networks as part of ongoing work.</p></reply>

The report also highlights that a number of sectors of society are assessed to be poorly engaged with digital technologies, including those persons who are older, have lower levels of education, lower incomes, and live in rural areas; as well as smaller businesses and farms.Digital inclusion is important to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s households, businesses and public sector are prepared for the opportunities and challenges of digitalisation. The report highlights the wide range of State policies focused on digital technologies as well as a range of State, business and community programmes and supports designed to bridge gaps in access to digital technologies by individuals and businesses.  </p><p>Ensuring that everyone can fully participate in a digital society and economy requires a coordinated suite of actions across Government. The NESC report will help inform the new National Digital Strategy which is currently under development.</p><p>Access to reliable connectivity is a pre-requisite for inclusion. The National Broadband Plan (NBP), together with investment by commercial operators, will ensure that reliable high speed broadband connectivity will be available for every household and business in Ireland. The State led NBP intervention will deliver high speed and future proofed broadband network within the Intervention Area, which covers 1.1 million people living and working in over 544,000 premises, including almost 100,000 businesses and farms along with 695 schools.</p></reply>

A summary report of the submissions received has been published on my Department's website.</p><p>While the primary aim of a micro-generation scheme is to enable a household to meet its own electricity needs, it is intended that a suitable payment for excess electricity generated on site and exported to the grid will be available to all renewables self-consumers later this year, subject to regulatory arrangements, and in line with transposition of Articles 21 and 22 of the recast Renewable Energy Directive. My Department is engaging with the Office of Parliamentary Counsel on transposing these Articles into Irish law and it is envisaged that this will be achieved before year end 2021. </p><p>It is expected that the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) will publish a draft framework in the coming weeks which will outline the details, including eligibility criteria and timescales for introduction, of the Clean Export Guarantee (CEG) payment for exported renewable electricity. This framework will introduce an obligation on all electricity suppliers to offer remuneration to their customers, by way of a payment, for excess renewable electricity exported to the grid by eligible micro- and small-scale generators. This would give effect to the above-mentioned articles and allow for the commencement of export payments to micro- and small-scale generators, by their suppliers.</p></reply>

Impacts include challenges with mobilisation of key contractors with restrictions on operations and supply chain and logistic delays, both nationally and internationally. In addition, there have been challenges with the recruitment of key personnel as NBI and its contractors scale up, including challenges associated with on-boarding and training people. Inevitably, like many other organisations, NBI and contractor staffs are at risk of contracting Covid 19 or may have had to restrict their movements as a result of being a close contact.    My Department has worked closely with NBI to put in place a remedial plan under the Contract to address the impacts of the Covid 19 pandemic on the project for 2021. The impact on future years continues to be assessed.  NBI is putting in place mitigation measures to address the impact of the pandemic on the programme to date. These include</p>  <p>  - Increasing the rate of pole replacement and duct remediation per month</p>  <p>  - Bringing in more resources to NBI</p>  <p>  - Purchasing more materials earlier</p>  <p>  - Bringing in more subcontractors</p>  <p>  While delivery of the Programme is the responsibility of NBI under the Contract, my Department continues to monitor delivery very closely. In parallel with the ongoing oversight of the contract, my Department has also been working with the 31 Local Authorities, the County and City Management Agency (CCMA), the Roads Maintenance Office (RMO), Broadband Officers and other Government Departments, where appropriate, to ensure that any possible barriers that might delay the rollout are addressed as soon as possible. This also includes engagement with other bodies such as Transport Infrastructure Ireland, Irish Rail and ComReg.  </p>  <p>  The contract makes provision for dealing with delays to delivery of the network arising from unprecedented events such as the Covid-19 pandemic and NBI can seek additional time to meet contract milestones. In those circumstances no penalties would apply. In other circumstances, the contract provides that penalty provisions relating to delays to delivery of the network are applicable with respect to any delays that occur from the end of contract year 2 (i.e. from 1 February 2022).</p></reply>

It is assisted in its statutory role by EirGrid which is responsible for the day-to-day management of the electricity transmission system.   The CRU has advised me that they have identified specific challenges to ensuring continued electricity security of supply, which they are currently in the process of addressing. </p>  <p>  These challenges include lower than expected availability of some existing power stations; anticipated new power stations not being developed as planned; expected growth in demand for electricity including due to the growth of data centres; and the expected closure of power stations that make up approximately 25% of conventional electricity generation capacity over the coming years. </p>  <p>  There is a range of actions being taken by the CRU and EirGrid to ensure security of electricity supply over the coming winter and years ahead. The actions being progressed include maximising the availability of existing generators; development of new generation capacity &ndash; including temporary generation capacity in advance of winter 2022; making changes to the grid connection rules for data centres; and working with large energy consumers to, where possible, reduce their electricity demand during peak periods. </p>  <p>  In June 2018 the &lsquo;Government Statement on the Role of Data Centres in Ireland&rsquo;s Enterprise Policy&rsquo; was published, which sets out the strategic importance of data centres to Ireland&rsquo;s overarching enterprise policy and attracting foreign investment in the ICT sector. The statement acknowledges that, as large consumers of electricity, data centres also pose challenges to the capacity of our electricity grid and the future planning and operation of a sustainable power system. </p>  <p>  In June, the CRU published a proposed direction to EirGrid and ESB Networks that would require each of the system operators to prioritise data centre connections based on location, the availability of on-site generation and flexibility in reducing demand when required. The consultation process is now closed and the CRU is considering the responses received.</p></reply>

The scheme delivers a range of energy efficiency measures free of charge to lower income households vulnerable to energy poverty. To date over 143,000 homes have received free upgrades under the scheme leaving them better able to afford to heat their homes to an adequate level. The approximate average value of the energy efficiency measures provided per household was &euro;17,100 at the end of July 2021.A range of home energy improvements can be funded under this scheme. The upgrades that are recommended for any given property depend on many factors including age, size, type and condition of the property. Each eligible home is assessed on a case-by-case basis by SEAI&rsquo;s managing agent. This involves a survey of the home which determines the upgrades that can be installed and funded. The home is subsequently allocated to a contractor which carries out a further assessment of the property to confirm the initial recommendation.  A programme of work is then agreed between the contractor and SEAI.

It will also help Ireland to move towards our 70% renewable electricity target by 2030. A resilient and well-connected energy infrastructure is vital for Ireland's economic well-being and the ability to respond to the future needs of energy consumers.</p>  <p>  The option of undergrounding the North-South interconnector has been comprehensively assessed on several occasions. Most recently, the key finding from the International Expert Commission's report of October 2018 was that an overhead line remains the most appropriate option for this critical electricity infrastructure.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, I decided to commission a further short review to assess if the overall finding from the 2018 report remains valid. Terms of reference for this study were published on my Department's website on 21 April. On 7 May, my Department initiated a procurement process to appoint an independent expert to undertake the review. International consultants have now been appointed subject to final contract compliance requirements being fulfilled. My officials are in regular contact with the selected consultants. I therefore expect that the review will commence shortly and will be completed later this year.</p></reply>

Recognising this urgency, the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021 commits Ireland to  achieve a climate neutral economy by no later than 2050, and provide a 51% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 (compared to 2018 levels). It also establishes a  significantly strengthened climate governance  framework to support delivery of these targets. </p>  <p>  My objective over the coming weeks is to agree an ambitious and comprehensive set of climate actions, through the Climate Action Plan 2021, that will position us to meet our new climate targets. This will mean more renewable energy, decreased transport emissions, changes in how we heat our homes and how we grow our food and look after our land. These steps will be challenging, but they will also create new opportunities.International cooperation and coordination is also needed to limit global temperature rises. In this context, I will lead Ireland&rsquo;s Climate Delegation for COP26. Ireland is committed to engaging constructively in the finalisation of the Paris Rulebook and will also continue to advocate for climate action to be informed by the best available science.  </p></reply>

It is estimated that there are over 16,200 life years lost, while many people also experience a poor quality of life due to the associated short, and long-term health impacts of this form of pollution. It is in this context that I have decided to introduce new standards for all solid fuels, which will serve to remove the most polluting from the Irish market   I am also conscious that some householders face the risk of fuel poverty, and burning solid fuel is the main or only way they have of heating their homes. However, it should be noted that better quality fuel burns more efficiently, and actually represents better value for money. The Domestic Fuels Comparison of Energy Costs report, published quarterly by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, consistently shows that low smoke coal is the most efficient type of coal in terms of cost per units of heat produced, and the second most cost-efficient overall.</p>  <p>  Lowest income households are often impacted the most from the health impacts of burning smoky fuels. The highest pollution levels recorded on cold, still evenings are regularly concentrated in areas dependent on solid fuels. The goal over the lifetime of this government is to provide support to retrofit these homes, and in the interim, to ensure they can be heated in a way that improves public health.</p></reply>

Impacts include challenges with mobilisation of key contractors with restrictions on operations and supply chain and logistic delays both nationally and internationally. In addition, there have been challenges with the recruitment of key personnel as NBI and its contractors scale up, including challenges associated with on-boarding and training people. Inevitably, like many other organisations, NBI and contractor staffs are at risk of contracting Covid 19 or may have had to restrict their movements as a result of being a close contact. </p>  <p>  My Department has worked closely with NBI to put in place a remedial plan under the Contract to address the impacts of the Covid 19 pandemic on the project for 2021. The impact on future years continues to be assessed.  NBI is putting in place mitigation measures to address the impact of the pandemic on the programme to date. These include</p>  <p>  - Increasing the rate of pole replacement and duct remediation per month</p>  <p>  - Bringing in more resources to NBI</p>  <p>  - Purchasing more materials earlier</p>  <p>  - Bringing in more subcontractors</p>  <p>  In line with the Programme for Government, NBI and my Department are also engaged in a review of potential measures that can be taken to accelerate the network rollout in parallel with the measures required to mitigate delays arising as a result of Covid-19. My Department continues to engage with NBI to explore the feasibility of accelerating aspects of the NBP rollout to establish the possibility of bringing forward premises which are currently scheduled in years 6 and 7 of the current plan to an earlier date. However, the primary focus must be on addressing the delays which have arisen and ensuring that the National Broadband Ireland build programme gets back on track and is building momentum month on month.</p>  <p>Despite the unprecedented challenges presented by the Covid-19 pandemic, National Broadband Ireland has made steady progress on delivery of the new high speed fibre broadband network under the National Broadband Plan. I am advised by National Broadband Ireland that as of 3   September over 251,000 premises have been surveyed across all counties. Main Fibre Build works are underway in 25 Deployment Areas covering over 105,000 premises. </p>  <p>  I am advised by NBI that, as of 3 September over 14,500 homes are passed and available for connection in Counties Cork, Cavan, Galway, Limerick and Monaghan.  In addition, over 7,000 premises can also pre-order via retail service providers (RSPs) in Counties Cork, Cavan, Galway, Limerick and Monaghan and get a connection in the coming months. As the programme continues to build momentum this figure is expected to grow month on month. </p>  <p>  While the Covid-19 pandemic has created many challenges, NBI has also faced many more complexities working with existing networks and subcontractors than initially envisaged. This is due to the sheer scale and complexity of rolling out fibre to the home in a rural environment. This has included significant tree trimming to ensure cable can be placed on overhead poles, remediation of ducting that has been in place for many decades and the co-ordination of hundreds of contracting crews while addressing the many issues arising week on week which could not have been foreseen until the build crews are actually on the ground.</p></reply>

A new National Retrofit Plan will be published in quarter 4 of this year. The plan is designed to address barriers to energy efficiency investments in four key areas: customer proposition and demand generation, financing and affordability, supplier capacity, and governance. </p>  <p>  SEAI grant schemes will be a central element of the Government's approach to achieving our retrofit targets.  It is intended to launch a new National Retrofit Scheme focused on achieving B2 retrofits later this year.  The existing SEAI grant schemes will be aligned with the National Retrofit Scheme as appropriate.  </p>  <p>  There are currently just over 7,000 homeowners on the Warmer Homes Scheme work programme. Information on waiting time by county is not held. However, SEAI data indicates that for homes completed to date in 2021, the average time from application to completion was approximately 26 months countrywide. The average wait times have increased significantly in 2021 due to the extensive COVID-19 related restrictions on construction activity.  Every effort is being made to maximise activity now that construction activity in the residential sector has recommenced.</p>  <p>  The information requested in relation to applications currently being processed on a county basis across other SEAI schemes is not readily available. I have asked the SEAI to compile the available data and forward it to the Deputy as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The fund will benefit post offices over an 18 month period from 1 July.</p><p>There are no plans to bring forward a public service obligation at this time. An Post is a commercial semi-state company and it is longstanding Government policy that postal services will not be directly subsidised by the taxpayer. The Government remains fully committed to a sustainable An Post and post office network as a key component of the economic and social infrastructure throughout Ireland. A long-term low interest loan of &euro;30m was provided to the company in December 2017, of which &euro;15m was to support and protect the renewal of the post office network.As with any business An Post and individual post offices need to continue to develop commercial strategies to enable them to grow and maintain their relevance for current and future customers.</p><p>The Government continues to provide significant business to An Post through the Department of Social Protection&rsquo;s Social Welfare contract and the National Treasury Management Agency business.

Since 2000, over 450,000 homeowners have upgraded their homes with support from these schemes, representing nearly one home in four across the country. This has resulted in warmer, healthier and more comfortable homes that are easier to heat and light.    Some &euro;221.5 million in capital funding has been provided this year for SEAI residential and community retrofit programmes. This represents an 82% increase on the 2020 allocation and is the largest amount ever for the schemes. This allocation has facilitated the expansion and improvement of existing SEAI grant schemes and the introduction of new initiatives. </p>  <p>  To date in 2021, over 6,500 homes have been retrofitted with support from SEAI schemes.  It is important to note that the number of retrofits was negatively impacted by the extensive COVID-19 related restrictions on construction activity between January and mid-April.  In addition, the number of retrofits supported has also been negatively impacted by challenges associated with availability and longer lead times for materials.  It is anticipated that SEAI initiatives aimed at driving demand for retrofits will encourage further uptake of retrofit grants for the remainder of the year and into 2022. </p></reply>

The targets are to retrofit 500,000 homes to a Building Energy Rating of B2 and to install 400,000 heat pumps in existing buildings by 2030.     This year, &euro;221.5 million in capital funding has been provided for SEAI residential and community retrofit schemes. This represents an 82% increase on the 2020 allocation and is the largest amount ever for the schemes. SEAI offers grants of up to 35% of the cost of home energy upgrades to homeowners as well as free home energy upgrades to people at risk of energy poverty. Output targets for grant schemes are set as part of the annual planning process. </p>  <p>  The new National Retrofit Plan will be published in quarter 4 of this year. The plan is designed to address barriers to energy efficiency investments in four key areas: demand generation, financing and affordability, supply chain capacity, and governance. The plan will set out a range of measures to support the achievement of our residential retrofit targets. We will continue to track and monitor progress against the targets, evaluate the impact of measures introduced and make adjustments to the plan as necessary.</p>  <p>  My Department is also engaging with Department of Finance and the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland in relation to the development of a residential retrofit loan guarantee scheme. The loan guarantee, which is co-funded by the EU, will enable credit institutions to offer loans with reduced interest rates and make comprehensive home energy efficiency upgrades more affordable to consumers. As a result, households will be able to enjoy more comfortable and healthier homes with a lower carbon footprint. The recently published Housing for All plan also commits the development of a proposal in relation to a new Local Authority Energy Efficiency Retrofit Loan for homeowners, supported by the Housing Finance Agency.</p></reply>

The REC definition employed in RESS was largely derived from the REC definition provided through the EU&rsquo;s Clean Energy Package, with particular reference to Article 22 of the recast Renewable Energy Directive (EU) 2018/2001. Accordingly, under the definition adopted in RESS a REC must be open to all potential local members based on objective, transparent and non-discriminatory criteria and must be effectively controlled by shareholders or members that are located in the proximity of the project, which underlines the key role of local participation and decision making in the energy projects. Members of a REC can include individuals, SMEs, local community organisations and local authorities, thus facilitating broader sources of equity funding than savings from local residents alone. </p>  <p>  A minimum number of members is not defined in the recast Renewable Energy Directive, which is currently in the process of being transposed into Irish law. I am not inclined to define a minimum number through the transposition process underway in recognition of the fact that no two communities are alike, particularly in terms of size. What is more important than the number of members a REC can have is that its primary purpose is to provide environmental, economic or social community benefits for its shareholders or members or for the local areas where it operates, rather than financial profits.</p></reply>

Key actions include initiatives to achieve climate-neutral, highly energy efficient and sustainable data centres by no later than 2030.</p><p>In 2020, data centres were approximately 11% of the total electricity used in Ireland, demonstrating that the impact of data centres on Ireland&rsquo;s energy demand, and therefore emissions in the electricity sector, is significant. EirGrid, in their Generation Capacity Statement 2020-2029, project that demand from data centres could account for 27% of all demand by 2029.</p><p>In June 2021, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) published a proposed Direction to the electricity system operators related to Data Centre grid connection, for consultation. This included a number of options for managing data centre connection demand. A final decision will be issued by the CRU in due course.</p><p>Earlier this year, EirGrid carried out a public consultation on 'Shaping our Electricity Future'. The aim is to make the electricity grid stronger and more flexible so that it can carry significantly more renewable generation as well as meet increasing demand from high volume energy users such as data centres. This may include potential geographic restrictions or incentives of large demand customers closer to the generation of power, potentially giving a more regional balance of locations. Publication of the outcome of the consultation is expected in Q4 of this year.</p></reply>

A summary report of the submissions received has been published on my Department's website.</p><p>While the primary aim of a micro-generation scheme is to enable a household to meet its own electricity needs, it is intended that a suitable payment for excess electricity generated on site and exported to the grid will be available to all renewables self-consumers later this year, subject to regulatory arrangements, and in line with transposition of Articles 21 and 22 of the recast Renewable Energy Directive. My Department is engaging with the Office of Parliamentary Counsel on transposing these Articles into Irish law and it is envisaged that this will be achieved before year end 2021. </p><p>It is expected that the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) will publish a draft framework in the coming weeks which will outline the details, including eligibility criteria and timescales for introduction, of the Clean Export Guarantee (CEG) payment for exported renewable electricity. This framework will introduce an obligation on all electricity suppliers to offer remuneration to their customers, by way of a payment, for excess renewable electricity exported to the grid by eligible micro- and small-scale generators. This would give effect to the above-mentioned articles and allow for the commencement of export payments to micro- and small-scale generators, by their suppliers.</p></reply>

TII ultimately delivers the National Roads Programme in line with Project Ireland 2040, the National Planning Framework (NPF) and the NDP.</p><p><b>Background</b></p><p>Within the overall context of Project Ireland 2040, the NDP was developed to underpin the successful implementation of the NPF.  This provides the strategic and financial framework for the National Roads Programme for the period from 2018 to 2027. The focus of TII's activities is, accordingly, being directed towards the development of the major national road improvement schemes that are included in the NDP, along with the maintenance of the existing national road network.</p><p>It should be noted that the NDP is currently under review, in compliance with the Programme for Government and taking account of the different circumstances now prevailing. Work has been undertaken within my Department to contribute to this review, with funding for national roads being finalised and a prioritisation of projects to follow.</p><p>The strategic transport issues for all regions, including for national roads, are being considered in the context of the ongoing review of the nationwide NDP. As part of this review for national roads, I am focused on how to help achieve compact growth, removal of congestion within our towns, and decarbonisation, among other objectives. Towns such as Castlemartyr will be considered in this light.</p><p>The review of the NDP is a broad and wide ranging review. It seeks to strengthen the alignment with the National Planning Framework as well as take into account key developments since the launch of the current NDP in 2018. It will examine developments in the context of each National Strategic Outcome. It will take into account the commitments set out in the Programme for Government. It will also take into account the impacts of Brexit and Covid-19 as well as reflect key policy developments in areas such as Climate Change and the completion of Regional, Economic and Spatial Strategies for the three Assembly Regions.</p><p>I would also like to highlight that all national road projects, including those listed in the NDP or any revision to the NDP, are subject to applicable statutory approval and compliance with the Public Spending Code.</p><p>Furthermore, the improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of each local authority in accordance with the provisions of Section 13 of the Roads Act 1993. Works on those roads are funded from Councils&rsquo; own resources supplemented by State road grants.  </p><p>Under the current NDP, there has been a significant increase in Exchequer funding for regional and local roads, particularly in the last four years. Funding is not yet at the level needed for the adequate protection and renewal of regional and local roads and so for this reason, the primary focus for capital investment continues to be the protection and renewal of the network with some limited investment in road improvement projects including a number of bypass/relief projects such as the Portlaoise Southern Distributor Road, Dingle Relief Road, Sligo Western Distributor Road, Sallins Bypass, Tralee Northern Relief Road, Athy Southern Distributor Road and Shannon Crossing/Killaloe Bypass/R494 Upgrade, Athenry Relief Road and the Edenderry Inner Relief Road.</p><p><b>Enhanced Regional Accessibility </b></p><p>A core priority under the NPF is to enhance and upgrade accessibility between urban centres of population and their regions, in parallel with fostering compact growth of urban centres. This has an important role to play in maximising the growth potential of the regional urban centres and the economy as a whole. Substantial progress has been made since 2000 in improving the road linkages between Dublin and most of the other urban areas and regions. Under the current NDP, the objective is to complete those linkages so that every region and all the major urban areas, particularly those in the North-West, are linked to Dublin by a high-quality road network.</p><p><b>N25 Congestion &amp;amp; Castlemartyr Bypass</b></p><p>The proposed N25 Castlemartyr Bypass was not included amongst those national road projects identified for development during the period of the current NDP.  However, in 2020 Cork County Council, which is the road authority for the area, completed the review of a Feasibility Report in relation to a relief road at Castlemartyr, Co. Cork, which considered constraints and issues in the area. The study indicates significant constraints will need to be examined in the planning of such a scheme and that a Compulsory Purchase Order (CPO) and an Environmental Impact Assessment Report (EIAR) would be required. </p><p>The report also indicates that a feasible Outer Bypass would have to be progressed as a Major Scheme, which is not provided for in the current NDP.</p><p>In the meantime, TII has requested Cork County Council to further assess whether an inner relief road that represents value for money, could be a more feasible option than a major bypass.  Geophysical and geotechnical surveys have been procured.</p><p>TII has provided an allocation of &euro;100,000 to the Council for 2021 to progress this further study on scheme feasibility.</p><p><b>Possible Benefits</b></p><p>The Castlemartyr Bypass scheme, if found to be viable and feasible, could remove a significant portion of national through traffic from the village, thereby improving safety and facilitating the reliability of journey times for public transport. It could also lead to environmental benefits with an improvement in the air quality and noise in the village itself.

This investment will help support the planned delivery of around 1,000 kilometres of improved walking and cycling infrastructure by 2025 as well as additional investment in Greenways.</p>  <p>  As we emerge from a difficult time of COVID-19 restrictions, I am cognisant of the fact that we also have a major opportunity to change the way that we travel in this country. The ongoing delivery of Active Travel infrastructure across the country will be important for us to implement changes to encourage more people to walk/cycle more, which will not only to ease traffic congestion in our urban areas but also reduce carbon emissions from private vehicles. </p>  <p>  As Minister for Transport I have responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to public transport infrastructure. The National Transport Authority (NTA) has responsibility for the development, implementation and oversight of public and sustainable transport infrastructure, allocating the funding provided by my Department at project level and working in conjunction with the relevant local authorities to ensure that projects are delivered as intended.</p>  <p>  In 2021, the NTA allocated just over &euro;240 million to active travel infrastructure projects in Dublin, the Greater Dublin Area and the regional cities. This funding will support the addition of 233 projects to the NTA's urban investment programme this year, bringing the total to over 450 projects.</p>  <p>  In addition, 2021 has seen the launch of the first ever major active travel investment programme for rural Ireland. &euro;72.8m was allocated by the NTA to the 19 remaining local authorities, which is greater than the entire 2019 funding allocation for walking and cycling. The NTA had initially earmarked &euro;50m for this scheme but was increased due to the volume of project proposals being developed by local authorities. </p>  <p>  In March I was delighted to launch the Safe Routes to School Programme in conjunction with the NTA and An Taisce's Green Schools Programme, which will see the roll out of safer walking and cycling routes within communities, aiming to alleviate congestion at the school gates and increase the number of students who walk or cycling to school by providing the necessary infrastructure. I was delighted with the uptake of this Programme, with applications from over 900 schools received. 170 schools around the country will receive funding under the first round of the Safe Routes to School Programme; I would like to note that the remaining schools who applied initially for the Programme will not be required to reapply as all schools which applied will come into the Programme on a rolling basis.</p>  <p>  With the allocation of additional funding comes the problem of local authorities actually having the capacity to spend it and deliver the projects as planned. To this end, earlier this year I wrote to the County and City Management Association to advise that around 250 additional staff would be allocated to local authorities around the country to work on the delivery of Active Travel projects. I understand that recruitment processes are ongoing and I hope to see these staff fully in place by early 2022. </p>  <p>  The increase in funding and resources signal a commitment by Government to accelerate the provision of Active Travel infrastructure around Ireland, and I look forward to the delivery of these projects as a matter of priority.</p></reply>

This has resulted in a capacity expansion of around 30% as compared to before and will be very welcome I am sure to passengers on the Line in the coming months and years. There are further plans under consideration to boost capacity even further through the provision of a turn-back at Stephen&rsquo;s Green for example and Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) is considering options in that regard.</p><p>Secondly, there is the ongoing planning and design of extensions to the network as referenced in the existing NDP. Last year I was delighted to launch the first public consultation in relation to the proposed Luas Finglas extension. Work has continued on the development of a preferred route for that extension and I understand a second public consultation is expected to be held toward the end of the year. Luas Lucan is at a much earlier stage of development and I understand TII is undertaking a feasibility study with regard to that proposal.  </p><p>Finally, there is the ongoing review of the Greater Dublin Area Transport Strategy which the National Transport Authority launched late last year. The Strategy will address the future requirements for public transport in the Greater Dublin Area, including the requirement for Luas, both in terms of meeting the capacity requirements on existing lines, as well as the need for new Luas corridors.A public consultation on the revised strategy will be held later in the year with a final strategy submitted for my approval in early 2022.</p></reply>

This funding stream constitutes the first ever major Active Travel investment programme for rural Ireland and will support the roll out of high-quality active travel infrastructure in rural towns and villages across the country. </p>  <p>  My Department is also working with Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) who are leading on the development of a National Cycle Network which will both map the existing Active Travel infrastructure around the country, including Greenways, and identify gaps which will inform future planning decisions for walking and cycling infrastructure in our cities, towns, villages and rural areas. It aims to provide a basis for the delivery of a high-quality, integrated Active Travel network which will seek to connect footpaths, cycle tracks and Greenways, potentially via improving Active Travel infrastructure on existing rural, local, regional and national roads. This has the potential to also identify areas where reallocation of road space would be more appropriate than the development of new infrastructure, such as on more lightly trafficked roads in rural areas. Following a period of public consultation next Spring, the final National Cycle Network Strategy is due to be delivered to the Department in Q4 2022.</p></reply>

Since May 2021, the RSA has been returning to delivering tests for all customers, while continuing to prioritise critical frontline workers who need to drive as part of their job (this does not include commuting to their job). In the interest of fairness, the RSA targeted test appointments to those waiting longest who are ready and eligible to take the test</p>  <p>  The service continues to operate under restrictions in the interest of making it safe while there is an ongoing presence of Covid. </p>  <p>  The RSA intend to increase the number of tests from 6 to 7 per tester per day from late September.</p>  <p>  The Road Safety Authority received sanction to hire 40 new temporary testers, in addition to 36 they were sanctioned to retain or rehire in 2020. These new testers have completed their training and are now conducting live tests since July 2021. Sanction has also been granted to recruit a further 40.</p>  <p>   An extra 10 temporary test centres have been opened (and are effectively an expansion of existing locations or replacing unsuitable locations), and a further 9 locations have been expanded within the existing premises, to accommodate more testers. </p>  <p>  The Driver Theory Test service has significantly increased its capacity since it reopened in June 2021. </p>  <p>  The number of tests provided has now increased from an average pre Covid19 level of 15,000 to over 25,000 appointments monthly. This number continues to increase and almost 50,000 tests were provided during the month of August.</p>  <p>  The RSA has also been working to extend its online theory testing service. The new offering will see up to 10,000 online theory tests available for all categories of vehicles per month. Tests are available on a first-come-first-served basis with the new online service becoming more widely available later in the year. </p>  <p>   However, it is disappointing that 1 in 6 customers are failing to show up for their Driver Theory Test. The RSA would ask any customer that is unable to attend for their test to let the Driver Theory Test service know in plenty of time so the appointment can be allocated to another candidate who needs a test. </p>  <p>  The Department and the RSA are very conscious of the significant number of people waiting to take their tests. Every possible measure is being put in place to ensure that the maximum number of customers can be served while public health guidance is strictly adhered to. The public&rsquo;s continued patience and understanding is requested as plans are put in place to safely and gradually increase capacity.  </p></reply>

I certainly believe that an important element of that overall commitment is the enactment of legislation in relation to the office of a directly elected mayor in Limerick and I welcome the publication of the General Scheme of the Local Government (Directly Elected Mayor with Executive Functions in Limerick City and County) Bill earlier this year.</p>  <p>  It is already the case that local government has extensive powers in relation to transport, in important areas such as active travel, permeability, public realm enhancements, road improvements and traffic calming measures to name but a few. Assignment of these existing powers is a matter for consideration generally in terms of the assignment of powers between the directly elected mayor, elected members and the executive under the proposed new arrangements.</p>  <p>  I can confirm that I met with Minister of State Burke during the summer to discuss the General Scheme as published, as well as to discuss whether other additional transport related functions might be suitable for assignment to the newly created office. Since that meeting my Department has been actively engaging with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage on the development of the General Scheme and that engagement is ongoing.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is presumably aware that the General Scheme already proposes the creation of a new Project Ireland 2040 City Delivery Board to be chaired by the directly elected mayor. One of the functions of this newly created Board will be to oversee the implementation of the Limerick Shannon Metropolitan Area Transport Strategy, which will be a vitally important role in the years to come as that Strategy is rolled out.</p>  <p>  I am also aware that the General Scheme proposes to establish an Implementation Forum to consider new functions and powers to be assigned to the directly elected mayor and it may be that this Forum might be the appropriate mechanism to consider in detail the potential for certain other transport related functions, over and above those already vested in local government.</p></reply>

I have sought and received a briefing from the IAA, on the concerns raised in the correspondence, and on the unofficial industrial action which in recent months has resulted in temporary staff shortages at State airports. </p>  <p>  As with any industrial relations matter, it is in the best interests of all parties to utilise established dispute resolution processes, which I understand in the IAA's case includes the Internal Dispute Resolution Charter and processes, the adoption and operation of which have been jointly utilised by the IAA and its staff representative bodies for some time now. </p>  <p>  With this in mind, and in the wider context of an aviation sector that, like so many others in society, has been severely impacted by Covid-19 and is now trying to get back on its feet as we see the first tentative signs of economic recovery, perhaps now is an opportunity for reflection and re-engagement by the parties involved.</p></reply>

The following information is the most up to-date information available to me on TII&rsquo;s delivery of projects on the N26.</p><p><b>Background</b></p><p>Within the overall context of Project Ireland 2040, the NDP was developed to underpin the successful implementation of the NPF.  This provides the strategic and financial framework for the National Roads Programme for the period from 2018 to 2027. The focus of TII's activities is, accordingly, being directed towards the development of the major national road improvement schemes that are included in the NDP, along with the maintenance of the existing national road network.</p><p>The Programme for Government includes a commitment to bring forward the review of the NDP from 2022 and to use the review to set out an updated NDP for the period out to 2030. The review of the NDP will be aligned with the NPF and Project Ireland 2040. Work has been undertaken within my Department to contribute to this review, with national roads funding being finalised and a prioritisation of projects to follow.</p><p>I would also like to take this opportunity to highlight that all projects, including those listed in the NDP or any revision to the NDP, are subject to applicable statutory approval and compliance with the Public Spending Code.</p><p><b>Enhanced Regional Accessibility under the NDP</b></p><p>A core priority under the NPF is to enhance and upgrade accessibility between urban centres of population and their regions, in parallel with fostering compact growth of urban centres. This has an important role to play in maximising the growth potential of the regional urban centres and the economy as a whole. Substantial progress has been made since 2000 in improving the road linkages between Dublin and most of the other urban areas and regions. Under the current NDP, the objective is to complete those linkages so that every region and all the major urban areas, particularly those in the North-West, are linked to Dublin by a high-quality road network.</p><p>In 2020, there was significant progress in developing new transport links through the appraisal, planning and procurement stages. As set out in Project Ireland 2040, improving access to the north-west is a strategic aim to support balanced national development. National road projects in the region at or close to construction phase are as follows:</p><p>- The N4 Collooney to Castlebaldwin project in Sligo received Government approval in January 2019. Construction on the project is ongoing and it is expected to be complete in late 2021. This will deliver 14.7km of improvements, including the provision of safe overtaking opportunities, appropriate road alignment and a reduction in junctions and private accesses onto the road. </p><p>- The N5 Westport to Turlough project in Mayo received Government approval in October 2019 and construction is ongoing. This will deliver 20km of dual carriageway and a 2.5km bypass of Westport which will deliver improved journey times and an improvement of the urban environments of Westport and Castlebar with the reduction of traffic within the towns.</p><p>- The N5 Ballaghaderreen to Scramoge project received Government approval in June 2021 and is due to commence construction over the coming months. This will deliver  33.4km of single carriageway bypassing Frenchpark, Bellangare, Tulsk and Strokestown, increasing the safety and capacity of the N5.</p><p><b>N26 Road Projects</b></p><p>While there are currently no specific projects on the N26 included in the current NDP, there is a general commitment for targeted improvements to address bottlenecks and enhance safety on this route. The following are a number of projects that are ongoing on the route to achieve these targeted improvements.</p><p>- The construction contract for the Cloongulane Bridge Scheme was awarded in October 2020, and TII provided an allocation of &euro;2.5 million in 2020 and a further allocation of &euro;7 million in 2021 to Mayo County Council to progress this project through construction, which commenced in November 2020. It is expected to be complete by Q3 2022.</p><p>- An allocation of &euro;50,000 was provided by TII to Mayo County Council in 2020 for the preparation of a Strategic Assessment Report (SAR) for the proposed link road between the N26 and N59. The SAR was approved by my Department in March 2021 and TII have provided an allocation of &euro;100,000 in 2021 to progress this minor safety scheme through the early planning and design phases. The project is currently at Phase 2 Route Selection. Should an option be identified during this phase that would deliver on the scheme objectives and provide value for money, It is likely that the scheme would progress to planning and publication of statutory orders in early to mid 2023.</p></reply>

To date, it is estimated that the sector will have received over &euro;300 million through a number of the supports available. The bulk of the support is through the wage subsidy scheme which was specifically designed to maintain the link between employers and employees. Liquidity support has also been made available by ISIF to large aviation enterprises.</p>  <p>  In November 2020, in recognition of the very difficult circumstances facing the aviation sector, the Government agreed a revised funding package of &euro;80 million specifically for Irish aviation in 2021. As part of this package, &euro;21 million is being provided under the Regional Airports Programme (2021-2025) this year.  This gives funding certainty to Donegal, Kerry and Ireland West Airports and also supports the PSO services. In addition, &euro;32 million is being provided to Cork and Shannon airports through a new one-year COVID-19 regional State airports programme. A &euro;26 million EU approved state aid scheme is available to compensate airport operators for the losses caused by COVID-19 and the restrictions imposed to limit its spread. The scheme will augment the supports already in place and help the industry to maintain connectivity and make a recovery from the impacts of COVID-19. Officals in my Department are also considering if further targeted supports may be required in 2021. </p></reply>

Some employees will be required to continue working their full contracted hours and others will not. Cork Airport will strive to maintain current pay arrangements at 100% during the 10-week closure. However, where full contracted hours are not available and to enable the airport to maintain wages at 100%, this will be achieved through a combination of working hours and annual leave or time in lieu. In some cases, team members have been asked to support other areas of the business for the duration of the project.</p>  <p>  Employment issues of other personnel employed through contracted services are matters between those personnel and their respective employers. While there are no specific financial supports being rolled out by my Department for companies/employees directly impacted by the closure of Cork Airport, I understand that the local Intreo Office is aware of the situation in respect of Cork Airport and will be able to offer practical, tailored services and supports for those affected by the closure. </p>  <p>  In addition, more generally speaking, in response to the impacts of COVID-19, Government has put in place a number of economy wide financial supports. </p>  <p>  In this regard, wage subsidies have served as the keystone of the Government&rsquo;s provision of financial supports in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This began with the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) and, to date, is continued by the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), which operates across all sectors of the economy. </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that Government is fully committed to protecting jobs for aviation workers and helping the sector get back on its feet.  State-aid compliant Schemes, with a budget of &euro;26m were developed by my Department, to help address liquidity issues at our State and Regional airports as a result of COVID-19 and Cork airport has received funding under one of these Schemes.  This funding will provide Cork with the flexibility to roll out route incentives/charge rebates, in consultation with airlines, with a view to supporting recovery and growth of connectivity when the airport reopens in November.  I understand that the daa has already developed major new airport charges discount schemes at Cork (and Dublin airports) to help kickstart air travel to and from Ireland.</p>  <p>  The State aid schemes are part of an overall &euro;80 million aviation-specific support package in 2021. To date in 2021 Cork Airport has been allocated &euro;10m in Exchequer funding for their runway overlay project, under the Covid-19 Regional State Airports Programme 2021.  Cork Airport is also eligible for a share (with Shannon Airport) of &euro;15.6m in operational supports under this Programme and my Department has recently invited Cork to apply for funding under this Scheme which will be disbursed later this year.  This operational funding is in addition to &euro;1.4m allocated to Cork Airport under the Damages Measure of the aforementioned State aid scheme.</p>  <p>  By virtue of its size and passenger numbers, Cork Airport has not previously been eligible for funding under the Regional Airports Programme 2021-2025.  However, in light of the impacts of Covid-19 resulting in suppressed passenger numbers, Cork airport (along with Shannon Airport) will be eligible for supports under the Programme in 2022. The level of funding that might be available under this Programme next year is currently being considered in the context of the Estimates process in relation to Budget 2022.</p>  <p>  Government is willing to keep under review any additional supports that may be necessary.  The Economic Recovery Plan published by Government on the 1 June, explicitly references this and recognises that additional supports may be required to assist the restoration of Ireland's air links, protect jobs in the sector, and support the aviation sector&rsquo;s recovery and my officials are currently considering options in this regard. </p></reply>

This builds on the positive leadership and market impacts that green public procurement policies can have on the development and uptake of innovative lower-carbon goods and services; and, complements wider Government commitments to transition public and private transport fleets from fossil fuel technologies.</p><p>Ireland now has a legal obligation to ensure that a proportion of public vehicle procurement is low-emission or zero-emission. </p><p>Definitions of what constitute &lsquo;clean&rsquo; vehicles are established in the legislation based on vehicle type. Light duty clean vehicles are defined by specified low tail-pipe emissions levels. For the heavy duty sector, &lsquo;clean&rsquo; vehicles are defined by low or zero-emission power - with a range of alternative fuel technologies included in this definition (such as battery, hydrogen fuel cell, biofuel, synthetic-fuel and gas-powered vehicles). </p><p>All public sector bodies will be compelled to apply the Directive if the value of their vehicle procurements is above relevant procurement thresholds as set out in Regulations amending the EU thresholds for the Directives 2014/24/EU and 2014/25/EU. Public sector bodies will also be required to report these vehicle procurements to facilitate national-level reporting to the EU. </p><p>The Directive applies to cars, vans, trucks and buses (excluding coaches)<b>,</b>procured through:</p><p>- Purchase, lease, rent or hire-purchase contracts under obligations set by EU public procurement rules;</p><p>- Public service contracts for the provision of passenger road transport services;</p><p>- Services contracts for public road transport services, special-purpose road passenger-transport services, non-scheduled passenger transport, refuse collection services, and mail and parcel transport and delivery.</p><p>There is considerable variation in the technological maturity of alternative fuel technologies for the different vehicle categories and types included in the Directive's provisions. The Directive and the associated regulations have been designed to take this into account and two reference periods for procurement targets have been set between now and 2030 with different minimum procurement targets applying to each. Between now and 2025, 38.5% of light-duty vehicles, 10% of trucks and 45% of buses procured under the relevant procurement value thresholds must be clean vehicles. </p><p>Between 2025 and 2030, the minimum procurement target of 38.5% clean vehicles will still apply to light duty vehicles, but more stringent targets will apply to heavy vehicles included in the Directive&rsquo;s provisions. In this later reference period, 15% of trucks and 65% of buses will have to be clean vehicles. </p><p>Due to the current limitations of alternative fuels technologies, certain categories of vehicle have also been excluded or have been exempted from the provisions of the Directive. These include coaches, specialised heavy duty vehicles used in agriculture and forestry, special vehicles used by the police, defence forces, civil and fire protection, as well as ambulances, hearses, wheelchair accessible cars and mobile cranes. As alternative fuel technologies for these vehicle segments develops, it is intended that these exemptions will be reviewed in future iterations of the Directive, and that national procurement targets will be amended as appropriate. </p><p>My Department will continue to work with public bodies to ensure that they are aware of the requirements of the Directive as provided for under the new Regulations and will support industry in developing relevant guidance material in this regard.</p></reply>

As ten years have since passed, it was decided that a review of the National Cycle Manual was required and in April 2021 consultants were appointed by the NTA to carry out this review. It is expected that this piece of work will take approximately six months, following which a period of consultation will take place, most likely in Quarter 4 2021. I understand that a revised and updated Manual will be finalised by early next year.</p>  <p>  Once finalised, the NTA intends to complement the publication and dissemination of the new Manual with a series of training sessions for relevant stakeholders and it is my expectation that this work, together with other initiatives planned in the area of National Roads Offices and local authority resourcing, will result in improved cycling outcomes across the country.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also interested to know that my Department is currently undertaking a piece work in relation to the various safety standards and guidelines that apply in relation the development and delivery of cycling infrastructure. There is currently some overlap and interaction between such guidelines which suggests a need to improve their coordination and implementation to avoid potential conflicts and to provide for a consistent and integrated approach to the quality of new cycling infrastructure. My officials along with representatives from the NTA, Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) and the County and City Management Association (CCMA) will form a working group, with the first meeting to be held this month, to help facilitate this coordination.</p></reply>

Section 9 of the Road Traffic Act 2004 (amended by Section 86 of the Road Traffic Act 2010) sets out the range of Special Speed Limits that may be applied through bye-laws.</p>  <p>  To assist local authorities in the application of Special Speed Limits, my Department&rsquo;s updated Guidelines for Setting and Managing Speed Limits in Ireland (2015) is available on www.speedlimits.ie website.  This applies to all roads and provides guidelines to local authorities as to how to decide appropriate speed limits. In addition, and in an effort to improve the appropriateness of speed limits, my Department has developed an appeals process which would allow for individuals to appeal a specific speed limit.  This is expected to be live in Q4 this year.</p></reply>

Since May 2021, the Road Safety Authority has been returning to delivering tests for all customers, while continuing to prioritise critical frontline workers. This means, in the interest of fairness, the RSA targeted test appointments to those waiting longest who are ready and eligible to take the test. </p>  <p>   The service continues to operate under restrictions in the interest of making it safe while there is an ongoing presence of Covid. </p>  <p>  In order to deal with the backlog, the Road Safety Authority received sanction to hire 40 new temporary testers, in addition to 36 they were sanctioned to retain or rehire in 2020. These new testers have completed their training and are now conducting live tests since July 2021. Sanction has also been granted to recruit a further 40.</p>  <p>  The Road Safety Authority  is also looking to increase the number of tests to 7 per tester per day from late September 2021, subject to compliance with health protocols.  </p>  <p>  The gradual re-opening of in-person driver theory test centres commenced from 8 June. The RSA and its service provider has put plans in place to significantly increase capacity. The number of tests provided has increased from an average pre Covid19 level of 15,000 to over 25,000 appointments monthly. Almost 50,000 tests were provided during the month of August. </p>  <p>  The RSA have also been working to extend its online theory test. The new offering will see up to 10,000 online tests available per month. The online service will become more widely available later this year.  </p>  <p>  It is disappointing that 1 in 6 customers are failing to show up for their Theory Test. The RSA would ask any customer unable to attend their test to let the service know in good time so the appointment can be re-allocated.</p></reply>

The Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021 commits us to a 51% reduction in our overall greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 at the latest, and to achieving net zero emissions by 2050. As Minister for Transport, I am committed to putting my sector on the trajectory required to achieve our targets; this involves, in part, deciding on which technologies can help accelerate our transition to a low-carbon and sustainable mobility system.</p>  <p>  In 2019 Ireland committed to no longer procuring diesel-only buses for our urban public fleet; since then an array of different alternatively-fuelled technologies have been assessed to determine their suitability for providing a reliable and greener bus service. While electric vehicles are currently the most mature and proven alternative fuel to decarbonise public transport, hydrogen is emerging as a promising technology especially for longer journeys.</p>  <p>  As such, and to adequately trial hydrogen, the NTA recently procured three double-deck buses. These vehicles are currently being deployed on Bus &Eacute;ireann commuter route 105X. My Department also included one of these buses in the Department&rsquo;s Low-Emission Bus Trial - which is a standardised test that has been employed to compare a range of alternative bus fuels and technologies under real driving conditions. This trial follows the testing of a single-deck hydrogen bus late last year. Findings from Phase 1 of the Bus Trial were published in December 2019, and I expect the final set of findings, including the results for the tests of both the single and double deck hydrogen buses, to be published in Q4 2021; thus allowing my Department to assess the feasibility of hydrogen as a fuel for public bus transport in Ireland. </p>  <p>  Investment priorities in public transport must be delivered to meet the targets set out in the Climate Action Plan and to achieve our climate objectives. The investment priorities represent a decisive shift towards the achievement of a decarbonised transport system demonstrating the Government&rsquo;s unequivocal commitment to securing a carbon-neutral future.</p></reply>

Both bus and haulage operators have been impacted.</p><p>Rising costs are an issue across the economy. On 9 September the CSO published the CPI figures for August 2021. Prices on average, as measured by the CPI, were 2.8% higher in August 2021 compared with August 2020. This is the largest annual change in prices in almost 10 years.</p><p>The largest increase in the year could be seen in Transport (+10.2%) mainly caused by higher prices for petrol, diesel and motor cars, an increase in airfares and a rise in the cost of services in respect of personal transport equipment.</p><p>Recruitment difficulties in the bus sector have only recently been highlighted to my Department as some operators have commenced campaigns to recruit new drivers. </p><p>I am well aware of the growing problem of driver shortages in the road haulage industry and a lot is already being done to help address the problem.

Located on the east coast where the first Offshore Renewable Wind developments will progress, Rosslare Europort has the potential to service a range of windfarms in the Irish Sea. The Department is aware of a number of ports also examining the business potential of Offshore Renewable Energy (ORE).</p>  <p>  The Department of Transport has been exploring options for the facilitation of ORE by the ports, including possible funding under the European Recovery and Resilience Facility. It was decided this would not be one of the projects going forward to Europe as part of Ireland&rsquo;s National Recovery and Resilience Plan due to prioritization of other more mature projects that are in line with EU timelines to maximise Ireland&rsquo;s overall funding.</p>  <p>  However, the Department of Transport has successfully negotiated  changes to the Connecting Europe Funding (CEF) criteria to allow EU funding for basic port infrastructure towards improving connectivity and for funding of port infrastructure for Offshore Wind Energy in the next 2021-2023 CEF Work Programme.</p>  <p>  This will allow ports on the TEN-T Network, including Rosslare Europort, to apply for CEF funding for the development of ports´ facilities related to offshore wind farms.</p>  <p>  The next call for applications will be published this month (September 2021). It is a competitive process and further application calls are expected in September 2022 and September 2023.</p>  <p>  Successful applicants can obtain significant funding of up to 50% of eligible costs for studies and up 30% of infrastructure works costs.</p>  <p>  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has met with Minister Ryan and  outlined the feasibility for Rosslare Europort to service the emerging offshore wind sector in Ireland and the scale of the investment in Infrastructure needed, between &euro;50m to &euro;225m, depending on the option.</p>  <p>  Department officials also met with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and Rosslare Europort  recently to explore the potential for CEF funding for the Port, including for Offshore Wind Energy facilities. Rosslare Europort have advised the Department that they are progressing their plans for the development of ORE  facilities at the port and that they will be applying for CEF funding under the CEF opening later this month.</p>  <p>  As part of its ongoing assessment on options to ensure the provision of ORE facilities at ports , the Department, in conjunction with the IMDO, are also meeting with other ports and administrations to establish best practice in this regard in Europe. Cross departmental engagement between key Government Departments is ongoing in addition to direct engagement with the ORE sector and other relevant stakeholders to explore mechanisms for investment in ORE required port infrastructure. It is expected that this assessment will be finalised shortly.</p>  <p>  The Department of Transport will continue to work with Rosslare Port as it progresses its plans for port infrastructure for serving the Offshore Wind sector while it also provides the necessary infrastructure to maintain RoRo freight activity at the port.</p>  <p>  It is vital that Ireland can achieve its carbon emission reduction targets while exploiting the many opportunities for balanced regional development and the creation of jobs.  It  intended that our ports will be in position to facilitate the development of the Offshore Wind Energy sector around Ireland, contributing towards the Programme for Government target of 5 GW of offshore wind energy by 2030. </p></reply>

I intend to develop a new policy framework for the next 10 years that can provide a strategic backdrop to the increased investment planned by this Government across the sustainable mobility programme. The new policy statement will be informed by the review of the previous policy framework (known as Smarter Travel), submissions received during my Department's consultation process and the views and recommendations of other relevant stakeholders. It will provide a platform to advance the ambitions of the Programme for Government in the area of sustainable mobility, including in rural areas.</p>  <p>  Our committments in both the Programme for Government and "Our Rural Future" in relation to public transport in rural areas will be progressed in the context of that new policy statement. </p>  <p>  Among the measures we will prioritise is the NTA&rsquo;s &ldquo;Connecting Ireland Rural Mobility Plan&rdquo; to ensure settlements over a certain size can connect to the national public transport system, expanding TFI Local Link services and prioritising public transport projects that enhance regional and rural connectivity. </p>  <p>  The National Transport Authority (NTA) has statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public passenger transport services nationally.  The NTA also has responsibility for local and rural transport, including the management of Rural Transport Programme (RTP) which operates under the TFI Local Link brand.  </p>  <p>  The NTA is developing its "Connecting Ireland Rural Mobility Plan", which has the objective of providing better connections between villages and towns through enhanced and new local routes. These local routes will be integrated with an enhanced regional network connecting cities and regional centres nationwide. Connecting Ireland is being developed by identifying and measuring the extent of gaps in connectivity between settlements, outside of Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford; and also through developing a set of proposals to address those gaps, by enhancing existing services and introducing new ones.</p>  <p>  In developing the Connecting Ireland initiative, the NTA undertook workshops with local authorities nationally. The NTA will shortly be undertaking a public consultation on the proposals emanating from Connecting Ireland.  The consultation will provide all interested parties and the general public with an opportunity to review and comment on the proposals. </p></reply>

I understand that as many as 70% of SPSV drivers have availed of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment which, as the Deputy will be aware, has been extended to February 2022. Self-employed SPSV operators can continue to claim the PUP and earn up to &euro;960 in a given 8-week period, net of expenses.</p>  <p>  Based on figures from the National Transport Authority (NTA) I am pleased to advise that passenger demand for SPSV services is now rising as we progress through the next and final phase of the Government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic: COVID-19: Reframing the Challenge, Continuing Our Recovery and Reconnecting. NTA figures also show a steady increase in the proportion of taxi drivers working over the last few months: from 36% of all drivers working in January 2021 to 62% working in June 2021. I expect these trends to continue as restrictions are lifted in line with public health advice.</p>  <p>  Support for SPSV operators continues to be available through a series of measures designed to support the sector, with a view to addressing statutory costs faced by operators which cannot be deferred. Standard licence renewal fees for SPSVs were waived in 2021 and I can confirm that they will be waived again in 2022 at an estimated cost of &euro;3 million. The NTA has put in place schemes to refund the Motor Tax paid by SPSV operators in the period 1 September 2021 to 31 August 2022 and to waive NCT fees for the same period. Further details on these schemes are available on the NTA website. The NTA has also extended age limits for SPSVs to 2022.</p>  <p>  Recognisng that the replacement of a vehicle is the single largest cost faced by any SPSV operator, and in view of my commitment to support the transition of the SPSV fleet towards zero/low-emission vehicles, I increased the funding available to the Electric SPSV (eSPSV) grant scheme for 2021 to &euro;15 million, up from &euro;1 million. This scheme can be used in conjunction with COVID-19 investment and liquidity measures, such as the COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme. There has been a strong interest in the revised scheme, which has received over 1,100 application. To date 254 vehicles have been licensed that were purchased under the scheme at a cost of just over &euro;3 million. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, Microfinance Ireland announced on 9 September that a loan finance up to &euro;25,000 is now available to support the eSPSV Grant Scheme, as many SPSV owners are finding it difficult to secure finance from banks and other commercial lending providers. Further information on this facility is available from Microfinance Ireland.</p></reply>

The fleet is divided into three classes for the regulation of safety. These are the greater than 24m vessels which are regulated by means of an EU Directive since 1999. The next category are the 15m to 24m and these are not regulated at EU or international level and it is a matter for individual states to regulate these. In 2007 Ireland progressively introduced a safety regime for such vessels. The remaining sector are fishing vessel in the less then 15m category and these have been regulated since 2004 under national provisions.</p>  <p>  The &ldquo;MFV Mary Kate&rdquo; was a fishing vessel in the 15m to 24 length category and was required to undergo its safety survey for compliance with the new safety regime in 2009. It was determined that it did not comply with the requirements specifically with the stability requirements and was not issued with a safety certificate. The owner then needed to propose how they would bring their vessel into compliance. The owner decided to lengthen the vessel by the inserting a new section into the vessel. This brought the vessel into the next length category of over 24m and the safety regime of that class applied. Following this alteration, the vessel was then found to comply with the stability requirements. The vessel was subsequently sold to another owner on the Irish flag, has since been renamed and has been operating since this time under the new name and ownership.</p>  <p>  In 2013 the MSO brought a paper to the EU Regulatory Committee on maritime safety matters, the COSS committee. This paper was submitted to raise awareness among other EU Member States as well as the European Commission of the &ldquo;MFV Mary Kate&rdquo; case and possible safety implications for similar vessels which may be operating on the registers of other EU MS.</p>  <p>  In relation to the European Fisheries Fund my Department has no role or function in relation to the funding of the fishing sector in Ireland. The MSO of my Department does not become involved with the financial arrangements for individual vessels in order to maintain the necessary separation of commercial and safety considerations. On this basis it would not be appropriate for me to contact the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine on this matter.</p></reply>

Bus &Eacute;ireann also has a separate, commercially-run business, "Expressway", which operates a number of inter-regional bus routes in competition with other, private, commercial operators in the licenced bus market.  </p>  <p>  The Covid-19 health emergency has had a profound impact on the public transport sector due to the fall in passenger numbers and associated drop in fare revenues.  In this regard, the Government agreed substantial increases to the PSO budget to ensure the continuation of PSO services throughout 2020 and 2021.  In addition, the Government has recognised the impact of the pandemic on the licenced bus sector - which normally operates on a commercial basis without public subvention but which, during the Covid crisis, was in a situation where its operations were no longer commercially viable, owing to the impact of Covid-19 on passenger numbers and the associated drop in fare revenue.   </p>  <p>  Therefore, in June 2020 the Government decided to introduce new, temporary financial supports for certain licensed services provided by commercial bus operators to ensure the continued operation of these essential services.  Among the commercially-operated routes that have qualified for support under the temporary scheme are most, but not all, of Bus &Eacute;ireann's "Expressway" services.   Notwithstanding these supports, though, the Covid situation has still had a profound impact on the company's financial situation, that the Board of the company is obliged to address. Following extensive analysis and work within the company, the decision to consolidate its Expressway network was taken by the Board of Bus &Eacute;ireann in September 2020. The decision impacts four routes - the X1 Dublin/Belfast service (which ceased operations in November 2020), the X12 Dublin/Limerick service (which ceased operations on 30/01/2021), the 20/X20 Dublin/Galway service (which ceased operations on 28/07/2021) and the X8 Dublin/Cork service (which ceased operations on 04/09/2021).   </p>  <p>  In circumstances where a commercial operator ceases operating a specific route, the NTA undertakes an examination to determine whether, with the discontinuation of the commercial service, it is necessary for a replacement PSO service to be introduced to ensure no loss of connectivity to the travelling public. This process includes an assessment of the level of demand for public transport services in the affected area, an evaluation of whether existing PSO services can be reconfigured to meet any shortfall, or whether it is necessary to competitively tender for the provision of services. In light of the decision by Bus &Eacute;ireann to cease operating the X20 route, the NTA completed a detailed assessment of the X20 corridor and have determined that despite Expressway&rsquo;s withdrawal, sufficient connectivity is provided by the remaining operators and the public service obligation is adequately met by other rail and bus services, thereby negating the need for any further intervention on the route.</p>  <p>  Given the NTA's statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public passenger transport services nationally, I have also forwarded the Deputy's question to the Authority for reply. Please advise my private office if you do not receive a reply within ten working days.</p></reply>

It is also expected that demand for public transport will increase further with the expected return of more employees to the workplace over the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  The Chief Medical Officer and the HSE are responsible for the issuing of guidelines in relation to public health and these advices apply across all modes of public transport. The NTA has a coordinating role and have maintained close links with all contracted operators in respect of the response to Covid-19. The NTA has stated that they will continue to liaise with transport operators to monitor passenger trends and any challenges that may arise as transport returns to full capacity. Passengers are being asked to avoid peak times if possible and the wearing of face coverings remains mandatory. A number of measures have been implemented by public transport operators with the support of the NTA to ensure the safe operation of services, including:</p>  <p>  - enhanced cleaning regimes for vehicles and stations;</p>  <p>  - distribution of personal protective equipment to public transport staff;</p>  <p>  - distribution of hand sanitizer on vehicles and at stations; and</p>  <p>  - display of public health advice and guidelines on vehicles and in stations</p>  <p>  The NTA continues to have regular engagement with the various public transport operators in relation to the impact of Covid-19 on the sector. In relation to direct engagement with transport workers and representative groups - that is a matter for the individual operators concerned.</p></reply>

These projects are all pre-construction projects and range from feasibility studies to environmental screening to support for planning applications. These projects will provide us with a pipeline of projects that will be considered for further support as they progress through the project management and decision gates before being considered for construction. I was particularly pleased that there is a wide geographical spread of projects included, from Donegal in the North-West around all our border counties to the South-West and across the Midlands and to the East. There are also a number of projects funded that will extend our existing Greenways and link Greenways to each other, contributing in future years to a network of Greenways and cycling infrastructure around the country.</p>  <p>  Progress has been slower than anticipated, unfortunately, due to the impact of the Pandemic and issues with staff resourcing within our local authorities that is being addressed with support from my Department. Just under half the total amount allocated will have been expended by the end of this year (&euro;2.29m). The remainder will be spent during 2022. </p>  <p>  When the projects complete and, subject to the criteria laid out in the Public Spending Code, they may progress to further pre-construction phases, or in some cases to construction itself. Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) are taking over project management of Greenways from my Department from September 20th and they will examine each of the projects and assess their suitability for progress.</p>  <p>  TII are also developing a National Cycle Network and this is due to be finalised by the end of 2022 and that work will feed into TII's determination of which projects should be considered for funding for construction. I am pleased that we have so many potential Greenways being developed around the country and that will contribute to the creation of a National Cycle Network. The delays to date will have no material impact in terms of construction funding as that will not be decided upon until the end of 2022 when the National Cycle Network has been identified.</p>  <p>  If the Deputy has queries about specific Greenways I will task TII with providing detailed answers to her queries.</p></reply>

These new testers have completed their training and are now conducting live tests since July 2021. Sanction has also been granted to recruit a further 40.  At this point I do not believe that there is a shortage of testers.  </p>  <p>  Driving testers carried out 8 tests each per day before the pandemic.  This was reduced to 5 on reopening in summer of 2020, and later increased to 6.  The RSA hopes to be able to increase this in the near future to 7, subject to health circumstances.  This will make a significant impact on the RSA's efforts to address backlogs.</p></reply>

I have therefore forwarded the Deputy's question to the NTA for direct reply. Please advise my private office if you do not receive a response within ten working days.</p></reply>

I believe that potential is not currently realised.</p>  <p>  That&rsquo;s why I broadened the terms of reference of what was a proposed high-speed study between Belfast, Dublin and Cork, so that it is now an all-island Strategic Rail Review. This Review will be conducted in co-operation with our colleagues in the Northern Ireland Executive and will examine all aspects of inter-urban and inter-regional rail. </p>  <p>It will set the type of strategic backdrop to rail investment in our regions and on our mainline network that the recent JASPERS Review of the Western Rail Corridor noted was lacking. We need this type of strategic analysis to inform our consideration of specific projects such as the Western Rail Corridor. I very much look forward to the completion of the Strategic Rail Review next year and implementing its recommendations in the coming years, supported by the new NDP.  </p></reply>

In addition and in an effort to improve appropriate speed limits, my Department has developed a speed limit appeals process which would allow a formal procedure for individuals to appeal a specific speed limit to a Review Board where the speed limit is considered to be inappropriate.   This process is expected to be live in Q4 this year.   </p></reply>

Each building has a range of health and safety mitigations already in place, aligned to the national Work Safely Protocols, and where mask wearing is an important element of a suite of measures to guard against the spread of COVID-19.</p>  <p>  My Department has a dedicated Health and Safety Unit with responsibility at Principal Officer level, whereby the objective is always to ensure a safe and appropriate working environment for all staff and visitors across our buildings. As a consequence of the pandemic, we quickly introduced a range of measures such as adjusting our accommodation setup to provide for social distancing, enhanced cleaning regimes and adjustments to our door access systems to reduce the risk of disease transmission. These are just some of the measures introduced since March 2020. Where a staff member has a particular health and safety concern(s) they are encouraged to make that known directly to their line manager, or to the Health and Safety Unit or the HR Unit of my Department, depending on the nature of the individual issue and all reasonable assistance will be provided to staff, which may include the provision of specific health and safety related equipment, where warranted.</p>  <p>  The nature of the work of my Department means we have minimal direct interaction with members of the public in our buildings. We have no public offices in the Department. The primary &ldquo;face-to-face&rdquo; onsite interaction with the public as we continue to transition back to our buildings is predominately undertaken by the Labour Court and the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC). Other Offices, such as the Companies Registrations Office and the Intellectual Property Office of Ireland have moved more and more of their operations online over recent years as part of the public sector reform process.</p>  <p>  For the small number of Departmental staff, such as our Service teams on Reception in our buildings or the WRC Inspectors, who would have more direct contact with members of the public, we have provided appropriate PPE to enable them to safely conduct their roles.</p>  <p>  The day-to-day operations of the Agencies under the remit of my Department is a matter for the respective Board and heads of the Agencies to oversee and manage though the majority of the Agency staff roles would be desk/office bound roles, whereby local arrangements would be very similar to those in place in my Department and also aligned to the national Work Safely Protocols.  </p></reply>

The 2014-2020 EEOS successfully resulted in final energy savings of over 3,800 GWh, supporting over 290,000 dwellings and 3,000 businesses. Following a consultation in 2019, it was decided that for 2021-30, Ireland would again use an EEOS to achieve a portion of the energy savings required under Article 7. For this period, the Government is redesigning the EEOS to more closely align with Ireland&rsquo;s broader climate ambitions and targets. </p><p>Since then, work has been progressing on the redesign of the EEOS to commence in 2022. As part of this, a second consultation in March/April 2021, set out detailed scheme design proposals, with stakeholders asked to provide input on consultation questions across the broad policy areas. </p><p>Iit was proposed that the new EEOS target would be set at 36,424 GWh cumulative final energy savings (60% of Ireland&rsquo;s Article 7 obligation), with at least 15% of this to be delivered in the residential sector, including energy poor homes.  This target equates to new final energy savings of over 6,600 GWh.</p><p>Consultation responses were received from a range of stakeholders and have been considered as part of the development process.</p><p>I intend to publish my decision on the new EEOS shortly, which will allow for its implementation from January 2022. </p></reply>

I propose to take Question Nos. 151, 152  and 159 together.</p>  <p>  Extensive investment plans are in place by a range of commercial operators with further investment plans recently announced. These plans will see improved high speed broadband access across the country.  Of the 2.4 million premises across Ireland, 77% of premises now have access to high-speed broadband of more than 30 Mbps.  National Broadband Ireland (NBI), through the Government's State led intervention, will address the remaining premises to ensure no premises is left behind.  </p>  <p>  According to the most recent Quarterly Report by ComReg, the  Quarterly Key Data Report on the Electronic Communications market for the period (1 April to 30 June), Q2 2021, which is available at: www.comreg.ie/media/2021/09/ComReg-2188.pdf, the total number of live broadband subscriptions (mobile and fixed) at the end of June 2021was 1.887m, which represents a 4.2% increase on the number of subscriptions in Q2 of 2020. The majority of the fixed broadband subscriptions  in Q2 2021 were equal to or greater than 30Mpbs, with 46%  being equal to or greater than 100Mpbs. Of the 1.5m fixed broadband subscriptions which represented a 4.0% increase since Q2 of 2020, 308K were fibre to the premises subscriptions, making up 19.9% of total fixed broadband subscriptions, up from 13.5% in Q2 of 2020.</p>  <p>  With respect to the National Broadband Plan, the Covid 19 pandemic has had an impact on the delivery of the fibre network, resulting in delays on delivery of aspects of the programme. Impacts include challenges with mobilisation of key contractors with restrictions on operations and supply chain and logistic delays both nationally and internationally. In addition, there have been challenges with the recruitment of key personnel as National Broadband Ireland (NBI) and its contractors scale up, including challenges associated with on-boarding and training people. Inevitably, like many other organisations, NBI and contractor staffs are at risk of contracting Covid 19 or may have had to restrict their movements as a result of being a close contact. </p>  <p>  My Department has worked closely with NBI to put in place a remedial plan under the Contract to address the impacts of the Covid 19 pandemic on the project for 2021. The impact on future years continues to be assessed.  NBI is putting in place mitigation measures to address the impact of the pandemic on the programme to date. These include</p>  <p>  - Increasing the rate of pole replacement and duct remediation per month</p>  <p>  - Bringing in more resources to NBI</p>  <p>  - Purchasing more materials earlier</p>  <p>  - Bringing in more subcontractors</p>  <p>  In line with the Programme for Government, NBI and my Department are also engaged in a review of potential measures that can be taken to accelerate the network rollout in parallel with the measures required to mitigate delays arising as a result of Covid-19. My Department continues to engage with NBI to explore the feasibility of accelerating aspects of the NBP rollout to establish the possibility of bringing forward premises which are currently scheduled in years 6 and 7 of the current plan to an earlier date. However, the primary focus must be on addressing the delays which have arisen and ensuring that the build programme gets back on track and is building momentum month on month.</p>  <p>Despite the unprecedented challenges presented by the Covid-19 pandemic, NBI has made steady progress on delivery of the new high speed fibre broadband network under the National Broadband Plan. I am advised by NBI that as of 3   September over 251,000 premises have been surveyed across all counties. Main Fibre Build works are underway in 25 Deployment Areas covering over 105,000 premises. Surveys are complete or underway in County Kildare in Killashee, Oughterard, Naas Rural, Rathmore, Kill, Kilteel, Carnalway, Gilltown, Ballymore Eustace, Bodenstown, Naas Urban, Newtown, Donaghcumper, Athy, Coneyboro, Aughaboura, Ballinapark, Castlemitchell, Bert, Kilberry, Kilkea, Leixlip, Celbridge and Maynooth. Network build, as part of the Blessington Deployment Area, has commenced in areas which are close to the Wicklow border.</p>  <p>  Further details are available on specific areas within County Kildare through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. NBI also has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries.</p>  <p>  Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 3 September, 366 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for school BCPs. BCP&rsquo;s are connected at Bigstone Community Hall, Crookstown Further Education and Training and Community Centre, and Lullymore Heritage Park. Further details can be found at nbi.ie/bcp-locations/. </p>  <p>  Rathmore National School, Saint David's National School and Piper's Hill Campus have BCPs installed by NBI for educational access. My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband, within the Intervention Area, for connection over the term of the NBP. In this regard, an acceleration of this aspect of the National Broadband Plan was announced in December which will see some 679 primary schools connected to high speed broadband by 2022, well ahead of the original target delivery timeframe of 2026.  Further details are available on the NBI website at nbi.ie/primary-schools-list/. </p></reply>

This programme has undergone significant expansion in recent years, from 29 stations in 2017 to 96 today. All monitoring stations collect air quality data for a range of pollutants in order to provide information to the public, and for assessment against European legal limit values and World Health Organisation (WHO) guideline values.   Data from these monitoring stations shows that the measures to protect our air quality have on the whole been effective and where exceedances of air quality guideline value levels have been observed, these have been primarily due to the burning of solid fuel in our cities, towns and villages. Each year, some 1,300 people die prematurely in Ireland due to air pollution from solid fuel burning. I am committed to addressing this critical public health and environmental challenge through enhanced regulation of all solid fuels. From September 2022, new emissions standards will be introduced across a range of fuels to ensure that the most polluting will no longer be available for sale on the Irish market.  Introducing these standards will improve the quality of the air that we breathe, and the health of the public that we serve.</p>  <p>  The national Clean Air Strategy, currently being finalised by my Department, will commit us to further cutting levels of the most damaging and dangerous pollutants in order to meet the current guideline limits recommended by the WHO. The Strategy will also identify and promote the integrated measures and actions across Government that are required to reduce air pollution and promote cleaner air, while delivering on wider national objectives.</p></reply>

These targets cover emissions from sectors outside of the EU Emissions Trading System, such as agriculture, transport, buildings and waste. For the year 2020 itself, the target set for Ireland is that emissions should be 20% below their value in 2005.  The Effort Sharing Decision allows Member States to meet their targets by means of unused emissions allowances from earlier years, or through purchasing allowances from other Member States or on international markets. </p>  <p>  The latest projections of greenhouse gas emissions, published in June 2021 by the EPA, indicate that emissions from those sectors of the economy covered by the ESD could remain around 7% below 2005 levels by 2020. According to this report, Ireland will cumulatively exceed the carbon budget implied by our ESD targets by 12.2 Mt CO2 eq.,and we will need to avail of flexibilities in order to comply with our obligations. Pre-Covid estimates of the additional costs of purchasing carbon credits for compliance with these targets were in the region of &euro;6 million to &euro;13 million, depending on the price and final quantity of allowances required. However, due to the reduction in the amount of required credits to be purchased, and changes in CER prices in the market, this figure is likely to be significantly lower than the &euro;6 million lower end of the range.</p>  <p>  The EU Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR) sets binding emission reduction targets for Member States for the period 2021-2030. The final agreement sets Ireland a target of 30% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 2005 levels. However, it is important to note that this target will be amended following the European Council&rsquo;s decision to increase ambition from its existing EU-wide 2030 target of a 40% reduction to at least 55%, compared to 1990 levels. Legislative proposals to implement the new EU 2030 target, including revising Member States&rsquo; annual targets from 2021-2030, were presented by the European Commission in July 2021. The proposed new target for Ireland is a 42% reduction in emissions by 2030, compared to 2005 levels.</p>  <p>  I am finalising the Climate Action Plan 2021 which will bring forward policies and measures to support the delivery of the Programme for Government commitment to achieve a 51% reduction in carbon emissions by 2030, and put us on a pathway to climate neutrality no later than 2050.</p></reply>

ComReg has also published the results of tests carried out on mobile/smartphone handsets currently available in Ireland (available at <i>www.comreg.ie/publication/mobile-handset-performance-data</i>). These findings will further allow consumers to make informed decisions based on the handsets which best address their needs.</p><p>A combination of commercial investment and State led intervention will ensure access to high speed broadband in every part of the country no matter how remote. Of the 2.4 million premises across Ireland, 77% of premises now have access to high-speed broadband of more than 30 Mbps. The National Broadband Plan will address the remaining premises and will provide a high speed and future proofed broadband network within the Intervention Area which covers 1.1 million people living and working in over 544,000 premises, including almost 100,000 businesses and farms along with 695 schools. The NBP network will offer users a high speed broadband service with a minimum download speed of 500Mbps from the outset. A number of commercial operators have also announced further investment plans in high-speed broadband. Eir has said it will roll out fibre to a further 1.6 million premises, bringing its fibre deployment to more than 1.9 million premises. SIRO is currently completing the first phase of its fibre deployment which will see 375,000 premises passed with gigabit services. Virgin Media is offering 250Mbps as a standard offering with higher speeds available to many of its customers across more than 1 million premises. Many other network operators and telecom service providers across the State also continue to invest in their networks.</p><p>The most recent Quarterly Key Data Report Q2, 2021 published by ComReg reported that fixed broadband subscriptions increased to 1.55 million, a 0.8% increase this quarter and an increase of 4.0% when compared to Q2 2020. Of these, over 308,000 were fibre-to the-premises (FTTP) subscriptions representing 19.9% of total fixed broadband subscriptions in Q2 2021, up from 13.5% in Q2 2020. </p></reply>

My Department has now prioritised primary schools with no high speed broadband and continues to work with the Department of Education in this regard. An acceleration of this aspect of the National Broadband Plan will see some 677 primary schools connected to high speed broadband by the end of 2022, well ahead of the original target delivery timeframe of 2026. It is expected that well in excess of 200 will be installed by the end of this year with all 677 schools connected by end 2022.   My Department has consulted with the Department of Education and the new school Gaelscoil Thromaire will be included in this programme. While the school has been prioritised for connection, further investigation is required by National Broadband Ireland (NBI) before a timeline for connection can be given. The new school building will need to be surveyed and a technical solution proposed. </p>  <p>  I understand that as an interim measure, the Department of Education is arranging for an existing retail service provider in the Schools Broadband programme to provide a temporary connection to the new school site, while NBI&rsquo;s work is being progressed.   </p></reply>

I am committed to addressing this critical public health and environmental challenge through enhanced regulation of all solid fuels. New emissions standards are being introduced across a range of fuels to ensure that the most polluting will no longer be available for sale on the Irish market.  Introducing these standards will improve the quality of the air that we breathe, and the health of the public that we serve. From September 2022, coal, coal-based products, any manufactured solid fuel or peat products<b></b>will be required to have a smoke emission rate of less than 10g/hour, reducing to 5g/hr by 2025. In order for such fuels, including peat briquettes imported or otherwise, to be placed on the Irish market, they must comply with these standards. </p><p>It should be noted that like any other solid fuel, imports of peat briquettes and lignite (coal) briquettes are permitted under international trade agreements and no restrictions on the import, sale or use of such briquettes are being proposed once the standards provided for under the new regulations have been met. </p></reply>

Fewer daily tests can now be conducted due to social distancing and priority is given to essential workers and then to those who have had tests cancelled due to Covid.</p><p>In line with the gradual reopening of services this Summer, driving tests for all those who are eligible to take the test and have been waiting longest have now recommenced. Critical frontline workers continue to be the priority for the driver testing service. There is no discrimination against young people in rural areas seeking a test. Everyone who is eligible to take a test can seek a date for a test. While I appreciate that all young drivers are anxious to take their test, they must pass their Theory Test, hold a Learner Permit for at least 6 months and take 12 mandatory lessons before they are eligible to sit a test. It is also notable that on average 44% of all those who sit a driving test, fail the test.</p><p>The latest figures available to Sunday 12 September show, in spite of the challenges posed by Covid, 101,870 tests have been offered and the RSA has delivered 92,672 driving tests in 2021. It is highly significant that, since the summer 2020 reopening of services, there has been no case of Covid transmission attributed to the driving test. </p><p>My Department is liaising with the RSA on an ongoing basis to meet the growing demand for tests. The RSA has a complement of 100 permanent driver testers.  An additional 40 temporary driver testers have been authorised along with 36 approved for retention or rehire in 2020.<b></b>These testers have been recruited and trained and commenced testing in July.</p><p>In addition, sanction was granted at the end of June to add a further 40 testers to the cohort.  When trained and in place, this will increase the number of testers to 216.</p><p>The RSA is looking to increase the number of tests from 6 to 7 per tester per day from the end of September as well as extending operating hours and expanding facilities at existing centres or opening new centres where appropriate.</p><p>At this point, there are on average 3,254 tests conducted per week and the number of tests scheduled is increasing on a gradual basis. However, it should be noted that approximately 5% of all tests scheduled are not conducted or are abandoned on the day for a number of reasons (e.g. no NCT, insurance not valid etc). In addition, it is very disappointing to note that a number of people do not turn up on the day for their scheduled test. The RSA has been working hard to reduce this &ldquo;no show&rdquo; rate, which was 10% and the volume of &ldquo;no shows&rdquo; has now dropped dramatically to an average of 1.38%.</p><p>Assuming a successful return to 7 tests per tester per day, the capacity of the system will be 4,881 tests per week.  This will increase again by December when the additional 40 testers are trained and commence testing.</p><p>As of Sunday 12 September 2021, 67,684 people were waiting to receive an invitation for a driving test, while 10,094 had received a test date. A further 28,631 have applied for their test but are not currently eligible to take it (i.e. they have not completed all of the Essential Driver Training (EDT) lessons or they have held their learner permit for less than 6 months).</p><p>Of the roughly 67,500 waiting to receive an invitation, :</p><p>- Approximately 8,000 have received and invite and not used it within the 10-day window </p><p>- Approximately 13,000 are in a current invite cycle, i.e. they have an open invite, having received one in the past 10 days, and have not yet used it </p><p>This leaves a truer figure of 46,500 waiting currently. </p><p>This means that, with a possibility of 4,881 tests weekly, it should be possible to clear the backlog in 14 weeks. The backlogs and waiting times will reduce further when the additional 40 testers sanctioned during the Summer come on stream towards year end.</p><p>I have to caution though that many people will have held off from applying during the lockdown, either because they were non-essential workers or because they were essential workers who had not completed the mandatory lessons. Even as we increase capacity, we can anticipate an increase in demand for a period.</p><p>It should be acknowledged that RSA driver testers are undertaking driving tests in extraordinarily difficult conditions, in an enclosed space, where physical distancing is not possible. Testers are also moving between vehicles provided by test candidates, which are not controllable work environments. </p><p>The health of both the public and the testers themselves must take priority, and as a result it is important to recognise that it will take time to get driver testing waiting times back to normal pre-Covid levels.</p></reply>

With the notable exception of airlines that primarily deal with air cargo, international airlines have seen a severe depletion of revenue, have faced varying degrees of financial challenge and have had to make very difficult decisions to ensure their long-term commercial viability. </p>  <p>  The Government decided to allow the resumption of non-essential international travel from 19 July. This was based on the progress being made with our national vaccination programme and a combination of measures relating to the EU Digital COVID Certificate, pre-departure testing, a system of mandatory hotel quarantine for designated third countries and other public health measures to ensure international travel could operate safely.  An &ldquo;emergency brake&rdquo; mechanism also allows us to respond to the potential emergence of problematic COVID-19 variants. </p>  <p>  The latest Eurocontrol data indicates a recovery of up to 70% of 2019 levels of air traffic movements across Europe. However, the recovery is slower in Ireland where the daily variation in air traffic is still only at 50% of 2019 levels. The transatlantic market remains severely impacted due to entry constraints in the US. </p>  <p>  The Government has provided a comprehensive suite of economy wide  business supports which aviation companies have been able to draw upon.  In additon support has have been provided through an EU approved airport damages scheme and liquidity funding through the ISIF Pandemic Stabilisation and Recovery Fund. Officials are assessing options for further targeted supports. </p>  <p>It is anticipated that the continued successful rollout of the vaccination programme and reduced risk of transmission of the virus will provide the basis for the return of consumer confidence and an increase in forward bookings. With continued support from Government during the coming months the sector should be well placed for strong recovery next year.     </p></reply>

This is similar to other ports in Ireland which receive no Exchequer funding and must fund all their infrastructure developments through their own resources, borrowing or through EU grant funding. </p>  <p>  There has been a significant increase in shipping services from Rosslare direct to the Continent as a result of Brexit. Rosslare reports huge demand for these services with an increase of around 400% in freight units through Rosslare when compared to the same period last year and 2019.</p>  <p>  In the context of these developments and to enhance Rosslare Europort&rsquo;s trade competitiveness, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and Rosslare Europort&rsquo;s strategic investment Masterplan for the port over the coming years has been completed.  The Masterplan includes investment plans for &euro;42 million, which will be funded from the port's own revenues, over the period 2021-2026, in customer facilities, port infrastructure, freight facilities, port assets, new technology and linking the new entrance of the port with the proposed new port access road.</p>  <p>  Additionally, to support the free flow of import and export trade through Rosslare to GB, there has been significant engagement, preparation and investment in the State Agency facilities required at Rosslare. Temporary Customs, Agriculture and Health facilities were constructed by OPW in the lead up to a possible no-deal Brexit in 2019. These facilities are located outside the port at Kilrane, on the N25 approaching Rosslare Town. These facilities are intended as interim facilities pending the construction of the permanent facilities within the port itself.  </p>  <p>  My Department continues to liaise closely with other Government Departments and agencies, in particular OPW, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Revenue Commissioners, Department of Health, HSE and Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and with Rosslare Port and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, in relation to the design and development of the permanent facilities. In August 2021, OPW  submitted a planning application to Wexford County Council in respect of these planned facilities.  </p>  <p>  This investment along with the Rosslare Europort Masterplan will ensure that the port is fully capable of meeting the controls required by the UK becoming a Third Country and of meeting the needs of future shipping capacity growth. Rosslare Europort and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann are working together with the OPW on the coordination of works under both the port's Masterplan and OPW&rsquo;s own plans for the State border control facilities. The parallel plans will require close liaison to ensure that the port remains fully operational while construction works are ongoing.  </p>  <p>  In relation to other business opportunities, Rosslare Europort have advised the Department that they are progressing their plans for the development of Offshore Renewable Energy (ORE) facilities at the port and that they will be applying for Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) funding under the CEF call opening later this month.</p>  <p>  With regard to a free zone at Rosslare Europort, in discussions with officials, Rosslare Europort has advised that the idea is at an early concept stage in the port with the focus at the moment on progressing plans for ORE facilities.  Further work on the free zone proposal will be required by  Rosslare Europort and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann setting out a worked out analysis of the benefits, if any, of any such proposal. </p>  <p>The development of a free zone at Rosslare would be a matter falling within the broad area of industrial policy and would require liaison between my Department, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department of Finance.</p></reply>

This Programme also supports PSO air services to Donegal Airport. While it also supported a PSO service on the Kerry route, this ceased when Ryanair began operating that service on a commercial basis in July, following the collapse of Stobart Air.In light of the impact of Covid on our regional State airports, &euro;32.1 million has also been provided to Cork and Shannon airports under a Covid19 Regional State Airports Programme in 2021.  </p><p>In addition to this funding, which will put our regional airports in funds while they navigate the Covid crisis,  my Department has developed EU Commission approved supplementary support schemes with a budget of &euro;26 million to help address liquidity issues at airports as a result of Covid-19.  These new schemes, include  &euro;20 million in compensation for our State Airports (Dublin, Cork and Shannon) in recognition of the impacts of Covid. This funding has provided these airports with the flexibility to roll out route incentives/charge rebates, in consultation with airlines, with a view to supporting recovery and growth of connectivity.  A further &euro;6m is also available to regional airports that provide connectivity(Donegal, Knock and Kerry) under the EU Temporary Framework in recognition of the impact of Covid on their business.  While &euro;23 million in funding has already been disbursed to these airports under these Schemes, my Department has recently invited applications from airports for further funding under the Temporary Framework.</p><p>Table 1 below outlines the total package of sector-specific supports available to aviation in 2021.  These supports are in addition to the horizontal supports made available to help mitigate the effects of the pandemic on business, including a wage subsidy scheme, grants, low-cost loans, a commercial rates waiver and deferred tax liabilities. To date, the value of these supports to the Irish aviation industry is estimated to be over &euro;300 million.</p><p>daa has developed new airport charges discount schemes at Cork and Dublin airports to help kickstart air travel to and from Ireland. Furthermore, Shannon Airport worked closely with airlines in delivering incentives to rebuild traffic, restoring capacity and securing pilot and crew jobs.</p><p>The Economic Recovery Plan published by Government on the 1 June, recognises that additional supports may be required to assist the restoration of Ireland's air links, protect jobs and support the sector&rsquo;s recovery as it opens up and my officials are currently considering options in this area. </p><p>Government is committed to continuing to support our regional airports (Knock, Kerry and Donegal) under the Regional Airports Programme in 2022.  With regard to Shannon and Cork airports, both of these airports meet the eligibility criteria for the Programme in 2022 and the level of funding that might be available under this Programme in 2022 is currently being considered in the context of the Estimates process in relation to Budget 2022.</p><p>The funding provided for regional airports in 2021 is set out inthe following table.  <table>    <tr>       <th>Grant Aid allocations</th>       <th>Eligible Airports</th>       <th>Capital Funding</th>       <th>Current Funding</th>       <th>Total Funding Allocation for 2021</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Regional Airports Programme 2021-2025 (includes funding of PSO routes)</td>       <td>Donegal, Kerry &amp;amp; Knock</td>       <td>&euro;10m</td>       <td>&euro;11.3</td>       <td>&euro;21.3m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Covid-19 Regional State Airports Programme 2021 (&euro;32.1m)</td>       <td>Cork </td>       <td>&euro;10m</td>       <td>&euro;15.6m</td>       <td>&euro;32.1m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td>Shannon<br /><br /></td>       <td>&euro;6.5m</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>New Covid-19 Supplementary Support Scheme for Irish Airports (&euro;26m)</td>       <td>Dublin</td>       <td></td>       <td>&euro;17.68m</td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td>Cork</td>       <td></td>       <td>&euro;1.400m</td>       <td>&euro;20m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td>Shannon</td>       <td></td>       <td>&euro;0.920m</td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td>Ireland West</td>       <td></td>       <td>&euro;1.931m</td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td>Donegal</td>       <td></td>       <td>&euro;0.142m</td>       <td>&euro;6m   (*)</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td>Kerry</td>       <td></td>       <td>&euro;0.913m</td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Covid-19 Emergency Support &ndash; Hold     Baggage Screening Project (300k of the &euro;6.1m allocated to the project was spent in 2020)</td>       <td>Shannon </td>       <td>&euro;5.8m</td>       <td></td>       <td>&euro;5.8m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>TOTAL</td>       <td></td>       <td>&euro;32.3m</td>       <td>&euro;52.9m</td>       <td>&euro;85.2m</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>(*) The remainder will be disbursed in December following an assessment by the Department of Transport of eligible losses in the current year to end 2021.</p><p>** Funding for the HBS project is included in this Table as while it was approved in 2020 by Government, only &euro;300k was spent by Shannon Airport in 202O with the balance of &euro;5.8m of the allocation spent in 2021. </p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to 7% average annual emissions reduction to 2030; ultimately, the goal is for a zero-emission mobility system by 2050.  Electrification will be key to achieving this objective in the transport sector. </p><p>Electric vehicles (EVs) are the most prominent transport mitigation measure in the 2019 Climate Action Plan, and Ireland has set an ambitious target of 936,000 EVs on our roads by 2030. This target is challenging but indicates the scale of the transformation that is needed across all sectors if Ireland is to achieve its climate targets in the coming years. </p><p>Considerable progress has been made, as a result of the work of the Low Emission Vehicle Taskforce, to ensure that conditions and policies are in place to support citizens in making greener vehicle choices. As the Deputy will be aware, a comprehensive suite of measures is available to EV drivers, including purchase grants for private car owners and taxi drivers, VRT relief, reduced tolls, home charger grants, favourable motor and BIK tax rates, as well as a comprehensive charging network. These measures have collectively contributed to increased take up of EVs in Ireland in recent years, albeit from a low base, to over 41,000 now. </p><p>In addition, my Department convened the Electric Vehicle Policy Pathway (EVPP) Working Group to produce a roadmap to achieving the 2030 EV target. The EVPP Working Group comprises senior officials and has considered regulatory, financial, and taxation policies to help drive a significant ramp-up in passenger EVs and electric van sales.  </p><p>The recommendations of the EVPP Working Group were approved by Government today and the full report is now available online. </p><p>The Working Group examined the issue of price parity between EVs and ICE vehicles. The Report finds that there is divergence within the research community as to when TCO in economic terms cost parity will be achieved with some studies estimating that it is likely to occur in the middle of this decade, driven by falling battery prices and savings due to economies of scale, while others<b><sup></sup></b>argue that the cross-over point may not occur until towards the end of the decade. </p><p>In the meantime, in order to support the transition to EVs, the Group recommended that:  </p><p>- The generous suite of EV supports already in place in Ireland should be retained until at least end-2022. Additional measures to further incentivise EVs and/or disincentivise fossil fuelled vehicles will also be necessary. Cost-effective, targeted policy supports should continue to be developed and strengthened over the coming years; and</p><p>- An Office for Low Emission Vehicles should be established, as a matter of priority, to co-ordinate the implementation of existing and future EV measures and infrastructure. The new Office should also take charge of developing and launching an extensive communication and engagement campaign, whole of Government in coverage, to drive the availability and understanding of key information regarding EVs, tailored to household, business and public sector consumers. </p><p>Overall, the Department is acutely aware that the cost of electric vehicles remains an issue for many consumers. To this end, electric vehicle policy is being kept under continuous review to endeavour to make low emission vehicles affordable. A new Climate Action Plan will be published shortly which will include actions to attempt to close the price gap between fossil fuel vehicles and electric vehicles.</p></reply>

Sections of road, which are amenable to engineering solutions, are prioritised for treatment. </p>  <p>  Collision data is recorded by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. This data is used by the RSA and TII for research purposes. Each high collision location is investigated by a site assessment team. The inspection of the site&rsquo;s collision history, coupled with the site visit, determines if an engineering counter measure will improve the safety performance of the location. </p>  <p>  TII is committed to the evaluation of the road safety remedial measure programmes. The remedial schemes are assessed in terms of the reduction in the number of collisions at the site and the first year rate of return. </p>  <p>  In addition, TII's HD17 programme is based on road safety inspection reports.  These reports indicate which issues, for example signing, lining or safety barriers, need to be addressed on different sections of roads and programmes are drawn up to deal with the priority issues.  </p>  <p>  Unfortunately the four main causes of fatalities on our roads remain speeding, use of mobile phones, intoxicated driving and non-wearing of seatbelts, all areas where drivers need to take personal responsibility for their driving behaviour.</p>  <p>  Every death on our roads is one too many, and myself and my officials are working tirelessly to achieve the EU's target of Vision Zero - no road deaths on European roads by 2050.  In this context, it is worth noting that Ireland's roads are the second safest in the EU.</p></reply>

This number continues to increase and almost 50,000 tests were provided during the month of August.</p>  <p>  The RSA has also been working to extend its online theory testing service. The new offering will see up to 10,000 online theory tests available for all categories of vehicles per month. Tests are available on a first-come-first-served basis with the new online service becoming more widely available later in the year. </p>  <p>   However, it is disappointing that 1 in 6 customers are failing to show up for their Driver Theory Test. The RSA would ask any customer that is unable to attend for their test to let the Driver Theory Test service know in plenty of time so the appointment can be allocated to another candidate who needs a test. </p>  <p>  The Department and the RSA are very conscious of the significant number of people waiting to take their tests. Every possible measure is being put in place to ensure that the maximum number of customers can be served while public health guidance is strictly adhered to.

In order to qualify for relief, the applicant must hold a Primary Medical Certificate issued by the relevant Senior Area Medical Officer (SAMO) or a Board Medical Certificate issued by the Disabled Driver Medical Board of Appeal. Certain other qualifying criteria apply in relation to the vehicle, in particular that it must be specially constructed or adapted for use by the applicant.   </p>  <p>  To qualify for a Primary Medical Certificate an applicant must be permanently and severely disabled, and satisfy at least one of the following medical criteria:</p>  <p>  - be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs; </p>  <p>  - be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs; </p>  <p>  - be without both hands or without both arms; </p>  <p>  - be without one or both legs; </p>  <p>  - be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg; </p>  <p>  - have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.  </p>  <p>  The medical criteria were included in Section 89 of the Finance Act 1989 by way of an amendment in the Finance Act 2020.  This amendment arises from legal advice in light of the June 2020 Supreme Court judgement that the medical criteria in secondary legislation was not deemed to be invalid, nevertheless it was found to be inconsistent with the mandate provided in Section 92 of the Finance Act 1989 (primary legislation). </p>  <p>  While I am very aware of the importance of this scheme to those who benefit from it, I am also aware of the disquiet expressed by members of this house and others in respect of the difficulties around access to the scheme. With this in mind I have asked my officials to undertake a comprehensive review of the scheme, to include a broader review of mobility supports for persons with disabilities, and on foot of that review to bring forward proposals for consideration.</p>  <p>  Department officials have been carrying out preliminary work, including an examination of the main issues which will frame the scope of the review. Officials have also been engaging with other Departments in the context of other ongoing work in mobility supports. In particular, the Department has engaged with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth in the context of a working group established early last year by the Minister for Justice before the work was interrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic.

This has been confirmed by a survey recently conducted by the Central Bank of Ireland. That being said, it is recognised that some householders in specific areas or due to certain circumstances are still experiencing difficulties in securing such cover. As such, I have asked my officials to monitor the development you have mentioned, and engage with Insurance Ireland on the matter. </p>  <p>  However, you should be aware that the provision of insurance is a commercial matter for insurance companies, which is based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept. Consequently, neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products. This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance (Solvency II Directive). </p>  <p>  Current government policy in relation to increasing flood insurance coverage is primarily focused on the development of a sustainable, planned and risk-based approach to managing flooding problems. Almost &euro;1 billion in flood relief measures is being invested over the lifetime of the National Development Plan 2018-2027. The Department of Finance will continue to engage with the OPW, Insurance Ireland and other stakeholders regarding the levels of flood cover being provided. Finally, the Deputy should be assured that Minister of State Fleming and I will continue to proactively engage on all aspects of insurance reform including flood insurance issues. </p></reply>

While the wearing of face coverings is not mandatory within my Department&rsquo;s workplace at present, my Department recognises that some staff may wish to wear a mask while in the office. My Department has made a welcome back pack available to staff which includes 2 reusable face coverings. My Department has instituted infection protection and control measures - such as physical distancing and good hand and respiratory hygiene - and regularly communicates the need to follow Covid-related safety protocols to all staff.</p>  <p>  The position of those bodies under the aegis of my Department who currently have staff that come into close proximity with others by necessity of their work is set out below:</p>  <p>  While the majority of staff of the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General continue to work remotely in line with current Government and HSE guidelines, a small number of staff attend the office to meet critical business needs as they arise. Medical grade face masks compliant with EN 14683 are provided for use by such staff. All staff of the Central Bank of Ireland, including staff seconded to the Investor Compensation Company DAC, who return to work onsite are issued with 3 reusable face coverings to standard CWA 17553:2020. The wearing of face coverings is a requirement for all employees when moving around any of our premises. Disposable face coverings to standard EN 14683 are also available for staff who, as part of their work, cannot maintain 2 metre distance. This is identified through a line manager risk analysis of specific tasks under their control.</p>  <p>  The Irish Financial Services Appeals Tribunal provides medical grade masks in the EN14683 category to anybody who attends at their offices for any reason and who wishes to avail of them. </p>  <p>  The Office of the Revenue Commissioners use &lsquo;non-medical grade&rsquo;, CE certified type 1 and GB/T 32610 masks which are 3-ply, non-woven material with ear loops as specified under EN 14683 and have an EN equivalency of EN 149. At the time the masks were purchased it was advised by Government that medical grade masks were required for medical professionals and that standard masks or face coverings should apply for all others. Re-usable masks were recommended for Customs and the latest ones supplied to them have the requested rating of EN 14683.</p>  <p>  All staff at the  Tax Appeals Commission who, by necessity of their work have to come into close proximity with others, including other employees or members of the public are provided with medical grade masks. While the masks are not labelled with the EN14683 category, they are 3-ply medical grade masks with 99% bacteria filtration efficiency and are compatible with the European Standard for Medical Devices and comply with the recommendations of the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET). The wearing of a mask is also compulsory for members of the public who attend a hearing so, in the case that a person has mislaid or forgotten to bring one, additional masks are available in the Commission.</p></reply>

Reports of suspected cases have been followed up and carcasses submitted to DAFM&rsquo;s Regional Veterinary Laboratories for testing. Although dedicated surveys have not been possible, the available evidence suggests that RHD2 remains primarily a disease of rabbits, with some limited spill-over into hares. Furthermore, the total number of reports has declined noticeably in 2021. On this basis there are grounds for some cautious optimism that RHD2 may not have the potentially significant impact on the hare population that was initially feared. The exclusion zone was reduced to reflect this reality. </p>  <p>   The limited data available does not indicate that a local outbreak of RHD2 in rabbits leads to an outbreak in hares in the area. On this basis exclusion zones do not arise following the discovery of infected rabbits.</p>  <p>  My Department's officials have found no evidence that the disease mentioned (form of myxomatosis) has arrived in Ireland but will continue to monitor suspicious deaths. My officials will continue to work closely with colleagues in the regional laboratories and virology unit of DAFM in relation to testing for diseases in hares. </p>  <p>  The control of live hare coursing is carried out under the Greyhound Industry Act 1958, which is the responsibility of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  My responsibility relates to the conservation status of the hare and my Department issues licences required under the terms of the Wildlife Acts to facilitate the netting and tagging of hares.  There is no plan to revoke the licences issued.</p></reply>

My Department routinely seeks views of the public in relation to the control of certain wild bird species before such Declarations are made. My Department is committed to carrying out a review of all the species on the Declaration list on a phased basis.  This year, for example, a survey is being undertaken on the gull population.  The National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department intends to carry out a review of the issue of pigeon damage to crops, including the collection of new scientific data, with a view to informing decisions for future declarations.</p></reply>

It is crucial for birdlife in Ireland that we fully understand how our practices and actions can cumulatively impact on the viability of vulnerable bird species. </p>  <p>  The wild bird hunting season opened on September 1st and I am concerned at the potentially unsustainable hunting of birds of conservation concern in Ireland.</p>  <p>  As outlined in the 2019 Article 12 report of my Department's National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS), the conservation status of a number of species that are permitted to be hunted at certain times of the year under the Open Seasons Order is declining. These species include Red Grouse, Golden Plover, Woodcock, Shoveler and Snipe. It is difficult to assess the sustainability of this hunting, due to a number of data gaps, including on the numbers of birds hunted annually. </p>  <p>  It is clear, however, that the conservation of certain species will require new ways forward &ndash; based on scientific evidence, collaboration and strategic action. Any hunting of birds of conservation concern in Ireland must be sustainable and not have an adverse impact on the species. </p>  <p>  To this end, I have established a working group in NPWS to determine the next steps to be taken to achieve this, and to invite stakeholders to participate in a collaborative dialogue in the coming months to develop a plan for a sustainable future for these species in Ireland. In that, I want to respect fully the views of the various stakeholders; I accept that some may be diametrically opposed. Nonetheless, I am keen to find common ground. </p>  <p>  By the time the season comes around in 2022, the NPWS will have concluded a paper for me on the scientific and other types of information that must be collected to inform our assessments of whether these species may be hunted sustainably, and what is to be done in the short, medium and long term. </p>  <p>  This will include recommendations on the removal of certain species from the Order in time for next year&rsquo;s season if appropriate.</p></reply>

NSAI has produced additional guidance to some harmonised standards, under the CPR, in the form of Standard Recommendations (SRs) which set out appropriate minimum performance levels for specific intended uses of certain construction products in Ireland. </p>  <p>  In relation to the specification of concrete blocks, the relevant suite of harmonised standard facilitating specification of masonry units is the EN 771 (series).  &lsquo;I.S. EN 771-3:2011+A1:2015&rsquo; deals with aggregate concrete masonry units. NSAI has published additional guidance in the form of &lsquo;S.R. 325:2013+A2:2018/AC:2019 Recommendations for the design of masonry structures in Ireland to Eurocode 6&rsquo; which provides, inter alia, guidance on the choice of masonry units and mortar classes most appropriate for particular situations as regards durability for finished work in Ireland. S.R. 325:2013+A2:2018/AC: 2019 recommends the use of Category 1 aggregate concrete blocks, which requires independent third party oversight of factory production control by a Notified Body (a designated body that carries out third-party tasks).</p>  <p>  In respect of specification of aggregates for concrete (including concrete blocks), NSAI has published &lsquo;S.R. 16:2016 Guidance on the use of I.S. EN 12620:2002+A1:2008 - Aggregates for concrete&rsquo; which outlines the precautions to be taken in the quarry to reduce the risk of harmful impurities in aggregate production, again including the requirement for independent third party oversight of factory production control by a Notified Body.</p>  <p>  In respect of the specification of hardcore, the relevant harmonised standard is &lsquo;I.S. EN .S. EN 13242:2002+A1:2007 &ndash; Aggregates for unbound and hydraulically bound materials for use in civil engineering work and road construction&rsquo;. NSAI has published &lsquo;S.R. 21:2014+A1:2016 Guidance on the use of I.S. EN 13242:2002+A1:2007 &ndash; Aggregates for unbound and hydraulically bound materials for use in civil engineering work and road construction&rsquo; which includes the specification for hardcore (Annex E of S.R. 21) and outlines the precautions to be taken in the quarry to reduce the risk of harmful impurities in aggregate production and requires third party oversight of the manufacturing process.</p>  <p>  A full list of designated Notified Bodies for construction products may be found on the New Approach Notified and Designated Organisations (NANDO) Information System hosted by the European Commission.</p>  <p>  Separately, NSAI published &lsquo;I.S. 888:2016 Code of Practice for the procurement and use of unbound granular fill hardcore material for use under concrete floors&rsquo;, which outlines the requirements for post manufacturing operations of hardcore (beyond the quarry gate) such as procurement, haulage, delivery and receipt, storage and handling, placing, traceability and record management, with the aim of improving the chain of custody within the supply chain and ensuring the complete traceability of hardcore from the original manufacturer and source to the location where it is incorporated into the works.</p>  <p>  Ultimately, the manufacturer is responsible for compliance with the CPR and in particular for the Declaration of Performance/CE marking of the construction product he or she is placing on the market, having full knowledge of the raw material (as is legally required by the CPR via the relevant harmonised European Standards) and having regard to the end product&rsquo;s suitability for use in construction works in accordance with the relevant Standard Recommendations published by the NSAI.</p>  <p>  While the CPR came into force and has direct legal application across the entire European Union since 1 July 2013, each Member State is responsible for regulating for its own market surveillance activities in accordance with the specific requirements of the CPR and the broader overarching requirements of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019 on market surveillance and compliance of products and amending Directive 2004/42/EC and Regulations (EC) No 765/2008 and (EU) No 305/2011. Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 establishes an EU wide framework for market surveillance, and came into full effect in July 2021. This strengthens the existing provisions in the CPR (and other Union harmonisation legislation), relating to the compliance of products, the framework for cooperation with organisations representing economic operators or end users, the market surveillance of products and controls on products entering the EU market.</p>  <p>  Under the European Union (Construction Products) Regulations 2013 (S.I. No.225 of 2013), each of the building control authorities (local authorities) have been designated as the principal market surveillance authorities for construction products that fall within the scope of the CPR, within their administrative areas. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Act 2020 (Construction Products &ndash; Market Surveillance) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 682 of 2020) appointed Dublin City Council as a competent authority for the carrying out of market surveillance functions under the  European Union (Construction Products) Regulations 2013 for all related construction products on a nationwide basis. Dublin City Council-National Building Control Office, (DCC-NBCO) Market Surveillance Unit has been established for this purpose. DCC-NBCO may be contacted at: support@nbco.gov.ie.  Building control authorities will liaise with DCC-NBCO national market surveillance unit to support compliance with the CPR and to determine appropriate action on enforcement matters, as they arise. </p>  <p>  Market surveillance activity should enable non-compliant products to be identified and kept or taken off the market with unscrupulous and/or criminal economic operators prosecuted and penalised for their actions. In this context, it is important to note that the overarching objective of a market surveillance authority is to ensure that compliant products are placed on the market. Where non-compliance is identified, market surveillance activities should be designed to encourage economic operators to take appropriate corrective actions to redress the position within a reasonable period of time. </p>  <p>  Market surveillance authorities have significant powers including to obtain access to the place of manufacture or storage, request technical information, select samples of the construction product and carry out evaluations, examination or tests on such samples. Where construction products are placed on the market which do not comply with the requirements set out in the CPR, market surveillance authorities have powers to direct the relevant economic operator to take the necessary corrective actions to bring the product into compliance. Where this does not work, there are further procedures that may result in the product being withdrawn or recalled from the market, its use subject to special conditions, or the products availability on the market being prohibited or restricted. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s National market surveillance programme 2021 is published on the website of the European Commission. Section 2.5 provides specific details with the market surveillance of construction products and outlines a market surveillance campaign led by DCC-NBCO, which has recently commenced, to perform risk assessments of selected quarrying and pit operations, follow-up inspections, sampling and testing as appropriate to ensure compliance with the CPR.</p>  <p>  Finally, whilst the CPR focuses on the conditions which apply when placing a product on the market, clients, specifiers, designers and builders etc., should:</p>  <p>  - when drawing up specifications, refer to the harmonised technical specifications and specifically to the requirements of individual characteristics when necessary,</p>  <p>  - when choosing the products most suitable for their intended use in construction works, review the manufacturer&rsquo;s Declaration of Performance,</p>  <p>  - check the Standard Recommendations published by NSAI, which give guidance on appropriate minimum performance levels for specific intended uses of the product in Ireland, and</p>  <p>  - ensure compliance with the Building Regulations 1997 to 2021, in this regard all works should be carried out in a workmanlike manner, using proper materials which are fit for the use for which they are intended and for the conditions in which they are to be used.</p></reply>

As a result of well implemented safety protocols our staff were able to assist citizens who required passports for a range of emergency and urgent personal, business or legal reasons, or who had compelling humanitarian needs to travel.</p>  <p>  The Passport Service began scaling up to more normal operational levels on 4 May 2021, in line with the phased easing of restrictions set out in &ldquo;COVID-19 Resilience and Recovery 2021 &ndash; The Plan Ahead&rdquo; while continuing to operate the emergency service for priority cases for which customers are encouraged to contact our Customer Service Hub if they require assistance.  In line with our continued scaling up of services my Department are actively planning for the opening of our Public Offices for the processing of urgent applications for those renewing their passport.  We will be making a public announcement on specific dates shortly.</p>  <p>  The Passport Service has received nearly 500,000 applications in 2021 to date, with approximately 110,000 under process. These applications comprise of 43,000 valid applications which are with the Passport Service and 67,000 incomplete applications that require action by the applicant. </p>  <p>  The current turnaround times are</p>  <p>  -10 working days for Simple Adult renewals,</p>  <p>  -15 working days for Complex renewals,;</p>  <p>  -40 working days for First Time applications on Passport Online and</p>  <p>  - 8 weeks for Passport Express.</p>  <p>  These turnaround times for Passport Online applications begins when all required supporting documentation is received by the Passport Service.  For reasons of integrity, the Passport Service is not in a position to process applications that are incomplete as these are not valid applications.  Such applications will inevitably encounter longer processing times.</p>  <p>  First time applications for adults and children are complex applications involving measures to assure the true identity of the applicant, their entitlement to Irish citizenship and, in the case of children, that all guardians have consented to the issuing of the passport. Particular complexity relates to the process of applications from children born in Ireland after 2004 due to the need to verify entitlement for Irish citizenship.</p>  <p>  The Passport Service continually examines how to improve processing times, including examining the processes around the verification and processing of the supporting documentation for first time applicants, and any delays that have been experienced by our customers as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the high demand seen in recent months as international travel resumed. However, the Passport Service has a great deal of experience in dealing with peaks in demand is a strong basis for confidence, taking into account measures to ensure a safe workplace, that we will return to more normal turnaround times for the processing of first time applications soon.  </p>  <p>  The Passport Service will continue to review its processes in order to identify further efficiencies that can be made to improve the efficiency of our services and improve customer experience while continuing to protect the integrity of the Irish Passport.  </p></reply>

I call for an end to violence, the immediate and unconditional release of all those detained, including the President and State Counsellor, and the restoration of a legitimate, civilian Government. </p>  <p>  As a result of the coup, there is a political and humanitarian crisis in Myanmar. The country is suffering from conflict, severe economic recession, large-scale displacement, collapsing public and health services and a significant surge in COVID-19 cases. This crisis affects not just Myanmar, but threatens the stability of the region. Ireland supports an urgent, international effort to address pressing humanitarian issues within Myanmar.</p>  <p>  Ireland continues to provide humanitarian assistance for the most vulnerable communities in Myanmar and I have called on the Myanmar military to allow unhindered access to all regions for humanitarian workers. My Department continues to provide significant resources to humanitarian partners in Myanmar, with approximately &euro;2.5 million approved for 2021 to date.  In July, the Emergency Response Fund Scheme (ERFS) was activated in support of a project to ensure that women and girls affected by the crisis in the conflict affected Kayah State are protected from, and treated for, the consequences of Gender Based Violence.</p>  <p>  My Department is also engaged in regular discussions with the UN organisations, International NGOs, Human Rights Groups and other organisations working actively on the ground.</p>  <p>  Ireland supports the adoption of the sanctions against the perpetrators of the coup and the economic entities that sustain them. In this regard, I endorsed the strong and comprehensive approach set out in the Council Conclusions adopted by the FAC on February 22 and the adoption of sanctions on 22 March, 19 April and 21 June. We are currently working with the EU to consider further actions which will work to restore the democratic path in Myanmar and not negatively affect developmental gains or exacerbate the humanitarian situation.</p>  <p>  Ireland continues to engage with discussions at the UN Security Council which has expressed deep concerns regarding developments in Myanmar, strongly condemned the use of violence by the military, and called for the release of all those detained. While this united position is welcome, Ireland would also like to see the Security Council agree more tangible actions to ensure peace and democracy in Myanmar. </p>  <p>  The crisis remains on the agenda of the Security Council and the Irish Mission to the UN continues to engage actively for a peaceful solution to the crisis. Through the UN and our Embassy network, we are encouraging all those who have influence on the military leadership to use it to find a political resolution to this crisis and protect the human rights of the people of Myanmar.</p></reply>

Ireland urged the DPRK to take immediate steps to halt all human rights violations, to cooperate with the Special Rapporteur&rsquo;s mandate, and to fully implement the human rights treaties to which they are party.</p>  <p>  This year Ireland co-sponsored a Resolution at the Human Rights Council, which condemned in the strongest possible terms the long-standing and ongoing systematic, widespread and gross human rights violations and other human rights abuses committed in the DPRK. The Resolution drew attention to findings made by the Commission of Inquiry in its report, including the denial of the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, including the right to adopt a religion or belief. The Resolution urges the Government of the DPRK to ensure the right to freedom of religion or belief. It also raises severe concerns about the discrimination under the songbun system, which classifies people based on State-assigned social class and birth and includes consideration of political opinions and religion. </p>  <p>  Freedom of religion or belief is a priority for Ireland&rsquo;s engagement on human rights issues at the UN. In February, Ireland signed a joint letter to the President of the UN Security Council, requesting that the agenda item, &lsquo;The situation in the Democratic People&rsquo;s Republic of Korea&rsquo; remain on the list of items of which the Council is seized. This provides a possibility to discuss the DPRK, including human rights issues, at Security Council level. Ireland joined others in repeating this request at a meeting of the Security Council on 25 August. My Department will continue to assess the situation in the DPRK, paying particular attention to the human rights situation and all independent and credible reports of violations, and in the specific context of Ireland&rsquo;s membership of the Security Council.</p></reply>

Progress on its implementation is crucial, for families and victims and for society as a whole. It was agreed in 2014 by both Governments and the political parties after intensive negotiations, and it must be implemented. </p>  <p>  The proposals published by the British Government on 14 July last for a &lsquo;Statute of Limitations&rsquo;, ending criminal investigations and prosecutions relating to Troubles-related incidents, as well as inquests and civil litigation, have caused significant upset, shock and concern. They represent a very radical departure from the Stormont House Agreement and we do not accept them as the basis of a way forward.</p>  <p>  Where the British Government are proposing significant changes to that framework, these must be discussed and agreed by both Governments and the parties to the Northern Ireland Executive. Only through a collective approach can we hope to deal with these issues comprehensively and fairly and in a way that responds to the needs of victims, survivors and society. </p>  <p>  Following a meeting of the British Irish Intergovernmental Conference on 24 June, we agreed to begin an intensive process of engagement with the British Government and the Northern Ireland parties to find an agreed way forward, with discussions beginning in July. Importantly, this process has engaged fully with victims&rsquo; representatives. The intention is to find an agreed way forward that will allow implementing legislation to be introduced in both the UK and Ireland by the end of this Autumn.  </p>  <p>  It is the position of the Government that there should be effective investigations into all Troubles-related deaths, regardless of the perpetrator. The rule of law and the protections afforded by the European Convention on Human Rights must apply equally to everyone and must be upheld, and this principle is at the core of the Stormont House framework.</p>  <p>  We have strongly communicated our position on this issue to the British Government and will continue to do so, and to caution in the clearest terms against any unilateral action. I spoke with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Brandon Lewis, on 3 September on this and the ongoing legacy engagement process.  The Government will continue to engage and work with the British Government and the parties represented on the Northern Ireland Executive on this very important issue in the period immediately ahead.</p></reply>

These students had the choice to sit examinations, (adjusted to take account of students' experience over their Senior Cycle), opt for Accredited Grades, or both, on a subject by subject basis.   In 2020 a system of Leaving Certificate Calculated Grades was offered to students following the decision that it would not be possible, for public health reasons, to conduct that year&rsquo;s Leaving Certificate examinations in the normal manner. This was followed by a later sitting of the Leaving Certificate examinations following which candidates who both sat the examinations and received Calculated Grades were awarded their best results between the two systems in their final results. </p>  <p>  The results of the 2021 Leaving Certificate were issued to students on 3 September.  Under the legislation which underpins the system of Accredited Grades, the 2021 Leaving Certificate comprises examinations and Accredited Grades.  The Leaving Certificate results which issued to candidates on their provisional statements and which will be issued on the Final Certificates are the results of the 2021 Leaving Certificate and do not distinguish examination grades from Accredited Grades. The overall profile of results this year is somewhat stronger than the profile of results in 2020. </p>  <p>  Due to the twin track approach to providing Leaving Certificate 2021, the 2021 outcomes are a unique set of outcomes reflecting the exceptional arrangements that were put in place for the 2021 Leaving Certificate. Ultimately, these are the Leaving Certificate results for 2021 which have the same status as any other Leaving Certificate as a measure of attainment at the end of Senior Cycle.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the Leaving Certificate is to measure attainment and satisfy the achievement of completion of second level education.  The results of the Leaving Certificate are used by candidates following a number of different paths, including as a means of entry to the world of work, to apprenticeships or traineeships, to further education or to higher education.  The Central Applications Office (CAO) and the Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) use the results of the examination to regulate entry into Higher Education.  The entry requirements for third level education are matters for the HEIs, who are autonomous bodies, and they deal with these matters through the central applications process in line with their own decisions.  At a departmental level, responsibility for entry into further and higher education is a matter for the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science. </p></reply>

The approach to antigen setting in education settings, including in schools will be informed by these pilots.</p>  <p>  The Department of Education will continue to work with the group as it is considered important that any data collected from a pilot of antigen testing within the wider education sector is available to inform decisions on the appropriateness of more widespread deployment of such tests within the schools sector and the potential to scale to the sector.</p>  <p>  The Department has an ongoing close working relationship with the Department of Health and the HSE throughout the period of the pandemic in the context of implementing important infection prevention control measures in schools to ensure that they can operate safely.  </p></reply>

This is an increase of 269 classes from the previous school year and will ensure that approximately 12,700 special class places will be available this year, including 1,600 new special class places. </p><p>Since 2011, the number of special classes in mainstream schools has increased by almost 386% from 548 to 2,118 for the 2021/2022 school year.</p><p>Budget 2021 provided for an additional 990 additional SNAs for allocation to schools, bringing the total numbers to 18,000 by December 2021.</p><p>This allocation of SNAs is to meet the care needs of pupils in 2021 and will enable the establishment of new special classes, creation of new places in special schools, support children in mainstream classes for the 2021/22 school year.</p><p>This will represent an increase of increase of 70% in the number of SNAs provided since 2011 at which point 10,575 SNAs were available.</p><p>The NCSE have published the SNA allocations on their website www.ncse.ie. </p><p>Where circumstances change during the course of the 2021/22 school year that materially increase the level of care need in a school to the extent that the school can clearly demonstrate that it cannot be met within the existing SNA allocation, the school may apply to the NCSE for a review.  Detailed information on the NCSE exceptional review process is published on the NCSE website ncse.ie/for-schools.</p><p>The NCSE manages the exceptional review process and handles each case individually. Some review requests can be concluded as an office based exercise, whilst others require a school to be visited. The timeframe for concluding a review can vary depending on the school context or the nature of the information provided. </p><p>The NCSE has responsibility for planning and coordinating school supports for children with special educational needs including the allocation of SNAs and reviews. The Department does not have a role in making individual school determinations. Accordingly, the question has been referred to the NCSE for direct reply.</p></reply>

Broadband capacity can vary across geographical locations and is dependent on local infrastructure which can impact on the service that can be provided in individual schools.</p>  <p>  The school referred to is preparing to move to a new school building, and to maintain connectivity and existing broadband contracts, the Department's Schools Broadband Service Desk has requested the current provider of the service to the school to migrate the existing wireless service to the new school building in time for the opening. The service provider will be in contact with the school in due course. The provision of telephony and the related installation of phone lines, is the responsibility of the school. The school should contact their preferred telephone provider and they will take the school through the ordering process.</p>  <p>  This school is included in the National Broadband Plan Intervention Area Plan for which implementation is now under way, and the provision of high speed connectivity to the almost 700 primary schools in that area is to be accelerated for delivery by the end of 2022.

When the high speed infrastructure is in place for this school through the NBP, the service will be upgraded to the school through the Schools Broadband Programme.</p>  <p>  The Schools Broadband Service Desk is the central point of contact providing schools with information, advice and technical support in relation to the Schools Broadband Programme.

To date expenditure on the scheme is almost &euro;8.7 billion. </p>  <p>  The number of customers in receipt of PUP is continuing to fall at a pace from a peak of over 602,000  to just over 114,600 this week as a result of the gradual lifting of restrictions and the success of the Covid-19 vaccination programme. The requirement for special arrangements is diminishing and it is important in the interests of equity and sustainability to restore standard social welfare terms. </p>  <p>  To allow as much time as possible for the economy to re-open and for employments to recover, the Government agreed to taper the payment of PUP over time between September 2021 and February 2022 to align it with the standard jobseekers terms.</p>  <p>  From this week, the 14th of September, the maximum rate of PUP of &euro;350 has reduced to &euro;300, the current rate of &euro;300 reduced to &euro;250 and the rate of &euro;250 has changed to &euro;203. Two further phases of rate changes are scheduled to take place from 16th November 2021 and 8th February 2022. </p>  <p>  The Government also agreed that PUP customers who were paid the &euro;203 rate of payment before 14th September would transition to standard Jobseeker terms commencing this month. </p>  <p>This process was due to begin in early September. However, I have deferred this process until after all sectors have started to re-open in line with the publication of the Government's Roadmap "Reframing the Challenge, Continuing Our Recovery and Reconnecting". This approach will support individuals working in those sectors of the economy that are re-opening more slowly than others. This means that all affected customers, those who were currently in receipt of the PUP &euro;203 rate, will not see any changes to their PUP payments until after 26th   October. Work on the transition process will commence at the end of September when the Department will write to all affected customers to outline the changes.  There are also a wide range of employment supports available for PUP recipients as part of Pathways to Work strategy.</p>  <p>  The means tested Supplementary Welfare Allowance Scheme also remains available through the Community Welfare Service at the local Intreo Centre for any person who is experiencing financial hardship. Supports provided under the scheme include Supplements and Urgent and Exceptional Needs Payments.</p>  <p>  I hope that this clarifies the position at this time for the Deputy.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-09-16a.662.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021091600089#WRP03100"><p>In July I met with some of those involved in writing the report, and I welcome the report's findings and proposals. </p>  <p>  On working conditions and staffing, the report highlights the low wages of those who work in early learning and care (ELC) and school-age childcare (SAC) services. I firmly believe that their level of pay does not reflect the value of the work practitioners do for children, for families and for the wider society and economy. It also contributes to challenges of recruitment and retention of staff, which are key to the consistency of care provided to children, as the report notes.</p>  <p>  The State cannot determine wages in the sector as it is not the employer. However, I am committed to doing what is in my power to improve wages and working conditions. That is why last December I began a process to examine the possibility of regulating pay and conditions in the sector and the suitability of a Joint Labour Committee (JLC). In agreement with IBEC/Childhood Services Ireland, and SIPTU, I appointed Dr Kevin Duffy, former Chair of the Labour Court, to be the independent chair of this process. </p>  <p>  On foot of Dr Duffy&rsquo;s report, on 11 March I wrote to the Minister of State for Business, Employment and Retail, recommending the establishment of a JLC for the sector. </p>  <p>  In line with the provisions of the Industrial Relations Acts, the Labour Court recommended establishment of a JLC, and Minister English has now accepted the Labour Court&rsquo;s recommendations. The Establishment Order came into effect at the beginning of July. The JLC will provide an opportunity for unions and employer representatives to work together to determine wages and working conditions for ELC and SAC. </p>  <p>  The report also highlights issues of affordability and of the level of public investment in the sector. First 5, the whole-of-Government strategy for babies, young children and their families, commits to at least doubling investment in ELC and SAC in the decade to 2028. A key vehicle to ensure that such significant additional investment delivers for children, families and the State will be a new funding model. The new funding model will be the framework for additional investment in services in return for clear evidence of quality and affordability to ensure effective use of public funding. </p>  <p>  An Expert Group has been leading the work on developing this new funding model since 2019. The Group is independently chaired and includes national and international experts in ELC and SAC systems, funding, quality, economics, and relevant policy experts from the Government Departments who will be involved in implementing the new funding model. They have met eighteen times to date and it is expected that their report will be submitted in November 2021. It is anticipated that the Expert Group&rsquo;s work will inform the Budget 2022 process and my officials are already engaged in this. </p>  <p>  ELC and SAC services are private businesses and are free to set their own policies regarding the charging of fees and contract conditions. First 5 sets out, as part of the reform of the funding model, the development of an appropriate mechanism to control fees charged to parents in return for increased State investment in affordability, quality and sustainability. As set out in the Terms of Reference for the Expert Group, an essential and top priority for this Group will be to make recommendations for a mechanism to control fee rates for different types of provision for ELC/SAC. The Programme for Government sets out a commitment to examine the approach of other European countries to set a cap on parental fees, irrespective of income.</p>  <p>  The research partner for the funding model project, Frontier Economics, has produced eight working papers, with three that directly address affordability issues including international comparisons of fees and public investment, approaches to funding the ELC sector, and mechanisms to control fees charged to parents. Further information on the work of the Expert Group and documentation related to the process is available at www.first5fundingmodel.ie.</p></reply>

This commitment to improvement is underpinned by the current review which gives specific attention to children whose parents are not working or in education or training.</p>  <p>  The basis for the design of the National Childcare Scheme is provided in the 2016 Policy Paper on the Development of the Single Affordable Childcare Scheme. This informed the Childcare Support Act which was debated and progressed through both Houses of the Oireachtas in 2018. </p>  <p>  Better outcomes for children is the primary objective both in the 2016 policy paper and the scheme design. The schemes objectives are to promote (i) a reduction in child poverty, (ii) positive child development outcomes, (iii) labour market activation and (iv) improved quality.   These objectives are inherently interrelated and sustain each other.</p>  <p>  The policy was informed by national and international evidence and advocacy on measures to prevent poverty (including inter-generational poverty). The policy sought to strike the right balance between enabling early learning and care services or indeed school age childcare services, to meet the needs of children in terms of their positive development and tackling a significant contributor to poverty and poorer outcomes for children of non-work households.</p>  <p>  There is strong evidence that growing up in poverty has negative impacts on child outcomes. For example, according to the ESRI study Understanding Childhood Deprivation in Ireland (Watson et al., 2012), the longer-term impacts of poverty among children include lower levels of educational achievement, emotional and behavioural problems, and poorer health outcomes.</p>  <p>  The research evidence suggests that parental employment is a key factor in protecting children from poverty and deprivation. The ESRI / Watson study concluded that parental unemployment is a significant risk factor in determining deprivation rates among children, with particularly high deprivation rates where a parent has never worked, or in lone parent households, or where the mother has no educational qualifications.</p>  <p>  Childcare costs in Ireland (prior to the NCS) have been found to be a significant factor in contributing to low levels of participation in employment, education and training for mothers, particularly for lone parents. The NCS makes childcare much more affordable, and in some instances free to parents.</p>  <p>  The NCS policy paper highlighted the dangers of poverty traps in childcare schemes, particularly where there is a risk of steep rises in childcare costs where a parent returns to work. Such traps undermine the incentive to take-up or increase employment.  Therefore the NCS was designed to counteract this disincentive effect, through a smooth taper rate across the income assessed subsidies, and also through a transition from unemployment to work/study which increases the number of hours available.</p>  <p>  Research by Melhuish et al. (2015) and Sylva et al (2004), in the NCS policy paper indicates that positive children&rsquo;s outcomes are for the most part met through part-time participation. This research has been used internationally in the design of various interventions. (DCEDIY is extremely grateful to have one of those authors, Prof Melhuish from Oxford University, on the Funding Model Expert Group.) </p>  <p>  Melhuish and Sylva's research points to the fact that young children do not need to be in early learning and care for full time hours to meet their child development needs. As such, many schemes around the world are based on 15 to 20 hours per week. In Ireland's case, the State is now providing two years of free pre-school to all children before they start school for 15 hours per week. The NCS  provides 20 hours of subsidised early learning and care per week where a parent is available at home, for children aged from six months, or 20 hours of school age childcare in non- term/ non ECCE time. </p>  <p>  The OECD&rsquo;s 2017 study Faces of Joblessness in Ireland, which included an ex ante analysis of the impact of the National Childcare Scheme, stressed the impact of work incentives on joblessness. It reported positively on the likely impact of the NCS. </p>  <p>  Households on incomes of less than &euro;26,000 NET can access full subsidies of up to &euro;225 per child, per week, covering up to 45 hours week. To access 45 hours rather than 20 hours, the parent must be in some type of employment or be engaged in training. The definition of work or study is broad, covering all forms of work or study arrangements: full-time, part-time, week-on/week-off and zero hour contracts.  Moreover, the minimum hours required to engage in work or study to qualify for up to 45 hours per week is very low &ndash; at just two hours per week. In this way, the NCS encourages parents to exit poverty and deliver better outcomes for their children.</p>  <p>  For children living in exceptional circumstances of disadvantage or need, the NCS sponsorship arrangement is designed so that they can access free early learning and care or school age childcare for longer or full time hours where required. </p>  <p>  The DCEDIY is committed to keeping the scheme under review and to assess whether it is meeting its objectives. I have contracted Frontier Economics to undertake a review of the National Childcare Scheme in line with Section 26 of the Childcare Support Act.  </p>  <p>  In conducting this review, I asked the consultant to give consideration to NCS and the application of a work-study test, which determines the number of subsidised hours of early learning and childcare a child may be eligible for under the Scheme.</p>  <p>  This work is due to be finalised in the final quarter of this year and will inform in an evidence based manner the future development of the scheme.</p></reply>

Places will be provided through increased and incentivised provision in full time undergraduate provision. 3,000 new places on 138 full-time undergraduate courses in 22 higher education institutions were funded for autumn 2020 and 2021. A further 1,101 places on 1 and 2 year ICT graduate conversion courses are on offer under the Springboard+ 2021 initiative to commence in 2021/22 academic year. </p><p>HCI Pillar 3, Innovation and Agility has two key areas of focus &ndash; innovation in modes and methods of delivery and an agility fund. It aims to ensure that courses in areas of skills needs demonstrate innovative methods of teaching and delivery, which will include flexibility in course provision. HCI Pillar 3 will deliver 22 projects in higher education institutions, 17 of which involve collaborations between institutions. The projects include the use of virtual laboratories in higher education, a new hub to upskill the building sector on green construction, and the establishment of Creative Futures Academy to support digital and screen culture, cinema, literature and broadcasting, art, design, and fashion. &euro;10m was reallocated to July stimulus from Pillar 3 in 2020 to Springboard plus and HCI Pillar 1. </p><p>The Human Capital Initiative (HCI) commenced a five-year funding programme in 2020.

When centres were allowed to reopen they did so only at 50-60% capacity due to social distancing measures which have been in place. </p>  <p>  However as we begin to reopen society safely the apprenticeship system can start to return to 100% operational capacity. This is seen in the plans for the month of September, whereby almost 3,000 apprentices have been scheduled to commence their off-the-job phase as we return to full capacity for the first time since March 2020.  Classes in October and onwards will continue to be scheduled at full capacity, subject to local conditions and prevailing public health advice.</p></reply>

The average duration is provided by programme, with the exception of the Electronic Security Systems programme as this programme has a substantial number of apprentices who, because of their industry experience, have been through a process of recognition of prior learning (RPL).  As a result they often start at phase 6 of the programme and this consequently means they have a much lower duration on average (c2.5 years). Note that some programmes have a slightly lower than 4 year duration on average but this is due to the fact that some apprentices have received time exemptions as part of their apprenticeship, thus reducing the duration overall. </p><p>The figures are an analysis of apprentices who have qualified.  As the Deputy is aware, there is currently a backlog in accessing off-the-job training for a number of craft apprenticeships which will increase average programme duration for the current cohort of craft apprentices.  Work is ongoing on addressing the backlogs, including providing a permanent increase in system capacity and also in providing targeted responses to increase off-the-job training places until all waiting lists have been addressed. <table>    <tr>       <th>Trade</th>       <th><div>Average Duration in Years</div></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>AGRICULTURAL MECHANICS</td>       <td><div>3.87</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>AIRCRAFT MECHANICS            </td>       <td><div>4.08</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>BRICK AND STONELAYING</td>       <td><div>4.22</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>CARPENTRY AND JOINERY</td>       <td><div>4.18</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>CONSTRUCTION PLANT FITTING</td>       <td><div>4.11</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>ELECTRICAL</td>       <td><div>4.17</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>ELECTRICAL INSTRUMENTATION</td>       <td><div>4.29</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>FARRIERY                      </td>       <td><div>4.21</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>HEAVY VEHICLE MECHANICS</td>       <td><div>4.08</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>INDUSTRIAL INSULATION</td>       <td><div>4.03</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>INSTRUMENTATION</td>       <td><div>3.97</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>M.A.M.F.                      </td>       <td><div>4.07</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>METAL FABRICATION</td>       <td><div>4.26</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>MOTOR MECHANICS</td>       <td><div>4.14</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>PAINTING AND DECORATING</td>       <td><div>4.13</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>PIPEFITTING</td>       <td><div>4.20</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>PLASTERING</td>       <td><div>4.25</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>PLUMBING                      </td>       <td><div>4.12</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>REFRIGERATION AND AIR CONDITIONING</td>       <td><div>4.12</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>SHEET METALWORKING            </td>       <td><div>4.23</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>STONECUTTING AND STONEMASONRY </td>       <td><div>4.15</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>TOOLMAKING</td>       <td><div>4.08</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>VEHICLE BODY REPAIRS</td>       <td><div>4.13</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>WOOD MANUFACTURING AND FINISHING</td>       <td><div>4.16</div></td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

Each minor is assigned a case officer who liaises with the court appointed guardian. The case officer meets with the guardian to work through any requirements and provide assistance in terms of accommodation, care, health needs and access to services. The case officer in the Wards of Court Office also liaises directly with a case manager, overseeing the care of the minor on behalf of the guardian or parents, where one is appointed. </p>  <p>  I am further informed that the Wards of Court Office is cognisant of difficulties that can be encountered by the guardians of minor wards of court and always strives to ensure that they are dealt with sensitively with the minor's wellbeing at the centre of all considerations. </p>  <p>  The Courts Service advises that in a small number of cases, the General Solicitor is appointed as guardian of a minor by the court and the Wards of Court Office deals directly with the Office of the General Solicitor in those circumstances. The Office of the General Solicitor will liaise with the next of kin or care provider of the minor. </p>  <p>  Any concerns that a guardian has in relation to their dealings with the Wards of Court Office can also be addressed to the Registrar of Wards of Court or through the Courts Service customer&rsquo;s complaint procedure.  </p>  <p>  Family law reform is a major element of the Justice Plan 2021. The Programme for Government contains a commitment to enact a Family Court Bill to create a new dedicated Family Court within the existing court structure and provide for court procedures that support a faster and less adversarial resolution of disputes in specialised centres. In September 2020, Government approved the drafting of a Family Court Bill along the lines of the General Scheme, which has been published. The General Scheme has been referred to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel for drafting and to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice for pre-legislative scrutiny. It should be noted that it is not intended that the Family Court Bill will make provision for matters relating to wards of court, be they children or adults.</p>  <p>  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 provides a modern statutory framework to support decision-making by adults with capacity difficulties. The Minister for Children, Disability, Equality, Integration and Youth has responsibility for matters relating to the commencement or amendment of the 2015 Act.</p></reply>

Since 12 March 2020, over 125,000 COVID-19 related Vetting Applications have been processed and GNVB have been instrumental in supporting efforts to curb the impact of coronavirus across Ireland.</p>  <p>  Throughout this period, GNVB has focused on ensuring that minimum disruption was caused to the vetting process for the 26,600 relevant organisations working with children and vulnerable persons across Ireland, despite the huge demands placed on the services of the GNVB.</p>  <p>  I am further advised that the GNVB has recently experienced a pent up demand from relevant organisations upon their resumption of services following the easing of restrictions. This has resulted in the GNVB receiving exceptionally large amounts of vetting applications within very short timeframes, as opposed to the more traditional spread of applications annually. </p>  <p>  This has caused larger than normal vetting applications to be in the system at the same time, and with other pressing demands, has extended the traditional turnaround times from 5 working days, to approximately 7/8 working days for most applications.</p>  <p>  The GNVB has previously communicated with all of the relevant organisations to advise them of the current turnaround times and to assure them that the GNVB continues to process their vetting applications as expeditiously as possible.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, Minister McEntee announced in April, the establishment of an inter-departmental group to undertake a review of Garda vetting arrangements and legislation. The group will make recommendations for amending legislation and strengthening the Garda vetting process and is due to report by the end of 2021.</p></reply>

The Deputy can be assured that all decisions are taken with the greatest of care and in full knowledge of the individual applicant&rsquo;s circumstances, insofar as they have been made known to us. The existing legislative and operational processes cater for all situations which may arise, particularly in those cases where the exercise of ministerial discretion may be warranted.</p></reply>

Scientific and clinical evidence is evolving on the long-term effects of COVID-19. An increasing number of reports and studies are now being published on the topic, however, at present there is no agreement on the definition or the terminology.</p><p>It is recognised that persistent and prolonged symptoms can occur after acute COVID-19 infection in a proportion of patients, including in some patients who did not develop symptoms severe enough to require hospitalisation. My Department, through the Health Research Board, continues to fund research into the clinical impacts of COVID-19.</p><p>Patients with persistent symptoms following COVID-19 infection may be followed up by their GP or in hospital settings as clinically appropriate. People in the community who are concerned about persistent symptoms following Covid-19 should contact their GP in the first instance. Treatment is currently focused on management of specific symptoms.</p><p>Specific guidance on the treatment of 'Long COVID' is presently under development both here and internationally.  You may wish to note that the HSE is currently recruiting for the position of an Implementation Lead to oversee the implementation of a national model of care.</p><p>The HSE is currently assessing need and the best way to care for those impacted by Long COVID to ensure the appropriate supports are in place. As part of this work on post-COVID care, the HSE is examining how it can model the possible numbers that will be affected, noting that this will take time as more evidence emerges. I understand that the HSE has also been in touch with a group of people who are suffering post-COVID symptoms to inform understanding.</p><p>The Department of Health will continue to develop an understanding of the implications of Long COVID to inform policy as appropriate.</p><p>As this question relates to a service matter, it has also been referred to the Health Service Executive for attention and direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

There is no provision under the GMS GP contract for persons who hold a medical card or GP visit card to be charged for medical services provided under the contract. </p>  <p>  It is a matter for the treating GP to determine in the case of each individual patient what is proper and necessary care. In circumstances where a GP, in the exercise of his/her clinical judgement, determines that a particular treatment or service requested by a patient is not clinically necessary, but the patient still wishes to receive same, it is at the GPs discretion as to whether he/she imposes a charge for providing the service/treatment in question.</p>  <p>   </p>  <p>  Consultation fees charged by GPs outside the terms of the GMS contracts are a matter of private contract between the clinicians and their patients.

My Department and the HSE discussed this issue previously with the relevant GP representative body.  However, it did not prove possible to achieve agreement that no charges for blood tests would be applied in any circumstances. It is intended to raise this issue again at an appropriate time. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that the GP chronic disease management programme which is being phased in, having commenced last year, will involve the ongoing monitoring of patients&rsquo; conditions and any blood tests required in this context will be covered by the fees payable for this care.  </p>  <p>  The position remains that where a patient who holds a medical card or GP visit card believes he or she has been incorrectly charged for routine phlebotomy services by his or her GP, then that patient should report the matter to their HSE Local Health Office. The local management, upon being notified of potential inappropriate charging of GMS patients, carry out an investigation into each complaint and will, where appropriate, arrange for a refund of charges incorrectly applied by the GP. </p></reply>

It recognised Ireland's history of leadership on tobacco control and provided an opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to tobacco control and to the international agreements of which Ireland is a signatory. The conference is the premier convention on tobacco&ndash;related topics and serves as one of the main opportunities for continuing international engagement on the global tobacco control conversation.</p>  <p>  The 2021 conference was postponed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic but a Leadership Summit on Tobacco Control is being held in its place as an online event. While it is most unfortunate that the physical conference cannot go ahead, the Leadership Summit does provide the opportunity for Ireland to reaffirm our commitment to addressing the tobacco epidemic. Both the Taoiseach and I will be delivering remarks to the Summit that will speak to Ireland's ongoing commitment to progressing tobacco control at home as well as supporting international efforts to curb tobacco use across the globe. The Summit will provide a platform for sharing knowledge and experience and for identifying future initiatives that will help to reduce the preventable death and ill-health attributable to tobacco smoking. </p>  <p>  Ireland is committed to fully engaging with our EU and international colleagues at the Leadership Summit, in discussions around the review of the Tobacco Products Directive at EU level and at the Conference of the Parties meeting on the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control in November. My Department has already engaged with the European Commission in its review of the Tobacco Products Directive and we will play an active role in any future discussions at Member State level on how the Directive is reshaped. Similarly, we look forward to positively contributing to discussions that will take place during the Conference of the Parties. We will ensure that, wherever possible, the key lessons on tobacco control initiatives from the Leadership Summit are carried forward into each of these fora.</p></reply>

This is a generic policy framework for rare diseases. The scope of the plan is broad given that there are approximately 8,000 rare diseases affecting millions of EU citizens; and consequently, there can be a dearth of expertise and knowledge about some rare diseases, simply because they are so rare.</p>  <p>  Many of the major recommendations of the plan have already been implemented including the establishment of a HSE National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases and a Rare Disease Office.  Building on this progress, themes for inclusion in a roadmap for the coming period were agreed, with the Rare Disease Task Force, which comprises the main rare disease advocacy groups; Rare Disease Ireland (RDI), the Medical Research Charities Group (MRCP), and  the Irish Platform for Patient Organisations, Science and Industry (IPPPOSI). </p>  <p>  In late 2020, the National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases was operationalised and incorporated into the National Rare Disease Office. So, from 01 September 2020, the NRDO became the main contact point and driver for national HSE rare disease projects and initiatives. The work of the NRDO is overseen and governed by HSE Acute Operations under the governance of the Office of the Chief Clinical Officer, where the National Rare Disease Plan is firmly embedded.</p>  <p>  Meetings to ensure that the input and the voice of the patient is represented in the ongoing work in relation to Rare Diseases, took place at regular intervals with the Rare Disease Task Force, the HSE National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases and the Rare Disease Office.  Continuing this practice, earlier this year (2021) I met with the HSE, The NRDO and The Rare Disease Taskforce and a very fruitful discussion was held regarding priority areas for the future in order to build on the significant progress made to date in implementing the Rare Disease Plan. A number, of key themes for inclusion in a roadmap for the coming period have been agreed.</p></reply>

The NIAC has now recommended that a booster dose of an mRNA vaccine (irrespective of whether the primary vaccination course was of an mRNA or adenoviral vector) for residents aged 65 years and older living in Long Term Residential Care Facilities and for those aged 80 years and older living in the community.</p>  <p>  The booster dose can be given after a minimal interval of six months following completion of the primary vaccination schedule.

This allows online applicants to be advised of certain errors at an early stage and to correct any such issues without penalty.</p>  <p>  The Department is also developing a new Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS). This database underpins payments to farmers under area-based schemes. </p>  <p>  The new LPIS gives farmers a more accurate representation of land parcel boundaries, and is based on the most up-to-date technologies and Ordnance Survey Ireland mapping standards.</p>  <p>  The Department is also participating in EU projects dealing with the uptake of new technologies for the modernisation of CAP controls and interactions with farmers. For example, the introduction of Checks by Monitoring (CbM) for the Protein Aid Scheme in 2021 is the first step in the implementation of the Area Monitoring System (AMS), which will be compulsory in the new CAP. CbM is an automated and continuous process which will use satellite data along with other data sources to determine the agricultural activity on all land parcels declared by farmers under the Protein Aid Scheme in 2021.</p>  <p>  The use of satellite data and technologies such as AgriSnap, DAFM&rsquo;s geotagged photo app for Checks by Monitoring, will have significant benefits for farmers. For example, CbM facilitates prior notification of Protein Aid Scheme applicants of non-compliances concerning crop type, and provides the applicant with the opportunity to amend their claim accordingly, without penalty.</p>  <p>  The development of all schemes under the new CAP will also take account of the one of the aims of the new CAP which is to reduce the administrative burden and ensure simplification in its implementation. The use of online applications and new technologies will allow the Department to meet these objectives, and to continue to improve on the delivery of essential payments to farmers.</p>  <p>  I am committed to reducing bureaucracy for farmers and making schemes as easy to navigate as possible.</p></reply>

The tillage sector supports so many aspects of the wider agri sector by providing high quality grain to the animal feed industry and straw for feeding and bedding, while also making a significant contribution to the food and drinks sectors in the form of malting barley, milling wheat and oats for the breakfast cereals industry.  The sector contributed an estimated &euro;430m at farm gate prices to overall agriculture output (&euro;8.3bn) in 2020.</p>  <p>  Food Vision 2030 identified the tillage sector as one of the most carbon efficient sectors of Irish agriculture and emphasised the importance of retaining and increasing the area under cultivation.  </p>  <p>Progress in development of the next CAP Strategic Plan is well under way and the Department has consulted widely.

These submissions, including those relating to the tillage sector, are under consideration and will be taken on board in the development of the plan. Discussions with key stakeholders will continue through bilateral engagements, and through the CAP Consultative Committee, where all key stakeholders are represented. </p>  <p>  A statutory consultation on a draft environmental report for the CAP Strategic Plan will be held in November with the final plan due for submission in December in advance of the 1st January 2022 deadline. The plan will then be subject to an approval process with the Commission over a 6/8 month period. </p>  <p>  All elements of the plan will be subject to review and scrutiny by the EU Commission in line with the relevant regulatory framework around the three general objectives of economic, environmental and social sustainability. </p>  <p>  The CAP Strategic Plan will become operational on 1st January 2023.</p></reply>
