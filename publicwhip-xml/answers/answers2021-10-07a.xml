Offices  are open  for walk-in service  each morning and appointment all day to 5pm. </p><p>If a person wishes to make an in-person appointment for any of the Department's services, they can contact their local Intreo Centre or Branch Office and an appointment will be arranged for them. Contact details for all our offices are available on www.gov.ie.</p><p>The health and safety of members of the public and of staff in my Department is of paramount importance.  For in-person appointments, we continue to observe public health measures including the use of screens and hand sanitiser.  The duration of all in-person appointments are kept as short as practically possible and social distancing guidelines are observed at all times.</p><p>We did however enhance and develop other means of accessing services during the Pandemic including by telephone and online and, for most people, these have worked well.  We would encourage people to continue to use these options wherever possible. </p><p>Many people are now using www.gov.ie to obtain information and our easy to use online portal www.MyWelfare.ie to apply for various income supports. </p><p>We expect the high uptake of both online and in-person services to continue.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-10-07a.10.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021100700055#WRA00800"><p>In August 2021, the rate of unemployment for young people under 25 was just under 26% when using the Central Statistic's Office Covid-19 adjusted measure.  Although this rate is high, it includes all those young people on PUP which, in August, included students - many of whom would not be considered unemployed as that term is commonly understood.  Even allowing for their inclusion, the Covid adjusted youth unemployment rate has fallen sharply from its 2021 peak of 61% in January.  This rate is expected to fall further in the October unemployment estimates as students, previously in receipt of PUP, will no longer be included in the estimate.  In addition, following the continued reopening of our society, the number of young persons on PUP has declined significantly, falling to just under 10,400 this week.  I expect this trend to continue as the final restrictions are eased.</p><p>These trends show that young people are among the most resilient groups in society and, once the opportunities are available, youth employment recovers very quickly.</p><p>The current approach to rates of payment for young Jobseekers allowance recipients was introduced in 2009 to encourage young unemployed people to participate in employment, education and training programmes.  Although the basic rate is &euro;112.70 per week for young people up to and including 24 year olds, it increases to the standard rate of &euro;203 if a young jobseeker participates on an education or training programme.  Where they participate on the new Work Placement Experience Programme, their weekly rate is increased to &euro;306. </p><p>There are many opportunities for young unemployed people - the Department has introduced a series of targeted measures under the Pathways to Work strategy targeted at young people including ring-fencing 4,000 places on the Work Placement Experience Programme and providing 50,000 additional further education and training places.</p><p>I trust this clarifies my position.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-10-07a.14.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021100700055#WRA01100"><p>The Deputy will be aware that I will be considering a range of options for Budget 2022 over the coming week, taking account of available resources. </p><p>The Central Statistics Office, in its most recent statistical release on prices, shows that the average level of prices over the 12 months to August 2021, as measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, was broadly the same as for the 12 months ending August 2020.</p><p>Having said that, I am also mindful that annual, or 12 monthly, data, can lag the lived experience of people and that monthly data indicates that price levels have increased recently.  This is obviously a factor to be taken into account in finalising the budget.</p><p>It is, I believe, important to emphasise that the Government takes a range of data, not just price data, into account in formulating its budget.  For example, the last two Budgets have, in fact, seen a series of evidence based increases in some social welfare payments targeted to improve the situation of the people who are most at risk of poverty and to ensure the most vulnerable were protected.</p><p>These included increases in the Living Alone Allowance of &euro;10 per week, the Fuel Allowance being increased by &euro;5.50 per week, and increases to the weekly qualified child rates of &euro;4 for children aged under 12, and &euro;8 for those aged 12 and over.</p><p>In addition, the earnings disregards for the One Parent Family Payment, Jobseeker Transition Payment and Disability Allowance have been increased, allowing lone parents and people with disabilities to earn more from employment without their payment being affected.</p><p>As a result of these targeted measures, some of the most vulnerable social welfare recipients have already seen increases significantly above the rate of inflation over this period.  For example, during the fuel season, a pensioner or person with a disability living alone is up to &euro;15.50 per week better off.  In the case of a lone parent or a person with a disability, this could increase further if they are working, as they can benefit from the increased earnings disregards introduced and the improvements made to the Working Family Payment.</p><p>In considering options for the forthcoming Social Welfare Budget package, I will once again be guided by evidence-based research produced by organisations such as the CSO, the ERSI and the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice.  Taking an evidence-based approach ensures that available resources are used to deliver maximum impact in terms of reducing poverty and disadvantage. <b></b></p></reply>

We are  now at an advanced stage in its first phase of a two-phase procurement of new employment services. This procurement process follows extensive consultations by my Department with the existing service providers over the last number of years.</p><p>I can assure the Deputy that, under these requests for tender, there is no requirement to lodge any funds against potential underperformance for the new Regional Employment Service. </p><p>The request for tender under Phase one, lays out the appropriate means of addressing underperformance by a service-provider. A Remediation Plan would detail the steps required to address the  underperformance, with the provision of up to eight weeks to resolve  these issues. </p><p>Following this, the Department has sole discretion to take appropriate action up to and including the termination of contract.  Needless to say, my Department would make every effort to ensure service-providers will deliver the employment services they are contracted to deliver. In the event that it is not possible to satisfactorily resolve service  issues my Department  will  put contingency measures in place to ensure continuity of service for the long-term unemployed and other clients.  </p><p>The second phase of procurement is to commence shortly and will see the Regional Employment Service model rolled out across the State. It will take on board the learnings from  the first phase. This is a significant expansion of employment services and will result in State-wide coverage of employment services for those furthest from the labour market for the first time. </p><p>My Department has a strong track record in working with service-providers in a constructive and pragmatic manner to ensure the delivery of services to those who need them most. This will continue under the new employment service models. </p></reply>

Parent&rsquo;s Leave and Benefit falls into this category and encourages the sharing of parental responsibilities equally between couples. </p><p>Parent&rsquo;s benefit is paid at a weekly flat rate of &euro;245 for five weeks to employed and self-employed people who avail of parents leave and who satisfy certain pay related social insurance (PRSI) contribution and other conditions.  The rate of parent&rsquo;s benefit is the same as the rates of paternity benefit, adoptive benefit and maternity benefit.</p><p>I had the pleasure in Budget 2021 to extend parent's benefit from two to five weeks.  Following that extension there has been a marked increase in the number of parents benefit claims awarded by my Department.</p><p>The number of Parents who have applied for parents benefit between 1st April 2021 and 30th September 2021 is 30,570.  The associated cost of the benefit in this period is some &euro;23m.  Since the start of this year, some 37,926 applications for Parent&rsquo;s Benefit have been awarded compared to 15,729 for all of 2020.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that I also extended the period in which the leave can be taken, so that the 5 weeks can be taken by each parent within the first two years of the child's birth.  The leave benefit can also be paid in separate weekly blocks or can be paid over a consecutive 5 week period.</p><p>The changes introduced enhance the flexibility of the schemes to make it easier for parents to avail of parent&rsquo;s leave and parents benefit, and contributes to an improved work life balance.<b></b></p></reply>

This is important not just for the farmers concerned but for the rural communities in which they live and work.  Under the scheme farmers can receive the equivalent of a jobseeker payment and also have access to secondary benefits and employment services.  The 2021 Further Revised Estimate provides for expenditure of &euro;61.7 million on the scheme.  The scheme is currently supporting just over 5,100 farmers.</p>  <p>  While the means test for the Farm Assist scheme is already more generous than that for the Jobseeker Allowance scheme I am very conscious of the importance of sustaining farming activity and supporting farming households in rural communities.  </p>  <p>  Accordingly, the Government made a commitment in the Programme for Government and in the Rural Development Policy 2021-2025 to review the means assessment disregards for the Farm Assist Scheme.  Officials in the Department are finalising this technical review of the means assessment and I expect that the report will be submitted to me shortly for consideration.</p>  <p>  Any changes to social welfare supports, including the Farm Assist scheme, will be considered in a budgetary and policy context. </p></reply>

As with all other persons, farmers can avail of the State Pension (Contributory) scheme if they have sufficient PRSI contributions.  People on low incomes, including farmers, may alternatively qualify for the State Pension (Non-Contributory) (SPNC), which is a means-tested pension, financed by the Exchequer, and paid at up to 95% of the maximum rate of the SPC.  </p><p>The Farm Assist scheme was introduced in 1999 to provide income support for low income farmers.  It replaced the Smallholders&rsquo; Unemployment Assistance payment and did not entail any payment of self-employed PRSI contributions.  Recipients who had previously paid Class S social insurance contributions could pay voluntary contributions to maintain their social insurance record, provided they satisfied the qualifying conditions to do so.  </p><p>Since 1st January 2007, the exemption from Class S PRSI has been removed and those self-employed persons receiving Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance or Farm Assist are subject to Class S PRSI as self-employed contributors on their self-employed income, provided their annual income is &euro;5,000 or more.  Many low income farmers qualify for he non-contributory State pension on this basis.</p><p>Low income farmers, on Farm Assist who don't, on reaching age 66, qualify for the non-contributory pension can take the opt to retain the Farm Assist rate of payment if that is  higher than any amount that they would get on the non-contributory, or means tested, pension.</p><p>The Department is currently conducting a technical review of the means test disregards for the Farm Assist Scheme, in line with a commitment under the Programme for Government and in 'Our Rural Future, Rural Development Policy 2021 &ndash; 2025'.  I expect that the report will be submitted to me shortly for consideration. </p><p>Any changes to social welfare supports, will be considered in a budgetary context in view of the overall improvements to social welfare supports.  </p><p>I hope that this clarifies matters for the Deputy. </p></reply>

As the two main hospitals that treat children are based in the Dublin area, this often involves parents having to travel distances and to stay close to the hospital concerned.  My Department provides supports that can be accessed where a need arises as a result of a child being hospitalised.</p>  <p>  Where a domiciliary care allowance is in payment this continues to be paid for up to 13 weeks following the hospitalisation of a child.  Similarly, if carers allowance is in payment this payment continues for up to 13 weeks following the hospitalisation.</p>  <p>  In all other cases, application can be made under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) scheme as this scheme is intended to provide assistance to eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs and those of their dependents. Under the SWA scheme, the Department may award a supplement to assist with ongoing or recurring costs that cannot be met from the person's own resources and which are deemed to be necessary.</p>  <p>  In addition, an Exceptional Needs Payment (ENP) is a single payment to help meet essential, once-off, exceptional expenditure, which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income.  For example, the payment can be for costs such as travel, necessary temporary accommodation while a family member is in hospital and clothing or other hospital requirements.  </p>  <p>  Social workers who are based in the hospitals are well briefed on these schemes and are in a position to contact staff of my Department for assistance where this is required.  As a result, I do not believe there is a need to base staff of my Department in the hospitals concerned.</p>  <p>  My Department is committed to ensuring that members of the public are fully aware of the welfare supports and services that are available to them.  To that end detailed information on each scheme and service is published on gov.ie.  A list of all DSP schemes and services can be found at www.gov.ie/dspschemes and this page provides a link to the dedicated web page for each individual scheme including the Exceptional Needs Payment and Carer&rsquo;s Allowance.</p></reply>

My officials work closely with the MESL team and I find this work very useful in informing policy.  The outputs from this research complement data produced from other analyses such as the Survey on Income and Living Conditions produced by the Central Statistics Office.</p>  <p>  The MESL research provides an estimate of the income requirements of different family types in both urban and rural locations.  It provides a comparison of welfare payments against these calculated requirements to identify what the Vincentian Partnership terms adequacy gaps.  In 2020, the study concluded that pensioner couple households have no adequacy gaps but other households demonstrate gaps of various magnitudes. </p>  <p>  This research also highlights issues that may also be addressed by improvements in services.  In this regard, improved services, such as the extension of GP visit cards for children and the affordable childcare scheme can result in significant reductions in the minimum income standards needed by households. </p>  <p>  In recent years, the Department has used the study as a key input into consideration of Budget options.  Budget 2019 introduced a new, higher rate of increase for qualified children aged 12 and over, across all social welfare schemes.  Budgets 2020 and 2021 again provided for a higher increase for older children.  Changes have also been made to enhance the Working Family Payment and One Parent Family payments.  In addition, the Living Alone Allowance increased by a total of &euro;10 per week over Budgets 2020 and 2021 in response to the research highlighting adequacy gaps, particularly for pensioners living alone.</p>  <p>  Measures taken by this and previous governments ensure that social welfare payment rates in Ireland are among the highest in Europe.  Social transfers contribute very significantly to reducing poverty rates in Ireland.  According to the Central Statistics Office, in the absence of social transfers and pension income, the at-risk-of-poverty rate would be 41.4%.  After social transfers, the rate is 12.8%.  This is a poverty reduction effect of 68.5% for all social transfers and pensions, one of the highest in Europe.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that any measures being considered for Budget 2022 will be guided by research, including the minimum essential standard of living research, to target resources at those who are identified as being in most need.</p></reply>

The objective of this commitment is to address the low proportion of employees in Ireland with supplementary pension cover, which includes both occupational and personal pensions.</p><p>The rate of supplementary pension coverage in Ireland is around 55% of the working population (CSO, Pension Coverage Survey 2020) and it is estimated that this reduces to less than 35% when the private sector is considered in isolation.  Many of these people will become reliant on the State pension for all or most of their income in retirement and accordingly, may face a significant unwanted drop in income.</p><p>Implementation of an Automatic Enrolment (AE) system will see a transition from the current and purely voluntary system to one where employees, subject to certain parameters, will be automatically enrolled into a quality assured retirement savings system.  This Government, recognising the exceptional strain that both employers and employees are now under as a result of the Covid-19 emergency, will seek to gradually deliver an AE system, based on the following principles:</p><p>-  There will be a phased roll-out, over a decade, of the contribution made by workers.</p><p>-  Matching contributions will be made by both workers and employers and the State will top up contributions.</p><p>-  There will be an opt-out provision for those who choose to opt out.</p><p>-  Workers will have a range of retirement savings products to choose from.</p><p>-  There will be a charges cap imposed on pension providers.</p><p>My officials continue to work on the design of the AE system.  There are five main areas where work is ongoing so as to produce design options.  These areas relate to:</p><p>-  the scope and role of a Central Processing Authority for the system;</p><p>-  the nature and functions of Registered Providers of savings products;</p><p>-  the investment framework and funds to be offered by Registered Providers, including the design of the default fund and the pay-out phase;</p><p>-  the design of the State financial incentive; and</p><p>-  the phasing of implementation.</p><p>The development of these policy proposals is at an advanced stage and, as set out in the recently published Economic Recovery Plan 2021, the overall design of the system will be decided later this year.  Thereafter, the necessary legislative, organisational and process structures will follow through over the course of 2022 and 2023.</p><p>In progressing this work, the Department is receiving technical support from the European Commission&rsquo;s DG Reform which assists EU member states implementing administrative and institutional reforms.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The new model will extend high quality employment services across the State, deliver enhanced governance arrangements and provide successful tenderers with greater flexibility to innovate and deliver services for their clients.  </p>  <p>  Phase two will see the Regional Employment Service model rolled out across the State and will take on board the learnings from the first phase.  This is a significant expansion of employment services and will result in State-wide coverage of employment services for those furthest from the labour market for the first time.</p>  <p>  The Phase two of this procurement process was to have had this service in place by January 2022.  This has now been temporarily postponed giving potential tenderers additional time to prepare to submit collaborative joint bids.  My Department is in the process of offering current local employment service and Job Club providers, in the Phase two areas, a new contract for a short period into next year.  This will enable continuity of service to our customers, while providing potential tenders additional time to work collaboratively on submitting joint bids.  The RFTs for Phase two will issue prior to year end and my Department has written to service providers outlining the revised timelines. </p>  <p>  Learnings arising from the Phase one procurement are already being incorporated by my Department in preparing the RFT for the remaining lots for the Regional Employment Service under Phase two.  My Department is also in ongoing dialogue with the various service providers and representative groups, including staff representatives and will consult with them further, as appropriate, before finalising the RFT for Phase two.  </p>  <p>  I understand and appreciate the concerns of the sector at the changes proposed.

Expenditure on the enhanced illness benefit was &euro;57 million in 2020, in addition to &euro;593 spent on standard illness benefit.  Expenditure on the enhanced payment was &euro;68 million from January to the end of September this year and is expected to be circa &euro;84 million for all of 2021.</p>  <p>  The rate of payment of the enhanced Illness Benefit payment in respect of Covid-19 is higher than the normal maximum personal rate for a limited period only.  </p>  <p>  The measures were designed to ensure that where a registered medical practitioner or a HSE medical officer diagnoses a person with Covid-19 or identifies him or her as a probable source of infection of Covid-19, the person can comply with medical advice to isolate, while having their income protected. This is essential to limit and slow down the spread of the virus, to keep the number of people affected to a minimum, and to reduce a peak of cases which would cause extreme pressure on the health system. </p>  <p>  The enhanced rate of Illness Benefit was brought in as a short-term public health measure and is not a long-term income support payment.  It is payable for 2 weeks where a person is isolating as a probable source of infection of Covid-19 and up to 10 weeks where a person has been diagnosed with Covid-19.  The purpose of the enhanced Illness Benefit payment in respect of Covid-19 is to encourage people not to attend the workplace due to financial constraint when they should be in isolation.  </p>  <p>  In a case where a person continues to be ill beyond 10 weeks, standard Illness Benefit may be paid for an extended period, based on the person&rsquo;s continued eligibility.  Illness Benefit is the primary income support payment for people who are unable to attend work due to illness of any type.  Additional payments may also be made in respect of a qualified adult and qualifying children. </p>  <p>  My Department provides a suite of income supports for those who are unable to work due to an illness or disability. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that entitlement to these supports is generally not contingent on the nature of the illness or disability but on the extent to which a particular illness or disability impairs or restricts a person&rsquo;s capacity to work. My Department spent a total of &euro;4.7 billion on illness, disability and caring payments in 2020. </p>  <p>  Apart from these income supports, my Department also provides means-tested supports under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme for people who are ill but who do not qualify for Illness Benefit.  The Department may also make an Exceptional Needs Payment to help meet essential, once-off expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet from their weekly income.    </p>  <p>  The enhanced payment was brought in on a temporary basis and has been extended on several occasions due to the ongoing nature of the pandemic and the rollout of the national vaccination programme.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to monitor the public health situation, the effectiveness of income supports during this time, and will be cognisant of any requirements to extend the duration of the enhanced illness benefit payment beyond 8 February 2022, the end date set out in regulations. </p>  <p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.   </p></reply>

The main goal of activation measures is to increase the employment opportunities for jobseekers and to improve matching between jobs and workers.</p><p>Persons in receipt of a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment must fully engage with the activation process.  Those in the activation process are also expected to avail of the range of supports provided during this process which includes education or training, employment support schemes, internships and other supports to help them into sustainable employment.  </p><p>However, self-employed professional artists can apply for the scheme for professional artists on jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance which is run by my Department.

This commitment is recognised in both the Programme for Government and the National Carers&rsquo; Strategy. </p><p>The main income supports provided by my Department include Carer's Allowance, Carer's Benefit, Domiciliary Care Allowance, and the Carer's Support Grant.  Over 135,000 carers benefit from regular income supports and spending on these payments in 2021 is expected to be in the region of &euro;1.5 billion.  The value of income transfers to family carers has increased by over 50% since 2015.</p><p>Carer's Allowance acts as an income support for those who cannot earn adequate income in the open labour market due to their caring responsibilities.  This allowance is part of the system of social assistance supports that provide payments based on an income need.  The means test plays a critical role in determining whether or not an income need arises as a consequence of a particular contingency &ndash; such as disability, unemployment or caring.  This ensures that the recipient has a verifiable income need and that resources are targeted to those who need them most.  In August, there were 90,207 recipients of Carer's Allowance.  The estimated expenditure for the payment this year is in the region of &euro;953 million. </p><p>The means test for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance is one of the most generous in the social protection system.  Currently, &euro;332.50 of gross weekly income is disregarded in the calculation of means for a single person; the equivalent for someone who is married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting is &euro;665 of combined gross weekly income.</p><p>By comparison, the income disregard applied to Disability Allowance is &euro;140 per week.  Income between &euro;140 and &euro;350 is assessed at 50%.  For Jobseeker's Allowance, it is &euro;20 per day up to a maximum of &euro;60, and the balance is assessed at 60%.  For Jobseeker's Transitional Payment, the weekly income disregard is &euro;165 with 50% of the balance assessed as means.</p><p>In the case of a couple, a carer may retain a full-rate payment of &euro;219.00 per week while having an annual income of &euro;37,500 from employment, retain a payment of (just under half rate) &euro;109.00 per week while having an annual income from employment of &euro;49,750, and retain the minimum payment of &euro;4 per week while having an annual income of &euro;61,000.</p><p>In the case of a single person, a carer may retain a full-rate payment of &euro;219.00 while having an annual income of just under &euro;19,000, retain a payment of &euro;109.00 per week (just under half rate) while having an annual income of &euro;25,400, or retain the minimum payment of &euro;4 per week while having an annual income of &euro;31,100. </p><p>I can assure the Deputy that I am very aware of the key role carers play in society and I will continue to keep the range of supports available to carers under review.  Changes to schemes are considered in an overall budgetary and policy context and from an evidence-based perspective.  Any improvements or additions to these supports can only be considered in that context and in the light of available financial resources. </p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The scheme offers participants the opportunity to gain valuable work experience in their communities.</p><p>Following a Government decision in 2017, the number of places on RSS was increased by 750 during 2017 and 2018 and a six-year time limit was introduced for new entrants, with effect from 1st February 2017.  Prior to the introduction of the six-year limit, a RSS participant could remain on the scheme for a significant part of their working life.  This had the effect of limiting places available on RSS and reducing the opportunities available to new applicants. </p><p>RSS participants who commenced on the scheme prior to 1st February 2017 can remain on the scheme until they reach state pension age once they continue to be eligible for a qualifying social welfare payment.

This procurement process follows extensive consultations by my Department with the existing service providers over the last number of years. </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that no new privatisation is being undertaken In relation to employment services.  No service previously undertaken by civil or public servants is being shifted to the private sector.  Local Employment Services have always been contracted out services and provide employment services for those who are long term unemployed.  My Department's Intreo offices will continue to engage with those unemployed for 12 months or less and, under the July Stimulus, and in line with the new Pathways to Work strategy, has been given additional resources to do so.</p>  <p>  The Local Employment Service and Job Club contracts are annual contracts for the provision of employment services. </p>  <p>  Since their inception and despite many changes to the contracts over the years, the contracts were awarded in a closed procurement manner each year.  However, my Department&rsquo;s legal obligations are that all contracted employment services must be procured in an open and competitive manner.  Good governance requirements also require significant changes to be made in how the existing contracts are delivered. </p>  <p>To address these issues my Department has developed the Regional Employment Service model which is being implemented in a two phased procurement process.  Phase two of the procurement process will take on board the learnings of the first phase.  This is a significant expansion of employment services and once complete will result in State-wide coverage of high-quality regional employment services for those furthest from the labour market for the first time.   </p></reply>

Expenditure on the scheme is over &euro;8.7 billion. </p>  <p>With the gradual lifting of restrictions, the number of customers receiving PUP has dropped significantly by some 80% from 481,000 in February to over 101,400 this week.  It is important in the interests of equity and sustainability to gradually restore standard social welfare terms.</p>  <p>  In line with the Government&rsquo;s Economic Recovery Plan, the PUP is gradually changing using a tapered and considered approach over a 6 month period from September 2021 until February 2022 to align it with standard jobseeker&rsquo;s payments.  Changes in the rate of payment were introduced in mid-September with further changes to place from 16th November 2021 and 8th February 2022.  As PUP customers go on to the &euro;203 rate, they will be transitioned to standard jobseeker terms.</p>  <p>  The process of moving from the lower &euro;203 rate of PUP to a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment was due to begin in early September.  I have deferred this process until after all sectors have started to re-open in line with "Reframing the Challenge, Continuing Our Recovery and Reconnecting".  This means that affected customers, including those in the live entertainment sector, will continue to receive their PUP payment until 26th October when the process of their transition to a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment will begin.  The Department has written to all affected customers to outline the details of the transition and the options that will be available to them.</p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the position.</p></reply>

This can include  providing employers with a bespoke recruitment service to fill  job vacancies, where priority is given to job seekers on the live register.  They engage with employers daily and can match employer vacancies to Jobseeker and PUP customers.  The teams are actively engaged with employers who are facing difficulties filling vacancies at present.</p><p>ERD hosted its first virtual week long campaign for Intreo Work and Skills Week from 19th to 22nd April 2021.  The concept was a tripartite presentation of supports from Government for business and jobseekers with a particular focus on recruitment, skills and learning.  In total over the four half day events the total number of persons who attended this on-line event was over 12,400. </p><p>ERD hosted two large online events on the EU EURES platform, one for the healthcare sector and one for the horticulture sector.  There are a further 5 EURES events planned for the remainder of 2021.  ERD has also presented at eight events reaching almost an additional 1400 employers, providing information on recruitment and financial supports available to employers to employ unemployed persons.  Currently ERD is working in collaboration with IBEC on an event to address labour shortages in October and a further event is planned for early December in relation to disability supports. </p><p>JobsIreland.ie is the Department&rsquo;s recruitment website available to both employers and jobseekers.  The platform allows employers to post and promote vacancies including posting vacancies across the EU Members States through our EURES service. </p><p>ERD also works with Activation Case Officers, Job Coaches, and Employer Relations teams in Intreo Offices countrywide.  These teams have been engaging directly with employers on an ongoing basis throughout the pandemic, matching suitable vacancies with jobseekers via email notifications, pre-recorded recruitment videos featuring employers, job slots on local radio, and hosting online recruitment events across many sectors of the economy including construction, hospitality, retail, manufacturing, sales and customer service.  </p><p>In June a live online recruitment event was hosted highlighting vacancies in the hospitality sector featuring a number of large employers in the Dublin/Mid-Leinster region.  Over 1,000 jobseekers attended the event. </p><p>The Government's national employment services strategy; Pathways to Work 2021-2025, sets out commitments for further engagement with employers including:</p><p>- A National Employer Roadshow is planned to promote supports and incentives available to employers and to encourage employers to avail of schemes and incentives.</p><p>- Developing a promotional campaign to increase employer awareness and take-up of the available supports and</p><p>- Planning 150 job promotion events each year to showcase employment opportunities.</p><p>I trust this clarifies matters.</p></reply>

The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household.</p>  <p>  The Fuel Allowance payment is paid to social welfare recipients such as pensioners, people with disabilities, lone parents and the long-term unemployed in recognition of their long-term financial dependence on their social welfare payment for all or most of their income.  </p>  <p>  The reason Illness Benefit is not a qualifying payment for Fuel Allowance is that, in the majority of cases, Illness Benefit is a short-term payment for those who are certified by their GP as needing to take time out from their employment due to illness.</p>  <p>  People who are permanently incapable of work may be eligible for the non-means-tested Invalidity Pension, subject to satisfying the relevant medical criteria.  Those who are substantially restricted in undertaking suitable employment arising from a medical condition may be eligible for the means-tested Disability Allowance, subject to meeting the relevant medical criteria.

The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household.</p><p>My Department also pays an electricity or gas allowance under the household benefits scheme at an estimated cost of &euro;195 million in 2021. </p><p>The criteria for fuel allowance are framed in order to direct the limited resources available to my Department in as targeted a manner as possible.  All recipients of non-contributory payments are accepted as satisfying the means-test for fuel.  People who are in receipt of a qualifying contributory payment must also satisfy a means test. </p><p>Any decision to raising the income threshold for fuel allowance for persons with disabilities would have to be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations.</p><p>My Department does provide additional support to people with disabilities through the household benefits package (HHB).  The HHB package comprises the electricity or gas allowance (&euro;35 a month) and the free television licence.  The package is generally available to people living in the State aged 66 years and over and is also available to people under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments including Disability Allowance and Invalidity Pension. </p><p>Under the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme, a heating supplement may be paid to assist people in certain circumstances that have special heating needs.  If a recipient of a social protection or HSE payment has exceptional heating costs due to ill health, infirmity or a medical condition which he/she is unable to meet out of household income, that person may apply for a heating supplement.  There is no automatic entitlement to a payment.  Heating supplements are payable at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case in order to ensure that the payments target those most in need of assistance.</p><p>Exceptional needs payments are also available under the SWA scheme.  Exceptional needs payments may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which customers are unable to meet out of their own resources, and this may include exceptional heating costs.  Decisions on such payments are made on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>The Programme for Government commits the Government to use the research into the cost of disability to individuals and families to properly inform the direction of future policy.  My Department commissioned Indecon International Consultants to carry out research into the cost of disability in Ireland.  The report has been received and my Department is considering it in detail. </p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This commitment is recognised in both the Programme for Government and the National Carers&rsquo; Strategy. </p><p>The main income supports provided by my Department include Carer's Allowance, Carer's Benefit, Domiciliary Care Allowance, and the Carer's Support Grant. Over 135,000 carers benefit from regular income supports and spending on these payments in 2021 is expected to be in the region of &euro;1.5 billion.  The value of income transfers to family carers has increased by over 50% since 2015.</p><p>Carer's Allowance acts as an income support for those who cannot earn adequate income due to their caring responsibilities.  This allowance is part of the system of social assistance supports that provide payments based on an income need.  The means test plays a critical role in determining whether or not an income need arises as a consequence of a particular contingency &ndash; such as disability, unemployment or caring.  This ensures that the recipient has a verifiable income need and that resources are targeted to those who need them most.  In August 2021, there were 90,207 recipients of Carer's Allowance.  The estimated expenditure for the payment this year is in the region of &euro;953 million. </p><p>The means test for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance is one of the most generous in the social protection system, most notably with regard to a spouse's earnings.  Currently, &euro;332.50 of gross weekly income is disregarded in the calculation of means for a single person; the equivalent for someone who is married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting is &euro;665 of combined gross weekly income.</p><p>By comparison, the income disregard applied to Disability Allowance is &euro;140 per week, with income between &euro;140 and &euro;350 assessed at 50%..  For Jobseeker's Allowance, it is &euro;20 per day up to a maximum of &euro;60, and the balance is assessed at 60%.  For Jobseeker's Transitional Payment, the weekly income disregard is &euro;165 with 50% of the balance assessed as means.</p><p>In the case of a couple, a carer may retain a full-rate payment of &euro;219.00 per week while having an annual income of &euro;37,500 from employment, retain a payment of (just under half rate) &euro;109.00 per week while having an annual income from employment of &euro;49,750, and retain the minimum payment of &euro;4 per week while having an annual income of &euro;61,000.</p><p>In the case of a single person, a carer may retain a full-rate payment of &euro;219.00 while having an annual income of just under &euro;19,000, retain a payment of &euro;109.00 per week (just under half rate) while having an annual income of &euro;25,400, or retain the minimum payment of &euro;4 per week while having an annual income of &euro;31,100. </p><p>In recognition of the vital role that carers provide in our society, the Carers Support Grant was increased by &euro;150 as part of Budget 2021.  It is now payable at the highest rate paid since its introduction. </p><p>I can assure the Deputy that I am very aware of the key role carers play in society and I will continue to keep the range of supports available to carers under review.  Changes to schemes are considered in an overall expenditure and policy context and from an evidence-based perspective.  Any improvements or additions to these supports can only be considered in that context and in the light of available financial resources. </p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

These supports are specifically targeted at those people who have been unemployed for 12 months or more. </p><p>The aim of CE and T&uacute;s is to enhance the employability of disadvantaged and long-term unemployed people by providing valuable work experience opportunities.  CE also provides training supports for participants.</p><p>I am aware of the challenges caused by the Covid-19 public health restrictions and the resultant impact on many CE and T&uacute;s schemes including on the recruitment of new participants.  Where it was safe and in accordance with public health restrictions,  some recruitment did continue during the pandemic, albeit on a more limited level than the norm.</p><p>Minister Humphreys and I have taken a number of measures to support CE and T&uacute;s schemes during the course of the pandemic.  These ensured participants were able to avail fully of the work experience and training opportunities available under both schemes while enabling schemes maintain local community services.  In particular, participants whose contracts were due to come to an end since last October have had their contacts extended on a number of occasions.  The latest extension was announced this week and will continue up until February 2022.  This will allow further time to increase the number and rate of referrals to fill vacancies. </p><p>Once normal CE and T&uacute;s operations return, it is important that these places are freed up and become available to the newer cohort of long term unemployed, including those whose jobs are permanently lost due to the pandemic.  Time spent on PUP will count towards eligibility for CE and T&uacute;s.  </p><p>My Department has moved to restore activation services to pre-pandemic levels and is prioritising the referral and recruitment of eligible jobseekers to CE and T&uacute;s.  At the same time, my Department is considering initiatives to strengthen and further support the referral process from the Intreo Offices to individual CE and T&uacute;s schemes. </p><p>Under Pathways to Work, the Department appointed almost 100 additional dedicated job coaches nationwide, to assist jobseekers in their efforts to return to full time employment.  The role of the job coaches includes the referral of eligible jobseekers to CE sponsoring authorities or T&uacute;s implementing bodies as appropriate; if participation on these employment supports would be of benefit.</p><p>In line with Government&rsquo;s plans for the full re-opening of the economy, under 'Reframing the Challenge, Continuing Our Recovery and Reconnecting&rsquo;, my priority and the priority of the Department is to have all CE and T&uacute;s schemes back providing normal services and supports to their long-term unemployed participants while delivering valuable services to local communities.  </p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This follows publication of the Arts and Culture Recovery Taskforce report - 'Life Worth Living' - in November 2020 which included a recommendation to pilot a basic income scheme for a three-year period in the arts, culture, audiovisual and live performance and events sectors.  The Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media has lead responsibility for this commitment.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government contains a separate commitment to engage in research, drawing from international experiences, on the best approach to piloting a universal basic income during the lifetime of the Government, via the Low Pay Commission.  The matter of a universal basic income, which would apply economy-wide, is a matter for my colleague the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</p>  <p>  In addition, 'Pathways to Work 2021-2025' was published by the Government in July 2021.  Under Pathways to Work, my Department will progress the delivery of a working age payment modelled on the Working Family Payment.  The Working Family Payment is a payment to low income families with children.  Under the scheme, the rate of payment a person receives is a percentage of the difference between their actual earnings and defined thresholds for their family size.</p>  <p>  The rationale in developing a working age payment is to create a greater link between welfare payments and employment earnings such that a person will always experience an increase in income where they take on additional work.</p>  <p>  The basic income pilot scheme for artists will apply only to that cohort, whereas the other schemes will have a wider scope.  </p></reply>

Of the  additional places, 1,475 places have been assigned to existing CE schemes recently and 1,164 to existing T&uacute;s schemes.  CE schemes will benefit from the additional placements in every county while the applications for T&uacute;s schemes have been approved for the 19 counties that applied.  Full details on the county profile for the schemes are listed in Table 1 below.  Further work has now commenced in assigning the remaining places.</p><p>These new places will be made available to existing and more recent long-term unemployed persons, including those whose employment was adversely affected as a result of Covid-19.  Time spent on PUP will count towards persons eligibility for CE and T&uacute;s.  Intreo Offices are  working with CE and T&uacute;s schemes to fill these new places.</p><p>I am fully committed to the future of CE and T&uacute;s and will continue to support and improve the programmes for the benefit of both the CE and T&uacute;s participants and the valuable contribution being made to local communities throughout the country. <table>    <tr>       <th>COUNTY</th>       <th>CE</th>       <th>T&uacute;s </th>       <th>Total</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Carlow</td>       <td>33</td>       <td>52</td>       <td>85</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cavan</td>       <td>33</td>       <td>23</td>       <td>56</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Clare</td>       <td>12</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>12</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork</td>       <td>132</td>       <td>165</td>       <td>297</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Donegal</td>       <td>173</td>       <td>93</td>       <td>266</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin</td>       <td>224</td>       <td>80</td>       <td>304</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway</td>       <td>45</td>       <td>188</td>       <td>233</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerry</td>       <td>51</td>       <td>21</td>       <td>72</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare</td>       <td>37</td>       <td>15</td>       <td>52</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilkenny</td>       <td>58</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>58</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Laois</td>       <td>17</td>       <td>11</td>       <td>28</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Leitrim</td>       <td>26</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>26</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick</td>       <td>90</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>90</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Longford</td>       <td>25</td>       <td>56</td>       <td>81</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth</td>       <td>71</td>       <td>7</td>       <td>78</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mayo</td>       <td>31</td>       <td>78</td>       <td>109</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Meath</td>       <td>48</td>       <td>169</td>       <td>217</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Monaghan</td>       <td>17</td>       <td>17</td>       <td>34</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Offaly</td>       <td>20</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>20</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Roscommon</td>       <td>6</td>       <td>30</td>       <td>36</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Sligo</td>       <td>77</td>       <td>43</td>       <td>120</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Tipperary</td>       <td>52</td>       <td>82</td>       <td>134</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Waterford</td>       <td>20</td>       <td>21</td>       <td>41</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Westmeath</td>       <td>53</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>53</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wexford</td>       <td>89</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>89</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wicklow</td>       <td>35</td>       <td>13</td>       <td>48</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>TOTAL</td>       <td>1,475</td>       <td>1,164</td>       <td>2,639</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

This involves the procurement of regional employment services for seven counties in the Midlands and North-West across four lots.  These counties have no existing local employment service and represent the first phase of an expansion of employment services.</p><p>Phase two of the process was to have seen service in place by January 2022.  This has now been temporarily postponed giving potential tenderers additional time to prepare collaborative joint bids. Learnings from the first phase will be applied to subsequent Requests for Tenders that will see the expansion of this model throughout the rest of the State.  This is a significant expansion of employment services and will result in State-wide coverage of employment services for those furthest from the labour market for the first time.</p><p>Under the RFT for the Regional Employment Service, the Department will be able to refer long term jobseekers to the new services as well as other cohorts on a voluntary basis such as lone parents and qualified adults.  All referrals will be managed by the Department&rsquo;s Intreo offices and they will determine the best employment service for an individual based on their specific circumstances and requirements.  In many cases the supports to individuals will be delivered through the Department&rsquo;s Intreo offices or they may be referred to the new Regional Employment Service. </p><p>If an individual is not in receipt of a social welfare payment, they should contact their local Intreo office who will offer them support and advice and may refer them to the Regional Employment Service, as appropriate.  The focus will be on getting the right people the right resources at the right time.</p></reply>

WPEP is a key policy initiative under the Government's new national employment services strategy; Pathways to Work 2021-2025.  It is a funded work placement scheme to provide work experience for 10,000 jobseekers who have been unemployed for more than six months, including time spent on the pandemic unemployment payment (PUP). Participation on WPEP is entirely voluntary.  All participants are paid &euro;306 per week plus any social welfare increases for qualified adults and children.  The intention is to provide quality and valuable work experience to unemployed persons.  Work placements are recognised internationally as being effective in assisting jobseekers find new jobs.  The Labour Market Advisory Council also recommended the inclusion of a new work placement programme as one of the active labour market measures to be included in the Pathways to Work Strategy.</p>  <p>  All host organisations and individual placements are checked for compliance and quality assurance purposes prior to being advertised on the Department&rsquo;s recruitment website; jobsIreland.ie.  A placement is not approved or published if the placement does not meet the stringent criteria set for the new programme.</p>  <p>  During the programme host organisations must complete monthly compliance checklists for all placements and return the completed checklists to my Department.  My Department will also undertake two monitoring meetings to ensure that the terms and conditions of the programme are being fulfilled.  Any complaints received relating to participation on the WPEP will be investigated in full by the Department&rsquo;s case officer as part of the ongoing monitoring of the programme and the individual placement. </p>  <p>  Since the programme was launched in the middle of July these arrangements have been working very well for the benefit of unemployed persons gaining valuable work experience which have been demonstrated to improve their long term employment prospects.  These will be kept under review.  </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies matters for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This group is comprised of senior representatives from responsible departments at Assistant Secretary and Principal Officer Level and three external members from the Community and Voluntary sector.  As Minister of State with responsibility for social inclusion policy and implementation of the Roadmap, I chair the Steering Group.  It has met on three occasions since November 2020, with the fourth meeting planned for November 2021. </p><p>Progress on implementation of the Roadmap commitments will be reported on an annual basis with the production of an annual report and report card on progress against each commitment.

Department officials also held discussions with unions representing CE supervisors and CE assistant supervisors.</p><p>At the start of April this year, agreement was reached with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform on proposals to resolve the long-standing issue.  These proposals include a financial package.</p><p>I am confident these proposals are a solid basis for progressing and resolving this complex issue.  Discussions on these proposals are ongoing between my Department and the unions representing CE supervisors and CE assistant supervisors.  The unions have made a number of observations, and these are currently being examined by my officials in conjunction with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and other relevant Government Departments. </p><p>My officials are continuing to progress this matter as a priority, and I would hope that these discussions can reach a conclusion in the near future.</p></reply>

This commitment is recognised in both the Programme for Government and the National Carers&rsquo; Strategy. </p><p>The main income supports provided by my Department include Carer's Allowance, Carer's Benefit, Domiciliary Care Allowance, and the Carer's Support Grant.  Over 135,000 carers benefit from regular income supports and spending on these payments in 2021 is expected to be in the region of &euro;1.5 billion.  The value of income transfers to family carers has increased by over 50% since 2015.</p><p>Despite the substantial extra financial demands due to the Covid-19 crisis, I announced that the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant would be increased by &euro;150 to a rate of &euro;1,850 in June of this year.  This is the highest rate since its introduction.  </p><p>The annual grant is available to all carers providing full-time care to an older person or a person with a disability, regardless of their means or social insurance contributions.  The grant can be used for any purpose at the discretion of the carer and it is not taxed.  Recipients of Carer's Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit and Domiciliary Care Allowance receive the grant automatically.  Other people who are not in receipt of a social welfare payment but who are providing full time care and attention to someone who requires that level of care are also eligible and can apply for a grant.</p><p>At the start of August, some 132,224 grants had been paid to 118,614 people.  Some 12,000 carers who are providing care for two or more people received a grant in respect of each person they are caring for.  The grant is paid in respect of each person being cared for to take account of the additional cost of providing care and to recognise the particular challenges faced by these carers. </p><p>I can assure the Deputy that I am very aware of the key role carers play in society and the particular challenges they have faced in light of Covid-19 and I will continue to keep the range of supports available to carers under review.  Any improvements or additions to these supports can only be considered in a budgetary context and in the light of available financial resources.  </p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This procurement process follows extensive consultations by my Department with the existing service providers over the last number of years.</p><p>The Phase two procurement, to commence shortly, will see the Regional Employment Service model rolled out across the State. It will take on board the learnings of the first phase.  This is a significant expansion of employment services and will result in State-wide coverage of employment services for those furthest from the labour market for the first time.</p><p>I have previously made clear that legal advice from the Attorney General's Office obliges my Department to procure its employment services in an open and competitive manner in respect of EU and national procurement rules.  The relevant EU directive is Directive 2014/24/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 February 2014 on public procurement. </p><p>In addition, the existing LES contracts are no longer consistent with current best practices.  Good governance therefore requires that my Department delivers a new model of employment services which entails a move to multi-annual contracts with enhanced key performance indicators and a funding model that will allow more autonomy on the best means of delivering enhanced employment services to members of the public. </p><p>The relevant legislation does not require the &quot;dismantling&quot; of employment services as the Deputy suggests, but it does require that we competitively procure these services.  As I have stated previously, existing service providers, with their strong track record and demonstrable capacity for delivering high-quality employment services, will be in a good position to submit strong competitive tenders for the Regional Employment Service.  </p></reply>

The latter rate, which includes those on the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP), has fallen sharply from its 2021 peak of 61 per cent in January. </p>  <p>  This rate is expected to fall further in the September unemployment estimates to be released this week as 20,000 students, no longer eligible for PUP since last month, will no longer be included in the estimate.  Full-time students are not traditionally included in unemployment estimates as they are not considered part of the labour force as they are generally not available for full time employment. </p>  <p>  Thanks to the continued reopening of our economy and society, the number of young people on PUP has declined significantly, falling by 91% since the 2021 peak in February to just under 10,400 this week.  Of these, 220 are in County Mayo, which represents 2 percent of all young persons on the scheme nationwide.  I expect to see further reductions in these PUP numbers, as the final set of public health restrictions are eased later this month. </p>  <p>  However, in order to minimise any scarring effects amongst young people who permanently lost their jobs due to the pandemic, my Department has introduced a series of targeted measures under the Pathways to Work strategy, including:</p>  <p>  - Expanding the JobsPlus scheme to 8,000 places and enhancing the incentive to recruit young jobseekers in particular, by increasing the youth age limit from 25 to 30 years. </p>  <p>  - The newly launched Work Placement Experience Programme, which is a 6-month, 30 hour per week voluntary work experience programme, for persons out of work for six months or more and has 4,000 places ring-fenced for young people. </p>  <p>  - Ring-fencing at least 1,000 out of the 3,000 additional Community Employment and T&uacute;s places for long term unemployed young people.</p>  <p>  - Ring-fencing at least 1,000 out of the 3,000 additional Community Employment and T&uacute;s places for long term unemployed young people.</p>  <p>  My Department also works closely with the Further Education and Training sector to provide access to training, upskilling and reskilling opportunities that are of particular relevance to young people entering the labour market for the first time.  As part of Pathways to Work 2021-2025, the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science are providing an additional 50,000 further education and training places to help more people, including young persons, to have the opportunity to upskill and reskill.  In addition, the Apprenticeship Incentivisation Scheme has been extended until the end of December 2021.  This scheme provides financial supports for employers who register apprentices to a national apprenticeship scheme. </p>  <p>  Using these measures, Pathways to Work 2021-2025 aims to reduce the youth unemployment rate back to or below the 2019 average of 12.5% by 2023.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

To be eligible to participate on RSS, a person must be aged 25 or over, in receipt of Farm/Fish Assist or another qualifying means-tested social welfare payment, and meet the criteria for either a self-employed farmer or a fisherman. </p>  <p>  RSS is not an activation measure, and participation on the scheme is by voluntary self-selection.  Applications are made directly to one of the 36 local development companies and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta that deliver RSS. These companies are collectively known as the implementing bodies (IBs).  </p>  <p>  IBs are required to promote and publicise RSS to encourage the take-up of the scheme among eligible candidates. </p>  <p>  Following a Government decision in 2017, the number of places on RSS was increased by 750 during 2017 and 2018 and a six-year time limit was introduced for new entrants, with effect from 1st February 2017 bringing the total number of places available to 3,350.  </p>  <p>  RSS participants who commenced on the scheme prior to 1st February 2017 can remain on the scheme and are not subject to the six-year limit on participation, provided that they continue to remain eligible for receipt of a qualifying social welfare payment. </p>  <p>  Prior to the introduction of the six-year time limit, an RSS participant could remain on the RSS scheme for a significant part of their working life.  This had the effect of limiting turnover of places on RSS and thereby reducing the opportunities for new entrants.  The six-year participation limit also serves to reduce the possibility of RSS participants or the organisations with whom they are placed becoming dependent on the scheme.</p>  <p>  The first cohort of participants that will leave RSS on the basis of the six-year rule will not arise until February, 2023.  </p>  <p>  The weekly rate of pay on RSS is determined by the underlying social welfare payment which would be payable to the RSS participant based on their household composition and financial circumstances, plus the weekly top up rate.  RSS participants may also be entitled to increases in relation to a qualified adult or qualified children.</p>  <p>  Any increase to the &euro;22.50 per week rate would have significant budgetary implications and would need to be considered in the context of the Department's wider employment support programmes.  This is not under consideration at this time.</p>  <p>  The Department continues to monitor all of the employment support programmes and while there are no plans to amend the RSS rules at present, the Department does intend to undertake a review of RSS in 2022, to ensure the ongoing best outcomes for both participants and their local communities.</p></reply>

CE participants, whose contracts were due to end during the periods of restrictions, have had their contracts extended on a number of occasions.  Earlier this week, the Minister for Social Protection, Minister Humphreys, and I announced a further funding for contract extensions to 4th February 2022 for existing CE and T&uacute;s participants.  </p><p>These final contract extensions will provide all participants with additional time to complete their training and benefit from work experience, which may have been adversely affected by public health restrictions.</p><p>The series of contract extensions introduced are exceptional supports and are temporary in nature; they will come to an end in 2022 as CE operations return to normal, post pandemic.  Following the latest extension, a coordinated and phased exit schedule will commence in February, 2022 for all of the CE and T&uacute;s participants affected.</p><p>Other than the above, there have been no significant amendments to CE since 2017.  However in March 2021 Minister Humphreys and I confirmed that certain CE participants, who were participating on CE when the 2017 changes had been introduced, would retain the option of remaining on CE for a maximum of six consecutive years, in accordance with the terms of a 2017 saver clause provided at that time.</p><p>In order to ensure that all employment and activation programmes have the best outcomes for participants, CE will continue to be made available to support those who are long term unemployed and furthest removed from the labour market, including those whose employment has been impacted by COVID-19.  </p><p>At the same time, the eligibility criteria for CE and the length of time persons can participate on CE is kept under active review by my Department officials to ensure the best outcomes for individual participants and to support the vital community services delivered by schemes.</p><p>I trust this clarifies matters for the Deputy. </p></reply>

The objective of the programme is to provide regular, nutritious food to children who are unable, due to lack of good quality food, to take full advantage of the education provided to them.  The programme is an important component of policies to encourage school attendance and extra educational achievement.</p><p>A budget of &euro;65.1 million has been provided for the scheme in 2021.</p><p>As part of Budget 2019, funding was provided for a pilot scheme from September 2019, providing hot school meals in primary schools at a cost of &euro;1m for 2019 and &euro;2.5m in 2020.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-10-07a.196.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021100700058#WRD01800"><p>The Covid-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) was introduced as an exceptional measure in response to the unprecedented impact on employment and earnings as a result of Government mandated public health measures.</p><p>There are currently 2,978 customers in Co. Wicklow in receipt of the PUP.  This is a reduction of 84% from the peak in May 2020 when 18,629 people in Co. Wicklow received the PUP. </p><p>While many people who have been receiving the PUP are returning to employment as restrictions ease and the economy re-opens, it is inevitable that some jobs will be permanently lost, and additional numbers of persons will require State support to find new jobs transitioning back to work. </p><p>My Department&rsquo;s Activation teams of Case Officers and Job Coaches are supporting PUP recipients and the Local Employment Service in Bray, Co. Wicklow continues to support jobseekers in that location who are long term unemployed.  My Department is supporting initiatives to assist people to get back to work, as COVID-19 restrictions and their impact on the economy and labour market begin to ease.  For example, during August and September all long term PUP customers in County Wicklow were contacted by phone to determine if they needed support in returning to work and my officials responded to the requests for support and information that this elicited.  </p><p>Throughout the pandemic my Department has been assisting employers with vacancies as the economy reopened by matching vacancies to relevant jobseekers via email notifications, pre-recorded recruitment videos featuring employers and the hosting of live recruitment events.  </p><p>Last month my Department hosted a 6-day series of online recruitment events, which were available to all PUP recipients in Co. Wicklow, featuring 30 employers with over 1,000 live vacancies.  Many sectors of the economy were covered including construction, hospitality, retail, manufacturing, sales and customer service.  Many large-scale companies took part including Amazon, Ryanair, McDonalds, Circle K, Butlers Chocolates, DID Electrical, Musgraves, Accenture and public sector employers.  One of these events focussed on training and education opportunities currently available. People on the Live Register and people on the Pandemic Unemployment Payment were invited to attend these events.  In total 12,217 individuals participated in these events.  Feedback to date from employers and jobseekers has been positive and recruitment for the positions available is continuing.</p><p>A further series of events is being planned for Co. Wicklow clients for the remainder of the year to include regular vacancy alerts for jobseekers, live and pre-recorded recruitment events as well as events to highlight training and upskilling opportunities.  These events and information sessions will be available to both jobseekers on the Live Register and Pandemic Unemployment Payment customers. </p><p>As outlined under the Government&rsquo;s &lsquo;Economic Recovery Plan&rsquo;, which was launched on June 1<sup>st</sup>2021, a central focus of the recovery process will be on helping people get back to work, training or education by extending labour market supports, and through intense activation and skills opportunities.  Pathways to Work 2021-2025 is a key delivery mechanism of the Economic Recovery Plan&rsquo;s second Pillar on &lsquo;Helping People Back into Work&rsquo;.</p><p>In supporting people back into employment the Pathways to Work 2021&ndash;2025 strategy seeks to minimise any long-term scarring effects of the pandemic on the labour force for those whose jobs are permanently lost while providing support to those unemployed pre-pandemic.  The strategy also sets out how an expanded Public Employment Service will utilise its existing and expanded capacity to deliver effective services in a post-COVID labour market with an overall target of increasing the caseload capacity by 100,000 per annum.</p><p>Some of the key supports form part of Pathways to Work and the Economic Recovery Plan include:</p><p>- Expanding the JobsPlus scheme to 8,000 places and enhancing the incentive to recruit young jobseekers in particular, by increasing the youth age limit from 25 to 30 years.</p><p>- Accelerating rollout of an additional 50,000 education and training places to support jobseekers to upskill and reskill for the labour market.</p><p>- A new Government Youth Employment Charter for intensive engagement with young jobseeker which will build on the new EU Reinforced Youth Guarantee.</p><p>- A new work placement scheme is open to all people regardless of age and should be particularly attractive to and beneficial for young people requiring work experience. </p><p>My Department works closely with the Further Education and Training sector, including the Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board (ETB), to provide access to training, upskilling and reskilling opportunities.  The Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science also last week announced the extension of the Apprenticeship Incentivisation Scheme until the end of December 2021.  This scheme provides financial supports for employers who register apprentices to a national apprenticeship.  </p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Roadmap includes a specific goal to protect the incomes of older people through the delivery of the commitment to benchmark State pension payments, which was outlined in the Roadmap for Pensions Reform 2018 &ndash; 2023. </p><p>The Roadmap for Social Inclusion outlines a potential approach for benchmarking pensions: the smoothed earnings approach.  This aims to ensure that over the long-term, the relative value of welfare payments compared to market earnings would be maintained and that, over any short-term period the real value, or purchasing power, of these payments would be protected. </p><p>Proposals on benchmarking of pensions is an issue considered by the Pensions Commission and I understand this Report is due to be published shortly, after consideration by Government.

This phase involves the procurement of regional employment services for seven counties in the Midlands and North-West across four lots.  These counties do not have an existing local employment service and represent the first phase of an expansion of similar employment services across.</p>  <p>  This procurement process follows extensive consultations by my Department with the existing service providers over the last number of years. </p>  <p>  The Phase two procurement, which will see the Regional Employment Service model rolled out across the State will take on board the learnings of the first phase.

Delivery under the CES is underpinned by three year Action Plans, as agreed by the Comprehensive Employment Strategy Implementation Group (CES-IG). </p><p>In addition, there are a number of other strategies that provide a framework for cross-departmental working and the development of services for people with disabilities.  Notably, these include the Roadmap for Social Inclusion (RSI) and Pathways to Work (PtW) strategies. </p><p>My Department currently provides a wide range of both income supports and employment supports to assist both jobseekers/existing employees with disabilities, and employers seeking to hire a jobseeker (or support an existing employee) with a disability.</p><p>The Department's disability-related income schemes have been designed to support people with disabilities to enter or return to employment or self-employment, as follows:</p><p><i>Disability Allowance (DA) and Blind Pension (BP)</i></p><p>Both DA and BP are structured to support recipients to avail of opportunities to pursue their own employment ambitions, be that self-employment or insurable employment.  When an individual commences employment, they can avail of an income disregard of &euro;140 per week.  In addition, a 50% taper on earnings between &euro;140 and &euro;350 is also applied, i.e., 50% of earnings in this band are disregarded for the purpose of the means test. </p><p><i>Partial Capacity Benefit (PCB)</i></p><p>The PCB scheme allows a person who has been in receipt of Invalidity Pension or Illness Benefit (the latter for a minimum of 26 weeks), and who may not have full capacity for work, to enter or return to employment or self-employment and continue to receive a partial or full payment.  PCB has been designed so there are no restrictions / limits on earnings from employment or on the number of hours a person can work under the scheme.</p><p><i>The Back to Work Enterprise Allowance (BTWEA) </i></p><p>The BTWEA scheme has been designed to support persons, including persons with disabilities, to become self-employed.  BTWEA has been designed so that customers who avail of it can retain a percentage of their income support payment for up to 2 years.  Persons in receipt of a wide range of income supports, including disability allowance and blind pension, are eligible for the scheme.  </p><p>In addition to providing income supports, DSP also provides a wide range of employment-related supports for both jobseekers / employees with disabilities and employers.  </p><p>These include:</p><p><i>DSP's Intreo Service</i></p><p>The Department's Intreo service is a single point of contact for all employment and income supports in the State.  Intreo provides a case-managed employment service and supports to both jobseekers and employers.  Jobseekers, including jobseekers with disabilities, who seek support from their local Intreo Centre, work with a case officer with a view to agreeing a suitable personal progression plan in order to access the full range of employment supports available.  Intreo also delivers a recruitment and job matching service for employers.  </p><p><i>Local Employment Services</i></p><p>The Department contracts for the provision of Local Employment Services.  Providers deliver a case-managed employment service for all jobseekers, including those with disabilities, who avail of the services.  Jobseekers work with a LES Mediator to develop a personal progression plan in order to access the full range of employment supports available.  Providers also deliver a recruitment and job matching service for employers.  </p><p><i>Specialist Employability Services</i></p><p>The Department recognises the additional challenges some jobseekers with disabilities may experience in securing and maintaining employment, and so contracts for the provision of services to help address these.  The Department contracts with 24 companies for the delivery of EmployAbility services in 31 locations.  </p><p>Access to these service providers is through referral only: a jobseeker with a disability who is working with their Intreo Case Officer or LES Mediator may be referred to an EmployAbility service provider only if it is agreed between the case officer or mediator and the jobseeker that they would benefit from the type of services and support provided.  Providers deliver a supported employment model of services for jobseekers with disabilities.  Jobseekers work with a job coach who provides both pre-employment and in-employment support and assistance.  Providers also deliver a recruitment and job matching service for employers.</p><p><i>Support for Graduate Jobseekers with Disabilities</i></p><p>The Department contracts AHEAD (Association for Higher Education Access and Disability) to deliver the Willing Able Mentoring (WAM) and &lsquo;Get Ahead&rsquo; Programmes on its behalf.  These programmes provide paid work experience and other supports for graduates with disabilities seeking to enter or re-enter employment.  Full details are available via www.ahead.ie/disabilitysupports</p><p><i>Reasonable Accommodation Fund (RAF) Grants</i></p><p>The four grants available under the RAF are:</p><p>1. Workplace Equipment/Adaptation Grant: </p><p>Where a person with a disability has been offered employment, is in employment or is self-employed and requires a more accessible workplace or adapted equipment to do the job, s/he or the employer may be able to receive a grant towards the costs of adapting premises or equipment.  A maximum grant of &euro;6,350 is available towards the cost of adaptations to premises or equipment.  Applications in excess of this sum are considered on an individual basis up to a maximum of &euro;9,523 if specialist training for assistive technology is required.</p><p>2. Employee Retention Grant</p><p>The purpose of the Employee Retention Grant Scheme is to assist employers to retain employees who acquire a disability by providing funding to identify accommodation and/or training to enable the employee to remain in his/her current position, or to retrain the employee so that s/he can take up another position within the company.</p><p>Funding is provided in two stages:</p><p>- Stage 1 - This stage is subject to a maximum of &euro;2,500 or 90% of eligible programme costs per employee to hire specialists to evaluate the employee&rsquo;s occupational capacity and conduct a workplace or job assessment to develop an individualised written retention strategy.</p><p>- Stage 2 - This stage is subject to a maximum of &euro;12,500 or 90% of eligible programme costs per employee to train the employee for their current position or to retrain them for another position within the company, hire a job coach to offer support to the employee and liaise with the employee&rsquo;s line manager for a maximum period of 300 hours, and hire a specialist to manage the retention strategy on an ongoing basis until reintegration is complete, for a maximum period of 60 hours.</p><p>3. Job Interview Interpreter Grant </p><p>A jobseeker who is deaf, hard of hearing or has speech impairment and is attending job interviews, may apply for funding to have a sign language interpreter or other interpreter to attend interviews.  A three-hour period for each interview can be funded.  The amount of the grant payable is based on an hourly fee paid which may vary.  A person may have several interviews arranged and can apply for funding for each.  There is no limit to the number of interviews a person can attend with an interpreter.  </p><p>Funding is also available to cover the cost of an interpreter to assist a person during the induction process, when he/she starts work with a private sector employer.  A maximum of three hours interpreter support is available, to be utilised by the person as he/she feels is needed.  Both the interview interpreter funding and in-employment interpreter support funding, for induction, can be provided.  In addition, the grant can also be used to cover travel costs for the interpreter &ndash; the cost of public transport or, if not available, a set rate per kilometer is applied. </p><p>4. Personal Reader Grant </p><p>A person employed in the private sector who is (or is becoming) blind or visually impaired, and who needs assistance with job-related reading, can apply for a grant to support them to employ a personal reader.  The amount of the grant payable is based on an hourly fee paid to the reader, in line with the current minimum wage, for an agreed period - for a maximum of 640 hours per year. </p><p>In addition to the above, the Department also provides two other supports specifically for employers: </p><p><i>1. Disability Awareness Support Scheme</i></p><p>The Disability Awareness Support Scheme provides funding for private sector employers to arrange and pay for disability awareness training for staff who work with a colleague with a disability.  Subject to meeting the conditions that apply, in the first year that a company applies, 90% of eligible training costs are provided up to a maximum of &euro;20,000.  In the second and subsequent years, 80% of eligible training costs are provided up to a maximum of &euro;20,000 in any one calendar year.</p><p><i>2. Wage Subsidy Scheme</i></p><p>The Wage Subsidy Scheme is targeted at private sector employers and is aimed at encouraging the employment of people with disabilities through the provision of financial incentives (a wage subsidy).  The subsidy is delivered in three strands:</p><p>Strand I subsidy is a general subsidy for any productivity shortfall in excess of 20% for a person with a disability, in comparison to a colleague without a disability.  An employee must work for a minimum of 21 hours per week up to a  maximum of 39 subsidised hours per week.  The rate of subsidy is &euro;5.30 per hour and the amount  of the subsidy is based on the number of hours worked.</p><p>Strand II subsidy is payable when an employer employs three or more people with a disability who are supported by a WSS Strand I payment.  Strand II is intended to cover the additional supervisory, management and other work-based costs relating to these employees.  This top-up payment is a percentage of the Strand I subsidy and is based on the overall number of employees with a disability employed under Strand I.  It ranges from an additional 10% of wage subsidy for 3 to 6 employees with a disability to a maximum of 50% of wage subsidy for 23+ employees with a disability. </p><p>Strand III subsidy enables employers who employ 25 or more workers with a disability on the Wage Subsidy Scheme to be eligible for a grant of up to &euro;30,000 per year towards the expense of employing an Employment Assistance Officer to support these employees.</p><p>Dormant Accounts Funding to Support Employment Opportunities for Carers and People with Disabilities</p><p>The Dormant Accounts Act 2001, together with the Unclaimed Life Assurance Policies Act 2003 and the Dormant Accounts (Amendment) Acts 2005 to 2012, provide a framework for the administration of unclaimed accounts in credit institutions (i.e. banks, building societies and An Post) and unclaimed life assurance policies in insurance undertakings.  </p><p>The legislation introduced a scheme for the disbursement of funds that are unlikely to be reclaimed, but only for the purposes of programmes or projects to assist:</p><p>- the personal and social development of persons who are economically or socially disadvantaged;</p><p>- the educational development of persons who are educationally disadvantaged;</p><p>- persons with a disability.</p><p>On 30th July, the Minister for Social Protection announced over &euro;7.5 million in funding to support and improve employment opportunities for people with disabilities.  Projects were selected following a competitive process organised by Pobal that evaluated applications against a number of predefined criteria. Pobal also manages the delivery process including payment and auditing.</p><p>A funding package for 45 projects nationwide is now in place and designed to support people with disabilities to improve their employment skills, advance their education or start their own business.  </p><p>This is in addition to an existing measure to support carers and people with disabilities to access employment (incl. self-employment) and training/education which began in January 2021 (until mid-2022) and is currently supporting sixteen projects totalling over &euro;2.3 million.</p><p>Any further improvements or additions to these supports can only be considered in a budgetary context and in the light of available financial resources.  </p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This is to ensure the continued availability of places on CE schemes for a broad range of long-term unemployed candidates, while those completing the scheme progress to employment in the open labour market.</p>  <p>  There is already graduated additional flexibility for participants on CE aged 55 and over.  For example, those over 55 years of age can remain on CE for up to three years, without undertaking formal training, while CE participants who are aged over 55 and commenced on CE prior 2017 can continue to be eligible to stay on CE for six consecutive years.  </p>  <p>  CE participants over the age of 62 can participate on a continuous basis up to the state pension age on the CE Service Support Stream (SSS).  Currently up to a maximum 10% of CE places are allocated to this stream.  There are 1,400 CE participants on this stream at present.</p>  <p>  CE participants&rsquo; contracts, including those aged over 55, were extended over the course of the pandemic, as a emergency support measure, which resulted in many contracts extending beyond the time limits outlined above.  Earlier this week, the Minister for Social Protection, Minister Humphreys, and I announced a further contract extension to 4th February 2022 for existing CE and T&uacute;s participants.  These final contract extensions will provide all participants with additional time to complete their training and benefit from work experience on CE.  </p>  <p>  In order to ensure that all employment and activation programmes have the best outcomes for participants, CE will continue to be made available to support those who are long term unemployed and furthest removed from the labour market, including those whose employment has been impacted by COVID-19.  At the same time the eligibility criteria for CE and the length of time persons can stay on CE is kept under active review by my Department to ensure the best outcomes for individual participants and to support the vital community services delivered by schemes. </p></reply>

For example, the last two Budgets have, in fact, seen a series of evidence-based increases in some social welfare payments targeted to improve the situation of the people who are most at risk of poverty and to ensure the most vulnerable were protected. </p><p>While core rates for pensioners remained unchanged in Budgets 2020 and 2021, measures were introduced which sought to protect some of the most vulnerable groups, including pensioners.</p><p>In recognition of research which indicates that those who are aged 65 years and over are more likely to be at risk of poverty, deprivation and consistent poverty if they live alone, the Living Alone Allowance was increased by &euro;10 per week over the course of Budgets 2020 and 2021.  This brought the rate from &euro;9 to &euro;19 per week. </p><p>To take account of increased costs arising as a result of increases to the carbon tax, the Fuel Allowance was increased by &euro;2 per week in Budget 2020 and a further &euro;3.50 per week in Budget 2021.  This raised the weekly rate of payment from &euro;22.50 in 2019 to &euro;28 currently.</p><p>As a result of these targeted measures, some of the most vulnerable social welfare recipients have already seen increases significantly above the rate of inflation over this period.  For example, during the fuel season, a pensioner or person with a disability living alone is up to &euro;15.50 per week better off.  In addition, on a once-off basis in 2020, the fuel season was extended by four weeks, in recognition of the fact that many people were spending more time at home due to the Covid-19 lockdown. </p><p>In considering options for the forthcoming Social Welfare Budget package, I will once again be guided by evidence-based research produced by organisations such as the CSO, the ERSI and the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice.  Taking an evidence-based approach ensures that available resources are used to deliver maximum impact in terms of reducing poverty and disadvantage. </p></reply>

As provided for in Budget 2021, Parent&rsquo;s Leave and Benefit have been extended from 2 weeks to 5 weeks for each parent.  These additional weeks are available to parents in respect of children born or adopted on or after 1st November 2019.</p>  <p>  The period during which this leave can be taken has also been extended from 12 to 24 months so it can be taken up to a child's second birthday or within two years following adoption.  These changes, which came into effect from 1 April 2021, enhance the flexibility of the scheme to make it easier for parents to avail of Parent&rsquo;s Benefit.</p>  <p>  Parent&rsquo;s Benefit is paid at a weekly flat rate of &euro;245 for 5 weeks to employed and self-employed people who satisfy certain pay related social insurance (PRSI) contribution and other conditions.  The rate of Parent&rsquo;s Benefit is in line with the rates of Paternity Benefit, Adoptive Benefit and Maternity Benefit.</p>  <p>  A number of employers top up their employee&rsquo;s Parent&rsquo;s Benefit in much the same way as they offer to top up Maternity and Paternity benefit.  These arrangements are discretionary private contractual arrangements agreed between employers and workers and, as such, are outside the realm of Social Welfare legislation.</p>  <p>  Since the changes to Parent&rsquo;s Benefit came into effect, the Department of Social Protection has awarded Parent&rsquo;s Benefit to some 30,570 parents at a cost of over &euro;23 million.

It is deliberately non-transferable between parents to ensure that both parents are encouraged and supported in taking time out from work to spend time with their child.  This is further supported through the provision of Parents&rsquo; Benefit at &euro;245 per week.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the entitlement under the 2019 Act is for each parent in their own right and is not an allocation per family. This is a requirement of the Work Life Balance directive. The Act was drafted in such a way as to take account of the broad complexion of family life and allows for an entitlement for the spouse, civil partner or cohabitant of the parent. </p>  <p>  This means that each parent of the child, and their respective spouse, civil partner or cohabitant, is entitled to take parents&rsquo; leave in respect of that child.  In effect this means that, if the parents of a child are not a couple but are in a separate relationship then their partner is entitled to parent&rsquo;s leave to care for the child.</p>  <p>  Commissioning surrogate parents may be entitled to Parents&rsquo; Leave, depending on their circumstances.  The father of a child born through surrogacy can qualify for Parents&rsquo; Leave if he is the biological father of the child and declared to be the parent of the child.  In these circumstances, the father's partner may qualify for Parents&rsquo; Leave if looking after the child in loco parentis and if they are married to, or in a civil partnership with, the child&rsquo;s biological father, or have cohabited with the child&rsquo;s biological father for over 3 years.</p>  <p>  At a wider level, policy on surrogacy rests with the Minister for Health, and policy on parentage is a matter for the Minister for Justice.  It is important to develop legislation on family leave in the context of the legal situation concerning parentage, including in relation to surrogacy.  Any changes in the legal situation with regard to parentage and surrogacy are matters for the Minister for Justice and Minister for Health , but I will always be happy to working with them on these matters.  </p></reply>

The work of the Committee will help to strengthen the Government&rsquo;s approach to combatting individual and institutional racism and will build on the anti-racism actions included in the Migrant Integration Strategy (MIS) and the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy (NTRIS). The Committee will also examine international best practice in combatting racism and will benchmark its actions against these standards.</p>  <p>  On 21 April this year, I had the pleasure of publishing the Anti-Racism Committee&rsquo;s Interim Report, which sets out the Committee&rsquo;s initial ideas and plans for developing the National Action Plan Against Racism. The publication of this Action Plan will fulfil a key commitment within the Programme for Government.</p>  <p>  The Committee&rsquo;s interim report contained valuable thinking, and I am working with my colleagues in Government to address their initial recommendations.</p>  <p>  On the same day as the publication of the Interim Report, the Committee launched the public consultation phase of its work, which ran for twelve weeks from 21 April until 14 July. During this phase, the Committee accepted written submissions, conducted an online survey, and held a series of consultation sessions with stakeholders  in order better to understand the nature and different forms of racism that are present in Ireland today.  </p>  <p>  There were 14 consultation sessions which took place between May and July, and these were attended by approximately 170 people in total.  These sessions addressed different themes such as access to justice; media and new technologies; and others identified by the Committee as being of particular concern in the fight against racism.  I was pleased to see that over 100 written submissions were made, and these are currently being analysed.  </p>  <p>  Having completed its public consultation, the Anti-Racism Committee is now engaged in the preparation of the National Action Plan Against Racism, with a view to submitting a draft Plan to me for consideration in the coming months.  I then intend to bring this Plan to Government and, subject to the agreement of the Government, hope to publish it early next year.</p></reply>

These standards were adopted by Government in 2019.</p>  <p>  The National Standards meet the requirements of the relevant legislation &ndash; the EU (recast) Reception Conditions Directive  which Ireland opted into in June 2018.</p>  <p>   My Department is currently engaging with HIQA and the Department of Health to undertake the preparatory work with regard to HIQA's monitoring role.  It is planned that the formal relationship between my Department and HIQA will begin with effect from 1 November this year.  In parallel with this process work is being undertaken to determine the legislative underpinning for HIQA's monitoring role.  </p>  <p>  In advance of the introduction of the independent monitoring mechanism, IPAS has taken steps to support adherence to the National Standards through its contract arrangements with accommodation centres.  All properties selected under IPAS&rsquo; most recent tender process are required to be able to implement the National Standards. This requirement applies to the provision of new centres and to any renewal of a contract with a current provider.</p>  <p>  In advance of HIQA&rsquo;s new role, it is important to note that there are inspections carried out under the current system.  At present, all IPAS permanent accommodation centres are subject to three unannounced inspections per year.  In 2021, two inspections will be carried out in each centre by an independent inspections company (QTS Ltd) and one by officials of the International Protection Accommodation Service (IPAS).    </p>  <p>  Inspections cover a wide range of issues including fire safety, appropriate signage and information for residents, the condition of communal areas and sleeping quarters, the quality of food provided and adherence to hygiene and other health and safety requirements.</p>  <p>  I look forward to HIQA becoming formally involved in this area.  As a respected, independent statutory body, I think it is wholly appropriate that HIQA would monitor the standards required in our accommodation centres for those seeking international protection.</p></reply>

Unfortunately, the Regulations do not enable the exercise of any discretion by the data controller and require consultation with an appropriate health practitioner in all cases.</p><p>As I have stated previously, I am not satisfied with the requirement to consult with an appropriate health practitioner in all cases. As the Regulations concern access to health data, the Minister for Health and his officials are leading on progressing new Regulations.  Officials in my Department are engaging directly with officials in the Department of Health with a view to progressing the new Regulations as a priority.  </p><p>The making of new Regulations continues to be an important matter for me and my Department. In the interim, my Department has advised requestors of a possible alternative option to access their health data, which is through Freedom of Information legislation. This route allows access to the same health information without any need to consult a health practitioner. A number of people have to date received their health data under FOI.</p><p>I am conscious that the current situation is very unsatisfactory for individuals seeking information, and I want to see the matter resolved as soon as possible.

However, the NAPC will involve significant change for childminders, and it will be critical that as many childminders as possible are supported to make the transition to regulation and to be able to access subsidies for families using their services. Given the large scale of reforms involved, with thousands of childminders expected to move into the scope of regulation and supports and the need to build the infrastructure to support the reforms, the NAPC necessarily involves a phased approach.</p>  <p>  In particular, during Phase 1 of the NAPC, which is expected to last 2-3 years, childminding-specific regulations will need to be developed that are proportionate and appropriate to childminders as will childminder-specific training. In addition, primary legislation will need to be amended, and there will be a need for further engagement and consultation with the childminding sector. </p>  <p>  The Steering Group for the NAPC has recently been established. Its purpose is to drive, oversee and monitor implementation of the NAPC. </p>  <p>  The Steering Group will be supported by four Advisory Groups which will be established over the course of Phase 1 in relation to: regulation and inspection; training and support; funding and financial supports; and stakeholder engagement, consultation and communications.</p>  <p>  To support implementation of the NAPC, a National Childminding Coordinator has been appointed, and six regional Childminding Development Officers have been appointed to work with the City and County Childcare Committees at local level.</p></reply>

These standards were adopted by Government in 2019.</p>  <p>  The National Standards meet the requirements of the relevant legislation &ndash; the EU (recast) Reception Conditions Directive  which Ireland opted into in June 2018.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently engaging with HIQA and the Department of Health to undertake the preparatory work with regard to HIQA's monitoring role.  It is planned that the formal relationship between my Department and HIQA will begin with effect from 1 November this year.  In parallel with this process work is being undertaken to determine the legislative underpinning for HIQA's monitoring role.  </p>  <p>  In advance of the introduction of the independent monitoring mechanism, IPAS has taken steps to support adherence to the National Standards through its contract arrangements with accommodation centres.  All properties selected under IPAS&rsquo; most recent tender process are required to be able to implement the National Standards. This requirement applies to the provision of new centres and to any renewal of a contract with a current provider.</p>  <p>  In advance of HIQA&rsquo;s new role, it is important to note that there are inspections carried out under the current system.  At present, all IPAS permanent accommodation centres are subject to three unannounced inspections per year.  In 2021, two inspections will be carried out in each centre by an independent inspections company (QTS Ltd) and one by officials of the International Protection Accommodation Service (IPAS).  Inspections cover a wide range of issues including fire safety, appropriate signage and information for residents, the condition of communal areas and sleeping quarters and adherence to hygiene and other health and safety requirements.</p>  <p>  I look forward to HIQA becoming formally involved in this area.  As a respected, independent statutory body, I think it is wholly appropriate that HIQA would monitor the standards required in our accommodation centres for those seeking international protection.</p></reply>

This has been borne out by multiple research reports including &ldquo;How's Your Head?&rdquo;, a national consultation commissioned by my Department. This research has informed the Government response across the pandemic.</p>  <p>  In recognition of the vital role played by youth work in providing support to young people, funding levels were maintained throughout the COVID period. My Department has also engaged with the sector to develop sector specific guidance which was updated at each point there was a change to the Covid-19 measures at Government and NPHET level.</p>  <p>  A total sum of &euro;1,338,270 in funding was allocated to youth services to mitigate Covid-19 and its impact in 2020. An ICT investment grant of &euro;1,000,000 was made available to support the improvement of ICT infrastructure within youth services and youth clubs to facilitate the remote provision of youth programmes and youth services. Early in my tenure, my Department made available a fund of &euro;338,000 for a small capital grant scheme. The scheme allowed over 1,500 funded youth services and clubs to meet minor costs incurred as a result of Covid-19 response measures.</p>  <p>  A further amount of &euro;1.4m is currently being distributed through the ETBs nationally to mitigate Covid-19 cost pressures and to support the re-engagement of volunteers as we continue to move out of restrictions.</p>  <p>  In relation to youth funding more broadly, I secured an increase of &euro;5 million in funding for youth services in 2021. &euro;66.8 million is being provided to youth services nationwide this year. The additional funding allocated to youth services in 2021 is supporting the delivery of universal and targeted youth services nationwide, with a particular view to the role played by youth services in fostering resilience and developing the social and personal competencies of young people.</p>  <p>   Further capital funding will be available in 2022 and my officials will seek to make detailed information available on that scheme as early as possible in the new year.</p></reply>

I acknowledge that many early learning and childcare services are reporting staffing and recruitment difficulties, with increased pressures as a result of Covid-19. My Department is actively monitoring the issue and has sought data and evidence-based proposals from sectoral representatives.</p>  <p>The primary data source for the sector is the Annual Early Years Sector Profile. In the most recent published Sector Profile (published in 2021, and relating to data from 2020), 44% of services reported challenges in recruiting suitably qualified staff over the past 12 months. While this figure was down 9% from the previous year, it remains very high. The staff turnover rate has similarly fallen from 23% to 18%, but remains unacceptably high. </p>  <p>Recruitment and recruitment difficulties in the sector are undoubtedly linked to poor terms and conditions in the workforce, with for example the average pay being &euro;12.45 per hour.</p>  <p>I am conscious of the need for significant improvement in pay and conditions of employment for early learning and childcare professionals. The level of pay they receive does not reflect the value of the work they do for children, families and the wider society and economy.</p>  <p>The State, however, is not the employer and therefore cannot determine wages in the sector. Nevertheless, I am committed to doing what is in my power. That is why last December, I began a process to examine the possibility of regulating pay and conditions in the sector and the suitability of a Joint Labour Committee (or "JLC"). In agreement with IBEC/Childhood Services Ireland, and SIPTU, I appointed Dr Kevin Duffy, former Chair of the Labour Court, to be the independent chair of this process.</p>  <p>On foot of Dr Duffy&rsquo;s report, on 11 March, I wrote to the Minister of State for Business, Employment and Retail, recommending the establishment of a JLC for the sector.</p>  <p>In line with the provisions of the Industrial Relations Acts, the Labour Court recommended establishment of a JLC, and the Minister of State has now accepted the Labour Court&rsquo;s recommendations. </p>  <p>I am pleased to confirm that the Establishment Order came into effect on 1 July last. The JLC will provide an opportunity for unions and employer representatives to work together to determine pay and conditions for early learning and childcare professionals. </p>  <p>Work is also progressing on a new funding mode for the sector, with recommendations from the Expert Group due to be made in November.  I anticipate that the report will offer potential new avenues through which the State can support providers to improve pay and to meet the requirements of any future Employment Regulation Order that may arise from the JLC.</p>  <p>Work on a new Workforce Development Plan is also well advanced, with the final report due for completion by the end of the year. </p></reply>

My Department is working with key stakeholders across Government, Non-Government Organisations and agencies to progress work in this important area. </p><p>Tusla has funding of &euro;30 million for DSGBV services in 2021, an increase of &euro;4.7 million from 2020. This includes &euro;28m in core funding to NGO service providers and an additional &euro;2 million of once-off contingency funding being made available to help services cope with the ongoing effects of COVID-19. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis, Tusla has prioritised DSGBV services and actively engaged with involved services to provide continuity of support. </p><p>The additional funding secured in Budget 2021 reflects my commitment to victims of gender-based violence. These additional resources enable services to continue their valuable supports for victims and their families at a vulnerable time in their lives. </p><p>Additionally, this year, I have prioritised the development of legislative proposals for paid leave for victims of domestic violence.

In its Fifth Interim Report, the Commission of Investigation noted that 'About 100 acres were sold in 1973 for the building of the N25 and for social housing. The Commission understands that there are about 60 acres of ground around the building now.' </p>  <p>The Commission concluded that it is likely that burials did take place in the grounds of Bessborough but that the location of burials at Bessborough could not be ascertained, that the site was too large to feasibly excavate and that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding of the likely location of burials.</p>  <p>It is my understanding that, currently, the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary retains part of the site; some land has been transferred to the HSE; and other land is owned by private parties who intend to develop the site for housing, subject to the appropriate permissions. </p>  <p>As the Deputy will be aware, I made submissions to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and Cork City Council as part of the normal planning process in respect of two planning applications made on the Bessborough lands requesting that due consideration be given to the sensitivity of the site and the conclusions of the commission&rsquo;s report. Like himself, I attended and made an oral submission to the Oral Hearing on the SHD application.  This application related to a particular part of the site which is identified on a 1950s ordnance survey map as a burial ground and which campaigners consider to be the most likely location of burials. </p>  <p>As the land in question is in private ownership, it is not open to Government to procure or carry out investigations there.  However, it is notable that An Bord Plean&aacute;la has refused permission to develop the land because it 'is not satisfied that the site was not previously used as, and does not contain, a children's burial ground and considers that there are reasonable concerns in relation to the potential for a children's burial ground within the site [...]'. </p>  <p>I have recently written to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage asking him for support in encouraging local authorities to provide specific protections within their Development Plan processes for any burial sites that may be linked to former Mother and Baby Homes or County Homes.  The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage has informed me that he is satisfied the Planning and Development Act 2000 enables local authorities to protect any potential burial sites from possible harmful development.  I also know that Cork City Council has committed to undertaking its development plan process and I would urge the councillors to take account of the Commission's conclusions in the zoning of the land.</p></reply>

Investment under the NDP will consist of three pillars : Modernisation, New Capacity and First 5 Initiatives. This will enable significant capital investment in early learning and childcare during the lifetime of the NDP as follows:</p><p><b>(1) Modernisation: </b>Much of the existing early learning and childcare infrastructure that was previously delivered by large scale capital programmes is now in need of upgrading and modernisation in order to be fully compliant with new regulations and more recent guidelines, as well as to maximise energy efficiency. This investment will prioritise follow-up funding for buildings that were funded through the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme (EOCP) and the National Childcare Investment Programme (NCIP), with funding also available for previously non-funded infrastructure.</p><p><b>(2) New Capacity:</b>Ireland is approaching the limits of capacity, with shortfalls for early learning and childcare places already evident in some areas and for some cohorts. The rates of participation in early learning and childcare are also lower than European averages. As investment in subsidisation grows in the coming years as committed to in First 5 and the Programme for Government, demand from parents will also increase.</p><p>In the coming years, NDP capital funding allocated to early learning and childcare will be used to increase the stock of early learning and childcare infrastructure, in order to address capacity challenges including the undersupply for certain types of provision and in specific areas of the country.</p><p><b>(3) First 5 Initiatives</b>: First 5 (Government Strategy for babies, young children and their families 2019 -2028) was launched in 2018 and was re-committed to in the Programme for Government: Our Shared Future. First 5 envisages a range of innovative initiatives for the early learning and childcare sector, including piloting Family and Early Childhood Centres and piloting outdoor early learning and childcare provision, piloting meal provision. Each of these initiatives have capital requirements.</p><p>As outlined in the National Development Plan 2021-2030, access to affordable early learning and childcare is inherently linked to creating an equitable society, sustainable communities and a thriving economy. Early learning and childcare provision is therefore considered under the National Development Plan, along with housing, schools and health facilities as an integral part of national infrastructure.</p></reply>

I have also met with Aitheantas a number of times during 2020 and 2021 as part of my engagement with adoption stakeholders.</p>  <p>  With regard to the recommendations concerning a review of historic adoptions, I am very conscious that every record on adoption represents the lives of a number of individuals. There are major ethical issues at play where the reality, identity and family and legal relationships that people have lived their whole lives may be fundamentally impacted. I am also conscious that, in some cases, records may simply not exist anymore.</p>  <p>  From listening to those most centrally affected, I believe that what is important as an immediate priority is access to birth certificates and birth and early life information for adoptees. The Deputy will be aware that the Birth Information and Tracing legislation is currently undergoing pre-legislative scrutiny. If enacted, this legislation will, for the first time, enshrine in law the clear right of access to birth certificates, and other birth and early life information. </p>  <p>  The legislation will provide the necessary legal framework for a strong and supportive information and tracing service.  It will ensure that any individual with a question about their origins is empowered to access their own records and is supported with regard to any related needs.</p>  <p>  With regard to counselling, Barnardos provides a service for adopted adults and parents. In addition, the National Counselling Service provides a service for individuals who were resident in Mother and Baby Homes or whose births were illegally registered. The proposed Birth Information and Tracing legislation also deals with the provision of supports to adopted persons and parents. </p></reply>

Nevertheless, I am committed to doing what is in my power. That is why last December, I began a process to examine the possibility of regulating pay and conditions in the sector and the suitability of a Joint Labour Committee (or "JLC"). In agreement with IBEC/Childhood Services Ireland, and SIPTU, I appointed Dr Kevin Duffy, former Chair of the Labour Court, to be the independent chair of this process.</p>  <p>  On foot of Dr Duffy&rsquo;s report, on 11 March, I wrote to the Minister of State for Business, Employment and Retail, recommending the establishment of a JLC for the sector.</p>  <p>  In line with the provisions of the Industrial Relations Acts, the Labour Court recommended establishment of a JLC, and the Minister of State has now accepted the Labour Court&rsquo;s recommendations. </p>  <p>  I am pleased to confirm that the Establishment Order came into effect on 1 July last. The JLC will provide an opportunity for unions and employer representatives to work together to determine pay and conditions for early learning and childcare professionals. </p>  <p>  Work is also progressing on a new funding mode for the sector, with recommendations from the Expert Group due to be made in November.  I anticipate that the report will offer potential new avenues through which the State can support providers to improve pay and to meet the requirements of any future Employment Regulation Order that may arise from the JLC.</p>  <p>  Work on a new Workforce Development Plan is also well advanced, with the final report due for completion by the end of the year. </p></reply>

There are 30 CCCs, located nation-wide, who are funded by my Department to provide support and guidance to local early learning and care (ELC) and school age childcare (SAC) service providers and to parents.  CCCs act as the local agent of my Department in the coordination and delivery of the national early education and childcare programmes and the implementation of Government policy at a local level, and in facilitating and supporting the development of quality, accessible ELC and SAC services for the overall benefit of children and their parents. </p>  <p>  In 'First Five, the Whole of Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families', my </p>  <p>  Department committed to completing a comprehensive review of the operating model for ELC and SAC </p>  <p>  in this country.

The review's objective is to ensure that the operating model is fit for purpose to implement Departmental childcare policy relating to quality, affordability and access, to the scale and standards required in an evolving and expanding sector, with the citizens of Ireland at its heart as core beneficiaries. </p>  <p>  I am pleased to report that this review is well underway, and is due to conclude shortly.  An independent external contractor has been engaged by my Department to undertake an analysis of the current landscape and consideration of options for a future operating model.  This has involved significant stakeholder engagement, including with the 30 CCCs.  An Oversight Group, chaired by my Department, has also been established and is meeting regularly.</p>  <p>  I look forward to bringing a report to Government on the matter in the coming weeks. </p></reply>

The Group is tasked with examining the current model of funding, its effectiveness in delivering quality, affordable, sustainable and inclusive services and considering how additional resourcing can best be structured in order to achieve these objectives.  </p>  <p>  The Group has met nineteen times to date, its report is currently being drafted and is on track to be submitted to me in November.</p>  <p>  The development of the new funding model is supported by a significant programme of research. The research partner of the Expert Group has produced a series of working papers examining Ireland&rsquo;s approach to this sector in an international context including papers on reducing costs to parents and mechanisms to control fees. The Group has also engaged in an extensive and detailed stakeholder consultation process.  </p>  <p>  Material relating to the work of the Expert Group, including reports from consultation and engagement, meeting documentation and research papers are available on a dedicated website, www.first5fundingmodel.ie.</p>  <p>  In the immediate term, in addition to my Department's funding schemes, all services can participate in the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS). This provides an average of 50% of normal operating costs for services, at a value of some &euro;34m to the sector each month. The EWSS has been paid at enhanced rates since October 2020. Most businesses must demonstrate a 30% reduction in turnover to be eligible for supports under the scheme. When the EWSS was introduced in August 2020, I negotiated a special arrangement for registered early learning and childcare services to be exempt from this turnover test. These arrangements remain in place. Government has assured businesses that there will be no cliff-edge in the removal of supports, and my officials are working on a smooth transition from EWSS for the early learning and childcare sector.</p>  <p>  I recognise that early learning and childcare services are private businesses and are free to set their own policies regarding the charging of fees and contract conditions and I am aware that some services have notified parents of a future significant increase in fees. Given the substantial additional supports allocated to the sector, and the assurance that there will be no sudden withdrawal of Government supports, I do not believe there is a case for an increase to fees paid by parents at this time.</p></reply>

However, it does not set out a single standard or recommended number of refuge spaces. Article 23 specifically refers to shelters, which should be accessible and &ldquo;in sufficient numbers&rdquo; to provide a place of refuge to victims. </p>  <p>  A policy document "Combating Violence Against Women: Minimum Standards for Support Services", published by the Council of Europe, references two standards: either one shelter space per 10,000 head of adult population, or one shelter space per 10,000 head of female population. These standards employ specific mechanisms for measuring population and calculation of shelter spaces.</p>  <p>  In line with reporting conventions previously used by the Department of Justice, Tusla has applied the standard of one shelter space per 10,000 head of female population. This reflects the community-focused integrated response for victims, where community-based organisations and outreach supports are in place alongside refuges. This is in contrast to some other states that may not have a range of other support services such as those available in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Tusla&rsquo;s &lsquo;Review of the Provision of Accommodation for Victims of Domestic Violence&rsquo; has been completed and is undergoing the final edit for publication. Once this process is completed, the Review will then be published by Tusla, which I anticipate will be over the coming weeks. The Review assesses the current and requisite distribution of safe emergency accommodation and has examined the current level of refuge provision, evidence of demand for services and unmet need, and analysis of proximity to refuge by local communities. </p>  <p>  The Review represents my commitment to prioritising and supporting victims of DSGBV. My Department will engage with Tusla, Non-Government Organisations, that play a key role in this area, other relevant Government Departments and Agencies, particularly the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, the Department of Justice, to progress work in this area. It is important that the needs of those who experience domestic violence are met in the most appropriate way possible. </p></reply>

This has allowed services to operate sustainably within the context of public health guidance throughout a period of significant uncertainty.  </p><p>In the context of Covid period, I note that there have not, on the whole, been significant fee increases to parents compared to average full-time fee increases of 3% per annum in the 2017-2019 period.</p><p>The major programmes funded by my Department that contribute to affordability and accessibility for parents include the Early Childhood Care and Education Programme, the Access and Inclusion Model and the National Childcare Scheme. </p><p>The universal <i>Early Childhood Care and Education</i>preschool programme provides for free access to early learning and childcare for 15 hours per week for the two years before children start primary school.  This significantly offsets the costs to parents of early learning and childcare at this stage. </p><p>An estimated 95% children in the relevant age cohort participate in this programme. </p><p>The <i>Access and Inclusion Model</i>provides a range of both universal and targeted measures, to support children with disabilities to take part in the ECCE pre-school programme in mainstream settings, and to help make pre-school services more accessible and inclusive &ndash; benefiting all children in those services. </p><p>The <i>National Childcare Scheme</i>provides universal and income-assessed subsidies to parents.  </p><p>A universal subsidy for children up to three is available for up to 45 hours per week.  An income-assessed subsidy is available for children of all ages for up to 45 hours per week, the level of which is determined by the family&rsquo;s income.  The NCS is designed to be highly inclusive and to meet the needs of those families who need it the most. The NCS is based on the principle of progressive universalism and has regard to the best interests of children. </p><p>The Programme for Government commits to an ambitious range of actions to develop the early learning and childcare sector including the implementation of the First 5 strategy, an action in which is to undertake an examination of the funding model for the sector and make recommendations for development. Other relevant commitments are to continue to invest in the National Childcare Scheme and to examine the approach of other European countries to set a cap on parental fees, irrespective of income. </p><p>The examination of the funding model is being led by an Expert Group.  The terms of reference of the Group include to review the existing approach to funding in terms of its effectiveness in delivering on the policy objectives of quality, affordability, accessibility and contributing to addressing disadvantage; identify and consider options on how additional funding could be structured to deliver on policy objectives; and agree a proposed design for a new funding model.</p><p>The Expert Group is comprised of international and national figures who have significant experience of early learning and childcare quality, systems and funding and is independently chaired.  The Group has undertaken an in-depth programme of research and analysis and engaged in an extensive and detailed stakeholder consultation process.  The Group has commissioned a series of research reports examining Ireland&rsquo;s approach to this sector in an international context including approaches to reducing costs to parents and mechanisms to control fees, all of which have been published.  </p><p>The report of the Expert Group is currently being drafted and is on track to be submitted to me in November.</p></reply>

In order to ensure objectivity and fairness, it is essential that clear rules exist for the scheme and that they are applied evenly.

This year, applications were received from all 31 Local Authorities for 52 projects and a total of &euro;450,000 was awarded by my Department. This year&rsquo;s scheme was opened to applications from Local Authorities on April 1, with a closing date of April 22</p><p>Criteria for the scheme are developed in partnership with the Local Authority Play and Recreation Network (LAPRN), established for the purpose of bringing a focus on play and recreation within each Local Authority. </p><p>One of the key criteria that is measured and scored during this process is <i>Accessibility &amp;amp; Inclusivity</i>; under this criteria we require Local Authorities to indicate how improvements to facilities and equipment for which funding is sought will:</p><p>- improve access/inclusivity to the park/facility for children and young people with additional needs, and</p><p>- provide access/inclusivity to the play equipment for all children</p><p>Having accessibility included as a funding criteria encourages Local Authorities to include projects for consideration that are primarily geared towards accessibility/inclusivity. This year for example, we approved funding for a number of projects to incorporate basket swing and wheelchair accessible swings into existing playgrounds.</p><p>In addition to the Play and Recreation Capital scheme, my Department also allocated &euro;87k to Local Authorities in relation to National Play Day 2021, which took place in July of this year.</p><p>The aim of National Play Day is to promote play opportunities for children and young people across the country, with this year&rsquo;s theme being <i>Playful Communities.</i>The National Play Day grant scheme is one part of the wider <i>Summer of Play campaign</i>; a government-led initiative designed to remind everyone, young and old, of the fundamental importance of play.</p><p>My Department received applications from 29 Local Authorities for this funding. All applicants qualified for the maximum amount of funding available - &euro;3,000 per Local Authority (which represents a 50% increase on the funding available to each Local Authority under this scheme in 2020). </p><p>The applications approved for funding enabled Local Authorities to deliver play opportunities for a diverse range of children and young people in the community. Numerous approved applications entailed play packs being purchased and targeted for disbursement to a number of harder to reach children, including traveller children, children with additional needs, children residing in women's refuge centres and children residing in direct provision centres. </p><p>Additionally a diverse range of outdoor activities were targeted at all children and young people in the respective Local Authority communities.</p><p>The <i>Summer of Play campaign, </i>referred to earlier<i>,</i>included a capital grant programme to enhance outdoor provision in early learning and care and school age services.  There were 3,689 approved applications with a total spend of &euro;4,597,500.</p><p>A grant was also offered to support new and existing Parent and Toddler groups.

It brings together State and non-State actors to implement change across 76 targeted actions, including measures to promote social inclusion, to improve access to public services and to address racism and xenophobia.</p><p>While initially due to conclude in 2020, the Migrant Integration Strategy was extended to the end of 2021 in recognition of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Strategy&rsquo;s implementation. My Department intends to commission an independent evaluation of all equality strategies due to conclude this year, the findings of which will inform the development of the future strategic approach to equality policies. I anticipate that a consultation process to develop a new strategic policy for migrant integration will begin early in 2022.</p><p>A number of funding streams have been made available by my Department to support migrants, or persons of migrant origin, to participate on an equal basis with those of Irish heritage.</p><p>-<b>National Funding Streams</b></p><p>Under the National Integration Fund 2020, a total of &euro;2.2 million has been made available over a three year period to support 18 integration projects nationwide.  These projects aim to increase mutual understanding between local communities and migrants; combat racism and xenophobia; promote the integration of vulnerable or socially-excluded immigrants and encourage the involvement of migrants in sport, volunteering and cultural activities.</p><p>In addition, the Communities Integration Fund provides small grant funding (&euro;1,000 - &euro;5,000 per project) to local community-based projects to support migrant integration.  Following a competitive open call in 2021, 111 local community-based organisations nationwide have been selected to receive grant funding under the Communities Integration Fund totalling &euro;497,772.</p><p>Both the National Integration Fund and Communities Integration Fund arose from actions contained within the Migrant Integration Strategy.</p><p>-<b>Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF)</b></p><p>In 2016, EU Funds Unit (then part of Department of Justice and Equality, now part of Funds Administration Unit of DCEDIY) ran a call for proposals for migrant integration initiatives. 20 projects were selected, with total funding of &euro;4.5m (75% of project budget, funded by EU under the AMIF 2014-2020 programme) over 3 years. In 2019 a further call for proposals awarded funding of &euro;4.5m (again, 75% of total budget, the balance to be co-funded by the grantee) to 19 projects over 3 years to 30 September 2022.</p><p>-<b>European Social Fund (ESF)</b></p><p>In 2016, EU Funds Unit awarded grants totalling &euro;3.3m to 5 projects following a Call for Proposals, to fund migrant employment support initiatives over 4 years. These grant amounts were 50% funded by EU, 50% by Government of Ireland.</p></reply>

Tusla is committed to promoting safe practice in all areas of alternative care, including residential care and foster care.  Safe practice is defined as the implementation of appropriate safeguarding measures necessary for working with young people in a manner that acknowledges their need to live in as normal an environment as possible. All children have the right to be cared for, fulfill their potential and be protected from harm.</p>  <p>  Once a child has been received into care, the most crucial task for the social worker is to find a placement that matches that child's needs. Children, depending on their identified need, may be placed in foster care either with relatives or general foster carers, in residential care, special care or other placement types. A key part of the social worker role is to develop, in consultation with the child and relevant others, a care plan which will guide the quality and safety of the child's placement, and to meet with the child on a one to one basis on all visits. There are safeguards surrounding each child's care placement, whether foster or residential care, and all placements are supervised by a professionally qualified social worker.</p>  <p>  Regulations govern the placement of children in care.  These provide for the welfare of the child, the care practices, care records, accommodation and safety precautions. The Regulations also provide that the allocated social worker oversees the implementation of the child's  care plan, visits the child and consults with family members, foster carers and other people involved with the child to ensure that his or her needs are being met and that the care being provided is optimal.</p>  <p>  HIQA carries out announced and unannounced inspections of children&rsquo;s services including Child Protection and Welfare Services, Foster Care Services, statutory Children&rsquo;s Residential Centres and Special Care units. HIQA carry out these inspections against Regulations and Standards, by reviewing files on site, interviews and questionnaires with staff and service users and their families. Following an inspection, HIQA share their initial judgements and draft report with the service/area. HIQA then works with the management of the centre or area in order to agree an Action Plan to address any identified deficits. Final reports are published, and are submitted to the Department with the area or service&rsquo;s Action Plans and are monitored as necessary by DCEDIY officials.</p>  <p>  Tusla has policies and procedures for responding to concerns, allegations and complaints made by or on behalf of children in care.  This includes ensuring all allegations, concerns, and complaints by children in care are taken seriously and receive the required response as stated in policies within Tusla.  In addition, the Ombudsman for Children and Tusla&rsquo;s own National Review Panel will report on specific topics relating to the work of Tusla which prompts further improvements in Tusla services.</p>  <p>  The foregoing sets out the safeguards in place with regard to all placements of children in care. Tusla in discharging its statutory responsibilities under the Child Care Acts must have the best interests of the child as its paramount consideration. It actively monitors every placement of every child in care to ensure its appropriateness to the needs of that child, and any concerns or breaches of standards are addressed in this context. </p></reply>

Participation of children with disabilities in the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) universal pre-school programme in mainstream early learning and care services is supported by the Access and Inclusion Model (AIM), which is delivered by my Department. The key objective of AIM is to support early learning and care providers to deliver an inclusive preschool experience, ensuring that children with a disability can fully participate in the ECCE Programme, thereby reaping the benefits of quality preschool provision. </p><p><i>First 5</i>, the Whole-of-Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families, commits to consider enhancements to, or extension of AIM, following completion of the evaluation of AIM. Such an extension might involve younger children, longer hours of availability of targeted supports, children with additional needs other than a disability, or children attending school-age childcare services. Any decisions on extension or reform of AIM will be informed by the findings of the end-of-year-three evaluation of AIM, which is currently underway, with the final report due to be published in February 2022.</p><p>The 2015 report of the Inter-Departmental Group which led to the establishment of AIM recommended that specialist pre-school services for children with disabilities, which include services provided by the Department of Education and by the HSE, should remain in place at least during the initial years of AIM roll-out. These specialist pre-school services include autism-specific pre-school services provided by the Department of Education, which include:</p><p>- 132 Early Intervention Classes attached to primary schools for autistic children aged three and over.</p><p>- A Home Tuition Scheme which provides funding towards 10 hours' tuition for children under 3 years of age and 20 hours per week for  children over 3 years of who cannot secure a placement in an early intervention class. Subject to conditions, parents are free to use the grant to engage tutors to deliver tuition in their home or pre-school  providers to deliver tuition in a group/pre-school setting. Such arrangements are essentially between the parents and the relevant provider.</p><p>If parents are seeking a place for their child in primary school or in an early intervention class in a school setting, supports are available through the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), affiliated to the Department of Education. If so, I would recommend the parents to contact their local Special Education Needs Organiser (SENO) for further assistance. The local SENO contact details are available on www.ncse.ie.</p></reply>

This is specifically set out in Section 20 of the Protection of Employment (Part Time Work) Act 2001. </p>  <p>  The maximum number of hours that an employee should work in an average working week, as set out under the Organisation of Working Time Act, is 48 hrs.

WRC inspectors can also be asked to investigate certain breaches. Complaints can be made on a single online complaint form available at the WRC&rsquo;s website www.workplacerelations.ie.</p>  <p>  In most cases it will be clear whether an individual is employed or self-employed.

The system is intended to act as a conduit for key skills which are required to develop enterprise in the State for the benefit of our economy, while simultaneously protecting the balance of the labour market.</p>  <p>  The system is managed through the operation of the Critical Skills and Ineligible Occupations Lists which determine employments that are either in high demand or are ineligible for an employment permit where there is a surplus of those skills in the domestic and EEA labour market.</p>  <p>  In order to maintain the relevance of these lists of occupations to the needs of the economy and to ensure the employment permits system is aligned with current labour market intelligence, these lists undergo twice-yearly evidence-based reviews which are guided by research undertaken by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN), the Skills and the Labour Market Research Unit (SLMRU), SOLAS and involves public/stakeholder consultation. Account is taken of education outputs, sectoral upskilling and training initiatives and known contextual factors such as Brexit and, in the current context, COVID-19 and their impact on the labour market. Consideration is also taken of the views of the Economic Migration Interdepartmental Group, chaired by my Department and of the relevant policy Departments, in this case the Department of Health.</p>  <p>  The most recent review did not recommend removal of the occupation of care worker/home carers from the Ineligible Occupations List as the evidence suggests that other factors, such as the contracts of employment on offer and employment terms and conditions being offered are a factor in the recruitment challenges faced by the sector, rather than a demonstrable labour market shortage. The sector has also previously been advised that a more systematic and structured engagement with the Department of Social Protection needs to be demonstrated.</p>  <p>  If a sector wishes to propose a change to the occupations lists, they need to submit a detailed evidence-based business case to substantiate their request. A review is currently underway, with submissions received, including submissions from the Home Care sector, under consideration. It is expected that the current review will be finalised in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

The AMBER area represents the area to be served by the network to be deployed under the NBP State led intervention.  I appreciate people's frustration when they are living so close to a fibre network but cannot get a connection to that network, particularly given the heightened importance of connectivity during the Covid-19 pandemic. The NBP will ensure that in all such cases a future proofed high speed broadband network will be built to serve these premises and work to deliver on this is underway.</p>  <p>  I am advised by National Broadband Ireland (NBI) that, as of 1 October, over 257,000 premises across all counties have been surveyed. Over 108,000 premises are under construction across 30 Deployment Areas and the first homes are connected in Counties Cork, Cavan, Galway, Limerick and Monaghan.</p>  <p>  Surveys are complete or underway in County Limerick, including in Killalee, Caherline, Ballynanty, Pallaskenny, Toreen, Old Kildimo, Askeaton, Adare, Croagh, Rathkeale, Kilfinny, Croom, Ballingarry, Patrickswell, Crecora, Banogue Cross, Granagh, Lees Cross and Ballykennedy. Main works have started in townlands outside Limerick City including Mungret, Patrickswell, Crecora, Castleconnell and Caherconlish. Further details are available on specific areas within County Limerick, through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. NBI has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries. Given the scale and complexity of delivery of the new high speed broadband network under the NBP, I am advised that any dates provided by NBI on its website are based on the best available information at the time and may be subject to change. NBI has recently published details of its full deployment schedule on its website, www.nbi.ie, which enables all premises within the intervention area to have an anticipated service activation date range.</p>  <p>  In addition to the challenges to the delivery of the NBP due to the Covid-19 pandemic, NBI has faced a range of other challenges due to the sheer scale and complexity of rolling out fibre to the home in a rural environment. These include significant tree trimming to ensure cable can be placed on overhead poles, remediation of ducting that has been in place for many decades, the co-ordination of hundreds of contracting crews and addressing the many issues arising week on week which could not have been foreseen until the build crews commenced work on the ground. My Department has worked closely with NBI to put in place a remedial plan under the Contract. This plan addresses delays experienced by NBI, primarily arising as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, and re-baselines milestones for 2021. Work is underway to re-baseline milestones for 2022 and beyond. This has resulted in some changes to timeframes for connection for end users.</p>  <p>  Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 1 October, 379 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for school BCPs. BCP&rsquo;s are installed at Hospital Herbertstown GAA Club, Glenmore Community Centre, Coolcappa Community Centre, Cappamore Community Centre (located 6.6km from Meentula), Galbally GAA Club, Glenroe GAA Club, Kildimo GAA Club,Shanagolden Education Resource Centre, Rathkeale Riverside Training Workshop ,Halla &Iacute;de Naofa, Caherline Community Centre and Patrickswell GAA Club. Further details can be found at nbi.ie/bcp-locations/.</p>  <p>  Limerick East Educate Together National School, Coolcappa National School, Anglesboro National School, Gerald Griffin National School, Tinnatarriff National School, Knocknadea National School, Mountcollins National School and Killinure National School have been installed by NBI for educational access. My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband, within the Intervention Area, for connection over the term of the NBP. In this regard, an acceleration of this aspect of the National Broadband Plan was announced in December which will see some 679 primary schools connected to high speed broadband by 2022, well ahead of the original target delivery timeframe of 2026.  Further details are available on the NBI website at nbi.ie/primary-schools-list/.</p></reply>

Storage technology, alongside demand-side response and interconnection, will be key as Ireland seeks to increase its share of renewable electricity up to 80 per cent by 2030 as outlined in the National Development Plan published this week. The 2021 Climate Action Plan will set out further actions to address energy storage. The combined storage capacity connected to the grid in Ireland today is 540MW; this consists of 292MW of pumped storage and 248MW of battery energy storage. Based on current projections by the System Operators, this figure is projected to more than double by 2024.  I am acutely aware of the critical role of energy storage in supporting a green energy system which is why my Department is considering how storage may be incentivised to participate in the second Renewable Electricity Support Scheme auction, the terms and conditions of which are currently being finalised.  This will require a coordinated programme of investment in grid-scale renewable electricity generation and storage.As outlined in the National Development Plan, the State bodies under the aegis of my Department will play a pivotal role in delivering on the transformation of our electricity system to meet the target of up to 80% renewables on the grid by 2030.</p><p>  I have requested the relevant bodies to contact the Deputy directly regarding their specific projects and plans for large-scale electricity storage capacity.</p></reply>

This plan addresses delays experienced by NBI, primarily arising as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, and re-baselines milestones for 2021. Work is underway to re-baseline milestones for 2022 and beyond. This has resulted in some changes to timeframes for connection for end users.</p>  <p>  Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 01 October, 379 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for school BCPs. BCP&rsquo;s are installed at Streete Parish Park &amp;amp; Community Hall, Whitehall Community Centre, Milltown Emper Community Centre, Clonkill Hurling Club, Ballycomoyle GAA Club and Castledaly Community Centre. Further details can be found at nbi.ie/bcp-locations/.</p>  <p>  Naomh Micheal, Scoil N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta Bhr&iacute;de and Scoil N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta Aodha Naofa have been installed by NBI for educational access. My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband, within the Intervention Area, for connection over the term of the NBP. In this regard, an acceleration of this aspect of the National Broadband Plan was announced in December which will see some 679 primary schools connected to high speed broadband by 2022, well ahead of the original target delivery timeframe of 2026.  Further details are available on the NBI website at nbi.ie/primary-schools-list/.</p></reply>

The Strategy set out several actions to alleviate the burden of energy poverty on the most vulnerable in society. The focus of the strategy was on high impact actions which aimed to make a real difference to the lives of those in energy poverty. Overall, the Government envisages expenditure in excess of &euro;700 million in 2021 on a number of measures to support households meeting the cost of energy.  Good progress has been made under the strategy including:</p>  <p>  - Funding for SEAI energy poverty retrofit schemes has increased dramatically over the period from &euro;15 million in 2015 to over &euro;109 million for 2021;</p>  <p>  - Free upgrades were carried out in over 24,000 lower income homes under the main Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) energy poverty retrofit schemes;</p>  <p>  - The Housing for All Strategy has committed to introducing minimum Building Energy Ratings for rented properties from 2025;</p>  <p>  - The allocations for retrofit of social housing have also increased significantly with an allocation of &euro;65 million for 2021.</p>  <p>  Income supports from the Department of Social Protection to help households with the costs of heating their homes have also increased.  The Minister for Social Protection recently announced a budget of &euro;292 million for the upcoming season. It will be paid for 28 weeks to an estimated 370,000 households across the State. Recipients are paid weekly rate of &euro;28. In addition, the Minister for Social Protection also provides an electricity or gas allowance under the Household Benefits scheme at an estimated cost of &euro;265 million in 2021. This is paid at a rate of &euro;35 per month, 12 months of the year. The Department of Social Protection also funds an exceptional needs payment, which can include support with fuel bills in some cases. Any increases to these allowances would be subject to wider budgetary considerations.</p>  <p>  Protections are in place for those falling into difficulty with their energy bills. Under the supplier led voluntary Energy Engage Code, suppliers will not disconnect a customer who is engaging with them. It should also be noted that data from approved price comparison websites shows that consumers can make significant savings by switching energy suppliers.</p>  <p>  A review of the implementation of the Strategy to Combat Energy Poverty will be completed this year and will inform next steps in relation to the development of a new strategy.  Alleviating energy poverty will also be a key consideration for the new National Retrofit Plan which will be published later this year.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-10-07a.466.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1578" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021100700062#WRH04000"><p>In terms of specific vehicle-related taxes, I have policy responsibility for motor tax, however VRT (including the NOx charge), fuel taxes (including the carbon tax element and VAT) and benefit-in-kind for company cars are a matter for my colleague the Minister for Finance.</p>  <p>  In terms of environmental policy, the Programme for Government 2020 contains a commitment to an average of a 7% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions year-on-year from 2021 to 2030 and to achieving net zero emissions by 2050.  The transport sector currently accounts for 20% of Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions levels and a reduction in emissions levels in the sector, through a combination of taxation and incentivisation, will form a key part of achieving that target. Road Traffic usage represents 96% of those emissions.  In this regard, the CO2-based motor tax system for private cars, which comprise the bulk of the vehicle fleet, is structured in such a way as to incentivise the uptake of electric and lower CO2-emitting vehicles, with these attracting lower motor tax rates than higher emitting vehicles.  </p>  <p>  The Climate Action Plan 2021 which is due to be published shortly will chart a course to achieve these targets by 2030 and it will include specific and challenging measures in that regard. The overall target here is very ambitious and will require a mix policy interventions and significant behavioural change, taking account of their relative impact on mobility options, including social, rural and urban impacts.  </p>  <p>  Electrification of the national fleet, significant investment in improving public transport options, ramping up walking and cycling infrastructure for short distances, increasing biofuels in the existing fleet and improved engine efficiencies will all play a significant role. Finally, demand management, or reducing the need to travel by private car,  will also be key. I am very aware that this is the most challenging element since it will impose restrictions on current travel behaviours.</p>  <p>  I am fully aware of the importance of finding a path to reduce emissions without removing people&rsquo;s access to travel, transport and services. Measures such as working from home and using online tools to access services will become more prevalent and usual with the digitilisation of our economy and society. Many of the trips we currently take and services we currently access in person can be accessed through online means. I am also very encouraged by proposals for 15 minute neighbourhoods, so that most of the key services people need can be accessed within 15 minutes of their home, so curtailing the need to travel long distances by car. We need to reduce emissions as a country because of the global crisis we are facing as a planet. However, we need to do so in a way that does not negatively impact people&rsquo;s lives and wellbeing.</p>  <p>  As set out in the recently published National Development Plan, the Government is committed to strengthening rural economies and communities and enhancing regional accessibility, with a range of investments proposed in new and existing public transport infrastructure.  The Plan also commits to significant investment in the land transport network and the upcoming National Investment Framework for Transport in Ireland will set out the priorities for investment in the land transport network.  The National Transport Authority&rsquo;s Connecting Ireland rural mobility plan aims to improve access to towns and cities for those in rural areas by improving existing bus services, increasing capacity and adding new bus services, and builds on from the Authority&rsquo;s TFI Local Link, which provides access to essential, educational and leisure services in rural areas.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s Rural Development Policy 2021 &ndash; 2025, &ldquo;Our Rural Future&rdquo;, also commits to improved and accessible public transport in rural areas and to the piloting of new rural transport initiatives.  </p>  <p>  Further, it should be noted that the National Development Plan commits to continuing investment in improving access to remote working facilities, enabling people to work in rural areas, thereby potentially reducing the need for car journeys for commuting purposes. It is becoming increasingly clear that over the coming years we must all undergo a transformational change how and why we travel if we are to meaningfully tackle the climate crisis.</p></reply>

It provides for significant investment in active travel, bus and rail infrastructure over the next ten years in terms of expanding sustainable mobility options in our cities, towns and villages, supporting our ambition for compact growth and seeking to develop our regional cities.</p><p>BusConnects, which is a strategic investment priority of the <i>NDP,</i>will be substantially delivered in all five cities, including Galway, by 2030.  It will be substantially delivered in all five cities across the country, including Galway, massively expanding access to public transport and radically improving cycling infrastructure as well.  It will completely overhaul the current bus system in Galway by implementing a network of &lsquo;next generation&rsquo; bus corridors (including segregated cycling facilities) on the busiest routes to make journeys faster, predictable and reliable. BusConnects will enhance the capacity and potential of the public transport system by increasing and replacing the bus fleets with low emission vehicles and introducing a new system of ticketing known as Next Generation Ticketing and cashless payments. </p><p>On active travel Connacht will benefit from the increased investment committed to under the <i>NDP</i>, with around &euro;28million allocated to local authorities in the province in 2021 alone. The Safe Routes to School Programme, which aims to provide safe infrastructure for walking and cycling around schools, will form part of this Active Travel spending going forward. I am delighted to say that thirty schools in Connacht have been selected to receive funding under Round 1, with additional schools in the province due to enter the Programme as it progresses over the next number of years.</p><p>I am particularly conscious that improved access to public transport cannot just be about the five cities, we need to increase that access in rural and regional Ireland too. This <i>NDP</i>proposes an investment of around &euro;350 million planned in rural and regional bus fleets across the country, including Connacht. The <i>NDP</i>also provides the capital funding required to support the delivery of <i>Connecting Ireland</i>in the coming years which will seek to significantly improve bus services in rural Ireland. </p><p>In rail, the <i>NDP</i>will support major transport-led developments in Galway, with funding allocated to support the redevelopment of Ceannt Station, as well as increased investment to expand commuter rail infrastructure and services on the Athenry to Galway Corridor.  The rail network generally in Connacht will benefit from the increased investment this <i>NDP</i>provides to support enhanced protection and renewal of the network leading to improvements in service reliability and journey times over the period. The potential of the Western Rail Corridor is being considered as part of the all-island <i>Strategic Rail Review</i>which has now commenced following the appointment of Arup consultants.  </p><p>Finally, light rail is another of the strategic investment priorities of the <i>NDP</i>and the feasibility of light rail in Galway will be considered again as part of next year&rsquo;s review of the Galway Transport Strategy. </p></reply>

It faces imminent and important milestones in the coming months and these milestones will determine its progress in the coming years.</p>  <p>  Firstly, there is Government&rsquo;s approval of the Preliminary Business Case and secondly there is the submission of a Railway Order application to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  On that first milestone, my Department has received draft Preliminary Business Cases for MetroLink.  This represents Decision Gate 1 under the Public Spending Code and the Preliminary Business Case is currently under review.</p>  <p>  For major projects, like MetroLink, the Public Spending Code requires a Government decision and I expect to seek such a Government decision in the near future.  If approved by Government, that will allow MetroLink to move into the statutory planning system, subject to the completion of the necessary planning and environmental documentation. </p>  <p>  The second impending milestone is the submission of Railway Order applications for MetroLink. That application requires the finalisation of an extensive set of documentation, including environmental impact assessment reports, and that work is ongoing in relation to this project.  </p>  <p>  I understand that an extensive body of work remains in relation to finalising the preliminary design, completing the required environmental impact assessment reports and closing out property referencing issues.  This should be completed during Q1 next year and, subject to the Government decision mentioned above, the project will then be ready to seek planning permission.</p>  <p>  An actual construction start date will ultimately be determined by the planning process and Government approval to proceed to construction at that time.  </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the current position.</p></reply>

The person confirmed that while the property is located above the ground floor of a building with significant pyrite damage (on the ground floor), certification or supporting documentation in accordance with the required criteria has not been secured. On that basis it is not possible for Revenue to grant an exemption from LPT for the property. </p><p>While there may not be entitlement to an exemption from LPT where the specified criteria is not met, it is accepted that the existence of pyrite, whether it has already caused structural damage or  has the potential to cause such damage, has a negative effect on the market value of a residential property. In such circumstances, the property owner is entitled to take account of its presence when determining the appropriate LPT valuation. </p></reply>

The first aspect of these proposals, Pillar One, provides for a re-allocation of a proportion of the profits of highly profitable very large multinational groups to taxation in the market jurisdiction. Pillar Two proposes a global minimum effective tax rate to multinational groups which have an annual turnover in excess of &euro;750 million.</p>  <p>  It is likely that, if agreed and implemented, these proposals will result in a reduction of corporation tax receipts in Ireland. Department of Finance officials previously estimated that the cost to the Exchequer of the OECD reforms may be up to EUR &euro;2 billion annually. This is the estimate included in both the Stability Programme Update published by the Department in April and the Summer Economic Statement published in July, with the full amount to apply from 2025. Notwithstanding progress on headline aspects of the proposals, there remain a number of important technical details outstanding on both Pillars, making it very difficult to provide an update to this estimate at this juncture.  </p>  <p>  The way in which business operates internationally has changed significantly in recent years due to the digitalisation and globalisation of the economy and I believe that the international tax system must evolve to reflect these changes. Bringing stability and certainty to the international tax system will have longer-term benefits for Ireland and the global economy generally.</p>  <p>  Negotiations are ongoing and there are important aspects of the proposals that remain to be resolved. Nevertheless, I expect that the OECD Inclusive Framework will find agreement on a comprehensive, sustainable and equitable solution which meets the needs of all countries, large and small, developed and developing.</p></reply>

It is given effect by the Good Agricultural Practice Regulations (SI 605/2017), as amended. The current regulations run to the end of 2021 and a new Nitrates Action Programme will be published towards the end of this year. </p>  <p>  The current review of the Nitrates Action Programme is being led by the Nitrates Expert Group, which includes scientific experts from my own Department; the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine; Teagasc and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The Nitrates Expert Group will assess the most up to date scientific evidence, and will advise me on the measures that should be included in the next Action Programme. The Expert Group have engaged, and will continue to do so, in bilateral discussions with interested stakeholder groups as part of the review.</p>  <p>  The EPA&rsquo;s Water Quality Indicator&rsquo;s Report 2021 shows that nearly half of Ireland&rsquo;s rivers have unsatisfactory nitrogen concentrations and over one quarter of rivers have unsatisfactory phosphorous concentrations. One of the purposes of the revised Nitrates Action Programme is to help reverse these declining water quality trends. The EPA have also estimated that up to 85% of nitrogen in mainly rural catchments comes from agricultural sources.</p>  <p>  Following the first public consultation in late-2020, a second consultation phase on the draft Nitrates Action Programme has just been completed, with over 600 responses submitted. These are currently being assessed with a view to adapting and finalising the measures in the Nitrates Action Programme 2022-2025. </p>  <p>  I note and appreciate that concerns have been raised in some submissions around the proposed measures.  These will be taken into consideration by the Nitrates Expert Group in the design and recommendation of the final measures. I should also note that the proposed measures are based on robust scientific assessment and are designed to achieve the objectives of the Nitrates Action Programme and must respond to the water quality trends reported by the Environmental Protection Agency. </p>  <p>The 2 public consultation processes which have been held on the proposed Nitrates Action Programme are important in informing the design of the final Programme. As the current round of submissions are currently being assessed it would not be possible to provide for a 3rd round of public consultation give the deadline of 31st   December 2021 for the publication of the final Action Programme.</p></reply>

The actions set out under Pathway 4 of <i>Housing for All</i>, &quot;Addressing Vacancy and Efficient Use of Existing Stock&quot;, and in particular action 20.3, &quot;Review and extend planning regulations that exempt certain vacant commercial premises from requiring planning permission to change of use for residential purposes to 2025&quot; will help us to deliver this. </p><p>Much housing demand within Local Authorities is for smaller homes for single people. Our town centres, above shops and older building stock can provide solutions through adaptive reuse, backfilling plots in towns, converting former retail units to full occupancy and infilling derelict sites within town, city and village settings. </p><p>Under <i>Housing for All </i>I have committed to reviewing and extending the regulations that exempt certain vacant commercial premises, such as &lsquo;over the shop&rsquo; type spaces, from requiring planning permission for change of use for residential purposes to 2025. This is underway will be completed by the end of the year. </p><p>However, it should be noted that under section 262(4) of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, legislative proposals in relation to exempted development require the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas before they can be signed into law. I propose to submit draft legislative proposals in this regard to the Oireachtas shortly.</p><p>Tackling complex and challenging town centre renewal projects to deliver new social homes is a challenge for Local Authorities when the priority is to deliver new homes at scale to meet the need of those on waiting lists.  But as Local Authority capacity is further built up to cater for increased output levels and complexities of the development process, there will be increased capacity to deliver more residential accommodation in town centres utilising existing vacant and derelict properties. </p><p>Under <i>Housing for All</i>, in addition to the planning exemptions mentioned, a wide range of measures are being pursued to make more efficient use of existing stock, such as: </p><p>- A new local authority-led programme to help Local Authorities buy or compulsory purchase 2,500 vacant homes in their areas which can then be sold on the open market will ensure homes don&rsquo;t lie vacant.</p><p>- Reform of the Fair Deal Scheme to remove disincentives to selling or renting unused homes.</p><p>- The Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe (Towns) Fund will be delivered by local authorities for the provision of serviced sites for housing, to attract people to build their own homes and to support the refurbishment of vacant properties, enabling people to live in small towns and villages, in a sustainable way. </p><p>- The Historic Towns Initiative is a capital grant scheme, operated in conjunction with the Heritage Council. The initiative will be adjusted so that there will be a particular focus &lsquo;to encourage private owners and/or occupiers to bring vacant floor area in historic buildings back into use&rsquo; and projects &lsquo;that address dereliction and vacancy &rsquo;. There will be an additional &euro;2 million in funding in the 2022 scheme.</p><p>These measures are in addition to the vacant property tax and vacant site tax being pursued by the Department of Finance. </p></reply>

The rate of the levy increased to 7% for sites listed on local authority vacant sites registers from 2019 onwards which site owners became liable to pay in January 2020.</p><p>My Department does not maintain a central register of vacant sites as each local authority administers the vacant site levy in respect of their functional area; this includes site assessment, assignment of market valuation and maintaining a local register. As provided for under the Act, the register in respect of each local authority is available for inspection at its offices and online on its website. Therefore, the specific information requested on the number of sites included on local authority registers or in respect of which section 7 notices have issued is not available to my Department.</p><p>My Department proactively engages with local authorities with a view to ensuring that the vacant site levy achieves its full potential in terms of bringing concerned sites into productive use. In this regard, my Department issued Circular Letter PL 03/2021 on 8 March 2021 requesting the submission of a progress report on the collection of the levy by each local authority. A response has now been received from each of the 31 local authorities. The progress reports noted the following:</p><p><b>2018</b></p><p>- 89 sites valued at &euro;132m were liable to the levy at the 3% rate in 2019 in respect of 2018;</p><p>- 86 letters issued in 2019/2020 demanding levy payments to a value of &euro;4.1m in respect of 2018; </p><p>- &euro;905k in levy payments were received in respect of 2018;</p><p>- levy payments of &euro;1.2m are outstanding in respect of 2018.*</p><p>(*It should be noted that some sites were de-registered following the issuing of payment demands due to appeal or notification of commencement of development etc. As a result, the amount collected plus the amount outstanding does not equal the value of the demands issued.)</p><p><b>2019</b></p><p>- 181 sites valued at &euro;198m were liable to the levy at the 7% rate in 2020 in respect of 2019;</p><p>- 153 letters issued in 2020 demanding levy payments to a value of &euro;13m in respect of 2019;</p><p>- &euro;1.18m in levy payments were received in respect of 2019; </p><p>- levy payments of &euro;11.5m are outstanding in respect of 2019.</p><p><b>2020</b></p><p>- 215 sites valued at &euro;268m were liable to the levy at the 7% rate in 2021 in respect of 2020;</p><p>- 79 letters issued in 2021 demanding levy payments to a value of &euro;11.8m in respect of 2020;</p><p>- &euro;21k in levy payments were received in respect of 2020;</p><p>- levy payments of &euro;14.3m are outstanding in respect of 2020.</p><p>It should be noted that the vacant site levy is collected in arrears. The levy due in respect of 2020 is collected in 2021. Local authorities are still issuing demands in respect of 2020. A number of local authorities noted delays in issuing payment demands in respect of 2020 due to COVID-19. Local authorities will continue to issue demands for payment of the levy in respect of 2021.</p><p>All levies due on an individual site will remain a charge on the land concerned until all outstanding levies due are paid. Accordingly, under the vacant site levy provisions, there will be a cumulative effect associated with not activating a site for development purposes for each year that a site remains vacant or idle and in respect of which levy liability is not paid. </p></reply>

The guidelines set out clearly how schools can set up and organise special classes, as part of a continuum of educational provision, for students with special educational needs.</p><p>I can also reassure the Deputy that the local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) continue to be available to assist and advise both schools and the parents of children with special educational needs. </p></reply>

This COVID-19 Adjusted measure, which includes all those in receipt of  PUP, has fallen by 6 percentage points from almost 26 percent in August and by over 41 percentage points since its 2021 peak of 61 percent in January.</p>  <p>  The reduction in the COVID-19 adjusted measure of youth unemployment seen in September is driven by the fact that students on PUP are no longer included in the estimate, as they are no longer eligible for the payment since last month. Full-time students are not traditionally included in unemployment estimates as they are not considered part of the labour force as they are generally not available for full time employment.</p>  <p>  Thanks to the continued reopening of our economy and society, the number of young people on PUP has declined significantly, falling by 91% since the 2021 peak in February to just under 10,400 this week.  I expect to see further reductions in these PUP numbers, as the final set of public health restrictions are eased later this month. </p>  <p>  To minimise any scarring effects amongst young people who permanently lost their jobs due to the pandemic, my Department has introduced a series of targeted measures under the Pathways to Work strategy, including:</p>  <p>  - Expanding the JobsPlus scheme to 8,000 places and enhancing the incentive to recruit young jobseekers in particular, by increasing the youth age limit from 25 to 30 years.</p>  <p>  - The newly launched Work Placement Experience Programme, which is a 6-month, 30 hour per week voluntary work experience programme, for persons out of work for six months or more and has 4,000 places ring-fenced for young people.</p>  <p>  - Ring-fencing at least 1,000 out of the 3,000 additional Community Employment and T&uacute;s places for long term unemployed young people.</p>  <p>  - Ring-fencing at least 1,000 out of the 3,000 additional Community Employment and T&uacute;s places for long term unemployed young people.</p>  <p>  My Department also works closely with the Further Education and Training sector to provide access to training, upskilling and reskilling opportunities that are of particular relevance to young people entering the labour market for the first time.  As part of Pathways to Work 2021-2025, the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science are providing an additional 50,000 further education and training places to help more people, including young persons, to have the opportunity to upskill and reskill.  In addition, the Apprenticeship Incentivisation Scheme has been extended until the end of December 2021.  This scheme provides financial supports for employers who register apprentices to a national apprenticeship scheme. </p>  <p>  Using these measures, Pathways to Work 2021-2025 aims to reduce the youth unemployment rate back to or below the 2019 average of 12.5% by 2023.</p>  <p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.  </p></reply>

The new model includes multi-annual contracts with enhanced key performance indicators and a funding model that allows more autonomy in delivering enhanced services and will lead to better outcomes across the State.

Participation limits on these schemes are necessary to allow for the maximum utilisation of places amongst qualifying persons. It is important to note that participation is intended to be for a temporary fixed term and the positions offered are not full-time sustainable jobs. Instead, the placements are designed to break the cycle of unemployment and maintain work readiness, thereby improving a person&rsquo;s opportunities of returning to the open labour market. </p><p>In general, placements for new entrants aged between 21 and 55 years are for one year.  Those participants who are working towards a Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) major award can seek to extend their participation on CE by up to two years to enable them to reach the required standard of qualification.  Participants aged 55 years or older can remain on CE for three years and do not have to work towards a QQI major award. In both instances, a maximum of three consecutive year&rsquo;s participation is permissible.  A person may re-qualify for CE after a 12 month break once they satisfy the qualifying conditions.  An overall lifetime limit of six years applies to all CE participants (seven years for those on a disability payment).  </p><p>As time spent  on CE for the person concerned is in excess of 3 consecutive years, they were due to finish their CE placement on 5th November 2021.However it has been decided that Community Employment participants who were due to leave their schemes on a phased basis from early November 2021 will now have their contracts extended until Friday, 4<sup>th</sup>February, 2022<b>.  </b>They may re-qualify for CE after a 12 month break subject to them satisfying the qualifying conditions and they may then go on to complete an overall lifetime limit of six years.</p><p>When the person concerned leaves their CE placement the Department's Activation Service can work with them  to ensure that the benefits and experience they received during their time on CE is maximised.

It recognises the importance of child related services working in conjunction with income supports in reducing child poverty.</p>  <p>  The most recent data shows the consistent poverty rate for children is 8.1%. While this is a reduction on previous years, it demonstrates that Government needs to continue to focus efforts on reducing the number of children experiencing poverty.</p>  <p>  Government through the Department of Social Protection offers a range of supports to children and families to alleviate poverty and has consistently targeted supports on reducing the number of children in poverty and deprivation.   Since Budget 2019, Government has increased the qualified child payment from a flat rate of &euro;31.80 to &euro;38 for children up to age 12, and &euro;45 for children aged over 12. During the same period, Government increased the income thresholds of the Working Family Payment by &euro;20 per week for families with up to 3 children; removed the earnings limit on the One-Parent Family Payment; and increased the Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance by &euro;25. This has occurred alongside measures under the Department&rsquo;s remit to support children and families, such as the extension of the Parent&rsquo;s Benefit; the provision of the School Meals programme; and the development and rollout of the Hot School Meals Programme.</p>  <p>  The above-mentioned supports are accompanied by a range of measures delivered across government, including:</p>  <p>  - prevention and early intervention initiatives and supports for parents through the work of the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, including implementation of the First 5 Strategy.</p>  <p>  - the rollout of free GP care to children and the provision of medical cards to families on low incomes under the Department of Health.</p>  <p>  - the continuing delivery of the Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools (DEIS) programme by the Department of Education. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

My Department has continued to support CE schemes throughout the period and introduced a number of emergency measures including the extension of CE participants&rsquo; contracts when necessary.</p>  <p>  Earlier this week, the Minister for Social Protection, Minister Humphreys, and I announced a further funding for contract extensions to 4th February 2022 for existing CE and T&uacute;s participants.  These final contract extensions will provide existing CE participants with additional time to complete their training and benefit from work experience, which may have been adversely affected by public health restrictions.</p>  <p>  I can reassure the Deputy that the planned exits will be carried out in a coordinated and phased basis from February 2022.  This phased exit approach will support the recruitment of new CE participants while ensuring the ongoing delivery of important local community services.  </p>  <p>  It is important to note that one of the measures included in the Pathways to Work Strategy announced by Government in July, 2021 was an increase in the capacity of the Public Employment Service in Intreo Offices and contracted services to further support jobseekers through the provision of job search advice and assistance. These additional resources will be central to meeting the increased demand for employment support services arising from the impact of the pandemic, including the referral of new candidates to fill existing CE vacancies. </p>  <p>   CE sponsoring authorities are encouraged by the Department to continue to promote the benefits of CE in their local communities.  Jobseekers interested in participating on CE can also contact a case officer in their Intreo Centre who will refer eligible candidates to local CE schemes.  My Department officials are continuing to work with local CE sponsoring authorities to identify suitable CE candidates. </p>  <p>  CE sponsoring authorities can also advertise vacancies on www.jobsireland.ie, the Department&rsquo;s online job advertising and recruitment service for jobseekers and employers.</p>  <p>  CE participants over the age of 62 can participate on a continuous basis up to the state pension age on the CE Service Support Stream.   Up to 10% of CE places are allocated to the Service Support Stream and there are 1,400 CE participants currently availing of the stream; there are approximately 500 places currently available nationally.</p>  <p>  In order to ensure that all employment and activation programmes have the best outcomes for participants, CE will continue to be made available to support those who are long term unemployed and furthest removed from the labour market, including those whose employment has been impacted by COVID-19. </p>  <p>  The eligibility criteria for CE, including the baseline year of 2007 and the length of time persons can participate on CE, are kept under active review by my Department officials to ensure the best outcomes for individual participants and to support the vital community services delivered by schemes.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies matters for the Deputy. </p></reply>

Many of these detailed submissions are available on the organisations' websites.</p>  <p>  I am very grateful for the time and effort taken by each organisation which made a submission this year and who attended the Pre-Budget Forum in July. These submissions will be taken into consideration by Government when forming social welfare measures to be included as part of Budget 2022, taking account of Government priorities and the need to protect the most vulnerable in society.</p></reply>

Some 20% of cases will be revised in favour of the appellant as a result of this review process. In some cases, further investigation may be required at this point (e.g. in relation to means or medical issues) and this can add to the time taken to process an appeal. </p><p>The appeals process is a quasi-judicial process with Appeals Officers being required to decide all appeals on a &lsquo;de-novo&rsquo; basis.  Appeal decisions are subject to review by the High Court. The nature of the appeals process impacts on the processing times which are proportionate to the complexity of many of the issues under appeal which often require a high level of judgement in addition to the need to ensure due process and natural justice.</p><p>Appeals may be determined on a summary basis or by means of an oral hearing. Where an oral hearing is necessary the logistics involved in scheduling the hearing and giving the appellant and any other witnesses adequate notice adds to the timeframe involved.</p><p>Other factors which impact on processing times include increased complexity, an increasing demand for oral hearings and the loss of Appeals Officer experience and corporate knowledge due to the high number of retirements in recent years. Ensuring that appeal processing times are as short as possible is a priority for the Chief Appeals Officer. </p><p>As a result, average appeal processing times have improved between 2018 and 2020 from 30.0 weeks for an oral hearing in 2018 to 27.1 weeks in 2020, and from 24.8 weeks for a summary decision in 2018 to 15.5 weeks in 2020. </p><p>The latest data for the period January to September 2021 shows a further improvement to 26.2 weeks for an oral hearing and 13.8 weeks for a summary decision.</p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

The last two Budgets have seen a series of evidence-based increases in some social welfare payments targeted to improve the situation of the people who are most at risk of poverty and to ensure the most vulnerable were protected. </p>  <p>  For example, in recognition of research which indicates that those who are aged 65 years and over are more likely to be at risk of poverty, deprivation and consistent poverty if they live alone, the Living Alone Allowance was increased by &euro;10 per week over the course of Budgets 2020 and 2021.  This brought the rate from &euro;9 to &euro;19 per week. </p>  <p>  To take account of increased costs arising as a result of increases to the carbon tax, the Fuel Allowance was increased by &euro;2 per week in Budget 2020 and a further &euro;3.50 per week in Budget 2021, raising the weekly rate of payment from &euro;22.50 in 2019 to &euro;28 currently.</p>  <p>  In addition, Minimum Essential Standard of Living (MESL) research has consistently shown that households with children, and particularly older children, face higher costs than those without. Since 2019, the IQC rate in respect of children aged under 12 has been increased by &euro;4 per week, while the rate for children aged 12 and over was increased by &euro;8 per week, bringing the current rates to &euro;38 and &euro;45 respectively. </p>  <p>  As a result of these targeted measures, some of the most vulnerable social welfare recipients have already seen increases significantly above the rate of inflation over this period.  For example, during the fuel season, a pensioner or person with a disability living alone is up to &euro;15.50 per week better off. </p>  <p>  In considering options for the forthcoming social welfare Budget package, I will once again be guided by evidence-based research produced by organisations such as the CSO, the ERSI and the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice.  Taking an evidence-based approach ensures that available resources are used to deliver maximum impact in terms of reducing poverty and disadvantage. </p>  <p>  Any increases to the core rates of social welfare payments will be considered in an overall budgetary and policy context. </p></reply>

An urgent needs payment (UNP) may be made to persons who may not normally qualify for supplementary welfare allowance but who have an urgent need which they cannot meet from their own resources or where an alternative is not available at that time. Government has provided &euro;46.02 million for the exceptional and urgent needs schemes in 2021. </p>  <p>  Approximately 92,200 payments were made in 2019, and 67,600 payments in 2020.

The categories with the largest number of payments within the ENP scheme are the clothing category; the housing category, which  includes payments for necessary items including bedding, flooring, furniture, household appliances and rent deposits; and the general category which includes support for travel costs, heating costs and insufficient means.</p>  <p>  I would encourage any person who considers they may have an entitlement to an exceptional or urgent needs payment to contact their local Intreo Centre.

HAP has been successfully rolled out nationally, available in all local authorities, since March 2017.  Since HAP's introduction, initially on a pilot basis in 2014, rent supplement recipient numbers have been declining as long-term rent supplement cases have migrated to local authority control primarily via HAP. </p><p>As part of the Government&rsquo;s response to the pandemic, in March 2020, the conditions for receipt of rent supplement were relaxed and flexibilities introduced to enable those in the private rented sector who suffered a loss of employment or income due to the pandemic to access rent supplement. For 2020, the increase in rent supplement recipients for this year reflect these changes alongside the increased demand due to the Covid emergency.</p><p>The central tenet  behind the Housing Assistance Payment was to identify and transfer those with long term reliance on rent supplement for their housing needs to a local authority sponsored solution whilst allowing rent supplement to revert to its originally intended role of providing short term income support to those temporarily unemployed. </p><p>The attached tabular statement shows the year on year reduction, from 2017 to 2019, the increase in 2020, and the reduction of recipient numbers in 2021 as HAP transfers continue and as Covid rent supplement recipients return to work. </p><p><b>Tabular Statement:</b></p><p><b>Rent Supplement:  Recipient Numbers &amp;amp; Expenditure 2016 - 2021</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th>Recipients</th>       <th>Cost</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016</td>       <td>48,041</td>       <td>&euro;275.3m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017</td>       <td>34,378 </td>       <td>&euro;230.6m </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>24,303</td>       <td>&euro;175.0m </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>16,781</td>       <td>&euro;125.2m </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020</td>       <td>19,304 </td>       <td>&euro;133.1m </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021 to end August</td>       <td>15,939*</td>       <td>&euro;89.8m**</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p><b>* </b>Recipient numbers as at end August 2021</p><p><b>**</b>Estimated Outturn to end August 2021 </p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Chief Appeals Officer has power under Section 318 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 to revise any decision where it appears that the Appeals Officer&rsquo;s decision was erroneous by reason of some mistake having been made in relation to the law or the facts.  </p><p>The table below  shows the outcomes of the Section 317 and Section 318 reviews finalised from January to September 2021.</p><p><b>January - September 2021</b> <table>    <tr>       <th></th>       <th>Allowed</th>       <th>Part Allowed</th>       <th>Disallowed</th>       <th>Total</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Section 317 review</td>       <td>288</td>       <td>24</td>       <td>231</td>       <td>543</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Section 318 review</td>       <td>14</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>24</td>       <td>40</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

Some 20% of cases will be revised in favour of the appellant as a result of this review process. In some cases, further investigation may be required at this point (e.g. in relation to means or medical issues) and this can add to the time taken to process an appeal. </p><p>The appeals process is a quasi-judicial process with Appeals Officers being required to decide all appeals on a &lsquo;de-novo&rsquo; basis.  Appeal decisions are subject to review by the High Court. The nature of the appeals process impacts on the processing times which are proportionate to the complexity of many of the issues under appeal which often require a high level of judgement in addition to the need to ensure due process and natural justice.</p><p>Appeals may be determined on a summary basis or by means of an oral hearing. Where an oral hearing is required the logistics involved in scheduling the hearing and giving the appellant and any other witnesses adequate notice adds to the timeframe involved.</p><p>Other factors which impact on processing times include increased complexity, an increasing demand for oral hearings and the loss of Appeals Officer experience and corporate knowledge due to the high number of retirements in recent years.

Initial priority has been given to meeting legislative commitments.   </p>  <p>  Ireland currently has two whole-of-government strategies in place, the National Disability Inclusion Strategy (now extended until the end of 2022) and the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities, 2015-2024.

My Department is actively monitoring the issue and has sought data and evidence-based proposals from sectoral representatives.</p>  <p>  The primary data-source for the sector is the Annual Early Years Sector Profile. In the most recent published Sector Profile (published in 2021, and relating to data from 2020), 44% of services reported challenges in recruiting suitably qualified staff over the past 12 months. While this figure was down 9% from the previous year, it remains very high. The staff turnover rate has similarly fallen from 23% to 18%, but remains unacceptably high. </p>  <p>  Recruitment and recruitment difficulties in the sector are undoubtedly linked to poor terms and conditions in the workforce, with for example the average pay being &euro;12.45 per hour.</p>  <p>  I am very conscious of the need for significant improvement in pay and working conditions for practitioners in early learning and childcare services. The level of pay they receive does not reflect the value of the work they do for children, for families and for the wider society and economy.</p>  <p>  As the State does not employ early learning and childcare practitioners, I cannot set wage levels or determine working conditions for staff in the sector. My Department has, however, over a number of years provided a range of supports to service providers to enable them to improve wages and working conditions.</p>  <p>  I am committed to doing what is in my power to improve wages and working conditions. That is why last December I began a process to examine the possibility of regulating pay and conditions in the sector and the suitability of a Joint Labour Committee (JLC). In agreement with IBEC/Childhood Services Ireland, and SIPTU, I appointed Dr Kevin Duffy, former Chair of the Labour Court, to be the independent chair of this process.</p>  <p>  On foot of Dr Duffy&rsquo;s report, on 11 March I wrote to the Minister of State for Business, Employment and Retail, recommending the establishment of a JLC for the sector.</p>  <p>  In line with the provisions of the Industrial Relations Acts, the Labour Court recommended establishment of a JLC, and Minister English accepted the Labour Court&rsquo;s recommendations. The Establishment Order came into effect at the beginning of July. The JLC will provide an opportunity for unions and employer representatives to work together to determine wages and working conditions for ELC and SAC.</p>  <p>  In addition, work on a Workforce Development Plan for ELC and SAC continues, with a final report expected by the end of the year.</p></reply>

A relevant parent in relation to a child means a person, other than the mother, who is the father of the child, the partner (spouse, civil partner or cohabitant) of the mother of the child, the parent of a donor-conceived child, or, the spouse, civil partner or cohabitant of the qualifying adopter of the child.</p>  <p>  The intention of paternity leave is to support and encourage parents, particularly fathers, to play a role in supporting their child&rsquo;s early development.  Paternity Benefit is paid at an equivalent rate to Maternity, Adoptive and Parent&rsquo;s benefits at &euro;245 per week.  </p>  <p>  My Department is committed to ensuring that the provision of family leaves meets the needs of working parents and families.

The strategy focuses on the period of early childhood and takes a joined-up, cross-government approach to supporting babies, young children and their families during their early years. </p>  <p>  The Implementation Plan, published in May 2019, covers the first phase of the ten year plan and identifies key milestones for each action across 2019, 2020 and 2021.  An Implementation Office monitors progress supported by an Inter Departmental Group and produces an Annual Implementation Report. The implementation structures of the Better Outcomes Brighter Futures framework provide further support and oversight for implementation. The measurability of the actions committed to, the oversight structures, and the transparent approach to monitoring are described by the Better Outcomes Brighter Futures Advisory Council as &lsquo;a model for other strategies&rsquo;.</p>  <p>  The Annual Implementation Report for 2019 monitored progress on all 305 milestones for 2019, illustrating that 69% of milestones were met by end 2019.  By the end of 2020, 90% of 2019 milestones were met.</p>  <p>  The Annual Implementation Report for 2020 is currently being compiled and when published will show continuing and significant progress being made on all 322 milestones for 2020, notwithstanding the significant impact of Covid-19 during that year and since.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government negotiated in 2020 also reaffirmed commitment to First 5 implementation.</p>  <p>Major examples of progress include the extension of Parent&rsquo;s Leave and Benefit to five weeks for each parent. Unpaid parental leave has increased by four weeks to 26 weeks for each eligible child and can now be taken until the child's 12th birthday.</p>  <p>  Healthy eating guidelines and a children&rsquo;s food pyramid for 1-5 year-olds were developed and published. A pilot milk schemes was run with Early Learning and Care providers in 2020.</p>  <p>  Clearly the Covid-19 pandemic has had an impact on anticipated progress in 2020 given the significant requirement of the civil and public service to respond to the public health emergency and put in place alternative arrangements across many of the major action areas in the strategy including early learning and childcare services, education and, most obviously, health services.  </p>  <p>  Despite this, there are many examples of good progress that have been achieved across Government to realise the vision set out in First 5.  The 2020 Annual Implementation Report will be published later this year and outline a full account of year two of implementation. </p></reply>

This Initiative is supported by the Dormant Accounts Fund. This initiative builds on a similar previous initiative which was reviewed and found that small group and 1 to 1 interventions by youth services proved beneficial in helping hard to reach young people. The ETBs have recently completed an application process and I anticipate that I and my colleague the Minister for Rural and Community Development will receive a submission shortly.  This iteration will focus on mentoring, leadership, local networks of NGOs and statutory bodies and outreach programmes.</p>  <p>  Further, my Department provides significant funding in both the targeted and universal space to support young people to address range of needs including the provision of age appropriate tools and information related to the acquisition of employment and life skills.  Of the over 250 UBU Your Place Your Space funded organisations, 75% include identified target groups of a) youth unemployment or b) young people not in employment, education or training. </p></reply>

The processing of all international protection applications is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Justice.</p>  <p>  While Tulsa has no role in the asylum system, it has a specialist team of social workers dealing with separated children - the Separated Children Seeking Asylum (SCSA) team. The SCSA team also works with unaccompanied minors that Ireland has agreed to accept under specific projects led by the IRPP. The SCSA will assist the child in completing a protection application form for the International Protection Office and will also provide emotional support to the child.</p>  <p>  Separated children are the largest cohort of children who come into Tusla care when they present to the immigration authorities at our sea and air ports. The service provided to these children is demand-led, and accurately estimating future demand is challenging as the international situation can change quickly. These children are received into care and are placed in residential and foster care.</p>  <p>  Tusla's SCSA team received 80 referrals in 2020. Often such referrals include children who arrive unaccompanied at a port of entry but who have an adult relative or friend who lives in Ireland and is willing to care for them. The children who do not have adult relatives or guardians are received into care. There were 52 of these children in 2020.</p>  <p>  With regard to children who are accompanied by their parents or guardians, such children are included in the protection applications made by their parents. The International Protection Accommodation Service (IPAS) of my Department has no role in the processing of asylum applications. IPAS is responsible for the provision of accommodation and other services to persons who indicate their need for such accommodation during the protection application process. IPAS has also developed its own developed a Child Protection and Welfare Policy, the implementation of which is overseen by a social work team leader on secondment from Tusla to IPAS.  In addition to this oversight role, the social work team leader also works directly with centre staff and families within IPAS accommodation centres to ensure they receive the child and family supports they require.</p>  <p>  Numerous organisations, including NGOs and State Partners, also provide in-reach assistance to the families to assist with their orientation to the country. Such assistance includes linking them in to State supports and legal advisory services.</p>  <p>  Other key service responses delivered or supported by Tusla, such as Tusla Education Support Services, Family Support Services and Children and Young People&rsquo;s Services Committees, actively engage with children in these settings to support their transition and integration into the community.</p>  <p>  In addition, IPAS has officials seconded full time from both the Department of Education and the Tusla Education Support Services who assist residents with the placement of their children in local schools and any additional education needs.  All children, irrespective of their gender, including children of international protection applicants, refugees, migrant workers and unaccompanied minors can access pre-school, first and second level education in a manner similar to Irish nationals, until they have reached the age of 18 years.</p></reply>

We had an in-depth discussion on the implications of the report and the issue is under review by officials in the context of our consideration of the Estimates for 2022.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, I provided an increase of &euro;5 million in funding for youth services in 2021, bringing the total from my Department to &euro;66.8 million this year. </p><p>Each year, my Department funds universally focused, volunteer led, youth work through the Youth Service Grant Scheme. A number of National Youth Organisations will benefit from over &euro;12 million in funding under this scheme in 2021. This represents a 6% increase over the funding provided in 2020.

This scheme supports 1,400 clubs or groups nationwide.</p><p>I would like to reiterate the significance and value I place on the contributions made by volunteers to the community life of our country and to supporting our most vulnerable.

The level of pay they receive does not reflect the value of the work they do for children, for families and for the wider society and economy. </p>  <p>  The State is not the employer and therefore cannot determine wages in the sector. However, I am committed to doing what is in my power to improve wages and conditions of employment in the sector. Increased investment by my Department in early learning and childcare services over a number of years has aimed to support improvements in pay. Overall, investment in the sector increased 141% over five budgets to 2020. This investment included specific measures to assist employers to improve pay and conditions such as: a 7% increase in ECCE capitation in 2018; higher capitation payments for graduates and Inclusion Coordinators; support for school-age childcare to make it easier to offer full-time, full-year employment contracts; and a pilot measure to fund participation in CPD.</p>  <p>  Last December I began a process to examine the possibility of regulating pay and conditions in the sector and the suitability of a Joint Labour Committee (JLC). In agreement with IBEC/Childhood Services Ireland, and SIPTU, I appointed Dr Kevin Duffy, former Chair of the Labour Court, to be the independent chair of this process.</p>  <p>   On foot of Dr Duffy&rsquo;s report, on 11 March I wrote to the Minister of State for Business, Employment and Retail, recommending the establishment of a JLC for the sector. </p>  <p>  In line with the provisions of the Industrial Relations Acts, the Labour Court recommended establishment of a JLC, and Minister English has now accepted the Labour Court&rsquo;s recommendations. The Establishment Order came into effect at the beginning of July. The JLC will provide an opportunity for unions and employer representatives to work together to determine wages and working conditions for the sector.  </p>  <p>  Work is also progressing on a new funding model. The recommendations of a dedicated Expert Group are due later in 2021 and will be central to addressing both affordability and quality issues. The Expert Group&rsquo;s Draft Guiding Principles to underpin a new funding model recognise the importance of the workforce in delivering quality services. </p>  <p>  Finally, work continues on the Workforce Development Plan in setting out an approach to achieve commitments in First 5 relating to the workforce in early learning and childcare services, including commitments to raise the profile of careers in the sector and to ensure sufficient numbers of staff at all levels within the sector along with leadership development opportunities, and to work towards a more gender-balanced and diverse workforce. It is expected that the Workforce Development Plan will be completed by the end of this year.</p></reply>

If I, or my officials, become aware of a situation in which a child is considered to be at risk, that concern is communicated to Tusla as a matter of urgency. </p>  <p>  If a child appears to be at risk of harm or neglect, the concerns should be reported to Tusla. Anyone can report a concern about a child to Tusla, and information on how to do so is available on the Tusla website.  If a child is at immediate risk or in danger, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (AGS) should be alerted without delay. </p>  <p>  Tusla acts urgently on notification of an immediate risk to a child. Children who are in a situation of immediate risk may initially be dealt with by AGS or by Tusla, but in the main both agencies work together in such cases. </p>  <p>  Tusla has an out of hours emergency number for AGS which provides advice to the AGS based on the circumstances and also can identify where a child is listed on the Child Protection Notification System. There is a 24/7 'out of hours' social work team available in Dublin, Wicklow, Kildare and Cork and on call social workers in other areas. Tusla has a network of emergency foster care placements for children in need of emergency care out of hours.   </p>  <p>  Garda&iacute; have specific powers under Section 12 of the Child Care Act to remove a child from a situation of danger, and under Section 13 of that same act, to deliver that child into the custody of Tusla. Tusla will at that point carry out an assessment to determine the child's needs. This may in some cases include applying for an Emergency Care Order.  In all cases, a plan will be put in place to ensure that the child is safe from harm. Where a child is already in care, Tusla will make a determination as to whether the child is safe in their placement or if they need to be moved. </p>  <p>  In April 2021 Tusla published research undertaken by National University of Ireland Galway (NUIG) which examined the actions undertaken by Tusla social workers when AGS transfer custody of a child to their care, following the AGS removing the child under Section 12 of the Child Care Act 1991. This research was carried out following the publication of an audit report, by the former Special Rapporteur for Child Protection, of the use of Section 12 by AGS.</p>  <p>  A total of 452 cases recorded in Tusla&rsquo;s Section 12 database for the period July 1st 2016 to June 30th 2017 were analysed. The findings showed that most of the children were aged 15 to 17 years and there were slightly more boys than girls. The research also showed that the most commonly reported reasons for invoking a Section 12 were: </p>  <p>  - Severe parenting Difficulties</p>  <p>  - Parental Alcohol/Drug Abuse</p>  <p>  - Child Behaviour Difficulties.</p>  <p>  As the data for the report was collected in 2016/2017 many of the findings of the report, and subsequent recommendations, have been addressed through ongoing service development and improvement in Tusla, including, as mentioned, the standardised processes of communication between Tusla and AGS.</p></reply>

The reports are published on Tusla's website and are scrutinised by my officials. Issues of note are brought to my attention. The reports provide statistical evidence of improvements to child welfare and protection services and highlight challenges and areas where further improvement is required, such as the recruitment of additional social workers.</p>  <p>  Additionally, Tusla child protection and welfare, and alternative care services are inspected against the relevant Standards and Regulations by the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA). These inspection reports are also published, and the findings used to inform the development and improvement of services within Tusla.   </p>  <p>  HIQA carries out announced and unannounced inspections of children&rsquo;s services including Child Protection and Welfare Services, Foster Care Services, Children&rsquo;s Residential Centres and Special Care units. In addition, HIQA has a programme of thematic and overview reports, which assess Tusla at a whole-service level. Inspections include reviews of on-site files, interviews with staff and service users and their families. </p>  <p>  Following an inspection, HIQA shares its initial judgements and draft report with the service/area. HIQA then works with the management of the centre or area in order to agree an Action Plan to address any identified deficits. Final reports, including the area or service&rsquo;s Action Plans, are submitted to the Department for information and monitored by my officials. Most inspections are generally positive, and reflect both examples of good practice and dedicated staff. However, some reports identify challenges within individual areas, including the impact of staffing shortages, and difficulties in finding appropriate placements for children and young people.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department meet Tusla management on a regular basis to review the level of service provision, including areas in need of improvement.</p></reply>

In mid-October 2020 the transfer took place of the Governance function of IHREC from the Department of Justice and Equality to my Department. </p>  <p>  Significant advances have been made in recent years to address inequality in Irish society, with the Government&rsquo;s commitment to fostering a diverse, inclusive and equal society re-affirmed through the Programme for Government commitments to achieve social solidarity, equality of opportunity and economic equity for all.</p>  <p>  The suite of national equality strategies, overseen and coordinated by my Department, act as the central policy framework adopted by Government to address inequality across Irish society. The strategies include the Migrant Integration Strategy (MIS), the National Strategy for Women and Girls (NSWG), the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy (NTRIS), the National Disability Inclusion Strategy (NDIS), the National LGBTI+ Inclusion Strategy, the National LGBTI+ Strategy for Youth and the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities (CES).</p>  <p>  The implementation of each equality strategy is overseen by a steering committee which draws together State and non-State actors to deliver a better quality of life for all through targeted actions to promote social inclusion and improved access to public services. I chair the meetings of the committees charged with the monitoring and oversight of the strategies, with the exception of the National Disability Inclusion Strategy steering group which is chaired by my colleague the Minister of State, Deputy Anne Rabbitte T.D., and the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities which is chaired by Fergus Finlay.</p>  <p>  As some of these strategies near their conclusion, I will work with stakeholders to examine what has been achieved over their term and how we can bring forth the next iterations of those strategies and ensure they are even more robust and effective. </p>  <p>  In June of this year I announced my intention to conduct a review of the Employment Equality and Equal Status Acts to examine the functioning of the Acts and their effectiveness in combatting discrimination and in promoting equality, including awareness of the legislation and whether there are obstacles to taking an action under the Acts. The first phase of the public consultation process has commenced and the views of the public and interested organisations are being sought on their own experience of the legislation and whether, in their view, legislative amendments are required. Submissions were also invited on the scope of the current definitions of the nine equality grounds. This includes consideration of the disability ground and whether new grounds should be added, such as the grounds of socio-economic discrimination and around gender identity. </p>  <p>  In response to requests from stakeholders, I recently announced the extension of the period of public consultation for the Equality Acts Review. The new deadline for submissions is 29 November 2021.</p></reply>

On 23rd September, Tusla gave a presentation to all stakeholders attending the Monitoring Committee for the 2nd National Strategy on DSGBV, with a view to achieving a national consensus within the sector on the proposed response to these needs. I anticipate publication of the review in the coming weeks. </p>  <p>  The Review assesses the current and requisite distribution of safe emergency accommodation and has examined the current level of refuge provision, evidence of demand for services and unmet need, and analysis of proximity to refuge by local communities. The development of additional refuge places will require strong engagement across Government and with key stakeholders.

Section 26 of the 1991 Act provides for the appointment of a GAL in respect of care proceedings where a child is not party to those proceedings and where the Court is satisfied that it is necessary in the best interests of the child and in the interests of justice to have a GAL appointed. </p><p>The role and function of a GAL is to inform the court of the child&rsquo;s views and to advise the court of what, in the GAL's<i></i>professional opinion, is in the best interests of the child.

As this process is ongoing, the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment at this stage. </p>  <p>  In recent years, funding for the provision of youth services has increased on an annual basis. Between the years 2016 and 2021, the annual current youth funding available to my Department has increased from &euro;51.9 million to &euro;66.79 million. This included &euro;5million in additional funding in 2021, the largest increase over that period, indicating my recognition and that of Government for the extremely valuable work of this sector. </p>  <p>  It is now more critical than ever that our young people are supported as they experience the social, economic, physical and mental health impacts of the pandemic. In recognition of the vital role played by youthwork services in providing such support to young people, funding levels have been maintained throughout the current challenging period.  This has enabled the youth sector to continue to provide supports to young people, particularly to marginalised, disadvantaged and vulnerable young people.  The increased funding in 2021 has enabled DCEDIY to offer more supports to existing services, to help them reach more young people, and it is enabling the introduction of brand new services across the country. </p>  <p>  As we begin to move beyond the pandemic, I am committed to supporting this important sector, which has enormous value to the many young people involved and from a broader social and economic viewpoint. </p></reply>

The Plan, which will be completed by year-end, is intended to set out an approach to achieve the workforce commitments in <i>First 5</i>(the Whole of Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families) relating to early learning and care (ELC) and school age childcare (SAC), including commitments to ensure sufficient numbers of staff at all levels of qualifications within the sector, and to raise the profile of careers in the sector, along with strengthening leadership development opportunities, and working towards a more gender-balanced and diverse workforce.</p><p>In addition to involvement of representatives of the sector and of further and higher education institutions in development of the Plan, public and sectoral consultation on the Plan took place in 2020.</p><p>I am not aware of a shortage of places on further and higher education courses for ELC. Rather, the staffing challenges experienced in ELC and SAC services primarily reflect challenges of staff recruitment and staff retention. I believe the key to tackling these issues are improving pay and conditions for ELC  and SAC practitioners. A pathway to addressing this is through the ongoing Joint Labour Committee (JLC) process which I commenced in December 2020 in coordination with employee and employer representative organisations.</p><p>The strengthening of a career framework and clear career pathways - through the Workforce Development Plan - should complement the efforts underway to improve pay and conditions of employment in the sector.</p><p>My Department continues to fund a number of workforce training and development initiatives, including Higher Capitation payments for ECCE services with graduate room leaders, the Learner Fund, and the LINC (Leadership for Inclusion) programme. These initiatives have had a positive impact on the increasing qualification levels in the sector. The proportion of staff in centre-based ELC services with higher qualifications than the minimum has been steadily increasing, with the proportion of the workforce holding a qualification at level 7 or above on the National Framework of Qualifications estimated at 27% in 2020, up from 12% in 2012. </p></reply>

As this process is ongoing, the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment at this stage.  </p><p>I would like to reiterate the significance and value I place on the contributions made by volunteers to the community life of our country and to supporting our most vulnerable. In the youth sector, the work of some 40,000 volunteers has been key to the ability of youth work organisations to function effectively prior to the pandemic.</p><p>My Department sits on the Implementation Group of the <i>National Volunteering Strategy 2021 &ndash; 2025</i>. The purpose of this Strategy, led by the Department of Rural and Community Development, is to recognise, support and promote the unique value and contribution of volunteers to Irish society. A number of representatives of the voluntary youth sector are represented on subgroups under the Strategy working to advance actions in the areas of volunteer support and training as well as youth engagement  <i>. </i></p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, I provided an increase of &euro;5 million in funding for youth services in 2021, bringing the total from my Department to &euro;66.8 million this year. </p><p>Each year, my Department funds universally focused, volunteer led, youth work through the Youth Service Grant Scheme. A number of National Youth Organisations will benefit from over &euro;12 million in funding under this scheme in 2021. This represents a 6% increase over the funding provided in 2020. I believe that the youth work carried out by these volunteer groups is transformative for young people.</p><p>Additionally, the Local Youth Club Grant Scheme supports volunteer-led youth work activities at a local level. The funding for this scheme increased by 7% to &euro;2.3m in 2021. This scheme supports 1,400 clubs or groups nationwide.</p><p>I have consistently recognised the significant role that the youth sector plays in the lives of young people today, and the extremely valuable role that volunteers play in this. Given the strong commitment of our volunteers, I am very hopeful that as public health matters improve; as more people are vaccinated; and as Youth Organisations are better positioned to support volunteers once again, we will see volunteers returning. </p><p>The Deputy will be aware that youth funding was maintained through the Covid-19 restrictions and various supports provided. As Ireland's phased re-opening progresses, it is of the utmost importance that youth work organisations are supported to restore their volunteer positions so that the resumption of youth services can continue and I am committed to continuing to support youth work services to do so.</p></reply>

Indeed, in the past few weeks I attended a round table discussion convened by the T&aacute;naiste involving Ministers and officials from relevant Departments and the youth sector to consider this issue. I issued a joint press release on 24 September detailing this meeting which may be of interest to the Deputy.</p>  <p>  My colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, Heather Humphreys TD, has recently published Pathways to Work 2021 -2025 with a number of key goals. Youth employment and youth employability generally comes within their remit. </p>  <p>  With respect to employability and a role for youth services, my Department is working with the Education and Training Boards on a Targeted Youth Employability Support Initiative, beginning in 2021 and for the full year of 2022.  This Initiative is supported by the Dormant Accounts Fund. This initiative builds on a similar previous initiative which was reviewed and found that small group and 1 to 1 interventions by youth services proved beneficial in helping hard to reach young people. The ETBs have recently completed an application process and I anticipate that I and my colleague the Minister for Rural and Community Development will receive a submission shortly.  This iteration will focus on mentoring, leadership, local networks of NGOs and statutory bodies and outreach programmes.</p>  <p>  Further, my Department provides significant funding in both the targeted and universal space to support young people to address range of needs including the provision of age appropriate tools and information related to the acquisition of employment and life skills.  Of the over 250 UBU Your Place Your Space funded organisations, 75% include identified target groups of a) youth unemployment or b) young people not in employment, education or training. </p></reply>

The scheme includes a "non-adjacent" rate of grant which is a higher rate of grant which takes into consideration the additional costs which may be associated with living further away from college, such as accommodation costs. </p>  <p>  Student maintenance grants are payable at either the adjacent or non-adjacent rate, depending on distance to the college attended. The adjacent rate of maintenance grant is payable in the case of students whose normal residence is 45km or less from the approved institution which he or she is attending. The higher non-adjacent rate of maintenance grant is payable in all other cases. In this way the scheme is responsive to eligible students who reside further away from college by providing an increased rate of student maintenance grant.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Programme for Government contains a commitment to review SUSI eligibility criteria, adjacency rates and postgraduate grant supports. To take forward this commitment I established a review of the Student Grant Scheme. This review is currently underway, and being conducted by Indecon Economic Consultants, under the direction of a steering group chaired by my Department and comprising a number of stakeholders. </p>  <p>  It is anticipated that the review will be completed later this year and will inform future priorities regarding the development of student grant policy, including in the context of forthcoming Estimates process for 2022. </p>  <p>  Apart from the Student Grant Scheme, students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund.

Operators offering activities in whole or in part online, will be subject to the licensing terms and conditions as set out by the regulator. Matters regarding enforcement will also be for the gambling regulator.</p><p>  Key objectives of the regulator will be preventing gambling from being a source or support to crime, ensuring that gambling is conducted in a fair and open way for companies to make decisions in certainty, and requiring safeguards including in relation to gambling advertising.</p><p>  Furthermore, given the size, complexity and technological development of the modern gambling industry and having regard to the current outdated and complex arrangements, it will be important that the regulator will be established on a sound footing and be adequately resourced to carry out this important task. </p><p>Further details on the functions and powers of the regulator will be outlined in the Scheme. </p></reply>

Prioritising visible policing in rural and urban communities will ensure community policing is at the forefront of our police service and an integral strand of our social contract with the public. </p>  <p>  To this end, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has an unprecedented budget of &euro;1.952 billion in 2021. This level of funding is supporting the ongoing recruitment of Garda members and staff. There are now approximately 14,400 Garda members and over 3,300 Garda staff nationwide. </p>  <p>  Although the budget was available for the recruitment of 600 Garda&iacute; this year, the Commissioner has indicated that, due to the impact of the pandemic restrictions in Templemore, Garda recruitment is likely to total approximately 450 trainees spread over four intakes this year.  Three of these intakes have already commenced training and the final intake are due to commence next month. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Garda Commissioner is introducing the new Garda Operating Model, which is designed to make each Division the central unit of policing administration, rather than the current smaller District model. This is to provide a more comprehensive and inclusive policing service and will help strengthen the focus on community policing. As part of this process, trained Garda&iacute; are freed up from desk duties and redeployed to front line policing.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to delivering on the report of the Commission for the Future of Policing in Ireland (CoFPI), which acknowledges that policing and community safety are not the sole responsibility of the Garda&iacute; but require a whole of Government approach. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, my Department recently published the General Scheme of the Policing, Security and Community Safety Bill. This Bill will improve the performance and accountability of our policing and security services, and support the human rights of all people throughout Ireland to be and feel safe in their communities. It will represent the most wide ranging and coherent reform of policing in a generation.</p>  <p>  The Bill has four main objectives:</p>  <p>  1. Make the prevention of harm and protection of people who are vulnerable or at risk, and the safety of communities,  a &ldquo;whole of government&rdquo; responsibility,</p>  <p>  2. Strengthen and consolidate independent, external oversight of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na,</p>  <p>  3. Enhance the internal governance of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the role of the Garda Commissioner as CEO, and</p>  <p>  4. Improve the independent oversight of our national security infrastructure.</p>  <p>  This Bill has been developed on the basis of the recommendations of CoFPI following its fundamental in-depth review and builds on the work of the Policing Authority.</p>  <p>  The Commission found that community safety requires a whole of Government approach in partnership with local communities. My Department has been developing a new Community Safety Policy and this new policy will be given a statutory basis in the Bill. To support and inform the policy, three Local Community Safety Partnerships are being piloted in Dublin&rsquo;s North Inner City, Waterford and Longford and will run for the next two years.  </p>  <p>  Local Community Safety Partnerships are designed to take a holistic approach to safety issues in partnership with the community. The Partnerships will allow local communities to identify issues  of particular concern within their area and work with the relevant State services to develop a local Community Safety Plan to specifically tackle these issues. The Local Community Safety Partnerships will be rolled out nationwide to all local authority areas after the pilot phase of two years.</p>  <p>  I am very aware of recent incidents of anti-social behaviour in on our communities. I met senior members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and representatives of businesses in Dublin city centre, as well as local representatives, in recent weeks to discuss the issue of anti-social behaviour in the city. I will be in continuing contact with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and others as we progress through the autumn and winter on the actions being taken to ensure people feel safe in Dublin and other towns and cities. </p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to implement high visibility policing plans to address public disorder related issues and anti-social behaviour, with particular overt and targeted policing of public places at times when public order incidents and anti-social behaviour typically increase, such as at bank holidays weekends. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, in line with the commitment in the Programme for Government, an Expert Forum on Anti-Social Behaviour has been established, chaired by Minister of State James Browne. This forum considers the effectiveness of existing legislation and proposes new ways forward, including new powers for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and additional interventions to support parenting of offenders. A sub-group of the forum has already considered measures which can be taken with regard to the misuse of scramblers and quad bikes in communities and similar sub groups can also be established for other issues where appropriate. For example, a further subgroup on the issue of knife crime has now been established and had its first meeting on 28 September.</p></reply>

This includes &euro;8 million in support of the initial phase of the Courts Modernisation Programme. There has also been an additional provision of &euro;5.7m for COVID measures to enable court sittings take place in a safe environment.</p>  <p>  The EU Justice Scoreboard, which presents an annual overview of the justice systems of all 27 Members States, shows that Ireland&rsquo;s per capita expenditure is the third highest across the EU.  Irish expenditure is by far the highest of the Members States with a similar common law legal system.  Irish spending has also continued to increase for every year measured in the EU Justice Scoreboard.</p>  <p>  I also welcome the significant capital allocations granted to the Justice Sector under the National Development Plan 2021-2030, launched this week. The Government has committed to investing over &euro;270m every year for the next five years in capital projects in the Justice Sector, which represents a significant increase on recent years. </p>  <p>  This investment will provide for the completion of vital projects including a new laboratory for Forensic Science Ireland in Backweston, a family law complex at Hammond Lane and redevelopment work at Limerick Prison. </p>  <p>  Throughout the pandemic, the Judiciary and the Courts Service have worked closely and innovated through the use of technology to maintain the highest level of court activity possible, with a particular focus on families, victims of domestic abuse and people who are most vulnerable at this time. I expect that the progress made on new ways of working will be maintained into the future. I know that the Courts Service and the Judiciary are committed to ensuring that as much business as possible is dealt with and I understand that the Courts Service is also working on a plan on how to deal with demands that will arise after the pandemic.</p>  <p>  Since the easing of restrictions in May, Courts have returned to normal sittings and are dealing with all business again. Additional High Courts sat in September together with the usual scheduled sittings to deal with emergency matters. High Court Civil Jury Trials re-commenced in the Kings Inns at the end of June and will continue from 2 November in Croke Park .  </p>  <p>  A Working Group has also been established in line with the Programme for Government to consider the number of and type of judges required to ensure the efficient administration of justice over the next five years.  That Group is examining the wider judicial resource needs in all courts, and is expected to report in the Spring of next year. Notwithstanding this group&rsquo;s important work, Government has recently implemented an increase in the number of High Court judges from 37 to 42, with four of those appointments made this week.</p></reply>

However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made with the Courts Service who have informed me that they do not publish the name of anybody convicted of a crime. Neither do they take or hold photographs of any defendant.</p>  <p>  More generally, the position in respect of the trial of criminal offences in Ireland is that justice must be administered in public in accordance with the Constitution. This is subject to certain statutory provisions that prohibit the reporting of the identification of an accused person or a convicted person, where, for example, that person is a minor or where the publication of their identity could lead to the identification of a victim, usually a minor but also adult victims in respect of certain offences.</p>  <p>  Where there is no order of prohibition in place, the media can and do report on murder and serious crimes, including by way of naming the convicted person. The Courts Service has maintained access to the courts for the media at all times, including throughout the pandemic. </p></reply>

These schemes provide avenues for Afghan nationals to seek protection and for eligible family members living in Ireland to seek to have their close family members granted permission to reside in Ireland, where the relevant criteria are met. More than 670 Afghan nationals have already been granted permissions to reside in the State so far this year. </p>  <p>  Last week, the Government approved an additional initiative; the special Afghan Admission Programme.  The Programme will allow places for up to 500 Afghan family members and each applicant will have an opportunity to nominate up to four family members who are currently residing in Afghanistan or who have fled to neighbouring territories and whom they consider would be especially at risk in terms of their freedom and safety.  </p>  <p>  The Programme is guided by the previous Syrian Humanitarian Assistance Programme (SHAP) which also provided for the nomination of a limited number of close family members and by the IRPP Humanitarian Assistance Programme (IHAP), which included Afghan nationals.</p>  <p>  The Programme, including the detailed eligibility criteria and the application process, will be developed over the coming months, with a view to issuing a call for applications in December. The timescale provided is to ensure that the options considered are as inclusive as possible and that the programme is available to those that most require our help. The intervening time is required to develop the details of the programme, including a guidance document for applicants, application form, decision making criteria and the appeals process. The clearer the application process is made at the outset, the quicker we will be able to process applications in the interests of those concerned.</p></reply>

It sets a target for Ireland to be tobacco free (i.e. with a prevalence rate of less than 5%) by 2025.</p><p>Prevention is primarily carried out through tobacco control legislation. Legislation (based on the WHO MPOWER evidence based measures) implemented in recent years includes the introduction of standardised packaging and a ban on smoking in cars. The current legislative project will license the retail sale of tobacco and nicotine inhaling products and will ban the sale of tobacco products through automatic vending machines. </p><p>Seeking to increase the price of tobacco products in each budget is also an important action under the MPOWER principles.  </p><p>Other important prevention measures include warning young people about the dangers of smoking and 2020 saw the inclusion of information on the dangers of tobacco use in Healthy Choices 1, the first substance misuse module of Junior Cycle - Social, Personal and Health Education, aimed at first year students.</p><p>Tobacco cessation measures include; smoking cessation medications provided to medical card holders through the Primary Care Reimbursement Scheme, frontline HSE intensive smoking cessation services, the national quit line and mass media campaigns. The quit campaign aims to increase the demand for QUIT support services and the national quitline. The total amount spent on smoking cessation services by the Tobacco Free Ireland programme was &euro;13m in 2019 and estimated to be the same for 2020.  </p></reply>

Furthermore, individual efforts to wear masks based on individual risk assessment will remain an important component of our collective response to COVID-19.</p><p>Government will meet in advance of 22 October to consider, based on the advice of the NPHET, moving forward with the plan. </p><p>Since the onset of the pandemic, we have saved lives and limited the impact of the disease on society in Ireland due to the huge effort of people across the country. Thanks to the hard work of the Irish people and the progress of our vaccination programme, we are now entering a new phase in the management of the pandemic. As our approach to the management of COVID-19 transitions from population wide restrictions to guidance we must continue to practice basic preventative behaviours, including in relation to self-isolation and restricting movements when advised, observing good respiratory and hand hygiene, physical distancing and mask wearing when appropriate. </p><p><i>COVID-19: Reframing the Challenge, Continuing Our Recovery and Reconnecting</i>can be found online: </p><p><i>www.gov.ie/en/press-release/f5291-post-cabinet-statement-covid-19-reframing-the-challenge-continuing-our-recovery-and-reconnecting/</i></p></reply>

The committee's recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation. It makes recommendations on vaccination policy to my Department. The NIAC continues to revise recommendations to allow for the introduction of new vaccines in Ireland and to keep abreast of changes in the patterns of disease. Therefore, the immunisation schedule will continue to be amended over time.</p><p>In 2009, the NIAC recommended HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccination for all 12 to 13 year old girls to reduce their risk of developing cervical cancer when they are adults. In September 2010, the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of secondary school.</p><p>In June 2017, on foot of the NIAC&rsquo;s recommendation that the HPV vaccine should also be given to boys, my Department asked the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to undertake a health technology assessment (HTA) to establish the clinical and cost-effectiveness of extending the immunisation programme to include boys in the first year of secondary school.</p><p>The HIQA completed the HTA in December 2018, recommending that the HPV immunisation programme be extended to include boys. A policy decision was made to extend the HPV immunisation programme to include boys, starting in September 2019, with the introduction of a 9-valent HPV vaccine.</p><p>The ages at which vaccines are recommended in the immunisation schedule are chosen by the NIAC in order to give each child the best possible protection against vaccine preventable diseases. As the HPV vaccine is preventative it is intended to be administered, if possible, before a person becomes sexually active, that is, before a person is first exposed to HPV infection.</p><p>Therefore, the gender-neutral HPV vaccination programme targets all girls and boys in first year of secondary school to provide maximum coverage. All vaccines administered through the School Immunisation Programme are provided free of charge.</p><p>My Department will continue to be guided by NIAC's recommendations on any emerging evidence on this issue in the future.</p><p>Anyone not in 1st year of secondary school or age equivalent in special schools or home schooled during the 2020/2021 school year who wishes to get the HPV vaccine, must go to their GP or sexual health clinic and pay privately for the vaccine and its administration. This applies to everyone whether or not they have a medical card/GP visit card, as it is outside of the HPV immunisation programme.</p><p>At the request of my Department, the HIQA are conducting a Health Technology Assessment (HTA) on a school based HPV mop-up vaccination programme (for those that were previously eligible and missed or turned down the vaccine). The HIQA has confirmed that this HTA has been added to its work programme for 2021/2022 and I have requested that my officials give consideration to the outcome of this work in the context of the immunisation programme.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-10-07a.1037.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021100700075#WRV02400"><p>Historically children&rsquo;s disability services have been provided by a range of statutory and non-statutory service providers that delivered services based on a child&rsquo;s diagnosis or age.  The type and level of service provided varied widely across the country.  This resulted in a situation whereby access to services depended on where the child lived, where they went to school, their age and their diagnosis.  In some cases, children were transferred between waiting lists as their diagnosis was unclear. In parallel, many families were advised to apply for an Assessment of Need (AON) under the Disability Act (2005) as a means of securing a diagnosis and subsequent access to services.  Consequently, waiting times for AON increased and the HSE was unable to meet its legislative obligations in this regard. </p><p>The Progressing Disability Services for Children &amp;amp; Young People (PDS) programme represents a major reform of services for children with complex needs.  Children&rsquo;s Disability Network Teams are being established that will provide services for children with complex needs based on their needs and on their address.  Access to these CDNTs is not linked to diagnosis or school placements.  To address issues associated with AON, the HSE implemented a Standard Operating Procedure for AON for all new applications from January 2020.  This procedure defines an AON as a preliminary team assessment that determines whether or not a child has a disability as defined by the Act.  This system is designed to ensure that children access timely assessments and intervention.  The establishment of CDNTs in association with implementation of this SOP ensures that children and families access appropriate supports as quickly as possible.  </p><p>The Children's Disability Network Team includes a range of health professionals, such as Speech and Language Therapists, Occupational Therapists, Psychologists, Paediatricians, Physiotherapists and Social Workers. The HSE has its own standards and criteria for employing health professionals and all professionals on the team will have the appropriate level of expertise to assess the child.</p><p>There is no legislation that prohibits a health practitioner from offering a private diagnosis, however, a diagnosis of autism can often require an assessment by a multi-disciplinary team. </p><p>When seeking any private health service, it is always advisable to check the health professional&rsquo;s qualifications. Some professions, such as psychiatrists, occupational therapists and speech and language therapists are statutorily regulated and the register of their regulator can be checked to ensure they are appropriately qualified - www.medicalcouncil.ie/public-information/check-the-register/,  <i>system.coru.ie/index.php/SearchMember/Find</i></p><p>Other health professions are not currently statutorily regulated but this does not mean that practitioners are not fully qualified to practise their profession. If a practitioner is unwilling or unable to provide proof of qualifications, it may be prudent to seek assistance from an alternate source.  In the case of some health professions, there are also professional bodies that can be contacted for advice, mindful that membership of a professional body is not always a requirement to practise, the Psychological Society of Ireland (PsSI), the professional body for psychologists in Ireland, being an example.The Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 provides for the statutory regulation of psychologists in the future, and work is ongoing towards opening the register. </p><p>If further information is required regarding HSE procedures in this area, please do not hesitate to contact this department and my officials will request that the Executive forward the relevant information to you directly.</p><p>I hope this provides some clarity to the Deputy.</p></reply>

The committee's recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation. It makes recommendations on vaccination policy to my Department. The NIAC continues to revise recommendations to allow for the introduction of new vaccines in Ireland and to keep abreast of changes in the patterns of disease. Therefore, the immunisation schedule will continue to be amended over time.</p><p>In 2009, the NIAC recommended HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccination for all 12 to 13 year old girls to reduce their risk of developing cervical cancer when they are adults. In September 2010, the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of secondary school.</p><p>In June 2017, on foot of the NIAC&rsquo;s recommendation that the HPV vaccine should also be given to boys, my Department asked the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to undertake a health technology assessment (HTA) to establish the clinical and cost-effectiveness of extending the immunisation programme to include boys in the first year of secondary school.</p><p>The HIQA completed the HTA in December 2018, recommending that the HPV immunisation programme be extended to include boys. A policy decision was made to extend the HPV immunisation programme to include boys, starting in September 2019, with the introduction of a 9-valent HPV vaccine.</p><p>The ages at which vaccines are recommended in the immunisation schedule are chosen by the NIAC in order to give each child the best possible protection against vaccine preventable diseases. As the HPV vaccine is preventative it is intended to be administered, if possible, before a person becomes sexually active, that is, before a person is first exposed to HPV infection.</p><p>Therefore, the gender-neutral HPV vaccination programme targets all girls and boys in first year of secondary school to provide maximum coverage. All vaccines administered through the School Immunisation Programme are provided free of charge.</p><p>My Department will continue to be guided by NIAC's recommendations on any emerging evidence on this issue in the future.</p><p>Anyone not in 1st year of secondary school or age equivalent in special schools or home schooled during the 2020/2021 school year who wishes to get the HPV vaccine, must go to their GP or sexual health clinic and pay privately for the vaccine and its administration. This applies to everyone whether or not they have a medical card/GP visit card, as it is outside of the HPV immunisation programme.</p><p>In addition, as this question concerns service matters, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

Accordingly, the burnt area has been deducted from the eligible area within the parcel leaving a reduced area upon which payment can be claimed for the 2021 BPS scheme year. The claiming of the ineligible area has resulted in an overclaim on this application.</p>  <p>  The Department wrote to the person named on 19th August 2021 advising him of the position in relation to this application.

The sector has had tremendous successes in the Eventing discipline over many years with the Irish Sport Horse Studbook being first in the world rankings for 22 out of the last 25 years.  </p>  <p>  In recent years, there have been major successes for our young horses in the show-jumping discipline in World Studbook championships with these horses excelling at international venues like Lanaken in Belgium. </p>  <p>  Building on the key principles of good breed improvement programmes and developing the skills of breeders to access young horses early and produce them early for their appropriate market, Horse Sport Ireland proposed the National Equine Production Pathway which is a knowledge transfer programme, as part of their Strategic Plan. This programme supports horse assessments, health screening, young horse production and educational days for breeders.   This is clearly a programme I can support. </p>  <p>  My hope for the sector is for Ireland to be in the top division of the World Breeding Federation of Sport Horse Studbook ranking for show-jumping in 10 to15 years, producing horses that fit with market demands, properly produced for that market.  I will continue to work closely with HSI so that this can be achieved. </p></reply>

Forest owners who wish to avail of RUS, to clear fell all ash trees, would have to have a certain level of diseased trees before they can enter this scheme (and a lesser level of diseased trees to enter the underplanting element of the Scheme).  The Scheme aims to compensate for the clearance costs and replace the trees.

A small percentage are exported to non-EU countries. Ireland does not set the standards for animal welfare in third country markets, which are set by that country's government.</p>  <p>  The Department, however, in cooperation with our EU partners, works closely with the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) with a view to improving animal welfare practices worldwide. The OIE is the global standard setting body relating to animal health and animal welfare. It is through this forum that we influence standards in other countries.</p>  <p>  Ireland has been a member of the OIE European Platform Steering Committee on Animal Welfare since its creation in 2013 and has offered technical inputs for the development of the OIE Platform action plans. To support these activities, Ireland has also provided financial supports in recent years. </p>  <p>  All live export shipments from Ireland are conducted in full compliance with legislative requirements. All proposed journeys must be notified to the Regional Veterinary Office in advance, and veterinary certification will only be provided where the journey complies with all animal transport and animal welfare regulations.</p>  <p>  Live exports play a significant role in stimulating price competition and providing an alternative market outlet for farmers. The Department facilitates this trade, recognising its critical importance to the agri-sector, while ensuring that live animal exports meet the highest welfare standards.</p></reply>

To that end, Government and my Department introduced a number of supports to assist sectors in dealing with the impact of COVID-19 and social restrictions necessary in the interests of public health. </p>  <p>  During 2020, the COVID-19 Stability Fund supported close to 600 organisations to continue to deliver vital services to the communities that depend on them. </p>  <p>  An allocation of &euro;10m was provided to the Stability Fund for 2021 as part of the revised Resilience and Recovery plan announced on Tuesday 23rd February by the Taoiseach.   The COVID-19 Stability Fund 2021 was launched on Thursday 6th May, and was targeted at organisations which deliver eligible critical services to vulnerable people within their community but which faced closure or a loss of service due to the impact of the pandemic. The Fund was open for application from May 20th - 27th. The Stability Fund is administered by Pobal on behalf of my Department.</p>  <p>  I was pleased to announce tranche one of funding under the 2021 Fund to 180 successful applicants on 9th July 2021, allocating close to &euro;4.5m in funding, with tranche two announced on 1st October allocating just over &euro;2m in funding to 65 organisations. All allocations are published on the Gov.ie website. </p>  <p>  Outcomes have now been issued to all applicants, including the organisation in question. Eligibility to apply or submission of an application was no guarantee of funding.  Unsuccessful applicants have been provided with information on the appeals process. The appeals panel will consider information provided by the applicant within the context of the published scheme criteria. </p>  <p>  In general, I would encourage all organisations to continue to engage with their Local Authority and Local Development Company, and to check on the Gov.ie website in order to be aware of funding opportunities relevant to their sector and services, as they become available. </p></reply>

LEADER is a rural development programme co-funded by the EU which operates a locally led, bottom-up, approach to meeting the needs of local communities and businesses. The programme supports private enterprises and community groups in rural areas. </p><p>In December 2020, I launched the Transitional LEADER Programme which came into effect from 1 April 2021 and will run to the end of 2022. A total of &euro;70 million is being made available over this programming period. &euro;20 million of this Transitional LEADER Programme is funded by the European Union Recovery Instrument (EURI), which will enable local communities and enterprises to respond, recover and adapt to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>In order for a project to be eligible for LEADER funding, it must be compatible with the actions outlined in the approved Local Development Strategy for the relevant LEADER area and it must comply with the Operating Rules and EU Regulations in place for the programme.</p><p>The decision to approve a project, or otherwise, is a matter for the Local Action Group (LAG) which administers the programme in each LEADER area.  Interested applicants should, in the first instance, contact the relevant LAG through its Implementing Partners to discuss the eligibility of the project and the funding that may be available.</p><p>Contact details for all LAGs and their Implementing Partners can be accessed through the Department&rsquo;s website at the following link<b>: </b>www.gov.ie/en/publication/c45498-local-action-groups/</p></reply>

The Measures to be included in the CL&Aacute;R programme are reviewed and revised, as appropriate, each year. </p>  <p>  The 2020 CL&Aacute;R programme was adapted to help rural communities respond to COVID-19 and did not included specific support for playgrounds.</p>  <p>  The CL&Aacute;R programme was revised in 2021 and included support for Outdoor Community Recreation Facilities, including playgrounds.
