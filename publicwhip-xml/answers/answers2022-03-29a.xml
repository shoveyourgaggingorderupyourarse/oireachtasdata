It is investigating certain transactions, activities and management decisions at the IBRC and in its first module is investigating the Siteserv transaction.</p><p>Its original deadline was 31 December 2015 but following multiple requests from the Commission, and after consultation with Oireachtas parties, its timeframe for reporting has been extended. Most recently, I have just  granted a further extension, this time until the end of August 2022, following a further request from the Commission in its Eleventh Interim Report dated 11 March 2022.</p><p>From the time of its establishment to the end of February 2022 the Commission cost &euro;11.15 million approximately, excluding third party legal costs that have been incurred but not yet paid, which will be a matter for the Commission to determine at the end of its investigation.</p><p>In its Seventh Interim Report in February 2020, the Commission estimated that the final cost of the Siteserv investigation will be from &euro;12 - &euro;14.5 million. This estimate assumed the investigation would be completed by the end of 2020, not end August 2022 as is now the case, and excluded costs or delays associated with possible judicial review hearings.  </p><p>The Commission also acknowledged that it involved a substantial degree of uncertainty regarding the amount of costs actually recoverable by the parties before it and assumed its Legal Costs Guidelines are not successfully challenged.  </p><p>The Commission&rsquo;s most recent Interim Report does not provide any update on the &euro;12 - &euro;14.5 million estimate but my Department has given its view on many occasions that the final cost is likely to significantly exceed the Commission&rsquo;s estimate and could exceed &euro;30m. </p><p>The further extension of its timeline, as well as the Commission&rsquo;s acknowledgement of the possibility of court challenges, further supports my Department&rsquo;s view.</p><p>The NAMA Commission was established in June 2017 following consultations with Oireachtas parties to investigate the sale by NAMA of its Northern Ireland portfolio, known as Project Eagle.  </p><p>Its original deadline for reporting was 31 June 2018 but following several requests from the Commission and consultation with Oireachtas parties, its timeframe for reporting has also been extended.Most recently, earlier this month, I granted a further request for an extension, this time until the end of June 2022.</p><p>From the time of its establishment to the end of February 2022, the Commission has cost &euro;4 million approximately, excluding any third party legal costs incurred but not yet paid and which will be considered by the Commission at the end of its investigation. </p><p>The estimated cost for the Commission when it was established was &euro;10 million approximately, excluding the cost of any litigation that may arise.  The Commission has not provided an<font color="#004080"> </font>updated estimate for the cost of its investigation but the expenditure incurred to date suggests it is unlikely to exceed the original estimate<font color="#004080">.</font></p></reply>

The purpose of this exercise is to advise as to whether any further investigation or inquiry beyond those already carried out is necessary and, if so, to advise on the form of such investigation or inquiry and its terms of reference.</p>  <p>  My Department maintains regular contact with the Judge and has assured him that any assistance he requires to complete his final report will be made available. I am informed that the Judge had sought comments on various sections of his draft report from the parties named in it and he has confirmed that he has received responses from most of the relevant principal parties.  Once this process is concluded, I understand the Judge should be in a position to finalise his report.</p>  <p>  Once I have received the final report, the advice of the Attorney General will be sought on publication and any other issues arising.</p>  <p>  I wish to conclude by re-stating in clear terms that the Government has never been opposed to the possibility of a further inquiry into this case if that is what is recommended. However, the Deputy will understand that I cannot pre-empt any view or advice that the Judge considers appropriate in his final report.</p></reply>

As part of our plan to deliver on this commitment, I have announced the establishment of three pilot community safety partnerships in November 2020. These pilots schemes have been set up in Longford, North Inner City Dublin and Waterford. The pilots will run for a period of two years, and learnings from the pilot LCSPs will inform the eventual nationwide rollout. </p>  <p>  The Longford Community Safety Partnership, along with the other two pilot areas, will devise and oversee a Local Community Safety Plan, which will be informed by the community itself. The Plans will detail how best the community wants to prevent crime and will reflect community priorities and local safety issues. The goal is to make communities safer for families, residents and businesses.</p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that the Longford Community Safety Partnership has a complete membership with an Independent Chair and Coordinator in place. </p>  <p>  The partnership is in the process of developing their Community Safety Plan and I am advised that they are on track to complete development and adoption of the plan by the end of Q2 2022. </p>  <p>  A Steering Group was formed to assist the Chair and Coordinator in developing public consultations and to provide oversight of the development of the Community Safety Plan. The Steering Group has met on four occasions to date, in November and December last and twice in February. This group makes recommendations to the full Partnership on the consultation approach, assisting with arranging consultation events and analysis of consultation data to feed into the development of the Plan. </p>  <p>  Two Thematic Working Groups have been formed and met for the first time in January of this year. Each group is chaired by a Vice Chair of the partnership and will meet monthly. Membership includes partnership members and some external members nominated based on expertise and experience. </p>  <p>  Each of the Local Community Safety Partnership pilots is subject to monitoring and evaluation by an independent evaluation team and learnings are communicated to the three partnerships through an active learning approach. The initial phase of fieldwork, between Q4 2021 and Q1 2022, is focused on reviewing processes and establishing a baseline for any outcomes of the LCSPs' work over the next two years. </p>  <p>  Establishing a baseline is an important aspect of the evaluation as it ensures a solid understanding of the starting point against which to compare the data at the latter stages of the evaluation.

It is important that people feel safe and are safe in their communities. </p>  <p>  My Department are taking a range of actions designed to break the link between criminal gangs and the children they seek to recruit. This includes the enactment of new criminal legislation which will outlaw the grooming of children to commit crime. I also intend to bring forward legislation shortly which will increase the sentence of conspiracy to murder from ten years to life in prison. These new laws will ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and our Courts have the tools they need to take firm and decisive action to deal with our most serious criminals.</p>  <p>  While there are a number of policy approaches ongoing with regard to the issues raised by the Deputy, I am aware of the Deputy's particular interest in the Greentown Programme which is an important development in the Government&rsquo;s Youth Justice Strategy. This internationally recognised initiative is supported by my Department and led by the REPPP Project (Research Evidence into Policy, Programmes and Practice) at the School of Law in the University of Limerick.  The REPPP project is a strategic research partnership between UL and my Department. The REPPP originally produced the &ldquo;Greentown Report&rdquo;, which studied the influence of criminal networks on children in Ireland, and was published in December 2016.</p>  <p>  The Report identifies crime networks as a separate and plausible risk factor underlying criminal offending by certain children. It outlines how the influence of criminal networks increases the level of offending by a small number of children and entraps them in offending situations.</p>  <p>  The Report recommended the design of a programme to include interventions with children and their families to help them withstand the influence of criminal networks. The REPPP project team implemented a bespoke design process to produce a model for an Irish evidence-informed intervention programme. This new Greentown Programme has been designed with the input of leading international expertise on crime and criminal networks, together with Irish scientific, policy and practice expertise in child protection and welfare, drugs and community development.</p>  <p>  Pilot applications of the Programme, developed by the REPPP, commenced in two locations in 2020 and will run for three years. The learning from these pilots will then be incorporated into mainstream Youth Diversion Project (YDP) practice. This specially designed intervention programme was developed with international expert advice, to tackle coercive control of children by criminal groups which entraps them in offending situations. Funds are already available for the initial pilots from the Dormant Accounts Funds, with a total of &euro;4.2m allocated over three years.</p>  <p>  The Programme is one of a number of policy approaches currently being undertaken to address the issues raised by the Deputy. Other initiatives include the Local Community Safety Partnerships, the Youth Justice Strategy, the Drogheda Implementation Plan and the socio-economic and community plan for Darndale and the surrounding areas in Dublin 17, which my Department is committed to supporting. While each of these initiatives is tailored to the specific challenges which they are designed to address, each is in line with the principles of my Department's Community Safety policy and rooted in a similar philosophy - that tackling community safety concerns requires a holistic, whole of society approach. </p></reply>

Section 108 makes provision for an order for electronic monitoring in the context of a restriction of movement condition applying to the granting of temporary release.  </p>  <p>  In addition, the Government recently approved my proposal to publish the Sex Offenders (Amendment) Bill 2021, which has since passed second stage in the D&aacute;il. I expect it will court change in the coming weeks. </p>  <p>  As drafted, this bill includes provision for a court to order an electronic monitoring device for a convicted sex offender who is subject to a post-release supervision order, or a sex offender order, that includes a condition restricting the offender's movement, post release. </p>  <p>  The operational details of how this will work will have to be carefully developed and take account of the costs, value for money, in the context of the technology&rsquo;s relatively limited effectiveness, as well as the Council of Europe Guidelines. </p>  <p>  The aim is to provide our courts with a range of appropriate tools and interventions to monitor and reduce the risks posed by sex offenders, to facilitate rehabilitation and to protect the public. </p>  <p>  There is some evidence that electronic monitoring can be effective in respect of sex offenders when used for a short duration in tandem with other interventions, such as probation supervision and this is what I am proposing in the Bill. </p>  <p>  As a technology, it has advanced over the years, but not all of its limitations have yet been overcome and I envisage therefore that a pilot scheme will be introduced to explore its costs and benefits once the legislation is in place.

Organised criminal activity, including drug dealing, represents a serious threat to community safety. </p><p>The continued disruption of the supply of all illicit drugs remains a priority for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the other State agencies tasked with responsibilities in this regard. A concerted effort has been made over the past two years to ensure that the detection and prevention of these types of criminal activity have not been adversely affected by the unprecedented demands placed on policing services by the vital enforcement of public health restrictions. </p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the management and administration of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including Garda operations aimed at preventing and countering criminal activity, and the enforcement of legislation pertaining to illegal drugs. As Minister, I have no direct role in these matters.</p><p>I am advised by the Garda authorities that Operation Cop&oacute;g commenced in March 2021 as a joint operation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Limerick City &amp;amp; County Council  to disrupt and target the sale and supply of controlled drugs in the St Mary&rsquo;s Park area of Limerick city. </p><p>Additional resources were allocated to the Community Policing Unit in Mayorstone and dedicated solely to the St Mary&rsquo;s Park area to provide a high visibility policing presence and reassurance to the community.  These Community Policing members work closely with the Divisional Drugs Unit at Henry Street Garda Station, to target individuals who are involved in the sale and supply of controlled drugs, with a particular focus on the sale of crack cocaine. Operation Cop&oacute;g is supported by the Regional Dog Unit, District Crime units, Armed Support Unit and Regular Units.</p><p>I am informed by the Garda authorities that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na seized in excess of &euro;2.8 million of controlled drugs in the period January &ndash; November 2021, the latest period for which information is available, and cash to the value of &euro;331,740. In the same period in 2021, Garda&iacute; in Limerick executed warrants pursuant to Section 26 Misuse of Drugs Acts and seized drugs including Cocaine, Cannabis Herb, Cannabis Plants, Cannabis Resin, Heroin and Tablets.  </p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have provided the following information with reference to Operation Cop&oacute;g during the period of March 2021 - March 2022:  <table>    <tr>       <th>Activity</th>       <th>No.</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Searches of persons pursuant to Section 23 Misuse of Drugs Act</td>       <td>400</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Premises searched under warrant pursuant to Section 26 Misuse of Drugs Act</td>       <td>35</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cases where persons have been found in possession of controlled drugs (purpose of sale/ supply and personal use)</td>       <td>61</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Vehicles seized under Section 41 Road Traffic Act</td>       <td>49</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The following incidents also relate to Operation Cop&oacute;g:</p><p>- One incident of Violent Disorder was detected where three persons were arrested. Two of these people were subsequently charged on the direction of the Director of Public Prosecutions.</p><p>- Five persons were arrested in relation to recent significant drug seizures and questioned regarding their involvement in the sale/supply of controlled drugs in St. Mary&rsquo;s Park.</p><p>- Three cases of money laundering were detected where a quantity of cash was seized believed to be the proceeds of drug dealing.</p><p>I would add that Operation Cop&oacute;g is only one element of wider strategies to deal with organised criminal activity and drug supply in the Limerick Region. These strategies under Operation Tara and Operation Coronation, amongst others, aim to prevent the wholesale distribution of drugs and activities in the region by organised crime gangs.  </p><p>Garda Management in Limerick are focused on targeting drug dealing and anti-social behaviour in all parts of Limerick. The significant successes to date across all the strategies that are in place are having a significant impact on the activities of organised crime gangs and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is determined to continue to target this criminal activity and reduce the negative impact that illegal drugs have on so many lives and in our community.</p></reply>

As Minister, I have no role in these independent functions.</p>  <p>  I am assured, however, that Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of policing priorities and crime trends, to ensure their optimum use.

These pilots schemes have been set up in Longford, North Inner City Dublin and Waterford. The pilots will run for a period of two years, and learnings from the pilot LCSPs will inform the eventual rollout of the model to every local authority area.</p>  <p>  Each LCSP pilot consists of 30 members, including an independent chairperson. The remaining 29 members are divided in a 14/15 split in favour of non-public representatives. Non-public membership relates to those who are not members of public body agencies or service providers. This can include local residents, community representatives (including youth, older persons, minority and new community representatives), business representatives, education representatives, voluntary sector representatives etc.</p>  <p>  The specific membership composition of each individual partnership is flexible depending on the needs of the community and is outlined in the respective Terms of Reference of each Partnership. The Pilots meet on a regular basis with at least four meetings a year.</p>  <p>  Each pilot has also employed a Community Safety Coordinator who provides the day-to-day contact between the community and the partnership, runs projects within the community and generally acts as a focal point through which community concerns can be channelled. Due to the size and complexity of the Dublin pilot, Dublin also employs an Administrative Officer to support the Coordinator and Chairperson. Each pilot has had at least two formal meetings of the full Partnership. The Partnerships are all currently working to develop unique Local Community Safety Plans, and to that end, each partnership has also formed subgroups that are focused on bringing actions forward between full meetings and/or developing the Community Safety Plan.</p>  <p>  Each pilot is also subject to an ongoing independent evaluation which will last for the 24-month duration of the pilots. The overall aim of the evaluation is to provide actionable evidence to help inform the development of the LCSPs and their rollout across the country on completion of the pilot period, after the Policing, Security and Community Safety Bill is enacted. The evaluation is exploring implementation approaches and processes that appear to be effective across and within the pilot communities. </p>  <p>  Over time, the evaluation will assess how well the Local Community Safety Partnership pilots identified the priorities and concerns of their respective communities; how the LCSPs conducted their work; the engagement and relationships the LCSPs have had with the local communities; and the impact of the LCSP work on community safety. </p>  <p>  Findings from the evaluation process will inform future rollout of the LCSP model in every local authority area. The initial phase of fieldwork, from Q4 2021 to Q1 2022, is focused on reviewing processes and establishing a baseline for any outcomes of the work of the Partnership pilots over the next two years. </p>  <p>  Establishing a baseline is an important aspect of the evaluation as it ensures a solid understanding of the starting point against which to compare the data at the latter stages of the evaluation. A baseline report will be completed and submitted to the Department of Justice by end of Q2 of 2022. The first report on findings and lessons will be due in Q4 2022.</p></reply>

These include measures around crime prevention, youth services, drug addiction, education, infrastructure and community development.</p><p>The recommendations highlight the need for improved interagency cooperation in the administration and delivery of State services in Drogheda, as well as the need to provide additional resources and services in certain areas.</p><p>In July of last year, Minister Humphreys obtained Government approval for an Implementation Plan for the report. The Government also committed to a special focus on Drogheda, including Departments and State agencies prioritising necessary funding applications for projects related to the Drogheda Implementation Plan.</p><p>The Implementation Plan identifies the relevant stakeholders for each recommendation and outlines the next steps for engagement and delivery. The Plan will be a living document and will be reviewed by my Department each quarter, with progress reports produced twice yearly. This approach will facilitate ongoing engagement and consultation and my Department has just completed the first internal quarterly review. The first progress report of the Drogheda Implementation Plan is currently under development and will be published in Quarter 2 of this year.</p><p>The most important aspect is at local level where the Drogheda Implementation Board is the core driver and co-ordinator of the activities outlined in the plan and my Department leads national oversight to ensure strategic direction, action planning and the delivery of the Drogheda Implementation Plan.  The first meeting of the Drogheda Implementation Board took place on 13 October 2021. I met with the board on 4 November and I look forward to seeing the further progress of the Implementation Plan in the coming months but there have already been some very positive actions arising from the plan. The Department of Education has provided supports to the three schools identified in the report and my own Department has provided further funding to the Red Door Project to ensure the continued provision of their important services.  Funding has also been committed to the Moneymore Consortium to support their planning work for the proposed development of a community hub facility and to the Moneymore Childcare Centre to ensure the continuation of the essential meal service they provide to children.  My Department has also secured a further &euro;250,000 in Dormant Accounts Funding for continued implementation of targeted crime prevention and harm-reduction measures in Drogheda in 2022.</p></reply>

I am pleased to note that very significant progress has already been made in that regard and only Limerick and Portlaoise Prison continue to have some cells without in-cell sanitation.  All newly constructed prison accommodation has in-cell sanitation and shower facilities.</p>  <p>  A major refurbishment of Mountjoy Prison was completed in 2014 which included the provision of in cell sanitation and upgrade of the cellular accommodation.  In 2016 a new purpose designed modern prison opened in Cork replacing the old prison facility.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be glad to know that a major construction project is currently nearing completion at Limerick Prison which will provide new accommodation for male and female prisoners. The completion of this project will replace accommodation in the old jail, some of which dates from its opening in 1821, as well as ending the practice referred to as &lsquo;slopping out&rsquo; at Limerick Prison. I understand the new accommodation will be operational towards the end of this year and will include rehabilitation and support facilities. </p>  <p>  When all of the works are completed in Limerick, the only area without in-cell sanitation will be the E Block of Portlaoise Prison.  This currently accommodates 19 people, representing approximately 0.5 % of the prison population.  To address this final element, the Irish Prison Service is conducting exploratory work to assess the feasibility of installing in-cell sanitation at that block.  Preliminary engineering surveys have been completed which is a necessary prerequisite to assess how best the project can be undertaken in a cost effective manner cognisant of the age, condition and fabric of the building. I am advised that a contract has been awarded for the construction of a sample cell at E block and the outcome of this project and future operational requirements will help inform next steps in this regard.  I hope to progress this necessary work as soon as possible.  </p></reply>

This internationally recognised initiative is being led by the REPPP Project (Research Evidence into Policy, Programmes and Practice) at the School of Law in the University of Limerick (UL).  The REPPP project is a strategic research partnership between UL and my Department. The REPPP originally produced the Greentown Report, which studied the influence of criminal networks on children in Ireland, and was published in December 2016.</p>  <p>  The report identifies crime networks as a separate and plausible risk factor underlying criminal offending by certain children. It outlines how the influence of criminal networks increases the level of offending by a small number of children and entraps them in offending situations.</p>  <p>  The report recommended the design of a programme to include interventions with children and their families to help them withstand the influence of criminal networks. The REPPP project team implemented a bespoke design process to produce a model for an Irish evidence-informed intervention programme. This new Greentown Programme has been designed with the input of leading international expertise on crime and criminal networks, together with Irish scientific, policy and practice expertise in child protection and welfare, drugs and community development.</p>  <p>  Trial site applications of the Greentown Programme, developed by the REPPP, commenced in two locations in late 2020 and will run for three years. Confidentiality and security of the persons and families concerned are paramount for the success of the programme and therefore the location of the trial sites cannot be disclosed. The number of vulnerable families that the programme is assisting at any given time is around 25, which equates to approximately 40 young people and family members being directly impacted. The programme is also working with other community bodies in the trial sites and has assisted, for example, in setting up community collaborations in the area of self-development courses.</p>  <p>  The learning from the trial sites will be incorporated into mainstream Youth Diversion Projects (YDP) practice as well as other community programmes. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, I can inform the Deputy that funds are already secured for the initial trial sites from the Dormant Accounts Funds, with a total of &euro;4.2m allocated over three years.</p></reply>

It will set an overall goal of zero tolerance in our society for domestic violence.</p><p>Last month I briefed those working in the sector on the progress of the strategy as part of that ongoing consultation, and a wider public consultation run by my Department recently concluded.</p><p>I will finalise the strategy for submission to government in light of submissions received in this final consultative phase.</p><p>The strategy and aims will be high level in tone and content.

It recommended an approach to address this with immediate, medium and long term actions required and it provides a list of priority areas where additional services would address the most immediate need.</p><p>I fully acknowledge the need to dramatically increase the provision of refuge spaces across the country and it is my intention to bring us to a situation where there is a refuge space for everyone who needs one </p><p>I have established a high level Inter-Departmental Group to review the current system for the provision of refuge spaces and to identify changes that can be made to the system to deliver additional spaces in the shortest timeframe possible.</p><p>In addition to the locations identified by Tusla, the Group will be engaging with local authorities, Government Departments and State agencies to look at sourcing refuge provision in a number of other areas.</p><p>My intention is that the timelines for delivery of these places, as well as further targets for nationwide delivery of refuge accommodation, will be outlined in the third national strategy with further detail contained in the accompanying action plan. </p></reply>

It removed those who offer their services as a prostitute from the existing offences of soliciting for the purpose of prostitution and criminalised the purchase of sex.</p>  <p>  A key purpose for the 2017 Sexual Offences Act was to provide additional protection to persons involved in prostitution, especially vulnerable persons and victims of human trafficking. It allows those engaged in prostitution to provide information to Garda&iacute;, for instance if they were subjected to violence by clients, without fear of prosecution for selling sexual services.</p>  <p>  Last year An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na formally established the Organised Prostitution Unit which is attached to the Garda National Protective Services Bureau. The establishment of this specialised unit reinforces the service's commitment to protecting vulnerable persons including victims of human trafficking involved in prostitution here. At the time of its launch last year An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na specifically recognised that a significant number of serious attacks on individuals involved in prostitution go unreported and they encouraged them to report all such attacks, so they can be investigated and the perpetrators brought to justice.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to be aware that there is now a Divisional Protective Services Unit (DPSU) established in every Garda division across the country. This ensures that when vulnerable victims of crimes, such as domestic abuse and sexual violence, present to Garda&iacute; they are met with a consistently high standard of specialist, sensitive, professional and expert assistance.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that any victim of a serious assault who comes forward to report it will treated with respect and dignity. I reiterate the call by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for anyone was a victim of an assault, or who might become a victim in the future, to please come forward and report it regardless of the circumstances in which the assault occurred. It will be taken seriously and the person reporting the assault will be treated sensitively and respectfully.</p>  <p>  It may also interest the Deputy to know that officials in my Department are also working on a legislative amendment to expunge previous convictions for &lsquo;sale of sex&rsquo;, or prostitution offences. This is a significant step in recognising and responding to the needs of victims of sex trafficking, and those forced to provide sexual services, which will include people trafficked into Ireland for that purpose.</p>  <p>  Separately, last year the Government approved plans to revise the National Referral Mechanism (NRM) to make it easier for victims of human trafficking to come forward, be identified, and facilitate their access to advice, accommodation and support. Officials in my are currently drafting the heads of a bill and I expect to be in position to publish the general scheme of the Bill shortly, with legislation to be enacted later this year.</p>  <p>  Finally, I would point out that if the organisation referred to by the Deputy feels the service and treatment they received from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na falls below what is expected, it is of course open to them to contact the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission (GSOC). GSOC is the independent body charged with receiving complaints from the public concerning members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Contact can be made with GSOC at their offices at: 150 Upper Abbey Street, Dublin 1 and by telephone on Lo-Call Tel: 0818 600 800.</p></reply>

Government Departments and services are working together to implement Ireland's commitments under the EU Temporary Protection Directive (2001/55/EC), which has been activated for the first time to grant temporary protection to displaced persons from Ukraine.</p><p>The Directive has legal effect under Section 60 of the International Protection Act 2015.</p><p>Those eligible for Temporary Protection (granted initially for one year, but renewable) will have immediate access to the labour market, social welfare, accommodation and other State supports as necessary. A whole-of-Government response is being mobilised to implement the practical arrangements to give effect to these commitments. </p><p>So far, approximately 85 per cent of Ukrainians who have entered the State have been welcomed at Dublin Airport. Beneficiaries are being provided with their permission letter on arrival at the airport in the 'one-stop-shop' established by my Department for that purpose, to ensure early access to all necessary supports. Approximately 7,300 temporary protection permissions have already been issued by my Department since the activation of the EU Directive on 4 March. </p><p>Arrangements have also now been put in place to provide permission letters to those who arrived at Dublin Airport prior to 9 March (when permission letters started to issue) and to those who have arrived at other ports of entry to the State.</p><p>For people who are staying in State provided accommodation, staff from my Department are visiting these accommodation locations and will provide permission letters there.</p><p>Alternatively, permission letters can be obtained by visiting the Ukraine Support Centre in Cork Street, Dublin 8. The centre is open Monday to Friday from 9.15am to 5.00pm. On Saturdays, the centre is open from 9.15am to 3.00pm. There, people can also receive assistance from the Department of Social Protection to obtain PPSN numbers, social welfare income supports, and to receive referrals to other State services. </p><p>Arrangements are also being put in place that will allow people to obtain their permission letters from the Ukraine Support Centres in Hanover Street in Cork City and in Limerick.

This includes the distribution and stationing of Garda members throughout the State. </p>  <p>  I am assured that Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of policing priorities and crime trends, to ensure their optimum use. I understand that it is a matter for the Divisional Chief Superintendent to determine the optimum distribution of duties among the personnel available to them, having regard to the profile of each area within the Division and its specific needs.</p>  <p>  The budget provided by Government to the Garda Commissioner continues to increase to unprecedented levels, with an allocation in excess of &euro;2 billion for 2022, which includes funding for the recruitment of up to 800 additional Garda trainees and up to 400 Garda staff. This significant investment demonstrates the Government's commitment to increasing the Garda workforce to enable the organisation to keep our communities safe, including in Cork City and County, and to preventing crime in all its forms. </p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that as of 28 February,  the latest date for which figures are available, there are 733 Garda members assigned to Garda Stations in Cork City, an increase of 12.6% per cent since the end of 2015, when there were 651 Garda&iacute; assigned to the Cork City Division. In addition, as of 28 February, there are 122 Garda staff supporting the members in Cork City, an increase of 106.7% since the end of 2015 when there were 59 Garda staff in the Division. </p>  <p>  I am further advised that, as of 28 February, 8 Probationer Garda&iacute; have been assigned to the Cork City Division in 2022. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that a Garda recruitment campaign closed earlier this month and I am advised that there was a strong interest, with over 10,000 applications received.

Key among these recommendations is the introduction of legislation for the establishment of a dedicated and integrated Family Court within existing court structures.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to enact a Family Court Bill to create a new dedicated Family Court within the existing court structure and provide for court procedures that support a faster and less adversarial resolution of disputes in specialised centres. In September 2020, Government approved my proposal for the drafting of a Family Court Bill along the lines of the General Scheme, which has been published. Work is ongoing on the drafting of the Bill, with a view to its publication as soon as possible in 2022.</p>  <p>  My Department is in the process of finalising a Family Justice Strategy, which will set out a high-level vision and key medium and longer-term objectives for the development of a national family justice system in parallel with the establishment of a dedicated Family Court structure as envisaged by the forthcoming Family Court Bill. </p>  <p>  To develop the new strategy, a Family Justice Oversight Group was established by my Department. The Group comprises the key State actors in this space, namely the Department of Justice, Courts Service, Judiciary, Legal Aid Board, the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  To assist its work, this Group has engaged in a phased consultation process where relevant stakeholders, the public, children and young people who engage with the family justice system gave their views on how a modernised family justice system should look. As part of the consultation process, two advisory groups have also been established comprising a subset of (1) NGOs and (2) practitioners and academics to further engage on issues emerging from the initial consultation phases.</p>  <p>  A number of issues are being considered for inclusion in the emergent Family Justice Strategy, including: how the courts work; the availability of and access to support services; and the potential use of less adversarial approaches to the resolution of disputes, where possible and appropriate; information dissemination and awareness raising; and oversight of the implementation of any proposed reforms. </p>  <p>  Another important area being considered by the Group is additional training for those working within the family justice system that would benefit all those who engage with the system. It is intended that the Family Court Bill will provide that specialist knowledge and ongoing professional training in the area of family law would be required for a judge to be appointed as a Family Court judge. </p>  <p>  My Department has also engaged academic experts to conduct research for the purposes of a review of the operation of the provisions of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 relating to guardianship of children whose parents are not married or in a civil partnership. I expect that this review will be completed  and published later this year.</p>  <p>  Among other recommendations made by the Committee was that consideration be given to whether laws should be amended to take into account situations where one parent is wrongfully influencing their child or children against the other parent, thereby creating unfair and unwarranted alienation that can be destructive and life lasting.  In that regard and to better inform further discussion on parental alienation, my Department arranged for research to be carried out.</p>  <p>  The aims of the research included to:</p>  <p>  - Identify the various definitions and characteristics of parental alienation being used internationally.</p>  <p>  - Investigate what is known about the prevalence of this issue (in Ireland or internationally) through examination of the literature.</p>  <p>  - Identify and outline the various approaches and responses being taken in other jurisdictions to deal with the issue of parental alienation (legislative and otherwise).</p>  <p>  - Describe, outline and evaluate any studies which have examined the effectiveness of these various international approaches and assess the relevance of these studies to the Irish context.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to say that a draft report was received by my Department at the end of November and is now being reviewed. It is also my intention to commence a public consultation on the topic in the coming weeks. Both the research and consultation will, I expect, create a deeper understanding of the issue, and inform my Department&rsquo;s consideration of policy and law in this area.</p>  <p>  The best interests of the child will of course be paramount in any considerations.</p></reply>

However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has advised me of the following.</p>  <p>  Sheriffs (or County Registrars acting as Sheriffs) are officers of the Court and are independent in the exercise of their functions and duties under statute and rules of court.  They are responsible to the Court for the enforcement of Court Orders.   Procedures governing the execution of Court Orders are set out in the Enforcement of Court Orders Acts, 1926 to 1940 and the Rules of Court made thereunder.</p>  <p>  I am advised by the Courts Service that the work of Under Sheriffs was curtailed by the pandemic with restrictions on non-essential travel limiting their ability to operate normally.  As much of their work involves site visits and meetings with clients, such journeys posed an increased health and safety risk to them and their staff.   </p>  <p>  With the lifting of restrictions, Under Sheriff operations have begun to return to normal with most Under Sheriffs now operating as before the pandemic.  That said, Under Sheriffs and the Courts Service remain conscious that Covid-19 infection numbers remain elevated, and so continue to adhere to public health guidelines to ensure all persons involved are not exposed to unnecessary risk of contracting this illness.</p></reply>

A particular focus of the design of the prison was to ensure that the women accommodated there had access to a regime that mirrored, as much as possible, living in ordinary accommodation and thus supported the women's reintegration to society, which is a key objective.</p>  <p>  The issue raised by the Deputy was considered in the context of the Probation Service/Irish Prison Service joint Women Strategy 2014-2016, which sought to improve the outcomes for women offenders.  A joint working group between the two agencies recommended that the most practical and cost effective way to address the needs identified was to develop a step-down facility for women. In this regard, the Probation Service and Prison Service worked collaboratively towards the identification of a suitable venue for a women&rsquo;s step down unit in Dublin, via a procurement process run by the Office of Government Procurement.</p>  <p>  The Outlook Programme, which opened on 10 May 2019, now provides this step-down facility. The vision of the Programme is to promote the rehabilitation and re-integration of women leaving prison and those who have accommodation needs requiring support in the community. This is achieved through the provision of a wrap- around service that supports, independent living skills, training and employment opportunities and pro-social behaviour in order to reduce risk of  re-offending</p>  <p>  The Programme which is run in joint partnership with the Probation Service and managed by Focus Ireland, supports women serving sentences of imprisonment who pose a low risk to society to gradually re-integrate into the community.  </p>  <p>  Since it&rsquo;s opening on 10 May 2019, 34 women have accessed the Outlook Programme, this includes 30 women who accessed the Programme directly from the Dochas Centre, as well as 4 community based referrals, made by the Probation Service. The Outlook Programme has capacity for 10 women.  While residing at the Outlook Programme, women are required to comply with strict Temporary Release conditions and if they fail to comply with same, they risk being returned to custody. </p>  <p>  In addition, as the Deputy will be aware, the Prison Service is currently in the process of a major redevelopment of Limerick Prison which includes the construction of a new prison facility for women prisoners. </p>  <p>  The new accommodation block for women offenders in Limerick which will replace the use of the female wing at that prison. The design of the new facility is based on the principle of rehabilitation and normalisation reflecting contemporary design standards.  A mix of accommodation units are being provided based around an external courtyard setting. The development will provide accommodation for 50 women prisoners and is scheduled for completion in late 2022, subject to no further delays as a result of the Covid pandemic. When open, this new facility will represent a complete change in the standard of accommodation and rehabilitative supports for women prisoners.</p></reply>

The Bill will provide for a key principle from the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland -  that preventing crime and harm and making our communities safer does not rest with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and my Department alone. Rather, it will be best achieved as a whole-of-government responsibility with Departments and agencies responsible for health and social services, education authorities and local authorities, the Garda&iacute; and the wider community working together.</p>  <p>  The new Bill will achieve this by establishing innovative Local Community Safety Partnerships to develop local safety plans, tailored to the priorities and needs identified by communities themselves. The Local Community Safety Partnerships will build upon and replace the existing Joint Policing Committees and will provide a forum for State agencies and local community representatives to work together to act on community concerns.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that in November 2020, I announced the establishment of three new Local Community Safety Partnerships on a pilot basis in North Inner City Dublin, Waterford and Longford. The locations of the pilots, which will run for 24 months, were chosen based on a number of factors including population density, crime rates and deprivation. An independent Chairperson has been appointed to chair each Partnership pilot.</p>  <p>  Each Partnership will devise and oversee a Local Community Safety Plan, which will be informed by the community itself. Each LCSP pilot consists of 30 members including an independent chairperson. The remaining 29 members are divided in a 14/15 split in favour of non-public representatives. </p>  <p>  Non-public membership relate to those who are not members of public body agencies or service providers. This can include local residents, community representatives (including youth, older persons, minority and new community representatives), business representatives, education representatives, voluntary sector representatives etc. The specific membership composition of each individual partnership is flexible depending on the needs of the particular local community and is outlined in the individual Terms of Reference of each Partnership. The Partnerships meet on a regular basis with at least four meetings a year.</p>  <p>  To date, each of the three pilot LCSPs in Longford, North Inner City Dublin and Waterford has a complete membership including an independent Chair. Each pilot has also employed a Community Safety Coordinator who provides the day-to-day contact between the community and the partnership, runs projects within the community and generally act as a focal point through which community concerns can be channelled.</p>  <p>  As the pilots progress, they will be carefully evaluated and any necessary changes made to ensure the Partnerships work as effectively as possible for the communities involved. The pilots will inform the further development of the Policing, Security and Community Safety Bill, which will facilitate the rollout of Local Community Safety Partnerships in every local authority area.</p>  <p>  Each pilot is also subject to an ongoing independent evaluation which will last for the 24-month duration of the pilots. The overall aim of the evaluation is to provide actionable evidence to help inform the development of the LCSPs and their rollout across the country on completion of the pilot period, after the Policing, Security and Community Safety Bill is enacted.</p>  <p>  The evaluation is exploring implementation approaches and processes that appear to be effective across the pilot communities. Over time, it will assess how well the LCSP pilots identified the priorities and concerns of their respective communities; how the LCSPs conducted their work; the engagement and relationships the LCSPs had with local communities; and the impact of the LCSP work on community safety. </p>  <p>  Findings from the evaluation process will inform future rollout of the LCSP model in every local authority area. The initial phase of fieldwork (Q4 2021 &ndash; Q1 2022) is focused on reviewing processes and establishing baseline data. A baseline report will be completed and submitted to my Department in Q2 of 2022. The first report on findings and lessons will be due in Q4 2022.</p>  <p>  A call for funding proposals for the new Community Safety Innovation Fund will issue shortly seeking applications for community safety projects and similar initiatives from bodies involved in community safety, such as the new Local Community Safety Partnerships and the Drogheda Implementation Board, as well as similar entities nationwide. Applications will be assessed against stated criteria outlined in the call for proposals to ensure funding is allocated to encourage the development of innovative ways in which to improve community safety. These criteria for allocating funding are now finalised, with the fund due to be launched in the coming weeks.  The fund will have an initial outlay in 2022 of &euro;2m, which is expected to grow in the coming years.</p></reply>

This significant investment demonstrates the Government's commitment to increasing the Garda workforce to enable the organisation to keep our communities safe. To this end, a Garda recruitment campaign closed earlier this month and I am advised that there was a strong interest, with over 10,000 applications received.</p>  <p>  Figures under the 'Theft/taking of vehicle and related' category of crime data, published at quarterly intervals by the CSO at Garda divisional level, illustrate that a 10 year low annual volume was reported nationwide during 2020 and 2021. Subsequently, there has been a return to pre-COVID levels of such crimes in many areas nationwide during 2022, with a comparable number of incidents to 2019, including in the Cork City Division.</p>  <p>  The Garda Commissioner is responsible for the organisation's approaches to preventing and investigating criminal activity.  I am advised by the Garda authorities that local Garda management in Cork have initiated Operation Joyrider to combat incidences of unauthorised taking of vehicles and joyriding in Cork City Division.  I am informed that this operation utilises location-specific patrols, intelligence-led operations, searches and arrests to combat known individuals involved in such crimes. </p>  <p>  I am further advised that there is cooperation between plain clothes and uniform members to combat the recent escalation in crimes which involves conducting both high visibility and covert proactive patrols. Furthermore I am informed that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Analysis Service is assisting with the monitoring of crime trends and pinpointing locations of crimes, times of incidents, and locations of recovered vehicles, to optimize the use of resources to tackle such crimes. </p>  <p>  In addition, I understand that the Crime Prevention Officer for Cork City Division is liaising with local media to promote preventative measures around the issue of car thefts, including messaging around a &lsquo;Park Smart - Secure your Vehicle&rsquo; information campaign.</p></reply>

These pilots schemes have been set up in Longford, North Inner City Dublin and Waterford. The pilots will run for a period of two years, and learnings from the pilot LCSPs will inform the eventual rollout of the model to every local authority area.</p>  <p>  The Community Safety Partnerships will be rolled out nationally following enactment of the Policing, Security and Community Safety Bill, completion of the three pilots and related monitoring and evaluation processes. I made a commitment to utilise a robust evaluation from the outset of this process. The overall aim of the evaluation is to provide actionable evidence to help inform the development of the LCSPs and their rollout across the country.</p>  <p>  Each LCSP pilot consists of 30 members including an independent chairperson. The remaining 29 members are divided in a 14/15 split in favour of non-public representatives. Non-public membership relates to those who are not members of public body agencies or service providers. This can include local residents, community representatives, including youth, older persons, minority and new community representatives; business representatives, education representatives, voluntary sector representatives etc. </p>  <p>  The specific membership composition of each individual partnership is flexible depending on the needs of the community and is outlined in the individual Terms of Reference of each Partnership. The Pilots meet on a regular basis with at least four meetings a year. </p>  <p>  To date, each of the three pilot LCSPs in Longford, Dublin North Inner City and Waterford has a complete membership including an independent Chair. Each pilot has also employed a Community Safety Coordinator who provides the day to day contact between the community and the partnership, runs projects within the community and generally acts as a focal point through which community concerns can be channelled. Due to the size and complexity of the Dublin pilot, Dublin also employs an Administrative Officer to support the Coordinator and Chairperson.</p>  <p>  Each pilot has had at least two formal meetings of the full Partnership and the Partnerships are all currently working to develop unique Local Community Safety Plans. Each partnership has also formed subgroups that are focussed on bringing actions forward between full meetings and/or developing the Community Safety Plan. </p>  <p>  Each pilot is also subject to an ongoing independent evaluation  which will last for the 24-month duration of the pilots. The overall aim of the evaluation is to provide actionable evidence to help inform the development of the LCSPs and their rollout across the country on completion of the pilot period, after the Policing, Security and Community Safety Bill is enacted. </p>  <p>  The evaluation is exploring implementation approaches and processes that appear to be effective across and within the pilot communities. It will, over time, assess how well the Local Community Safety Partnership pilots identified the priorities and concerns of their respective communities; how the LCSPs conducted their work; the engagement and relationships the LCSPs had with the local communities; and the impact of the LCSP work on community safety. </p>  <p>  Findings from the evaluation process will inform future rollout of the LCSP model in every local authority area.  The initial phase of fieldwork, between Q4 2021 &ndash; Q1 2022, is focused on reviewing processes and establishing a baseline for any outcomes of the LCSPs work over the next two years. </p>  <p>  Establishing a baseline is an important aspect of the evaluation, it ensures a solid understanding of the starting point against which to compare the data at the latter stages of the evaluation. A baseline report will be completed and submitted to my Department during Q2 of 2022. The first report on findings and lessons will be due in Q4 2022.</p></reply>

However, since April 2001, non-EEA students with an immigration Stamp 2 permission, and who are enrolled on courses with education providers listed on the Interim List of Eligible Programmes (ILEP) including English language courses, have been afforded the opportunity to work.</p>  <p>  This allows them to take up casual employment to supplement their income while studying in Ireland. During term time, non-EEA students can work up to 20 hours per week and during normal college holiday periods they can work on a full time basis up to 40 hours per week.</p>  <p>  The Stamp 2 permission will typically expire shortly after the conclusion of the course. The person will then need to leave the State or seek a change of permission, if they met the criteria.</p>  <p>  Further information is available on my Department's website at: </p>  <p>  www.irishimmigration.ie/registering-your-immigration-permission/changing-your-immigration-permission/.</p>  <p>  For those students who have Graduated with a level 8 or above on the National Framework of Qualifications Framework (NFQ)  a Stamp 1G may be provided in order to assist students who are making genuine efforts to access suitable graduate level employment for example attending job interviews or signing up with graduate employment agencies.</p>  <p>  A Stamp 1G indicates that a person has permission to look for employment in the State under the Third Level Graduate Programme. When an applicant has completed their studies in Ireland and gained an award at Level 8 on the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ) or above, that person may qualify for a Stamp 1G for 12 months. Where an individual receives an award at Level 9 NFQ, they may qualify for a Stamp 1G for up to 24 months subject to the overall limit of 8 years on student conditions that applies. Graduates at level 9 NFQ or above who qualify for a Stamp 1G permission will be granted the permission for 12 months initially.</p>  <p>  Following the period on the Stamp 1G it is open to the Graduate and any prospective employer to make an application to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment for an employment permit. If the application is successful, they can register on a Stamp 1 immigration permission. </p>  <p>  Thereafter, it is open to any person who has been legally resident in Ireland for a minimum of 60 months (five years)  to make an application for Long Term Residency or Naturalisation, subject to meeting the required criteria.

The Deputy will agree that we are all immensely grateful to all our frontline workers for their outstanding dedication to serving the public, and for the important role that they play in our society, notably their sustained commitment throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.    </p>  <p>  It is imperative that frontline workers are protected in carrying out their work and that the law reflects and responds to the situations in which they find themselves.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, it would not be appropriate for me to detail the operational measures that the Garda authorities have taken or would take in these situations. However, I can assure the Deputy that whatever protective and detection measures are deemed appropriate by the Garda authorities will certainly be taken.</p>  <p>  I should also say that while the criminal law in this area is being kept under ongoing review, there are a range of robust legislative provisions available to the Garda authorities in circumstances where threats or assaults are made against Garda&iacute;.</p>  <p>  Any assault causing harm on any person is an offence under section 3 of the Non&ndash;Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997.  A person convicted of such an offence would be liable on summary conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to a maximum fine of &euro;2,500 or both, or on conviction on indictment, to a fine, or to imprisonment, for a term not exceeding 5 years or both.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, an assault on a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, a prison officer, a member of the fire brigade, ambulance personnel, or a member of the Defence Forces would constitute an offence under section 19 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994.  A person convicted of such an offence would be liable on summary conviction to a maximum fine of &euro;5,000, or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months, or both.  A person convicted of such an offence on indictment would be liable to a fine, or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 7 years, or both.</p>  <p>  The investigation of any such offences under these Acts are, of course, a policing matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. I would encourage anyone with information relating to the alleged or possible commitment of these offences to report this information to their local/nearest Garda station.</p></reply>

I note the Deputy's interest in this report, and I understand the report was commissioned by Dublin City Council following a request by the Deputy when he was the Lord Mayor at the time.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the Council asked for practical and achievable recommendations regarding a number of significant concerns about drugs and criminality raised by the local community and local agencies in recent years.</p><p>As the Deputy will already be aware, the Department of Health leads on Government policy in the area of drugs, and this policy is guided by the national drugs and alcohol strategy, &quot;Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery - a health-led response to drug and alcohol use in Ireland 2017-2025&quot;. This strategy represents a whole-of-Government response to drug and alcohol use in Ireland. The implementation of the strategy is led by my colleague, the Minister for Health, however, the strategy includes actions for all stakeholders, including my Department and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, many of the themes and issues outlined in the &lsquo;<i>Ballymun - a Brighter Future</i>&rsquo; report are reflected in the objectives of the Youth Justice Strategy 2021-2027, which I published with Minister McEntee in April 2021. These include:</p><p>- the principle of diversion of young people away from anti-social and criminal behaviour; </p><p>- developing supports centred on the need of the child/young person, which take account of issues such as trauma; </p><p>- supporting young people in education and considering alternative approaches where appropriate; </p><p>- employing innovative approaches to help break cycles of offending, including:</p><p>imulti-systemic therapy which is used in the Bail Supervision Scheme, currently expanding from its initial pilot area in Dublin to Cork and Limerick; and</p><p>ii  a specialised approach to combat coercive control by criminal groups of young people &ndash; the Greentown programme which is currently being piloted in two locations provides an evidence-based intervention programme designed with the assistance of Irish and international experts.</p><p>Both the Bail Supervision Scheme and the Greentown approach have been recognised internationally as cutting edge approaches to addressing problematic youth offending.</p><p>A key priority in the Youth Justice Strategy is the further expansion and intensification of supports provided by Youth Diversion Projects (YDPs), of which there are 105 nationwide. As the Deputy will be aware, Crosscare&rsquo;s Ballymun Youth Block (BYB) is a well-established YDP in the Ballymun area.</p><p>Budget 2022 includes significant additional funding to support initiatives under the Youth Justice Strategy - almost &euro;6.7 million, representing an increase of one third in support for youth justice services. This funding provides the resources to kick-start delivery of key objectives in the Youth Justice Strategy and, in particular, the programme to expand and deepen the range of supports made available through local YDP services.</p></reply>

This is why it remains a priority for my Department to ensure that community groups continue to be supported in developing their local CCTV schemes, whilst balancing this with proportionate oversight of important data protection statutory considerations.</p>  <p>  Since 2017, my Department has administered a grant aid scheme, supporting groups wishing to establish a community-based CCTV system in their area. Eligible groups, including community groups and local authorities nationwide, can apply for grant aid of up to 60% of the total capital cost of a proposed CCTV system, up to a maximum total of &euro;40,000. </p>  <p>  The CCTV grant scheme was extended in 2019 to cover not only new CCTV systems but to also provide funding for the extension or upgrade of existing CCTV systems, which are incomplete or obsolete. Applicants may now also seek a once-off grant of up to &euro;5,000 for minor maintenance costs. Support and assistance for those running CCTV schemes is available by contacting my Department at a dedicated email address which is available on my Department's website.</p>  <p>  To date, a total of 35 locations have been approved under the community-based CCTV scheme, with a total of almost &euro;950,000 committed to these projects.</p>  <p>  Justice Plan 2022, which I published this week, commits to the publication of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Digital Recording) Bill, which relates to Garda powers to use modern digital technology including body worn cameras, ANPR and CCTV, with a view to enactment by the Oireachtas.  The bill will also provide statutory underpinning for recording, which will include CCTV authorised in local communities by the Garda Commissioner. As part of the proposed bill, it is intended to repeal Section 38 of the 2005 Garda Act and to replace it with new CCTV provisions.</p>  <p>  I secured government agreement for the General Scheme of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Digital Recording) Bill on 29 April 2021. The General Scheme was sent to the Office of Parliamentary Counsel for formal drafting, and drafting is continuing. It is my intention to publish the bill in the second quarter of 2022 with a view to its passage through the Oireachtas later this year.</p>  <p>  Community-based CCTV is currently governed by Section 38(3)(c) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (CCTV) Order 2006 (SI 289 of 2006). This legal framework requires that any proposed community CCTV scheme must:</p>  <p>  - be approved by the local Joint Policing Committee; </p>  <p>  - have the prior support of the relevant local authority, which must also act as data controller; and </p>  <p>  - have the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner.</p>  <p>  This is the legal basis for all community CCTV schemes, regardless of how they are funded.  These key legal requirements have not changed since 2006.</p></reply>

This ensures that vulnerable victims of crimes, such as domestic abuse and sexual violence, presenting to Garda&iacute; are met with a consistently high standard of specialist, sensitive, professional and expert assistance. </p><p>This specialisation will ensure that when victims of domestic and sexual violence present to Garda&iacute;, at perhaps their most vulnerable moment, they are met with professional and expert assistance.</p><p>Under Budget 2022, an additional &euro;1m is being provided to AGS to refurbish and upgrade the Divisional Protective Service Units. This commitment will allow us to better support and protect vulnerable victims.</p><p>In addition, the Divisional Victim Service Offices (DVSO) and front line Garda&iacute; are also resources available to respond to domestic violence and support victims.</p><p>To be of assistance to the Deputy I contacted the Garda authorities to seek information on matters related to domestic violence training for the Service, both for those officers attached to DPSUs and to members generally. I am informed that significant investment in training for addressing instances of domestic violence and supporting victims has, and is, being made.</p><p>I am advised that in 2021, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na devised mandatory online training for its personnel in the area of Domestic Abuse. This is a comprehensive training package consisting of instructor led videos presented by subject matter experts from the Garda National Protective Services Bureau (GNPSB).  </p><p>It also includes periodic knowledge checks and supporting materials.  Furthermore, live webinar virtual classroom sessions in relation to the Domestic Abuse Risk Evaluation Training is currently being rolled out to Garda personnel on a phased basis, hosted by subject matter experts from GNPSB. </p><p>I am further advised that the Domestic Abuse Risk Evaluation Tool is a tool utilised by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to aid a decision-making process through which members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na determine the best course of action when responding to domestic abuse related calls by estimating, identifying, qualifying or quantifying risk.  The Domestic Abuse Risk Evaluation Tool is currently in use in the North Western and Southern Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Regions, and is in the process of being rolled out in the remaining Garda regions on a phased basis.</p><p>A separate online course, which consists of instructor led demonstration videos on the correct use of PULSE in dealing with Domestic Violence Orders has also been launched.  </p><p>In addition, new content has been included on the Foundation Training Programme with a view to enhancing the learning for Garda Probationers during the course of their training.</p><p>While those assigned to the DPSU already receive specialist training, a review of this is currently underway and with a view to redeveloping the DPSU training to ensure an even more customised, fit-for-purpose and victim-centric training course is delivered to all DPSU members from Detective Garda to Detective Inspector.  </p><p>To this end GNPSB have completed a nationwide canvass with a view to determining training needs and it has been established that there are 392 members of Garda, Sergeant and Inspector rank attached to Divisional Protective Services Units nationwide. Training was delivered in 5 individual modules titled as follows:</p><p>1. Sexual Crime;2. Online Child Exploitation;3. Domestic Abuse;4. Human Trafficking and Victims;5. Court Process.</p><p>The initial position in respect of the DPSU training requirement, is that anyone who has not completed all five modules of this training will be required to undertake the new training programme that will be ready for delivery by Q2, 2022. </p><p>The proposed training programme is expected to enhance the skills of DPSU members, to ensure that each one can carry out the full range of specialist tasks frequently necessitated within their roles.</p></reply>

It is also the case that the Government endeavours to fill judicial vacancies at the earliest opportunity to ensure our courts continue to operate as effectively and efficiently as possible.   Some positions are due to be filled shortly following some recent retirements. </p>  <p>  Additional resources have been provided for the High Court, where the number of judges was increased by five last year, from 37 to 42, with the enactment of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2021.</p>  <p>  In addition, section 8 of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2021 provided for the number of High Court judges to be exceeded by a further one should the Government, at my request, having consulted with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, form the opinion that it was necessary due to the volume of business and to ensure the efficient administration of justice.  I brought a Memorandum to Government on 19 January 2022, with a recommendation to have that additional High Court post filled.</p>  <p>  With that recent appointment to the High Court, the complement of High Court judges is now six more than it was on 1 October 2021.  This represents one of the largest increases in judges in recent memory and a very significant investment by the State in judicial resources.</p>  <p>  Any further judicial resourcing needs will be informed by the report and recommendations of the Judicial Planning Working Group, which was established in April, 2021 in line with commitments in the Programme for Government and my Justice Plan 2021 to &ldquo;Establish a working group to consider the number of and type of judges required to ensure the efficient administration of justice over the next five years&rdquo;. </p>  <p>  To help inform the work of the Group, the OECD have been commissioned to prepare an independent review of judicial resource needs, including benchmarks against international comparators. The latest indications from the OECD are that they hope to present their initial draft report to my Department in the coming weeks with the final report to be published later this year.</p></reply>

This includes the distribution and stationing of Garda members throughout the State. </p>  <p>  I am assured that Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of policing priorities and crime trends, to ensure their optimum use. I understand that it is a matter for the Divisional Chief Superintendent to determine the optimum distribution of duties among the personnel available to them, having regard to the profile of each area within the Division and its specific needs.</p>  <p>  The budget provided by Government to the Garda Commissioner continues to increase to unprecedented levels, with an allocation in excess of &euro;2 billion for 2022, which includes funding for the recruitment of up to 800 additional Garda trainees and up to 400 Garda staff. This significant investment demonstrates the Government's commitment to increasing the Garda workforce to enable the organisation to keep our communities safe, including in Cork City and County, and to preventing crime in all its forms. </p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that as of 28 February, the latest date for which figures are available, there are 21 Garda members assigned to Carrigaline Garda Station, an increase of 10.5% since the end of 2015, when there were 19 Garda&iacute; assigned to Carrigaline. In addition, as of 28 February, there was one Garda staff supporting the members in Carrigaline, which remains unchanged since the end of 2015. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that a Garda recruitment campaign closed earlier this month and I am advised that there was a strong interest, with over 10,000 applications received. I hugely welcome this significant response to the recent Garda campaign, indicating, as it does, the widespread respect for the important position that Garda&iacute; occupy in our society, as well as the unique contribution that Garda&iacute; can make to the lives of individuals across the country.</p></reply>

It is the first operational programme of the St Stephen's Green Trust, and is also funded by the Prison Service and the Probation Service. </p><p>I am advised by the Prison Service that a significant amount of positive steps have been taken since the beginning of this collaborative project, including: </p><p>- The development of peer support services in 4 prisons and mediation in 8 prisons, which it is intended to develop further now that COVID restrictions are reducing; </p><p>- The identification of Traveller Liaison Teachers to support greater access to education services and adaptation of education services for Travellers; </p><p>- The hosting of Traveller pride events to better share awareness about the rich cultural heritage of Travellers; </p><p>- The introduction of awareness training for new prison staff on the issues arising for Travellers and areas of discrimination; </p><p>- The development of the electronic means to capture ethnicity information in a systematic way, and </p><p>- The training of Traveller volunteers for the Red Cross programme in prisons.</p><p>The &lsquo;Working It Out&rsquo; report by the Travellers in Prison Initiative regarding unemployment amongst Travellers highlighted the work required in the area of training and employment and the Prison Service intends to take steps to address a number of issues identified in that report.</p><p>The recent evaluation of the Travellers in Prison Initiative 2015-2021 will serve to highlight specific goals for the Prison Service to target in a strategic way in the next phase of this work. Both the Prison and Probation Service are committed to working together to advance the necessary changes identified.</p><p>The mediation programme, which is in operation in Castlerea Prison since 2016, is a partnership between the Midlands Traveller Conflict Mediation Initiative, the Red Cross, Travellers in Prison Initiative, and Castlerea Prison School, is a hugely successful programme aimed at conflict awareness.</p><p>A number of prisoners are trained as mediators and the programme is facilitated by members of the Traveller community. It aims to develop intervention skills to address some of the issues that can lead to person on person violence in prisons. The mediation programme has been expanded into a number of locations including Midlands Prison, Loughan House, the D&oacute;chas Centre and Cork Prison and while the roll out has been impacted by Covid there are a number of prison educations centres who have expressed a willingness to introduce a similar programme in the future.</p><p>In late 2020, the Prison Service in collaboration with the equine industry, opened the Equine Centre at Castlerea Prison.  While the equine programme while open to all prisoners, early indications show a high level of interest from Traveller men.  Prisoners from Castlerea Prison attend the Centre daily and are engaged in the Horse Care and Welfare programme. The course is specially designed for delivery to students with literacy issues and is delivered visually with voice over and assisted through the use of diagrams.  It is an accredited programme endorsed by the Racing Academy and Centre of Education (RACE).  </p><p>In addition, the Probation Service continues to actively partner with TPI on a variety of training and development initiatives aimed at supporting staff to work more effectively and sensitively with members of the Traveller Community.</p><p>A summary of achievements and plans to date, include: </p><p>- The development and delivery of ethnic identifier training to all Probation Officers which focuses on supporting staff to consistently and sensitively gather accurate ethnicity data. The aim of this training is to enable the routine collection and publishing of ethnic data to inform good policy. </p><p>- The joint delivery of cultural awareness training to all Probation Officers on <i>&ldquo;working with members of the Travelling Community &ndash; a culturally sensitive approach&rdquo;</i>. This training commenced in 2021 and involves participation from travellers with lived experience of the criminal justice system. </p><p>- The Service is currently working with TPI to deliver a customised training programme on <i>Working with Traveller Women</i>and <i>Working with the Roma Community</i>. It is anticipated that training will commence later in 2022. </p><p>- The Service has also engaged with TPI in relation to the importance of preparing Pre-Sentence Assessment Reports that reflect the particular challenges faced by the traveller community, which result from cross generational issues of discrimination and hostility. The Service is currently progressing work in this area and is actively researching how this has been done in other jurisdictions, for example in Canada with their Aboriginal population (Gladue Reports). This research will inform future work in this area.</p><p>The Service&rsquo;s work with the Traveller Community and ongoing partnership with TPI is central to its commitments to the promotion of inclusion prioritised as a core pillar within its Strategy Statement 2021-23: Probation Works for Community Service.</p></reply>

This new plan will have a particular focus on prevention, and on ensuring victims are better supported.</p><p>It is my intention to publish the final strategy and accompanying action plan as soon as possible in the coming weeks.</p><p>Minister O&rsquo;Gorman and I also commissioned an independent audit of how responsibility for domestic, sexual and gender based violence is segmented across Government.</p><p>On foot of this, it has been agreed that my Department will assume responsibility for services for victims of domestic, sexual and gender based violence, in addition to policy responsibility and overall cross-Government coordination of implementation.</p><p>A detailed plan setting out how this will work is in preparation.</p><p>In relation to the specific issue of refuge spaces, in February Minister O&rsquo;Gorman and I published the review by Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, of accommodation for victims of domestic violence.</p><p>The review highlights gaps in geographical coverage and inadequate provision of safe accommodation, including refuges, to meet population needs. It recommended an approach to address this with immediate, medium and long term actions required and it provides a list of priority areas where additional services would address the most immediate need.</p><p>While the review says that a minimum of between 50 and 60 new refuge places are needed as a priority, further analysis has identified 10 locations nationwide where the delivery of 82 family refuge spaces would have the most impact if prioritised.</p><p>These locations and refuge need have been chosen on the basis of required proximity to a refuge, as well as a need for refuge spaces per head of population in densely populated areas.</p><p>These represent areas where there is the most significant under-provision and represent a starting point to increasing refuge spaces comprehensively and in every county across the country.</p><p>I fully acknowledge the need to dramatically increase the provision of refuges across the country, and key to this will be ensuring organisations can access funding.</p><p>I have established a high level Inter-Departmental Group to review the current system for the provision of refuge spaces and to identify changes that can be made to the system to deliver additional spaces as effectively as possible. </p><p>Specific issues for each location are being given due attention and as we progress this work we will be engaging with local authorities, government departments and State agencies across the country to source refuge provision. At the moment I urge any groups with proposals around refuge developments to notify Tusla in the first instance on their plans so they can be helped to progress them as appropriate. </p><p>This is a priority for me and I will be making sure this progresses as quickly as possible to ensure we meet the urgent need to make more refuge places available. </p><p>Tusla will continue to engage with stakeholders on all aspects of service development as part of its current remit to support the provision of services to victims of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence. </p><p>My intention is that the timelines for delivery of these places, as well as further targets for nationwide delivery of refuge accommodation, will be outlined in the third national strategy and further detail will be contained in the accompanying action plan.</p></reply>

The Government has supported An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in addressing the threat from organised crime gangs through the introduction of a range of legislative measures.</p><p>This includes the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which is currently being drafted and will provide, among other matters, for an increase in the penalty for conspiracy to murder from 10 years to life imprisonment.  </p><p>The Government has in place the National Drugs and Alcohol Strategy, &quot;<i>Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery - a health led response to drug and alcohol use in Ireland 2017-2025</i>&quot;. The Strategy recognises the need for a balanced health-led approach - reducing demand, while also reducing access to illegal drugs, and is aimed at reducing the number of people criminalised for the possession of drugs for personal use. While this strategy supports the vulnerable people who use drugs, it is also matched with strengthened enforcement measures across government to tackle the supply of illegal drugs.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Garda Commissioner is responsible under the law for the management of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including operational matters and the deployment of resources. As Minister, I have no responsibility for these matters. </p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to develop and implement strategies to dismantle and disrupt criminal networks, utilising advanced analytical and intelligence methods. Garda&iacute; target dangerous criminals and organised criminal groups through the use of focused intelligence led operations by specialist units and agencies such as the Organised Crime Unit, the Criminal Assets Bureau and the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation.</p><p>The Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau (GNDOCB) is having significant success in disrupting the supply of illicit drugs by organised crime groups. Its work is supported by Divisional Drugs Units nationwide and by all Garda&iacute; working in local communities, while working closely with international law enforcement partners.</p><p>I am advised by the Garda authorities that in 2021, the GNDOCB seized &euro;63.689m in illicit drugs, and seized cash of &euro;5.6m and &pound;38,751 (UK). In addition, &euro;8.23m, &pound;142,520 (UK) and $23 (US) was forfeited to the State in 2021.</p><p>I can further inform the Deputy that on 2 July 2021, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na commenced an enhanced national anti-drugs strategy, Operation Tara, which has a strong focus on tackling street-level dealing throughout rural and urban Ireland. The focus of Operation Tara is to disrupt, dismantle and prosecute drug trafficking networks, at all levels - international, national and local - involved in the importation, distribution, cultivation, production, local sale and supply of controlled drugs. Recent successes of Operation Tara include the seizure of an estimated &euro;125,600 of suspected cannabis in Tipperary on 11 February and the seizure of four firearms, ammunition and an estimated &euro;70,000 of suspected heroin in Dublin on 29 January.</p></reply>

As part of its aims for the programme, the Courts Service is committed to simplifying services and processes.</p>  <p>  This will build on a number of important reforms introduced over the last decade, including the following changes to jury service: </p>  <p>  - removal of the upper age limit for eligibility to serve on a jury; </p>  <p>  - provision for the appointment of up to three additional jurors to ensure continuity in lengthy criminal trials; </p>  <p>  - the modernisation and centralisation by the Courts Service of the handling of all jury summonses from across the country, allowing greater efficiency in managing jury lists - previously this was carried out by each Circuit Court office; and </p>  <p>  - the recent enactment of the Criminal Procedure Act 2021 which provides for pre-trial hearings, reducing the scope for lengthy legal argument during the course of trials, making court procedures faster and more efficient, thus improving the experience for jurors.</p>  <p>  It should also be noted that during 2020 further consideration was given to jury reforms while assessing the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on criminal trials.  In this context, the Deputy will be aware that my Department brought forward the Civil Law and Criminal Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2020 and the previously mentioned Criminal Procedure Act 2021. </p>  <p>  Jury service exists to protect an individual's rights and to involve the public in the administration of justice. Jury service is one of the most important civic duties that a person can be asked to perform. While there are no expenses paid to jurors who are called for jury duty, lunch and refreshments are provided for those who ultimately serve on a jury.</p>  <p>  Information for potential jurors on jury duty is posted with jury summonses and can also be found on the Courts Service website. This information includes an outline of the position regarding expenses and explains that employers must continue to pay an employee while engaged on jury duty. Self-employed persons can seek to be excused by the County Registrar.</p>  <p>  If expenses were to be paid, a budget would need to put in place to cover those costs and no such budget is currently in place. In addition, provision would need to be made for administrative costs, including drafting guidelines or regulations covering the claiming and checking of such expenses, establishing a means of reimbursement, together with a system to issue the payments and staff to run, administer and govern the scheme.</p>  <p>  I would intend that, in due course, the overall operation of the jury system will be reviewed in the context of my Department&rsquo;s Statement of Strategy and my Justice Plan 2022, and any necessary reforms will be addressed in primary legislation, including, as appropriate, the specific points raised by the Deputy.</p></reply>

This new plan will have a particular focus on prevention, and on ensuring victims are better supported.</p><p>It is my intention to publish the final strategy and accompanying action plan as soon as possible in the coming weeks.</p><p>Minister O&rsquo;Gorman and I also commissioned an independent audit of how responsibility for domestic, sexual and gender based violence is segmented across Government.</p><p>On foot of this, it has been agreed that my Department will assume responsibility for services for victims of domestic, sexual and gender based violence, in addition to policy responsibility and overall cross-Government coordination of implementation.</p><p>A detailed plan setting out how this will work is in preparation.</p><p>In relation to the specific issue of refuge spaces, in February Minister O&rsquo;Gorman and I published the review by Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, of accommodation for victims of domestic violence.</p><p>The review highlights gaps in geographical coverage and inadequate provision of safe accommodation, including refuges, to meet population needs. It recommended an approach to address this with immediate, medium and long term actions required and it provides a list of priority areas where additional services would address the most immediate need.</p><p>While the review says that a minimum of between 50 and 60 new refuge places are needed as a priority, further analysis has identified 10 locations nationwide where the delivery of 82 family refuge spaces would have the most impact if prioritised.</p><p>These locations and refuge need have been chosen on the basis of required proximity to a refuge, as well as a need for refuge spaces per head of population in densely populated areas.</p><p>These represent areas where there is the most significant under-provision and represent a starting point to increasing refuge spaces comprehensively and in every county across the country.</p><p>Athlone, which services to a significant catchment area within Co. Roscommon, is one of the priority locations identified arising from the review for development of refuge services, and it is expected that developments in Sligo and the wider midlands area, would also improve access for those in Co. Roscommon.</p><p>I fully acknowledge the need to dramatically increase the provision of refuges across the country, and key to this will be ensuring organisations can access funding.</p><p>I have established a high level Inter-Departmental Group to review the current system for the provision of refuge spaces and to identify changes that can be made to the system to deliver additional spaces as effectively as possible.</p><p>In addition to the locations identified by the Tusla review, the Group will be engaging with local authorities, government departments and State agencies to look at sourcing refuge provision in a number of other areas where there is a need. Part of the work being undertaken will be to assess the readiness of locations to proceed with the construction of refuges having regard to local capacity, availability and suitable sites, etc.</p><p>My intention is that the timelines for delivery of these places, as well as further targets for nationwide delivery of refuge accommodation, will be outlined in the third national strategy and further detail will be contained in the accompanying action plan.</p></reply>

Government Departments and services are working together to implement Ireland's commitments under the EU Temporary Protection Directive (2001/55/EC), which has been activated for the first time to grant temporary protection to displaced persons from Ukraine.</p><p>The Directive has legal effect under Section 60 of the International Protection Act 2015.</p><p>Those eligible for Temporary Protection (granted initially for one year, but renewable) will have immediate access to the labour market, social welfare, accommodation and other State supports as necessary. </p><p>So far, approximately 85 per cent of Ukrainians who have entered the State have been welcomed at Dublin Airport. Beneficiaries are being provided with their permission letter on arrival at the airport in the 'one-stop-shop' established by my Department for that purpose, to ensure early access to all necessary supports. Approximately 7,300 temporary protection permissions have already been issued by my Department since the activation of the EU Directive on 4 March. </p><p>Arrangements have also now been put in place to provide permission letters to those who arrived at Dublin Airport prior to 9 March (when permission letters started to issue) and to those who have arrived at other ports of entry to the State.</p><p>For people who are staying in State provided accommodation, staff from my Department are visiting these accommodation locations and will provide permission letters there.</p><p>Alternatively, permission letters can be obtained by visiting the Ukraine Support Centre in Cork Street, Dublin 8. The centre is open Monday to Friday from 9.15am to 5.00pm. On Saturdays, the centre is open from 9.15am to 3.00pm. There, people can also receive assistance from the Department of Social Protection to obtain PPSN numbers, social welfare income supports, and to receive referrals to other State services. </p><p>Arrangements are also being put in place that will allow people to obtain their permission letters from the Ukraine Support Centre in Hanover Street in Cork City and from the third Support Centre that will open shortly in Limerick. Further details on this will be announced shortly.</p><p>A centralised Government information portal is available at: www.gov.ie/ukraine, which is regularly updated. </p><p>My Department&rsquo;s Irish Immigration website also contains a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) page at: www.irishimmigration.ie/faqs-for-ukraine-nationals-and-residents-of-ukraine/. </p><p>I can assure the Deputy that my Government colleagues and I will continue to work with our EU counterparts on any further EU-wide measures that might be needed to assist those fleeing Ukraine. However, the immediate and overriding priority is to assist those who have arrived and continue to arrive in Ireland to find safety with access to state supports as needed, as part of a whole of Government response.</p><p>Notwithstanding this, given the very extreme pressures being faced by Moldova in the current circumstances, the Government has agreed, as part of an EU response, to offer to accept from Moldova up to 500 people who have fled the war in Ukraine. </p></reply>

Organised criminal activity, including drug dealing, represents a serious threat to community safety.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Department of Health leads on Government policy in the area of drugs, and this policy is guided by the national drugs and alcohol strategy &quot;Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery - a health led response to drug and alcohol use in Ireland 2017-2025&quot;. This strategy represents a whole-of-government response to drug and alcohol use in Ireland. Implementation is led by my colleague the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Frank Feighan, and encompasses actions for all stakeholders, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and my Department.  </p><p>The Government&rsquo;s strategic approach is health-led to reduce <i>demand</i>while balancing this with reducing <i>access</i>to illegal drugs.  It also aims to reduce the numbers criminalised for the possession of drugs for personal use, diverting these people to health and diversion treatments to address their habits and behaviours.  While the strategy aims to support the most vulnerable people who use drugs, it is also matched with strong enforcement measures across government to tackle the <i>supply</i>of illegal drugs. I share the Garda Commissioner&rsquo;s concern at the prevalence of illegal drug use and I am glad that sustained action by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to tackle this continued apace throughout the pandemic, resulting in increased convictions and ongoing seizures of drugs, as well as volumes of firearms, ammunition and cash that inevitably accompany this very serious organised criminal activity.  </p><p>The Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau (GNDOCB) is having significant success in disrupting drug trafficking and the supply of illicit drugs by organised crime groups. I am advised by the Garda authorities that in 2021, the GNDOCB seized almost &euro;64m worth of illicit drugs and over &euro;5.6m in cash, a significant increase from 2019, when there were over &euro;21m worth of illicit drugs and over &euro;2.5m in cash seized. </p><p>The Bureau&rsquo;s work is supported by Divisional Drugs Units nationwide, and by all Garda&iacute; working in local communities. GNDOCB also works closely and productively with international law enforcement partners. Garda&iacute; continue to work closely with local authorities, the HSE, NGOs, community groups and other State agencies to tackle the problems of drug addiction and abuse.  </p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, intimidation is a very serious issue and the Bureau has worked with the National Family Support Network, to develop <i>&lsquo;the Drug Related Intimidation Reporting Programme&rsquo;</i>to respond to the needs of drug users and family members experiencing drug related intimidation. The Commissioner has tasked an Inspector in every Garda Division to respond to the issue of drug related intimidation.  People seeking assistance may contact their local Inspector confidentially who will provide practical personal security and safety information and advice in relation to particular threats or instances of intimidation, along with information on appropriate drug support services for the individual in the family who is accruing drug debts, while also providing information regarding the process involved in making a formal complaint. </p><p>My Department are also taking a range of actions designed to break the link between criminal gangs and the children they seek to recruit. This includes the enactment of new criminal legislation which will outlaw the grooming of children to commit crime. I also intend to bring forward legislation shortly which will increase the sentence of conspiracy to murder from ten years to life in prison. These new laws will ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and our Courts have the tools they need to take firm and decisive action to deal with our most serious criminals.  <b><i>In addition, we will continue to roll out the Greentown initiative which is designed to target those children most at risk of being recruited by criminal gangs.  </i></b></p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, three pilot Local Community Safety Partnerships are currently in place in Longford, Waterford and Dublin North Inner City. Each pilot is developing a Local Community Safety Plan which is allowing communities to identify the specific community safety issues which need to be tackled in their local areas and to hold public service providers accountable for their agreed actions. Following the enactment of the Policing, Security and Community Safety Bill, Partnerships will be rolled out to every local authority area.</p><p>I will also be shortly launching the Community Safety Innovation Fund, which will enable local communities to seek funding for innovative projects which will improve community safety in their areas.</p></reply>

An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na plays a vital role in enforcing road traffic law and in making our roads safer for all road users, including vulnerable road users, such as cyclists.</p>  <p>  The Garda Commissioner is responsible by law for the management of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including personnel matters and deployment of resources. As Minister, I have no responsibility for these matters. </p>  <p>  I am advised by Minister Ryan that the protection of vulnerable road users is prioritised in the new Road Safety Strategy. Protecting vulnerable road users involves a range of actions aside from legislative and law enforcement measures. Improvements in infrastructure, such as dedicated cycle lanes, will reduce the danger by keeping vulnerable road users separate from motorized traffic. The Government has committed to investing up to &euro;1.8 billion in cycling and walking infrastructure during its lifetime. I understand that the Road Safety Authority also engages in public information and education initiatives to raise driver awareness of the specific risks to vulnerable road users.    </p>  <p>  As regards the establishment of a dedicated online portal for the submission of video evidence of potential violations of road traffic legislation, the Deputy may be aware that the current Traffic Watch facility allows for members of the public to report driver behaviour to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Matters reported via this facility are forwarded to the relevant District Office for investigation. Similarly, citizens may make complaints to any member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or through the Garda website.</p>  <p>  Under Action 29 of the Road Safety Strategy, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will explore the potential of an online portal for road users to upload footage of road traffic offences which could assist in prosecution. This action is due to be completed by Q4 of this year.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, there are strict standards in legislation relating to photographic evidence obtained by Garda&iacute;. While An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has confirmed that private dash cam footage may be used during a prosecution, its use must be in accordance with best evidential practices and entails ensuring structures exist around continuity of evidence.</p>  <p>  The Department of Transport has further advised that any decision to allow film by members of the public to be used in evidence in road traffic cases would raise questions of reliability of, and possible tampering with, the apparatus used, as well as potential privacy issues. It might also raise questions about why Garda apparatus was held to a standard not required of private individuals, if both were ultimately to be treated as reliable evidence. </p>  <p>  Road traffic enforcement remains a core policing function of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The Garda National Roads Policing Bureau ensures a consistent approach to road safety and enforcement of road traffic legislation across the country. This is achieved through coordination of enforcement measures and development of policy based on research and analysis of statistics and by engaging in campaigns in partnership with other State Agencies, notably the Road Safety Authority.</p>  <p>  It is also important to emphasise that road traffic legislation is enforced as part of the day-to-day duties of all members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in addition to the employment of specific enforcement operations.</p>  <p>  I would of course encourage any member of the public to report any incidents of dangerous driving directly to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></reply>

The Guidelines rightly state that no one should have to suffer domestic violence and recognise that migrants may have additional vulnerability in this area, as the perpetrator may threaten a victim with the loss of their status if they report the abuse.  </p><p>Anyone who is the victim of domestic abuse and whose permission to be in the State is linked to their partner, will have the issue of their status dealt with sensitively by the immigration authorities and each case will be assessed on an individual basis.</p><p>I would urge anyone in this situation to approach my Department for advice and assistance and I can assure any victim of abuse that they will be supported and protected. </p><p>In line with the Immigration Guidelines, an application may be made from inside the State by a person whose immigration status as the dependent of an Irish or foreign national is valid. If the permission is not currently valid, the person may still make an application.  </p><p>One of the standard conditions of an immigration permission granted in the State, is that the holder must be of good character. Engaging in domestic violence would not be in line with this condition and could lead to the revocation or non-renewal of the perpetrator&rsquo;s own immigration status.</p><p>If it is the case that the victim is in the State undocumented, it may also be open to them to make an application to the Regularisation of Long Term Undocumented Migrants Scheme. Further information is available on my Department's website at:  </p><p>www.irishimmigration.ie/undocumented. </p><p>I would also encourage anyone who has been a victim of domestic abuse to reach out for help as soon as it is safe to do so. They can contact the Women&rsquo;s Aid Freephone Helpline on 1800 341 900. Their Telephone Interpretation Service facility covers 170 languages for callers needing support in their own language. Interpreters are available on the Language Line from 8am&ndash;8pm, 7 days a week. They can provide information on support services throughout Ireland. Further information on that service can be found at: </p><p>www.womensaid.ie/services/helpline/telephoneinterp.html. </p><p>This year, my Department, with the support of the Dormant Accounts fund, will be rolling out awareness raising measures to reach people within marginalised communities in Ireland to inform them of the rights they have under the Victims of Crime Act 2017 and of the Victims Charter. In order to achieve this, my Department will work with various community organisations to adapt various assets and resources for victims of crime in culturally specific ways.</p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, I am leading on the development of a new whole-of-Government strategy to combat domestic, sexual, gender-based violence. The goal of the strategy is zero tolerance in our society for violence against women and it recognises the added vulnerability of certain groups of women, including migrant women.</p><p>The strategy has been developed in partnership with the sector to ensure it is targeted, comprehensive and effective in achieving all of the goals set out. Last month, I briefed those working in the sector on the progress of the strategy as part of that ongoing consultation, and a wider public consultation run by my Department has recently closed. </p><p>The submissions from those working in the sector, and the wider public survey, will now be analysed by consultants to see if any adjustments need to be made before the strategy is finalised. </p><p>I intend to bring the finalised strategy to Government in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

During the period 24 January to 13 February prisoners were entitled to receive one physical visit per fortnight with a maximum of two visitors allowed during each physical visit, one of whom may be a child (under 18 years of age).</p>  <p>  From the 14 February 2022 the number of visitors permitted on a visit increased to three people, two of whom may be a child (under 18 years of age).  Prisoners are currently entitled to receive one thirty minute physical visit every fortnight and on the weeks that they are not receiving a physical family visit, prisoners are able to avail of a video visit. Prisoners may also choose to avail of a video visit instead of a physical visit if they prefer.</p>  <p>  I can further advise the Deputy, that no decision has yet been taken in relation to the resumption of weekly visits but this matter is under constant review.  </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that I fully appreciate how challenging these restrictive measures are for both prisoners and their families. I am very aware of the importance of assisting prisoners to maintain close contact with family and friends while in custody. Families and friends play and important and supportive role in the rehabilitation of prisoners and in their preparation for life post release.</p>  <p>  This is an issue that the management of the Irish Prison Service are also cognisant of and they have at all times sought to minimise the impact of such measures.</p>  <p>  The Service continues to try to balance the need for infection control with the need to ensure that prisoners continue to receive support from family and friends while in prison. </p>  <p>  The high prevalence of Covid-19 in our communities continues to present a high risk of transmission to the prison population and this risk is higher with the increased movement of people into and out of our prisons. </p>  <p>  Updates on the operation of physical family visits are published on a regular basis on the Irish Prison Service website, www.irishprisons.ie, and twitter account, @IrishPrisons.</p></reply>

The enactment of this legislation is a priority for the government and it is intended to publish the bill in the second quarter of 2022 and to complete its passage through the Oireachtas later this year.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, community-based CCTV is currently governed by Section 38(3)(c) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (CCTV) Order 2006 (SI 289 of 2006). This legal framework requires that any proposed community CCTV scheme must: </p>  <p>  - be approved by the local Joint Policing Committee;  </p>  <p>  - have the prior support of the relevant local authority, which must also act as data controller; and </p>  <p>  - have the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner.</p>  <p>  This is the legal basis for all community CCTV schemes, regardless of how they are funded.  These key legal requirements have not changed since 2006.</p></reply>

When a victim of crime begins to engage with the justice system they should know what to expect, be confident they will be treated respectfully and sensitively, know what their legally enforceable rights are and what supports are available at every step in the process.</p><p>Central to achieving this is  <i>'Supporting a Victim's Journey' </i>- our plan to implement the recommendations of The O'Malley Review.  <i>Supporting a Victims Journey</i>is an ambitious plan to introduce important reforms to support and protect vulnerable victims and ensure our criminal justice system is more victim-centred.</p><p>The O&rsquo;Malley Review looked at the journey a victim faces from the moment a crime is committed against them, to the initial reporting of the offence right through to the end of any court proceedings and beyond, because the journey for a victim doesn&rsquo;t end with a verdict.</p><p>I am deeply committed to implementing in full all of the actions set out in <i>Supporting a Victim's Journey</i>and I am chairing an Implementation Oversight Group comprising all relevant departments and agencies responsible for driving the implementation of the agreed actions.</p><p>To date, a number of key actions have been delivered as part of implementing Supporting a Victim&rsquo;s Journey including: </p><p>- The introduction of preliminary trial hearings; </p><p>- The nationwide rollout of Divisional Protective Services Units (DPSUs); </p><p>- The first cohort of staff at a new sexual offences unit in the Director of Public Prosecutions office formally took up their roles in April; </p><p>- Work to advance the training for all personnel who come into contact with vulnerable victims is underway; </p><p>- The University of Limerick has been commissioned by my Department to develop the framework for the training and accreditation operation and training of intermediaries. </p><p>Key areas of the trial process that were identified as being  traumatic for victims and survivors of sexual violence are being addressed in order to make sure they are not victimised further by the processes they need to go through in order to seek the justice they deserve. </p><p>Preliminary trail hearings will reduce delays and increase efficiency in how our criminal trials are run by allowing for certain matters to be addressed in advance of the trial itself starting. </p><p>  In addition to the above, a review of the supports and funding of civil society organisations providing frontline services has been conducted to identify where gaps may exist and how to bridge them. Specific geographical areas and categories of victims that are not adequately covered by NGO supports were identified and my Department engaged with relevant NGO partners to agree revised funding to ensure that we met the gaps identified. </p><p>Recently I announced funding totalling &euro;4.6m for more than 60 organisations to support victims of crime. This is an increase of over 20% on the previous total fund of &euro;3.8m which was made available in 2021. </p><p>I am confident that through increased funding, together with our work to implement the actions set out in  <i>Supporting a Victims Journey,</i>we will ensure that have a system that removes fear and empowers victims to have the confidence to report an offence, knowing they will be supported, informed and treated respectfully and professionally for the entirety of the difficult journey they have to face.</p></reply>

The advice of the Attorney General was sought regarding next steps, including on the matter of publication of the final report. On 8 October 2021, my officials met with the family of Patrick Nugent to discuss the implications of that legal advice. The purpose of that meeting was to update the family generally as to what steps were being taken and to explain the legal difficulties regarding publication of the final report. </p>  <p>  The family were informed that I had provided an unredacted copy of the report to the Garda Commissioner on 9 September to decide what further action, if any, should be taken by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the light of the Judge&rsquo;s findings.  The Garda Commissioner has informed me that he has instructed that a fresh investigation be undertaken into the matters which Judge Clyne determined required further investigation. </p>  <p>  Insofar as any alternative forms of further inquiry might be considered by me as alternatives to the cold case review being undertaken by the Commissioner, I would note that none of the proposed alternatives would have the criminal investigatory powers of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  As previously communicated to the Nugent family, I do not propose to publish Judge Clyne&rsquo;s report at this time as to do so could potentially prejudice a future prosecution.  I am also mindful of the need not to interfere with or otherwise prejudice the cold case investigation which the Garda Commissioner has decided to open.</p></reply>

A key part of the ongoing preparation has involved the CSO working closely with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage (DHLGH) and the Dublin Region Homeless Executive (DRHE). As part of this work the DRHE has supplied the CSO with the locations of accommodation designated under Section 10 of the Housing Act 1988.  This will ensure that persons staying in this accommodation will be correctly enumerated on Census Night.</p>  <p>  The DRHE has committed to conducting a rough sleeper count in the Dublin region.  The information gathered in this process will be provided to the CSO after the census to ensure any person sleeping rough in the Dublin region will be included in the homeless count.  For areas outside Dublin, local census field staff are working with Garda&iacute; and stakeholder groups to identify where persons may be sleeping rough to ensure they are included in the count.

This highlights the views raised in engagements with over 1,000 civic representatives and sets out how the Government is taking account of their contributions. A copy of the report was sent to every Member of the Oireachtas.</p><p>The Dialogue series will continue through this year, focussing on key sectoral issues and on societal concerns for the whole island, including on culture and identity.</p></reply>

The system is managed through the operation of the Critical Skills and Ineligible Occupations Lists which determine employments that are either in high demand or are ineligible for an employment permit where there is a surplus of those skills in the domestic and EEA labour market. The lists are subject to twice yearly evidence-based review. </p>  <p>  Changes announced in June 2021 provided access to the General Employment Permit for non-EEA nationals wishing to take up employment in the State as a Nursing Auxiliary or Assistant (Health Care Assistant) in hospital/nursing home settings. The changes announced did not include the home care sector. </p>  <p>  The results of the most recently concluded review were announced on 28 October 2021. While submissions from the home care sector were considered, the review did not recommend removal of the occupation of care worker/homecarers from the Ineligible Occupations List as the evidence suggested that the contracts of employment on offer and employment terms and conditions being offered are factors in the recruitment challenges faced by the sector, rather than a demonstrable labour market shortage. </p>  <p>  The sector would need to demonstrate a more systematic and structured engagement with the Department of Social Protection, efforts to recruit locally and further information on the sectors terms and conditions.</p>  <p>  My Department is a member of the Cross Departmental Strategic Workforce Advisory Group recently established by the Department of Health in relation to the recruitment and retention challenges faced by the sector. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to review the employment permits system on a bi-annual basis in light of changing labour market circumstances and intends to launch the next review of the Occupations List in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

The NCPC&rsquo;s main functions are: to diagnose and analyse competitiveness and productivity developments; to influence policymakers to take actions to improve the environment in which businesses operate; to publish work to generate and inform the debate on competitiveness and productivity issues; and, to function as Ireland&rsquo;s National Productivity Board (NPB). The NCPC does not have a role in investigating the pricing behaviour of commercial enterprises. </p>  <p>  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) is the statutory body responsible for promoting compliance with, and enforcing, competition and consumer protection law in Ireland. The impact on fuel prices has caused much concern and distress for consumers. To date, the CCPC has received nearly 200 complaints in relation to retail fuel prices, which they are currently reviewing.  </p>  <p>  The CCPC continues to assess the complaints it has received in relation to fuel prices at the pump. As part of this process, it is engaging with complainants and the industry, and will assess any evidence that might indicate the possibility of breaches of the law. </p>  <p>  There are a number of other actions the CCPC has taken in relation to fuel pricing: </p>  <p>  - It has written to one trade association and two fuel companies about the competition law risks of making public statements about future increases in fuel prices, and they are continuing to monitor public statements; </p>  <p>  - It has updated its website to provide consumers with relevant information on price increases and their role; </p>  <p>  - It has written to fuel retailers&rsquo; representatives to remind them of their members&rsquo; obligations under consumer protection law and will be continuing compliance checks in relation to pricing displays.</p>  <p>  The National Competitiveness and Productivity Council has recently published a Bulletin on Energy Security which highlighted the urgency of diversifying Ireland&rsquo;s sources of energy supply to ensure energy security and competitiveness of enterprises operating in Ireland, which is heavily reliant on imported energy (oil, gas, coal, and peat). In particular, the dominance of gas is a risk to both the physical security of supply and in terms of exposure to price variation. The NCPC also emphasised that policies to enhance energy security should align with the targets set out in the Climate Action Plan 2021 to facilitate Ireland&rsquo;s transition to a low carbon economy.</p></reply>

There has been a significant long-term shift in attitudes to remote work amongst both employers and workers throughout the country. </p>  <p>  Remote work is already a key consideration in government policy documents such as the National Economic Plan, the Climate Action Plan, the Town Centre Living initiative and the Smarter Travel Policy. The State is committed to increasing remote work adoption in Ireland through removing barriers, developing infrastructure, providing guidance, raising awareness and leading by example in this area.</p>  <p>  In the context of Pillar 1 of the National Remote Work Strategy, published in January 2021, a commitment was made to legislate to provide employees with the right to request remote work. This is one of the key actions of the Strategy. </p>  <p>  On 25th January the Government approved the priority drafting of the Right to Request Remote Working Bill 2022. Pre-legislative scrutiny of the General Scheme by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment commenced on 9th February.</p>  <p>  The intention remains that the Bill will be progressed through the Oireachtas as quickly as possible. </p>  <p>  Following publication of the Joint Oireachtas Committee&rsquo;s Report on pre-legislative scrutiny, any recommendations  made will be reviewed and considered.</p></reply>

These discussions have been detailed and protracted, and a potential proposed compromise outcome has now emerged, that aims to offer the most promising path toward achieving a meaningful outcome among all WTO Members. The outcome was put forward by the WTO Secretariat last week.   </p>  <p>  This draft proposal has not yet been presented to the full WTO membership for consideration. As these consultations are still ongoing, I am not in a position to provide details of the draft proposal. </p>  <p>  In the meantime, the EU will continue to engage constructively in discussions in the WTO in order to reach a compromise as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  Global production of COVID-19 vaccines reached 12.6 billion doses by February 2022 and is expected to be between 18 and 19 billion by mid-2022. This means that by mid-2022 we will have sufficient vaccines for everybody in the world, including for booster campaigns.  As vaccine production is no longer an issue, the focus has now shifted to vaccinations and how strengthening health systems and their preparedness is pivotal in the achievement of the 70% vaccination target.  </p>  <p>  In 2021, the EU was the largest donor of doses through COVAX and is the largest donor and exporter of vaccines globally. Team Europe has shared more than 400 million vaccine doses and exported over 1.8 billion vaccines to 165 countries and is committed to sharing 700 million doses by mid-2022, with a focus on supporting Africa where vaccination rates are lower than in other parts of the world.  Team Europe is also investing &euro;1 billion to ramp up mRNA production capacity in Africa. </p>  <p>  In addition to dose donation and exports of vaccines, the EU, with its Member States, has committed over &euro;3 billion to COVAX in support of the equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines.</p>  <p>  The Irish Government has to date committed to the donation of &euro;13.5 million and five million COVID-19 vaccine doses to the COVAX facility. Over 1.8 million doses have already been delivered to recipient countries including almost 1.5 million doses delivered to African countries including Uganda, Nigeria, Ghana, and Burkina Faso, with further deliveries expected to follow shortly.</p></reply>

It was created in the second half of 2017. Its initial focus was on coordinating the EU&rsquo;s Digital Single Market (DSM) agenda across Government.  </p><p>The role of the Unit expanded in April 2018 in line with developments on the DSM agenda. Accordingly, the Unit led the Irish position on the negotiations for the EU&rsquo;s Platforms to Business Regulation, which was adopted in 2019 (EU Regulation 2019/1150) and was implemented into Irish law by S.I. No. 256 of 2020.  At the same time, the Unit took responsibility for EU policy on Artificial Intelligence. </p><p>In December 2020, the European Commission published their proposals for two new EU Regulation, namely the Digital Services Act and the Digital Markets Act. </p><p>The Unit has managed the Irish position in the negotiations on both proposals to date, including establishing an interdepartmental group that meets weekly, running public consultations and organising round table discussions with both business and representatives of civil society. The Council and European Parliament reached agreement on the Digital Markets Act on 25 March 2022. The Digital Services Act is in trilogue negotiations and is expected to be agreed before the end of June 2022. </p><p>The Unit also manages the Irish position in the EU negotiations for a Regulation on artificial intelligence, known as the AI Act. It conducted a public consultation in 2021 and is working across relevant Departments and Agencies on the Irish position. Negotiations in Council may reach a general approach in June of this year. </p><p>Last month, the Commission published its proposals for a Regulation on data, the Data Act and responsibility for coordinating the Irish position in the EU negotiations has been assigned to the Unit. It intends to open a public consultation shortly and is working with the relevant Departments to identify issues. </p><p>In mid - 2021, the Department expanded the remit of Digital Economy Policy Unit, to include national digital policy as well as EU policy and regulation. This includes responsibility for the implementation of the National AI Strategy (AI &ndash; Here for Good: National artificial intelligence strategy for Ireland), as well as the enterprise pillar of the National Digital Strategy (Harnessing Digital &ndash; The Digital Ireland Framework). Actions under these strategies being advanced in the Unit include establishing Ireland&rsquo;s first AI Ambassador, who will champion AI as a positive force for the economy and society. I intend to appoint the new Ambassador shortly. Another action in the Unit is the creation of an Enterprise Digital Advisory Forum [EDAF]. This forum will bring together representatives from across the enterprise base and experts in digital technologies to advise and work with Government to drive industry adoption of AI and other digital technologies. The Forum will be appointed shortly. </p><p>The Unit is also responsible for the development of the Digital Transition Fund, which is an &euro;85 million multi-annual fund that will be announced in Q2 of this year and will run until 2026. This fund is part of the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP). </p><p>Finally, the Unit manages Ireland&rsquo;s representation at the D9+ Group on EU Member States, at the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence, and at the OECD on digital issues.</p></reply>

The Local Enterprise Offices act as a &lsquo;first stop shop&rsquo; providing a signposting service to all available Government business supports. </p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices can offer direct grant aid to microenterprises (10 employees or fewer) in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sectors which, over time, have the potential to develop into strong export entities. However, it should be noted that the Local Enterprise Offices do not provide direct grant-aid to areas such as retail, personal services, local professional services, or local building services, as it may give rise to the displacement of existing businesses. </p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices also provide a wide range of high-quality business and management development programmes that are tailored to meet specific business requirements. Whether it is starting a business or growing a business there is something suitable for anyone exploring self-employment as an option. </p>  <p>  I would suggest seeking the advice of a LEO Business Mentor; The Mentor programme is designed to match up the knowledge, skills, insights and entrepreneurial capability of experienced business practitioners with small business owner/ managers who need practical and strategic one to one advice and guidance. This may provide this company with guidance on how best to proceed with their business plans. </p>  <p>  Programmes such as LEAN for Micro and Green for Micro can provide business owners with tools and expert advice on reducing costs and increasing efficiencies within their business. I would also encourage them to enquire about further digital supports such as the Trading Online Voucher scheme, which can assist businesses in developing their e-commerce capabilities and includes training in digital marketing and social media. </p>  <p>  The above supports along with a host of others can also be found on the supportingsmes.gov.ie website.

These discussions were difficult and protracted and have resulted in a potential compromise outcome that aims to offer the most promising path toward achieving a meaningful outcome among all WTO Members. The outcome was put forward by the WTO Secretariat last week.  </p>  <p>  This draft proposal has not yet been presented to the full WTO membership for consideration. As these consultations are still ongoing, I am not in a position to provide details of the draft proposal.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, the EU will continue to engage constructively in discussions in the WTO in order to reach a compromise as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  Global production of COVID-19 vaccines reached 12.6 billion doses by February 2022 and is expected to be between 18 and 19 billion by mid-2022. This means that by mid-2022 we will have sufficient vaccines for everybody in the world, including for booster campaigns.  As vaccine production is no longer an issue, the focus has now shifted to vaccinations and how strengthening health systems and their preparedness is pivotal in the achievement of the 70% vaccination target. </p>  <p>  In 2021, the EU was the largest donor of doses through COVAX and is the largest donor and exporter of vaccines globally. Team Europe has shared more than 400 million vaccine doses and exported over 1.8 billion vaccines to 165 countries and is committed to sharing 700 million doses by mid-2022, with a focus on supporting Africa where vaccination rates are lower than in other parts of the world.  Team Europe is also investing &euro;1 billion to ramp up mRNA production capacity in Africa.</p>  <p>  In addition to dose donation and exports of vaccines, the EU, with its Member States, has committed over &euro;3 billion to COVAX in support of the equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines.</p>  <p>  The Irish Government has to date committed to the donation of &euro;13.5 million and five million COVID-19 vaccine doses to the COVAX facility. Over 1.8 million doses have already been delivered to recipient countries including almost 1.5 million doses delivered to African countries including Uganda, Nigeria, Ghana, and Burkina Faso, with further deliveries expected to follow shortly.</p></reply>

The map is colour coded and searchable by address and Eircode. Premises in the AMBER area will be provided with high speed broadband through the State led Intervention, the contract for which was signed in November 2019 with National Broadband Ireland (NBI).  The BLUE area represents those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have plans to deliver high speed broadband services.  This includes the premises referred to in the Question located in the Burrow Peninsula which are located in the BLUE area and will be delivered with high speed broadband by commercial providers operating in the area. </p>  <p>  In July 2019, in order to finalise the mapping exercise required under the State Aid Guidelines on Broadband and to ensure the NBP High Speed Broadband Map was up to date, my Department conducted a consultation in relation to the High Speed Broadband Map. This consultation sought submissions from operators who wished to have their existing high speed broadband networks or plans to invest in high speed broadband networks over the following 7 years to be included on the Department&rsquo;s High Speed Broadband Map.</p>  <p>  This consultation was part of a significant engagement with industry initiated in July 2013 where my Department engaged in an extensive process of mapping and monitoring broadband availability in Ireland. This has been supported by a number of public consultations conducted from 2013 to 2019. As part of the 2019 consultation, over 180 submissions were received from a variety of stakeholders including 30 from large and small telecoms operators with the remainder from local authority broadband officers and members of the public. All operator submissions were fully assessed against my Department&rsquo;s published assessment criteria and operators were informed of the outcome of this assessment in November 2019. The mapping exercise was conducted across all counties, including Dublin, to ensure the map is up to date.  </p>  <p>  My Department defines high speed broadband as a connection with minimum speeds of 30Mbps download and 6Mbps upload. Commercial operators have indicated their plans to supply Gigabit services to all premises in the BLUE area of the NBP Map by 2026.  Under State aid rules, my Department is not permitted to displace commercial investment by intervening in areas where commercial investment exists or is planned, as to do so would be an infringement of these State aid rules. The activities of commercial operators delivering high speed broadband within BLUE areas are not planned or funded by the State and my Department has no statutory authority to intervene in that regard. </p>  <p>  Complaints about service provision are a matter to be dealt with between the consumer and the service provider in the first instance.

This Government recognises the potential to make use of renewable and waste energy to heat homes and businesses as part of a range of measures to reduce carbon emissions. The Climate Action Plan 2021 contains actions that will provide a solid basis for the appropriate expansion of district heating in Ireland, including the establishment of a Steering Group to oversee the rollout of district heating and ensure that a robust governance framework is put in place. </p>  <p>  My Department has established the District Heating Steering Group, which draws together the expertise of key stakeholder organisations in order to inform the setting of targets and other key elements for the rollout of district heating at far greater scale. The Steering Group will also ensure that there is a robust governance framework in place and develop a regulatory framework, along with any legislation that may be required. Considerations in this regard will also encompass legacy district heating schemes that are already in operation in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Gas prices are not capped in Ireland, and the position of successive Governments, for almost 20 years, has been that competitive energy markets result in greater choice for consumers and businesses.</p></reply>

By bringing together groups of buildings under the same retrofit programme, communities projects facilitate community-wide energy improvements more efficiently and cost effectively than might otherwise be possible. The primary objective of the scheme is to support and maximise the number of home energy upgrades delivered. Non-domestic projects are supported to support the engagement of communities to build low carbon and sustainable communities. </p>  <p>  Under the Scheme, the SEAI place a maximum limit on the number of beneficiaries who may apply in any one grant application as excessive beneficiary numbers could significantly increase the administration and documentation requirements making the Scheme unmanageable. As part of the governance of the delivery of the projects, SEAI make payments to the contract project coordinators as they are responsible for managing all aspects of the projects. It is not possible to make payment to multiple different beneficiaries as this could create difficulties identifying who is responsible for the overall delivery of the project and cause project financial governance difficulties.</p>  <p>  Individual projects which finish works early, may by agreement with the project coordinator, be paid in full before other projects within the contract are complete. This allows for a very flexible approach to managing project cash flow. </p>  <p>  A budget of &euro;43 million has been provided for the Community Energy Grant scheme in 2022. This represents a 43% increase on the 2021 funding allocation and is the largest ever budget for the Scheme. </p>  <p>  The Government has approved a package of supports as part of the delivery of Ireland&rsquo;s residential retrofit programme. These measures are aimed at making it easier and more affordable for homeowners to undertake home energy upgrades, for warmer, healthier and more comfortable homes, with lower energy bills and emission. Included in these measures is the establishment of the new National Home Energy Upgrade Scheme, offering unprecedented grant levels, increased from around 30% to 50% of the cost of a typical B2 home energy upgrade with a heat pump. Importantly, these new higher grant rates will also be available for domestic upgrade projects under the Community Energy Grant Scheme.</p>  <p>  The Community Energy Grant Scheme is open for contractors to make an application to participate in the current call. The team in SEAI are working to make the Communities team available for local workshops nationwide in the coming months to support smaller contractors to participate in the scheme which is now open all year round.</p></reply>

I can confirm that the scheme is available only to operators holding a road haulage transport operator licence.</p>  <p>  In deciding on this targeted, temporary scheme, the Government considered that the licensed haulage sector is a specific case for several reasons, primarily that the sector is of national strategic importance as a critical enabler of a functioning supply chain, bringing essential supplies into and around the State, supporting key infrastructure and enabling the maintenance of economic and social activity.

No. 415 of 2017), as amended. </p>  <p>  The Road Traffic (National Car Test) (Amendment) Regulations 2020 provided for a permanent four-month extension to test due dates for certain qualifying vehicles. This was in direct response to the suspension of the National Car Test service (NCT) on 28 March 2020 to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. The extension was automatically applied to vehicles with an NCT certificate in force on 28 March 2020 and those with a first test due falling during the period between 28 March and 31 July 2020. Cars first registered on or after 1st August 2016 were not eligible for the extension.</p>  <p>  All Member States of the European Union are required by law to carry out periodic roadworthiness inspections on motor vehicles at regular intervals throughout the vehicle's lifecycle. The changes made to legislation in 2020 were permitted only by way of special derogation in the context of the exceptional circumstances facing Europe due to COVID-19.</p>  <p>  There are currently no plans to further amend this legislation.</p></reply>

The estimated cost of the backlog is in excess of &euro;5 billion. </p>  <p>  Because of the pressures on the regional and local road network, approximately 90% of available Exchequer grant assistance to local authorities for regional and local roads is being directed to maintenance and renewal works rather than for new roads or for road realignments.</p>  <p>  In this context there has been significant increases in Exchequer grants for regional and local roads particularly in recent years. The 2022 regional and local road grants were notified to local authorities on the 15th February and Galway County Council has been allocated a total of &euro;37.6 million this year which compares to an allocation of &euro;19.6 million in 2017. All regional and local road grant monies for 2022 have been fully allocated.</p>  <p>  The Department's grant funding for the maintenance of regional and local roads is allocated to local authorities on a pro-rata basis, determined mainly by the length of the regional and local road network in a local authority functional area. The Department appreciates that, within the overall parameters set for the grant programme, local authorities might need to target funding at particular problem areas and there is sufficient flexibility in the structure of the grant programme to allow for this. It is also open to each local authority to allocate its own resources to priority areas. </p></reply>

The National Transport Authority (NTA) has statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public passenger transport services nationally, and for the allocation of associated funding to the relevant transport operators.  </p><p>Licensed bus and coach operators are an integral part of the overall public transport system particularly in areas which are not covered by existing public service bus and rail services. In recognition of this, throughout the COVID-19 pandemic the Government have provided temporary financial supports for certain licensed commercial services with a view to protecting capacity across the public transport sector throughout the crisis.</p><p>  The temporary support was initially introduced for a period of 6-months in June 2020, however owing to the continued impact of Covid-19 on passenger numbers and the associated drop in fare revenue, these supports have been extended a number of times. Over &euro;60 million has been provided to the sector to date. In acknowledgment of the continuing difficulties facing this sector, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that I recently approved an extension of the supports for a further 3 months, up to the 30 June 2022. </p><p>As the Deputy is aware, fuel costs have increased substantially since the commencement of the Scheme in June 2020, and I wish to confirm that the NTA has funded the Operators for actual fuel costs throughout this period and will continue to do so throughout the extension of the Scheme.</p><p>Moreover, to ensure the continued operation of public transport services in rural parts of Ireland, the NTA have recently provided an additional level of subvention to support Local Link operators in the delivery of these services. These are provided to operators who are on fixed rate contracts and therefore are receiving no further increases to their base contracted rates. Currently, the funding has been provided to cover the costs for Quarter 1 2022. This is a once off payment initially, and the situation will be monitored on an ongoing basis.</p><p>Given the NTA's statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public passenger transport services nationally, I have also referred the Deputy's question to the NTA for direct reply. I ask the Deputy to please contact my private office if he does not receive a reply within 10 days.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-03-29a.522.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1578" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022032900062#WRL03900"><p>On 15 March 2022, the Government approved an emergency support measure - the Licensed Haulage Emergency Support Scheme to address cost pressures arising from current high fuel prices. </p>  <p>  The scheme was developed for licensed hauliers specifically for the reasons outlined below. My Department is aware there are approximately 20,000 own account HGV vehicles, therefore the cost to the Exchequer of including these would be an estimated additional c. &euro;16 million. Any amendments to the scheme would need to be considered in the overall policy and budgetary context. </p>  <p>  In deciding on this targeted, temporary scheme, the Government considered that the licensed haulage sector is a specific case for several reasons, primarily that the sector is of national strategic importance as a critical enabler of a functioning supply chain, bringing essential supplies into and around the State, supporting key infrastructure and enabling the maintenance of economic and social activity. In addition fuel represents a greater overall proportion of overhead cost for hauliers than would be the case for other businesses who self-provide transport as part of their wider business.</p>  <p>  Given the rapid increase in fuel prices linked to the crisis in Ukraine, the haulage sector reported to the Government a serious risk of cessation of business among haulage companies that would have had significant implications for supply chains into the State, including for essential goods.</p>  <p>  You will be aware that on 09 March 2022, in recognition of rising fuel costs for all citizens and businesses, the Government reduced Excise duty by 20 cent per litre of petrol, 15 cent per litre of diesel and 2 cent in the excise duty charged on marked gas oil in order to reduce the cost of fuels.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Finance has written to the European Commission to ask what flexibilities might be available on an emergency basis to reduce the tax on fuel. Currently, however, the EU Energy Tax Directive limits the possibility of further reducing the tax on fuel. Specifically, the Directive requires a minimum tax of &euro;0.33 per litre and the measures already decided have reduced the tax on diesel to the minimum.</p>  <p>  In general, it should be recalled that the causes of these fuel price pressures are not within the control of Government and are being directly influenced by external factors, including the Ukraine crisis.</p>  <p>  The Government has limited resources but through the Excise measure announced on 09 March, as well as the Licensed Haulage Emergency Support Scheme approved on 15 March 2022, it has responded to help to ease the impact of these price increases. However, we must accept that it will not be possible to insulate citizens and businesses from the full impact of these fuel price increases. In providing 8 weeks support with these sudden increased costs, the Government is seeking to cushion the shock of the rapid spike in fuel prices. While it remains to be seen how fuel prices evolve it is imperative that haulage (and other) businesses engage with their customers on the need for the prices for their services to reflect the increasing costs. </p></reply>

The EVPP Working Group comprises senior officials and has considered regulatory, financial, and taxation policies to help drive a significant ramp-up in passenger EVs and electric van sales.  The recommendations of the EVPP Working Group were approved by Government and the full report is now available online.</p>  <p>  In order to support the transition to EVs, the Group recommended that the generous suite of EV supports already in place in Ireland should be retained until at least end-2022. Additional measures to further incentivise EVs and/or disincentive fossil-fuelled vehicles will also be necessary. </p>  <p>  The report also recommended that an office for low emission vehicles should be established, as a matter of priority, to co-ordinate the implementation of existing and future EV measures and infrastructure. </p>  <p>  This new office  should also take charge of developing and launching an extensive communication and engagement campaign, whole-of-Government in coverage, to drive the availability and understanding of key information regarding EVs, tailored to household, business and public sector consumers.

This excludes costs incurred in relation to gluten free alcohol. In such cases, a letter from a doctor stating that the taxpayer is a coeliac sufferer is generally acceptable as proof of entitlement to tax relief on such costs. </p><p>However, as with all claims for tax relief, Revenue may ask the taxpayer to provide additional supporting documentation to prove his or her entitlement to the tax relief claimed. The type of information that a taxpayer will need to provide will depend on the nature of the expense incurred and the relief being claimed. </p><p>If a taxpayer is requested to provide receipts to support a claim for tax relief on the cost of gluten free foods, the receipts and documents provided by the taxpayer should contain sufficient information to satisfy the Revenue office dealing with the claim that the costs incurred by the taxpayer relate to foods which have been specifically manufactured to be gluten free. </p><p>I am advised that Revenue has had extensive engagement with the person concerned in relation to the health expenses claim made and has allowed relevant expenditure where it was demonstrated that such expenditure related to foods that were specifically manufactured to be gluten free.  Where this could not be demonstrated, the claim in respect of such expenditure was disallowed. </p><p>I note the comments of the person concerned regarding the fact that the leading multiples do not include any references to gluten free products on its receipts thereby making it difficult for a health expenses claimant to prove his/her entitlement to such relief.</p><p>However, it is understood that some multiples provide a service for coeliac sufferers to receive an annual statement showing details of any expenditure they incurred on specific gluten free products during the year.  This statement can be used to validate a claim for tax relief to Revenue.</p><p>I will ask my officials to discuss with Revenue whether there are possible additional means of verifying such claims or whether the Department of Health, which has primary responsibility in this area, may be able to assist in this regard.</p></reply>

The incentive gives a refund on Income Tax and Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) paid in the State over the previous four years, subject to limits outlined in the legislation. Section 477C Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997 outlines the definitions and conditions that apply to the HTB scheme.</p>  <p>  An increase in the supply of new housing is fundamental to resolving the current housing crisis.  The HTB scheme is specifically designed to encourage an increase in demand for new build homes in order to encourage the construction of an additional supply of such properties. A move to amend the scheme to include second-hand properties would not achieve this aim; on the contrary, it could serve to dilute the incentive effect required in terms of encouraging additional supply of new properties. </p>  <p>  In passing, I might note that the number of housing commencements for 2021 at over 30,700, and up from 21,686 in 2020, is encouraging. As the Deputies may be aware, the Housing for All Strategy has as a  target the construction of an average of at least 33,000 new homes per year out to 2030.</p>  <p>  Decisions regarding taxation measures are usually made in the context of the annual Budget and Finance Bill process. Such decisions must have regard to the sound management of the public finances and my Department's Tax Expenditure Guidelines. The guidelines make clear that any policy proposal which involves tax expenditures should only occur in limited circumstances where there are demonstrable market failures and where a tax-based incentive is more efficient than a direct expenditure intervention.</p>  <p>  Finally, as the Deputy may be aware, I announced in my Budget 2022 address that a formal review of the scheme will take place in 2022. The review will be fundamental in nature and will inform decisions for Budget 2023 and Finance Bill 2022. My Department has recently put the review exercise out to tender. </p></reply>

The ETD prescribes minimum tax rates for fuel with which all Member States must comply. ETD provisions on mineral oils are transposed into national law in Finance Act 1999 (as amended). Finance Act 1999 provides for the application of excise duty, in the form of Mineral Oil Tax (MOT), to specified mineral oils, such as petrol, diesel, and kerosene, that are used as motor or heating fuels. MOT is comprised of a non-carbon component and a carbon component. The carbon component is commonly referred to as carbon tax and the non-carbon component is often referred to as &ldquo;excise&rdquo;, &ldquo;fuel excise&rdquo; or &ldquo;fuel duty&rdquo;. In complying with ETD minimum rates, total MOT rates are taken into account.</p><p>I will deal with the Deputy&rsquo;s questions regarding MOT rates and ETD minimum rates for each of the fuel types individually.</p><p>Firstly, in relation to petrol the Deputy will be aware that, in response to the current fuel crisis, I recently introduced a significant reduction in the MOT rate effective from 10 March this year until the end of August. Inclusive of VAT this cut amounts to 20 cents on each litre of petrol. I also brought forward legislation in Finance Act 2021 to provide for a temporary reduction of 1 cent per litre inclusive of VAT to MOT on petrol. This reduction is to come into effect on 1 April and will run to 11 October this year.  I took this step to partially offset the expected rise in fuel costs arising from an increase in the Biofuel Obligation for transport fuels proposed by my colleague the Minister for Transport. MOT rates on petrol are summarised in the table below, along with comparisons with the ETD minimum rate.  <table>    <tr>       <th>Petrol rates/1,000L from</th>       <th>MOT non-carbon</th>       <th>MOT carbon </th>       <th>Total MOT</th>       <th>ETD minimum</th>       <th>MOT &amp;gt; ETD min by</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>13-Oct-21</td>       <td>&euro;541.84</td>       <td>&euro;94.87</td>       <td>&euro;636.71</td>       <td>&euro;359.00</td>       <td>&euro;277.71</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>10-Mar-22</td>       <td>&euro;379.24</td>       <td>&euro;94.87</td>       <td>&euro;474.11</td>       <td>&euro;359.00</td>       <td>&euro;115.11</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>01-Apr-22</td>       <td>&euro;371.11</td>       <td>&euro;94.87</td>       <td>&euro;465.98</td>       <td>&euro;359.00</td>       <td>&euro;106.98</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>01-Sep-22</td>       <td>&euro;533.71</td>       <td>&euro;94.87</td>       <td>&euro;628.58</td>       <td>&euro;359.00</td>       <td>&euro;269.58</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>12-Oct-22</td>       <td>&euro;541.84</td>       <td>&euro;112.23</td>       <td>&euro;654.07</td>       <td>&euro;359.00</td>       <td>&euro;295.07</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>With regards to auto-diesel, I recently introduced a reduction of 15 cents inclusive of VAT to the MOT rate effective from 10 March through to the end of August. This is in addition to the temporary reduction of 1 cent per litre inclusive of VAT, to offset biofuel costs, provided for in Finance Act 2021 and to come into effect on 1 April until 11 October this year.  These rate changes are summarised in the table below, along with comparisons with the ETD minimum rate.  <table>    <tr>       <th>Auto-diesel rates/1,000L   from</th>       <th>MOT non-carbon </th>       <th>MOT carbon</th>       <th>Total MOT</th>       <th>Effective MOT incl.

This means that the current effective MOT rate on auto-diesel is only marginally above the ETD minimum. From 1 April until 1 September 2022 the difference between the ETD minimum and the effective MOT rate on auto-diesel will be negligible; &euro;0.38/1,000 litres or 0.038 cents/litre.</p><p>Kerosene used for heating purposes attracts a reduced rate of MOT which is comprised entirely of a carbon component. The ETD minimum rate of taxation on kerosene used for heating purposes is set at zero. When introducing the 10-year carbon tax trajectory in 2020, I deliberately scheduled rate changes on heating fuels to come into effect at the end of the winter heating season. Therefore, the next scheduled increase in the carbon component of MOT on non-propellant fuels such as kerosene will come into effect on 1 May. The current kerosene MOT rate, the rate effective for one year from 1 May 2022 and comparison with the ETD minimum are set out in the table below. <table>    <tr>       <th>Kerosene rates/1,000L   from</th>       <th>MOT non-carbon</th>       <th>MOT carbon </th>       <th>Total MOT</th>       <th>ETD minimum</th>       <th>MOT &amp;gt; ETD min by</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>01-May-21</td>       <td>&euro;0.00</td>       <td>&euro;84.84</td>       <td>&euro;84.84</td>       <td>&euro;0.00</td>       <td>&euro;84.84</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>01-May-22</td>       <td>&euro;0.00</td>       <td>&euro;103.83</td>       <td>&euro;103.83</td>       <td>&euro;0.00</td>       <td>&euro;103.83</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Finally, while kerosene is the predominant oil used for heating, gas oil (diesel) is also used. Where gas oil is used for heating the ETD minimum tax rate is &euro;21.00 per 1,000 litres. Gas oil that qualifies for a reduced rate of MOT is marked green and is usually referred to as Marked Gas Oil (MGO) or green diesel. When providing for cuts to MOT rates earlier this month I reduced the rate on MGO by 2 cents per litre inclusive of VAT from 10 March. I also provided for the overall rate on MGO to be set at the 2021 level from 1 May until the end of August this year, instead of an increased rate legislated for in Finance Act 2020. These rates are detailed in the table below with ETD comparisons. <table>    <tr>       <th>MGO rates/1,000L from </th>       <th>MOT non-carbon</th>       <th>MOT carbon</th>       <th>Total MOT</th>       <th>ETD minimum</th>       <th>MOT &amp;gt; ETD min by</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>01-May-21</td>       <td>&euro;47.36</td>       <td>&euro;90.81</td>       <td>&euro;138.17</td>       <td>&euro;21.00</td>       <td>&euro;117.17</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>10-Mar-22</td>       <td>&euro;29.74</td>       <td>&euro;90.81</td>       <td>&euro;120.55</td>       <td>&euro;21.00</td>       <td>&euro;99.55</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>01-May-22</td>       <td>&euro;27.03</td>       <td>&euro;111.14</td>       <td>&euro;138.17</td>       <td>&euro;21.00</td>       <td>&euro;117.17</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>01-Sep-22</td>       <td>&euro;47.36</td>       <td>&euro;111.14</td>       <td>&euro;158.50</td>       <td>&euro;21.00</td>       <td>&euro;137.50</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>12-Oct-22</td>       <td>&euro;47.36</td>       <td>&euro;111.14</td>       <td>&euro;158.50</td>       <td>&euro;21.00</td>       <td>&euro;137.50</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>I am advised by Revenue that the cost of reducing MOT on petrol, auto-diesel, heating kerosene and MGO to the relevant ETD minima for periods to the end of August 2022 and to the end of December 2022 are estimated at the amounts set out in the table below.  The estimated costs of reducing MOT on auto-diesel are based on effective MOT rates to end 2022 which take account of the maximum DRS repayment rate of &euro;75.00/1,000 litres. As taxpayers are not required to provide details of their economic activity or supplies in their periodic tax returns it is not possible to provide the actual VAT loss due of these reductions. However, using tax returns and third-party data an estimate of the VAT loss is provided in the table below. <table>    <tr>       <th>Period</th>       <th>Petrol &euro;m</th>       <th>Auto-diesel &euro;m</th>       <th>Kerosene &euro;m</th>       <th>MGO &euro;m</th>       <th>VAT &euro;m</th>       <th>Total (VAT &amp;amp; MOT) &euro;m</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>To end August 2022</td>       <td>45</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>26</td>       <td>62</td>       <td>13</td>       <td>147</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>To end December 2022</td>       <td>132</td>       <td>176</td>       <td>74</td>       <td>114</td>       <td>44</td>       <td>540</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>I am further advised by Revenue that these estimates are based on levels of consumption in 2021, projected forward based on growth rates as anticipated by my Department in Budget 2022. Therefore, they may not fully reflect the current levels of uncertainty in the market for fuels. MGO is used for non-heating purposes, such as in agricultural tractors, and data broken down by usage type is not available. Therefore, the estimates for reducing MOT on MGO reflect all qualifying uses. </p><p>MOT receipts, including both carbon and non-carbon components, for all mineral oils for the years 2017 to 2020 are published on the Revenue website at: www.revenue.ie/en/corporate/documents/statistics/excise/net-receipts-by-commodity.pdf.</p><p>Current MOT rates for mineral oils and vehicle gas are published on the Excise Duty rates page on Revenue&rsquo;s website.

Revenue has advised me that most PAYE income tax returns are submitted online and any refunds due are generally paid to the taxpayer&rsquo;s bank account within three to five working days. Exceptions may occur where an income tax return is selected for further checking or where Revenue needs to contact the taxpayer to request further information in support of a claim. Paper returns are processed manually and may take slightly longer.</p>  <p>  Regarding the numbers of calls to the PAYE Helpline, Revenue has advised that the peak period for this service occurs during the early months of the year (January to April) when taxpayers submit their income tax returns for the previous year/s, claim any refunds or reliefs to which they are entitled, and check their tax credits for the current year. The service is currently answering between 3,500 and 4,500 calls per day while also responding to between 4,500 and 6,000 correspondence items per day. It is expected that the number of calls to the PAYE Helpline will reduce over the coming weeks as the peak period passes.</p>  <p>  To date in 2022, Revenue has processed over 835,000 income tax returns for PAYE taxpayers, answered over 175,000 calls to the PAYE Helpline, and dealt with over 300,000 items of correspondence. These calls and correspondence items relate to a broad variety of topics, including requests for assistance in completing the income tax return, clarifying a person&rsquo;s tax position for 2022 and requesting changes to personal details held on Revenue&rsquo;s records.</p>  <p>  Finally, if the Deputy is aware of a particular case that is experiencing delays, he should advise Revenue of the details via the Oireachtas Helpline so that the matter can be investigated and followed up as necessary with the taxpayer.</p></reply>

In general, the VAT Directive provides that all goods and services are liable to VAT at the standard rate, currently 23% in Ireland, unless they fall within categories of goods and services specified in the Directive, in respect of which Member States may apply a lower rate or exemption from VAT.  In addition, the Directive allows for historic VAT treatment to be maintained under certain conditions and Ireland has retained the application of VAT exemption to the transport of passengers and their accompanying baggage. This means that the supplier does not register for VAT, does not charge VAT on the supply of their services and has no VAT recovery entitlement on costs where such costs are used for the exempt supply of passenger transport.</p>  <p>  Ireland may continue to apply the VAT exemption on the supply of domestic passenger transport as governed by Article 371 of the VAT Directive; however, it cannot change the conditions under which the exemption was granted. In accordance with the Directive, a reduced rate of VAT (Ireland currently has two reduced VAT rates, 9% and 13.5%) could be introduced to the supply of passenger transport in place of the exemption that currently applies; this would give the transport operator deductibility in relation to VAT on their business inputs but would involve charging passengers VAT on their fares. </p>  <p>  In relation to Northern Ireland, the UK continues to apply the zero rate of VAT to the supply of passenger transport, with the exception of a taxi service which is standard rated, and suppliers established in the UK have an entitlement to deductibility on the costs relating to the supply of these services where the place of supply is the UK. This was a historic standstill provision for only the UK and could not be availed of by Ireland or other Member States. In addition, as the UK is no longer part of the EU, their VAT rates are not subject to the VAT Directive.  </p></reply>

Tax and Duty manual 23-01-36 provides an overview of how relief for the increase in the carbon tax on farm diesel operates, as is provided for by section 664A Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. </p>  <p>  The relief operates by allowing farmers, in computing their taxable farming profits, to claim a deduction for farm diesel in an amount equal to the difference between the carbon tax charged and the carbon tax that would have been charged had it been calculated at the rate of &euro;41.30 per 1,000 litres of farm diesel (the 2012 baseline).  This deduction is in addition to being able to claim a tax deduction for expenditure incurred on farm diesel (including any carbon tax charged in respect of the diesel.)  </p>  <p>  The &ldquo;carbon tax&rdquo; referred to in section 664A is the carbon component of Mineral Oil Tax for farm diesel, which was introduced on 1 May 2010.  The rate of the charge was last increased on 1 May 2021 and is to increase again on 1 May 2022.  I am informed by Revenue that it has updated Tax and Duty manual 23-01-36 to provide an additional example to demonstrate how the relief operates using the current rate of the carbon charge component.

It is a complex piece of legislation which has had to be extensively adapted to take account of the Supreme Court's decision in<i>Zalewski v.

This should foster a culture of personal accountability across the sector.</p><p>Restoring public trust in the financial sector is essential, not least for the sector itself. The Central Bank (Individual Accountability Framework) Bill will provide an effective framework, and will help to reassure the public that meaningful cultural change is underway. </p><p>The aim of this regime is to allocate responsibility and prevent misdemeanour, rather than being punitive. This framework is designed to improve governance and the management of risk and outcomes for consumers.</p><p>I intend to bring the Bill to Government for approval to publish it as soon as possible.</p></reply>

Where there is more than one lessor all the lessees must be unconnected with all of the lessors.   </p>  <p>  Connected persons is defined in section 10 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 and provides that &ldquo;a person shall be connected with an individual if that person is the individual&rsquo;s husband, wife or civil partner, or is a relative, or the husband, wife or civil partner of a relative, of the individual or of the individual&rsquo;s husband, wife or civil partner.&rdquo;  A relative for these purposes includes immediate family e.g. grandparents, parents, brothers, sisters, children, grandchildren, etc.</p>  <p>  The details supplied do not set out the full particulars of the familial relationship between the parties involved and, specifically the relationship between the father and the aunt.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-03-29a.591.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022032900063#WRM04700"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 273 to 277, inclusive, together.</p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s taxation of fuel is governed by European Union law as set out in Directive 2003/96/EC, commonly known as the Energy Tax Directive (ETD). The ETD prescribes minimum tax rates for fuel with which all Member States must comply. ETD provisions on mineral oils are transposed into national law in Finance Act 1999 (as amended) and this Act provides for the application of excise duty, in the form of Mineral Oil Tax (MOT), to specified mineral oils that are used as motor or heating fuels. MOT is comprised of a non-carbon component and a carbon component. The carbon component is commonly referred to as carbon tax and the non-carbon component is often referred to as &ldquo;excise&rdquo;, &ldquo;fuel excise&rdquo; or &ldquo;fuel duty&rdquo;. It is important to note that both components of MOT are excise. Total MOT rates are what are considered in terms of compliance with ETD minimum rates.</p><p>The Diesel Rebate Scheme (DRS) was introduced in 2013 with the aim of providing support to road haulage and bus transport operators when the retail price of auto diesel is relatively high. The DRS operates as a State Aid under Commission Regulation (EU) No 651/2014, commonly referred to as the General Block Exemption Regulation. The DRS allows qualifying operators to benefit from an effective lower rate of MOT than other auto-diesel users. While this application of a differentiated MOT rate on auto-diesel for certain commercial uses is allowed under Articles 7.2 and 7.3 of the ETD, the ETD minimum rate, currently &euro;330 per 1,000 litres, must still be complied with. This means that the effective MOT rate is what is considered in terms of compliance with ETD minimum. The effective MOT rate is determined by reducing the actual MOT rate by the maximum DRS repayment rate. </p><p>The DRS is provided for in section 99A of Finance Act 1999 and operates on a sliding scale basis, whereby a partial rebate of MOT is available when the retail price of a litre of diesel exceeds &euro;1.00 excluding VAT. The repayment rate increases gradually as the retail price increases, up to a maximum repayment rate of 7.5 cents per litre. Budget 2020 introduced enhancements to the DRS, whereby the marginal rate of repayment was increased from 30% to 60% at prices over &euro;1.07 per litre excluding VAT (&euro;1.32 incl. VAT). The rate of repayment is currently capped at 7.5 cents per litre. This cap is reached when the average price of diesel, excluding VAT, is &euro;1.16 or more per litre (&euro;1.43 incl. VAT). </p><p>The Deputy will be aware that in response to the current fuel crisis I recently introduced a reduction of 15 cents inclusive of VAT to the auto-diesel MOT rate effective from 10 March through to the end of August. This is in addition to the temporary reduction of 1 cent per litre inclusive of VAT which was provided for in Finance Act 2021 to partially offset expected rises in biofuel costs. This MOT cut will come into effect on 1 April and run until 11 October this year.  These rate changes are summarised in the table below, along with comparisons between actual and effective MOT rates and the ETD minimum rate.  <table>    <tr>       <th>Auto-diesel rates/1,000L from </th>       <th>MOT non-carbon</th>       <th>MOT carbon</th>       <th>Total MOT</th>       <th>Effective MOT incl.

This means that the current effective MOT rate on auto-diesel is only marginally above the ETD minimum by &euro;8.51 per 1,000 litres or 0.85 cents per litre. From 1 April until 1 September 2022 the difference between the effective MOT rate and the ETD minimum will be even less; &euro;0.38 per 1,000 litres or 0.038 cents per litre. The Deputy will appreciate that an increase of 0.038 cents per litre in the DRS repayment rate would be negligible. Any increase beyond 0.038 cents per litre during the period from 1 April to 1 September would be incompatible with EU law.</p><p>Regarding the costs of increasing the DRS repayment rate from 7.5 cents to 15, 20 and 25 cents, as already outlined any material increase in the repayment rate is currently not permissible under the ETD. I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, if repayment rates of 15, 20 and 25 cents were permissible, it is estimated that the additional costs to the end of 2022 would be in the region of &euro;30m, &euro;50m and &euro;70m respectively providing a total cost of &euro;60m, &euro;80m and &euro;100m respectively for a full year. These estimates are based on the most recently available data and assume the average price of auto-diesel remains above &euro;1.16 per litre excl. VAT (&euro;1.43 incl. VAT). </p><p>The Revenue Commissioners advise that the provisional cost for the Diesel Rebate scheme for 2021 is estimated at &euro;9.7m and costs for the years 2018 to 2020 are published on the Revenue website at the following link:</p><p>www.revenue.ie/en/corporate/documents/statistics/tax-expenditures/costs-tax-expenditures.pdf  </p><p>The Deputy has asked if consideration has been given to expanding the DRS to include other fuels such as compressed natural gas. Natural gas used as a propellant is subject to MOT and is referred to in legislation as vehicle gas. The current MOT rate on vehicle gas is &euro;9.36 per megawatt hour. This rate has been in place since its introduction in 2017 and is legislated to remain in place until May 2024. Under the ETD, the minimum rate of taxation required on propellant natural gas is &euro;9.36 per megawatt hour. Therefore, there is no scope to extend the DRS to include vehicle gas. In any event vehicle gas, unlike auto-diesel, is not covered by ETD provisions that allow for differentiated rates of taxation for commercial purposes. </p><p>The availability of the DRS is widely known across the sector. I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the number of operators registered for the DRS over the last four years are given in the table below along with the number of new registrations each year.  <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th>DRS Registrations</th>       <th>New DRS Registrations </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>2,490</td>       <td>119</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>2,581</td>       <td>93</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020</td>       <td>2,653</td>       <td>72</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021</td>       <td>2,901</td>       <td>249</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>I am further advised that the DRS is operated through Revenue Online Systems (ROS) and comprehensive details are published on Revenue&rsquo;s website, including how to register and claim online, qualifying criteria and repayment rates. Under the DRS a repayment may only be made to licensed road haulage and bus transport operators who purchase diesel in the State for use, in the course of their business, in qualifying motor vehicles. Qualifying road haulage vehicles include those with a maximum permissible gross laden weight of not less than 7.5 tonnes. Qualifying passenger transport vehicles include category M2 and M3 vehicles.</p><p>When registering, applicants must provide a copy of the relevant licence and either a valid Tax Clearance Certificate issued by Revenue or written proof of tax compliance in the form of a letter from the tax authority of another Member State where the operator&rsquo;s road licence was issued. Claims may only be made for auto-diesel purchased in the State in bulk (2,000 litres or more), or by using a fuel card approved by Revenue. Revenue may request supporting evidence to verify that the auto-diesel was dispensed to and used in a qualifying vehicle.  </p><p>Uptake of the scheme by qualifying operators (appropriately licensed, tax cleared and using auto diesel in qualifying vehicles) is clearly driven by fuel prices. The final quarter of last year saw fuel prices rise to a point where the DRS hit the maximum repayment rate of 7.5 cents per litre. Some registered have not made claims over the past two years despite rising fuel prices, which may be partly explained by a downturn in business during the Covid-19 pandemic. I understand that Revenue is currently engaged in contacting registered operators who have not recently submitted DRS claims to remind them of the availability of the scheme. In this regard, 243 letters issued to operators in late 2021 and a further approximate 1,100 will issue in the coming weeks.</p><p>Finally, I must point out that the European Commission&rsquo;s proposal for the revision of the ETD envisage the removal of some tax exemptions, reliefs and reduced rates that essentially act as fossil fuel subsidies. The ETD proposals are a key pillar of the Commission&rsquo;s Fit for 55 legislative package which is aimed at reducing net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030.</p></reply>

The purpose of this acquisition was to facilitate the development of a Family Court complex and office accommodation for the Court Service.</p>  <p>  In relation to the current use of the site, the OPW was approached in 2019 by the developers of an adjoining site to request temporary use as a building compound.  In October 2019, the Commissioners entered into a licence agreement with the contractor for a period of 1 year with 2 possible extensions of 6 months each permitted.  A licence fee of &euro;50,000 was payable for the duration of the licence.  In October 2021, the OPW extended the licence for a further 12 month period at the request of the developers.  A licence fee of &euro;50,000 was payable for this extension. </p>  <p>  It is envisaged that the site will ultimately transfer to the Courts Service to address the need for improved court accommodation for family law cases in Dublin.  The development proposed for the site will provide a purpose built facility where family law cases can be dealt with in a dignified, secure and non-threatening environment with all required support services to hand.  The complex is being designed with the needs of family law users in mind and is cognisant of reforms proposed in the Family Courts Bill and the Courts Service modernisation programme. </p></reply>

Unfortunately, the toilets were subject to considerable anti-social behaviour and arson, which  led to the decision by DCC to close them to the public. OPW will examine the building block in question and will develop a plan to refurbish. It is unclear what might ultimately be possible at this location but we will endeavour to provide toilet and caf&eacute; facility if at all possible.</p>  <p>  It should also be noted that there are permanent tearooms at three locations in the Park and the OPW is also considering a mobile unit to serve teas, coffees etc at the Papal Cross. This is due to tender in the coming weeks. I can also advise that there are several toilet facilities located within the Park and these are all open during daylight hours where cleaning staff provide passive surveillance and security. </p></reply>

The bulk of the savings have been achieved through a large scale staff energy awareness campaign (<i>Optimising Power @ Work</i>). Launched in 2008 the campaign operates in over 275 large Central Government buildings (this covers approximately 80% of the energy usage in the OPW portfolio).  Average energy savings of over 25% have been achieved through this initiative.</p><p>Since 2017, the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communication (DECC) through the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) have provided significant funding for energy efficiency retrofit projects in central government buildings. The programme is a joint venture between DECC/SEAI and OPW.  The energy retrofits carried out, mainly comprised lighting, heating and controls systems upgrades.</p><p>The OPW is currently working with SEAI to secure additional funding (&euro;20M) over a 3-year period for deeper energy retrofit pathfinder projects in OPW buildings. In addition to the type of upgrades carried out in the previous programme, the new projects will also include substantial building fabric and air tightness upgrades. The energy standard that will be required in these projects will be to achieve a minimum BER B after the energy retrofit works are complete.</p><p>The table attached, shows the office buildings managed by the Office of Public Works (owned and leased) which are occupied by the various Government Departments and agencies, the Display Energy Certificate energy rating (where available) and the amounts to date received under the DECC/SEAI/OPW public sector energy efficiency programme.</p></reply>

Its core proposition is that participation in arts, culture and heritage-based activities drives personal and collective creativity, with significant implications for individual and societal wellbeing and achievement.</p><p>Under the <i>Creative Communities</i>initiative in the Creative Ireland Programme, my Department and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage provide funding to each of the 31 local authorities to enable them to implement their individual Culture and Creativity Strategies 2018-2022.  These Strategies were developed in 2017 following extensive local public consultation and are unique to each local authority, reflecting the breadth of cultural and creative work being undertaken in each area as well as the strategic priorities identified by the local community.  </p><p>Each of the local authorities established a Culture and Creativity Team led by a Creative Ireland Coordinator to oversee implementation of their Strategy.  The cross-functional Culture and Creativity Teams (including Arts Officers, Heritage &amp;amp; Biodiversity Officers, Librarians, Archivists, Conservation Officers, Irish Language Officers, Local Enterprise Offices) is a unique model, providing local authorities with an agile and adaptable resource to address locally-relevant priorities.</p><p>Each local authority through their Culture and Creativity Team is responsible for programming community-led initiatives and administering their delivery as a way of implementing their Culture and Creativity Strategies.  This often involves individual local authorities operating public grant funding schemes.  Based on all the information available, I understand that the grant scheme referred to may be operated by Mayo County Council.  That being the case, any queries concerning the administration of the scheme would need to be directed to Mayo County Council in the first instance.  Relevant contacts for their Culture and Creativity Team are available online at www.creativeireland.gov.ie/en/mayo/. </p><p>Through the Creative Ireland Programme, I welcome the fact that funding of over &euro;790,000 has been provided to support Mayo County Council implement its Culture and Creativity Strategy 2018-2022 and associated community-led projects.  I am delighted that Government has recently decided in principle to extend the Creative Ireland Programme for another 5-year period.  I look forward to supporting each local authority as they lead the development of a new Culture and Creativity Strategy 2023-2027 in the months ahead.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-03-29a.684.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022032900065#WRO02400"><p>A review of homeless deaths was undertaken on behalf of the Dublin Region Homeless Executive by Dr Austin O&rsquo;Carroll.  The review analysed the available data concerning deaths in homeless services for 2020 to identify learning for homeless and health services that could help tailor the provision of care to homeless people. This &lsquo;Interim Report on Mortality in Single Homeless Population 2020&rsquo; was completed in June 2021.  </p><p>In the report, Dr O&rsquo;Carroll notes that the most important step in reducing mortality amongst the homeless population is the reduction of long-term homelessness.  The report notes that the Housing First model is &ldquo;the optimum approach to achieve this objective&rdquo;.  Housing First enables homeless individuals with high levels of complex needs to obtain permanent secure accommodation with the provision of intensive housing and health supports to help them maintain their tenancies. <i>Housing for All</i>commits to the continued expansion of Housing First, with more than 1,300 additional Housing First tenancies planned over the next five years. This will ensure that Housing First continues to operate and expand in every county of Ireland. It will involve an average of 264 new tenancies per annum, with the specific annual targets for each region now set out in the plan.  This comes on the heels of the first Housing First National Implementation, which completed in December 2021, exceeding its four-year target by over 90 additional tenancies.</p><p>The report makes recommendations in the areas of data collection and analysis, and a pilot study on data collection of homeless deaths nationally is being undertaken by the Health Research Board on behalf of the Department of Health. The research is applying the methodology used to compile the National Drug Related Deaths Index, which is a census of drug-related deaths and deaths among drug users and those who are alcohol dependent in Ireland. The data collection for 2019 deaths, including deaths among people who were homeless, involves the review of approximately 17,000 files from all Coroner districts. My Department continues to engage with the Department of Health and the Health Research Board on this study.</p><p>Dr. O&rsquo;Carroll&rsquo;s report also identifies that co-operation between different agencies and service providers is of critical importance. Under <i>Housing for All</i>, a new National Homeless Action Committee has been established. All of the key Government departments, agencies and stakeholders are involved.  The overarching objective of the Committee is to ensure that a renewed emphasis is brought to collaborating across Government to implement actions in Housing for All, along with bringing better coherence and coordination of homeless-related services in delivering policy measures and actions to address homelessness. Beyond this, the Committee will also have a role in addressing emerging homeless-related issues and in developing further responses.</p><p>The improvement of health outcomes for socially excluded groups in society is a key priority for Government. The HSE, through its National Service Plan 2022, has identified priority action areas with regard to healthcare services for people who are homeless. Among these are:</p><p>-the development of a single integrated homeless case management team for Dublin that will provide integrated individual assessment, case management, care planning and co-ordination;</p><p>-  the implementation of the health actions in Housing for All for people who are homeless including those in addiction, in order to provide the most appropriate primary care and specialist addiction / mental health services for their needs;</p><p>- continued support of the roll-out of specific harm reduction approaches such as opioid substitution treatment and increased naloxone provision;</p><p>-  the development of a stepped model of mental healthcare for homeless population in Dublin in collaboration with mental health services.</p><p>It is important to note Dr O'Carroll's report was interim pending the examination of Coroner's files, and it has been agreed that the DRHE and Dr O'Carroll should liaise with the Health Research Board to examine these files. The Health Research Board will be the first point of contact for future research in this area.</p><p>My Department is working closely with the Department of Health, the HSE and local authorities to continue to deliver the appropriate measures to support all individuals experiencing homelessness including those with complex needs.</p></reply>

It has been available nationwide from local authorities since 4 January 2022. The loan can be used both for new and second-hand properties, or to self-build. It is the successor to the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan.</p>  <p>  The local authority mortgage protection insurance (MPI) scheme has applied to all house purchase loans approved by local authorities after 1 July 1986, including the Local Authority Home Loan.</p>  <p>  One of the conditions of the MPI scheme, which is a group policy, is that it is obligatory for all local authority borrowers who meet the eligibility criteria to join, and remain in, the scheme. A local authority housing loan applicant, who is not eligible for the local authority MPI scheme, must source a suitable comparable individual MPI policy from the market.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that there are a number of differences between the local authority MPI scheme and standard MPI products available on the market.  Most notably, the current local authority MPI covers mortgage repayments in case of borrower disability, which is not part of standard MPI. In addition, the local authority MPI scheme offers a single group rate per &euro;1,000 sum assured to all participants in the scheme as opposed to standard MPI products that are individually priced based on a member&rsquo;s age, amongst other factors. </p>  <p>  In summary, the local authority scheme provides benefits not typically available under standard MP products;</p>  <p>- Mortgage repayments are paid if there is a valid claim as a result of disability;</p>  <p>- Separate to life cover, an additional &euro;3,000 is payable in the event of a member&rsquo;s death;</p>  <p>- Members are covered for death up to age 75, where as standard MPI cover usually ceases at the age of 65.</p>  <p>  The scheme is subject to periodic review and competitive tendering in accordance with the terms of EU Directives relating to the award of public service contracts. This is to ensure that the most appropriate cover at the best value for money is secured for local authority borrowers over the entire life of their mortgages.</p>  <p>  The most recent public procurement competition for the provision and administration of this MPI scheme was conducted by the Local Government Management Agency. The contract resulting from this open tender competition came into effect from 1 January 2022 and is due to expire on 31 December 2022. My Department will review the provision and administration of the MPI scheme prior to that date.</p></reply>

It is expected that approximately 36,500 of those homes will be local authority owned homes. The EERP is the programme specifically designed for retrofitting local authority housing stock.</p>  <p>  The 2021 Programme saw a significant increase in the maximum grant available per property from &euro;38,900 for mid-terrace and apartment type properties to &euro;45,400 for end of terrace/detached/semi-detached properties. Local authorities were made aware however of the requirement to ensure that the average property cost does not exceed &euro;27,000 in order to ensure that the delivery target was met. This figure is exclusive of project management fees which were recoupable from the Department and provided additional funding of up to &euro;3,000 per dwelling over and above the &euro;27,000 average.</p>  <p>  The Energy Efficiency Retrofit Programme is grant funded at 100% of costs where local authorities take a pragmatic approach to the selection of properties for retrofitting and the design specification applied and operate within the limits of the line item caps as outlined in Circular 8/2021. </p>  <p>  As part of the 2021 process Cork City Council were provided a target of 123 properties for retrofitting. It is the responsibility of the local authority to choose the properties to be retrofitted based on their targets. Local authorities were urged to choose a mix of properties, requiring varying levels of retrofit, when setting out their works programme. Properties in the Churchfield area were selected and submitted to the Department for consideration as part of their 2021 energy efficiency programme and these were approved by my Department. Unfortunately Cork City Council did not complete work on the targeted properties in 2021. I understand that Cork City Council has tendered for and selected a supplier for 110 of the 123 properties approved under the 2021 programme and these will be re-approved under the 2022 programme.</p>  <p>  Budget 2022 has provided a significantly increased budget of &euro;85 million for the Energy Efficiency Retrofit Programme this year which will allow for 2,400 local authority homes to be targeted for upgrade to a Building Energy Rating (BER) of B2 or cost optimal equivalent level. </p></reply>

The strategy sets out, over four pathways, a broad suite of measures to achieve its policy objectives together with a financial commitment of in excess of &euro;4 billion per annum.</p>  <p>  Housing for All commits to a range of measures to address vacancy and maximise the use of existing housing stock including plans to introduce a new programme for the Compulsory Purchase Order (CPO) of vacant properties to ensure their use for residential purposes. While the concept of a Compulsory Sales Order is not included in Housing for All, it may be considered in the context of a wider review of CPO legislation. In the meantime, the detailed arrangements for the CPO programme are currently being developed, with aim of advancing it this year, and it will build on the experience of many Local Authorities that already utilise CPO acquisitions, for example, in their delivery of new social homes through the Buy and Renew scheme.</p></reply>

The target for the HAA fund was to acquire 1,600 units over a four year period to 2020 with this target subsequently extended out to 2021. </p>  <p>  This fund has enabled the Housing Agency to actively engage with banks and investment companies in relation to the acquisitions of properties. Through the provision of direct access to capital funding for the Housing Agency, the aim was to simplify the current acquisition process for vacant portfolio purchases; speed up the acquisition process and to encourage investors to make additional supply available. The HAA fund is replenished by the Housing Agency through the sale of units primarily to the Approved Housing Body (AHB) sector and the funds received are recycled back into the fund for future acquisitions. </p>  <p>  This was intended to be a short term to medium term initiative, targeting the vacant property portfolios of financial institutions and investment companies, in direct response to the social housing shortage that would be designed to complement, not displace, ongoing targeted acquisition activity by local authorities and AHBs.</p>  <p>  As at Q3 2021, 888 units were delivered under the Housing Agency Acquisitions fund programme and an additional 562 properties were acquired by the Housing Agency Acquisitions team on behalf of local authorities. The number of homes acquired though the HAA fund and made available to AHBs under Caretaker Lease are included in my Department's overall quarterly reporting which is available at the following link: </p>  <p>www.housing.gov.ie/housing/social-housing/social-and-affordble/overall-social-housing-provision.  </p>  <p>  The Department does not have a record of the number of vacant residential properties currently in the possession of banking institutions in Ireland. The Housing Agency continues to engage with financial institutions and it is clear that the supply of properties that the fund was established to acquire has substantially declined. Under Housing For All, a review of the Housing Agency Acquisitions fund is under way and will be completed shortly.   </p>  <p>  There are also a range of measures in Pathway 4 of Housing for All which are designed to address vacancy. One of these measures is a Compulsory Purchase Order (CPO) Programme for vacant properties. This aims to support local authorities in using CPO procedures to acquire vacant properties that will then be sold on the open market. 2,500 properties is the target under this initiative and this will be in addition to properties local authorities might purchase under a CPO for social housing use. The initiative would apply to any suitable vacant property so although it is not specifically targeted at bank controlled properties, it may encompass vacant properties controlled by the banks.</p></reply>

Galway; impact from agriculture in Lilliput, Co. Westmeath; a combination of sewage discharges and misconnections from domestic plumbing systems, birds and other animals, and contaminated surface streams in Balbriggan, Co. Dublin; and unusually high rainfall events impacted Cuas Crom, Co. Kerry, with no clear pollution source evident. </p>  <p>  The relevant local authorities have management plans in place detailing the actions required to mitigate theses impacts. Where waste water is deemed to be an issue the local authorities continue to liaise closely with both the EPA and Irish Water and these actions have been, or are currently being implemented. </p>  <p>  Excellent work is being carried out by each of our local authorities and other stakeholders on the continued improvements in our bathing water quality. To protect bathers' health and ensure that public have access to bathing water amenities it is important that the network of bathing waters is strengthened and enhanced and we continue to see new beaches identified each year.  </p>  <p>  The European Commission reviews the implementation of the Bathing Water Directive by Member States with the last review undertaken in 2018. This review found that Ireland is fundamentally in line with the provisions of the Directive. The Commission recommended that Ireland improve the provision of information on algae and short-term pollution. This has since been put in place. The report concluded that Ireland offers several good practices demonstrating how the Directive can be effectively implemented in practice. The next EPA Bathing Water Quality, in relation to 2021, is due to be published in May 2022. </p>  <p>  The bathing season under the Bathing Water Regulations is from the 1 June to 15 September each year. There has been a call to have a longer bathing season in some areas. In response, I have met with stakeholders and I have asked the National Bathing Water Expert Group, chaired by officials in my Department, to consider the matter, including bathing water monitoring data, and make recommendations on how best to protect bathers&rsquo; health outside of the current bathing water season and what additional measures may be necessary.</p>  <p>  The Expert Group have developed a questionnaire for the public, and a questionnaire for local authorities, to determine who is bathing during the winter months, where this bathing is occurring and the expectations of winter bathers. This information, to be gathered within the coming two months, will inform the development of guidance for bathers outside of the current bathing water season, and assist in informing the Expert Group if any additional changes, including regulatory and/or monitoring changes, are required. This assessment is ongoing and I have asked the Expert Group to report back to me in time for the outputs to be implemented ahead of the close of the designated bathing season in September 2022.</p></reply>

My Department and local authorities administer a number of funding programmes to assist AHBs with the cost of building, acquiring and leasing new social housing units.</p>  <p>  The Capital Advance Leasing Facility (CALF) funding is capital support provided to AHBs by local authorities to facilitate the funding of construction, acquisition or refurbishment of new social housing units.

Repayments on either the capital or interest are not required during the term of the loan (between 10 and 30 years), although where an AHB chooses to, repayments can be made during the term. At the end of the term, the outstanding capital amount plus the interest accrued, is owed and repayable to the local authority. The local authority issues the CALF monies to the AHB and the local authority, in turn, recoups same from the Department. The remainder of the capital cost is sourced by the AHB through other borrowings, to which the local authorities are not party. </p>  <p>  At the end of 2021, a total of 11,243 dwellings were supported under the Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP) under Payment and Availability agreements relating to units delivered under the Capital Advanced Loan Facility (CALF).

The Local Government Act 1946 provides that where a property is unoccupied on the date of the making of the rate, the owner becomes liable for rates. However, the owner is entitled to a refund if the property is vacant for specified purposes, these being if the premises are unoccupied for the purpose of additions, alterations or repairs; where the owner is bona fide unable to obtain a suitable tenant at a reasonable rent; and where the premises are vacant pending redevelopment. The collection of rates and the determination of eligibility for a refund in this context are matters for each individual local authority.</p><p>The Local Government Reform Act 2014 gives discretion to the elected members of individual local authorities to vary the level of rates refunds that apply in individual local electoral areas within the authority&rsquo;s administrative area.  The Act allows local authorities to offer less than 100% refund and to vary the level of refund for vacant properties at its annual budget meeting.

This includes the provision of units or properties required for self isolation or shielding units for those medically vulnerable to Covid-19.</p>  <p>  The ongoing need for such services is an operational issue for consideration by the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive (DRHE) in consultation with the HSE. From a strategic perspective, in the context of the overall response to Covid-19, my Department is in regular contact with local authorities to ensure sufficient bed capacity is available to facilitate the isolation of suspected or confirmed cases that arise in homeless services. </p>  <p>  Over the course of the pandemic a strong collaborative working relationship has been established between the HSE and the DRHE which was successful in reducing Covid-19 transmission. It is important that this collaborative way of working continues post-pandemic to ensure that service delivery is appropriate to the needs of those in emergency accommodation.  </p></reply>

In general, the operation of emergency accommodation facilities is contracted out by local authorities, under service level agreements, to NGOs involved in the delivery of homeless services.  As a number of facilities are operated privately in the Dublin Region, the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive have adapted the NQSF standards in order to apply their provisions to private emergency accommodation.  These standards are being applied to private emergency accommodation, with the owner / operator responsible for the physical standards and the visiting support teams responsible for the support and case management standards.

I note that the Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court opened an investigation into the situation in Palestine in March 2021 and that the Court has jurisdiction over crimes against humanity, amongst other alleged international crimes that have occurred in the occupied Palestinian territory since June 2013. Ireland is a party to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court and views the Court as the cornerstone of the system of international criminal justice.</p></reply>

In addition, 45% of adult online renewal applications are processed in one working day.</p><p>The current passport processing times are:</p><p>- 10 working days for Simple Adult online renewals</p><p>- 15 working days for Complex or child online renewals</p><p>- 35 working days for First Time Applications on Passport Online</p><p>- 8 weeks for An Post&rsquo;s mail-in &ldquo;Passport Express&rdquo; service</p><p>There are currently over 171,000 applications in the Passport Service system. While there is a very high volume of applications, this does not represent a backlog. These applications are all being processed in the usual way, with a continuous stream of new applications and a continuous dispatch of completed passports happening every day.</p><p>Figures show that of the total number of applications in the system, 61% are fully complete and are being processed by the Passport Service. The other 39% of applications in the system are incomplete, which means the Passport Service is waiting for the applicant to submit the necessary documentation required. While the Passport Service makes every effort to contact applicants in such circumstances, their experience is that many applicants take weeks and sometimes months to send in the necessary documents.</p><p>First time passport applications do take longer to process than renewal applications and there are a number of reasons for this. First time applications are necessarily complex to process, since, in many cases, they are applications for Irish citizenship. The Passport Service must validate the true identity of the applicant and take measures to confirm the applicant&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship. It is the statutory responsibility of the Passport Service to protect the integrity of the Irish passport. Accordingly, a rigorous analysis process is in place to verify the identity and citizenship status of first time applicants.</p><p>In the case of first time passport applications for children, the consent of guardians must also be thoroughly validated. </p><p>I strongly urge anyone who is considering travelling overseas this year, particularly families with young children, to check the validity of their passports before booking travel and to apply for their passports online in plenty of time.</p></reply>

Building on an initial focus on students from Africa, in 2009 the Ireland Fellows Programme was extended to Vietnam.  Following the publication of the A Better World policy on international development in 2019, the Programme was further enlarged to include students from the occupied Palestinian territory, and in 2020-2021, from Small Island Developing States (SIDS).</p>  <p>  Fellowships are awarded to 25 students from the occupied Palestinian territory each year.  Ireland&rsquo;s funding to the Palestinian people has traditionally had a strong focus on education, which is crucial to Palestine&rsquo;s long-term economic viability.</p>  <p>  The objective of the Ireland Fellows Programme is to help to build a cohort of people with the potential to become leaders in their home country and contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. Courses within the Programme are aligned with Ireland&rsquo;s policy for international development, A Better World. The Fellowship award covers course fees, accommodation, living costs, and flights. The Ireland Fellows Programme promotes gender equality, equal opportunities, and welcomes diversity and alumni are invited to stay connected with Ireland, and with each other, after returning home.</p>  <p>  The process of selecting Fellows for the 2022-23 academic year &ndash; including those from the occupied Palestinian territory - is underway and expected to conclude in June 2022. Applications for the 2023-24 academic year are expected to open in September 2022.</p></reply>

As currently drafted, the Bill would provide that the UK&rsquo;s immigration rules may require that non-Irish and non-British citizens obtain an ETA before travelling to the UK, including for journeys across the land border with Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  The movement of people on the island of Ireland, particularly in border areas, is unique, with tens of thousands of people crossing the border every day in the course of their daily lives, including to access essential services, for business, and for family reasons. It is a uniquely shared space. This is something which the Irish and British Governments recognised and committed to supporting in Strand 2 of the Good Friday (Belfast) Agreement.</p>  <p>  The introduction of the proposed ETA scheme for cross-border journeys would cause considerable disruption to the lives and livelihoods of many people across the island who are not Irish or British citizens, particularly those residing in border areas. The scheme could have a significant impact on tourism in Northern Ireland, with many tourists first arriving here before travelling onward to Northern Ireland or including a destination in Northern Ireland as part of their itinerary. There are potential implications also for cross-border healthcare, education, and integrated supply chains.</p>  <p>  It is regrettable that MPs in the House of Commons voted last week against an amendment from the House of Lords, which would have exempted cross-border journeys to Northern Ireland from the proposed ETA requirements.</p>  <p>  Our Government has been engaging with the British Government at both official and political level to make clear our concerns with regard to the ETA scheme. Most recently, I met with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the Minister of State for Northern Ireland at the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference in Dublin. During our meeting, I expressed the Government&rsquo;s serious concerns with regard to the draft Bill&rsquo;s ETA provisions as they relate to Northern Ireland. I highlighted the complexities that the implementation of such a scheme would present in the context of cross-border travel on the island of Ireland, as well as the serious implications for daily lives and livelihoods on this island. Senior officials in my Department continue to engage with their British Government counterparts with respect to these concerns. </p>  <p>  This legislation is not yet finalised and will continue to be debated in Westminster. For our part, we will continue to engage on the issue and emphasise our serious concerns, with a view to finding a satisfactory resolution which addresses them. </p></reply>

Our efforts  are aimed at bringing an end to this war, ensuring accountability for violations of international humanitarian and human rights law and meeting the humanitarian needs of those caught in the conflict.</p>  <p>  The UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine was deployed in 2014 and operates at the invitation of the Government of Ukraine to monitor, report and advocate on the human rights situation in the country, with a particular focus initially on the conflict area in eastern Ukraine and the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol, occupied by the Russian Federation.</p>  <p>  Since 24 February 2022, when the Russian Federation began its armed attack on Ukraine, the Mission has been closely monitoring its impact on human rights across the country.</p>  <p>  Ireland has prioritised the issue of Ukraine at the ongoing 49th session of the Human Rights Council. On 2nd March, at the high level segment of the session, I focused on the situation in Ukraine, calling for an immediate ceasefire, unconditional withdrawal of Russian forces, full respect for human rights and the holding to account of all perpetrators of violations and abuses of human rights.</p>  <p>  Ireland strongly supported support Ukraine&rsquo;s formal request for an Urgent Debate at the Human Rights Council. Ireland was also an original co-sponsor of the resolution on the situation of human rights in Ukraine, adopted by the Human Rights Council on 4th March, establishing a Commission of Inquiry on the alleged abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian law in the context of Russia&rsquo;s aggression against Ukraine.  </p>  <p>  On 25 March, Ireland joined a Group of Friends of Accountability to ensure that those who commit crimes as part of Russia's invasion are held fully accountable. </p>  <p>  We remain fully committed to maintaining a strong, united approach across multilateral fora, to highlight violations and abuses of human rights, and to hold the perpetrators to account.</p></reply>

These supplies have already been transported by Defence Forces personnel to a Polish logistics hub which was established for the co-ordination, administration and delivery of military equipment (lethal and non-lethal), from donating EU Member States and third countries to Ukraine. This contribution comes from existing Defence Forces&rsquo; stocks and forms a specific element of Ireland&rsquo;s support via the European Peace Facility towards the provision of non-lethal equipment.</p>  <p>  As regards the provision of lethal equipment, the Programme for Government clearly states that Ireland will not fund lethal equipment through the EPF. This is the basis on which Ireland&rsquo;s involvement in the EPF was decided by the Government and agreed with our EU partners.  Ireland's entire financial contribution to the EPF measures will, therefore, be used for the provision of non-lethal equipment for the armed forces of Ukraine.  </p>  <p>  To date, the Government (through the Department of Foreign Affairs) has contributed approx. &euro;11 million through the European Peace Facility to the EU&rsquo;s initial package of &euro;500 million in military assistance for Ukraine. This support has now been doubled to &euro;1 billion and Ireland will now contribute a further &euro;11 million, all of which will go towards non-lethal elements.</p>  <p>  The Irish Government is also providing &euro;20 million in humanitarian aid, as well as medical supplies.

This includes supporting the wellbeing and social and emotional needs of these young people. </p>  <p>  In line with research on best practice, guidance from the  National Educational Psychology Service (NEPS), the HSE and the Psychological Society of Ireland, the Department is taking a Psychological First Aid approach to supporting wellbeing in our schools at this time.  Instead, these children/young people and their families need to be given time to adapt and adjust to their new environment, new home, new school, and to be given access to practical supports, clear information and assistance to settle in and make friends. NEPS has developed guidance for schools on how best to welcome children and support their wellbeing at this time.  This guidance is based on the provision of a psycho-social response of promoting a sense of safety, calm, connectedness, efficacy and hope. These are key evidence-based principles known to help people regain a sense of normalcy and wellbeing in the aftermath of emergencies/traumatic events.  Schools are familiar with these principles of support, as they formed the basis of the Department&rsquo;s response to supporting wellbeing during the Covid-19 pandemic. Children and young people will do better in the long term if they feel safe, calm and hopeful, if they feel a sense of belonging and connectedness to their new school, and they feel that they can manage and cope.  Applying these five principles will help the school community, in its own unique way, to foster these children&rsquo;s and young people&rsquo;s resilience.</p>  <p>  NEPS will develop further advice and resources, as appropriate, including a webinar for school staff. NEPS psychologists are available on the ground to consult with schools and provide support as needed.</p>  <p>  Children and their families arriving from Ukraine need to be given time to adapt and adjust to their new environment, new home, new school, and to be given access to practical supports, clear information and assistance to settle in and make friends.  Counselling or psychological debriefing are not recommended at this time.  Many of these children and young people will show remarkable resilience now that they are in a safer place and psychosocial supports are in place, but for some recovery will take longer. The Department of Health has responsibility for the provision of mental health services in Ireland, and through HSE Primary Care Psychology and Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) provides clinical support to children and young people with mental health needs.  This Department will continue to signpost schools and students to the HSE/HSE-funded mental health services.</p></reply>

Schools were not required to apply for inclusion in the DEIS programme and the model has been applied fairly and equally to all schools </p>  <p>  Schools that have not been included in the DEIS programme at this time will have an opportunity to have that decision reviewed. My Department will provide further information in the coming days on this appeals process on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p></reply>

This continuum extends from placement in a mainstream class with the necessary additional teaching and care supports through to placement in a special class or special school depending on the complexity of need.</p>  <p>  The Special Education Teaching (SET) allocation aims to provide the necessary additional teaching support for children with special educational needs in mainstream settings.   </p>  <p>  Since 2017, SET allocations are frontloaded into schools at the commencement of each school year.  This removed the need for individual student diagnosis and in that way simplified and streamlined the allocation process.  It also facilitates the enrolment of new children during the year. A school is required to deploy the SET allocation so that those students with the greatest needs receive the greatest level of support and guidance has issued to schools in this regard. </p>  <p>  SET allocations are determined on the basis of an education profile of each school which takes account of a range of factors including enrolment, number of children with complex needs, student learning achievement and social status of school.  The provision of an SET allocation is designed to give a fair allocation to each school.  </p>  <p>  Where a school&rsquo;s circumstances change in a material way, a school can request a review of its allocation from the National Council for Special Education (NCSE).</p>  <p>  The Special Needs Assistant (SNA) scheme is designed to provide schools with additional adult support staff who can assist children with special educational needs who also have additional and significant care needs.  Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.</p>  <p>  SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school.  It should be noted that not every student with a special educational need requires SNA support. </p>  <p>  Where a school considers that it requires additional SNA support to meet the needs of its students, it can seek a review from the NCSE. </p>  <p>  I understand that the school in question has sought a review of both its SET and SNA allocations.  The application for a SET review is currently being considered.  The review of the SNA allocation has been concluded and in accordance with the terms of the SNA scheme, no additionality has been granted to the school.</p></reply>

It is planned that further material will be added to supplement what is already available.</p>  <p>  A central repository of information and CPD resources for school leaders and teachers to support cultural and linguistic diversity is being developed on the Scoilnet.ie website that schools are familiar with. These supports to include those designed by the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) to help children suffering from trauma and EAL, intercultural and relevant curriculum supports developed by the teacher education supports services including PDST, the NCCA and the ETB sector</p>  <p>  My Department is also working to identify and prepare arrangements to address the needs of the primary and post-primary school-aged children arriving from Ukraine,  including supporting the wellbeing and social and emotional needs of these young people. </p>  <p>  In line with research on best practice, guidance from NEPS, the HSE and the Psychological Society of Ireland, the Department is taking a Psychological First Aid approach to supporting wellbeing in our schools at this time.  Instead, these children/young people and their families need to be given time to adapt and adjust to their new environment, new home, new school, and to be given access to practical supports, clear information and assistance to settle in and make friends. NEPS has developed guidance for schools on how best to welcome children and support their wellbeing at this time.  This guidance is based on the provision of a psycho-social response of promoting a sense of safety, calm, connectedness, efficacy and hope. These are key evidence-based principles known to help people regain a sense of normalcy and wellbeing in the aftermath of emergencies/traumatic events.  Schools are familiar with these principles of support, as they formed the basis of the Department&rsquo;s response to supporting wellbeing during the Covid-19 pandemic. Children and young people will do better in the long term if they feel safe, calm and hopeful, if they feel a sense of belonging and connectedness to their new school, and they feel that they can manage and cope.  Applying these five principles will help the school community, in its own unique way, to foster these children&rsquo;s and young people&rsquo;s resilience.</p>  <p>  NEPS will develop further advice and resources, as appropriate, including a webinar for school staff. NEPS psychologists are available on the ground to consult with schools and provide support as needed.</p>  <p>  Children and their families arriving from Ukraine need to be given time to adapt and adjust to their new environment, new home, new school, and to be given access to practical supports, clear information and assistance to settle in and make friends.  Counselling or psychological debriefing are not recommended at this time.  Many of these children and young people will show remarkable resilience now that they are in a safer place and psychosocial supports are in place, but for some recovery will take longer. The Department of Health has responsibility for the provision of mental health services in Ireland, and through HSE Primary Care Psychology and Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) provides clinical support to children and young people with mental health needs.  This Department will continue to signpost schools and students to the HSE/HSE-funded mental health services. </p></reply>

In that context, similar to the process adopted in advance of the current academic year, my Department is engaging with patron bodies, including those of schools in Mayo, to identify particular capacity requirements for the forthcoming year(s) which may necessitate further action to that already in train.</p><p>Under Project Ireland 2040, my Department continues to make progress to increase the infrastructural capacity in the schools sector, in order to meet demographic and other demands.  It is expected that the enrolment pressures in this, and other areas will reduce in the short-term as such planned additional capacity comes on stream and as demographic demand moves past its peak.</p><p>The Capital Programme details the school projects that are being progressed under Project Ireland 2040.

SENOs also make recommendations to my Department where assistive technology/specialised equipment is required. The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in making recommendations for support.</p>  <p>  In order to qualify for equipment under the assistive technology scheme, a student must have been diagnosed with a physical or communicative disability and must also have a recommendation in a professional assessment that the equipment is essential in order to allow the student to access the curriculum.</p>  <p>  It must also be clear that the existing I.T. equipment in the school is insufficient to meet the child's needs. Where necessary, schools may also purchase new or additional equipment or software for students from normal school resources or funds.</p>  <p>  Schools make applications directly to the SENO, providing details of the student&rsquo;s special educational needs or disability, including details of the approach taken by the school in making relevant interventions.</p>  <p>  SENOs will review the application, and professional reports provided in support of same, in order to establish whether the criteria of the scheme have been met. They will then make a recommendation to my Department as to whether or not assistive technology is required; and based on this recommendation, my Department will decide on the level of grant, if any, to be provided.</p>  <p>  The type of equipment provided under the assistive technology scheme is varied, and includes audiological supports for students with hearing impairment, braille equipment for children with visual impairment, and computer equipment with associated modified software for students with physical or severe communicative disabilities.</p>  <p>  Communication devices or medical or therapy related devices which are not specific educational interventions or equipment specifically required as essential for school educational access, and which have a general application outside of school, are not provided for under the Assistive Technology scheme, however. Such equipment is normally provided for children with disabilities by the Health Service Executive (HSE).</p>  <p>  Based on the professional information provided to the SENO and in line with criteria set out in Circular 10/2013, the SENO was not in a position to recommend an Assistive Technology grant for the school concerned on behalf of the student.</p>  <p>  I can confirm that an appeal for assistive technology for the pupil named by the deputy was recently received in my Department and is currently being reviewed.</p></reply>

In the current school year over 121,400 children, including over 15,500 children with special educational needs, are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;289m in 2021. </p>  <p>  The purpose of the Department's School Transport Scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school.</p>  <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann is obliged to tender all works, goods and services to be provided by external suppliers in line with national and EU procurement legislation and this includes services provided by contractors under the School Transport Scheme.  Compliant tenders are evaluated against published award criteria. Successful tenderers are awarded a contract for up to five years.</p>  <p>  The Department of Education is considering in consultation with other relevant departments and Bus &Eacute;ireann the implications that increasing fuel costs may have on the provision of school transport services.  The Department is also very aware of the potential impact of the current situation unfolding in Ukraine which is impacting fuel prices further.  </p>  <p>  Government has announced a reduction in excise on fuel will result in a decrease in the cost of fuel.  The reduction of 20 cent per litre on petrol and 15 cent per litre on diesel will be in place until 31 August at an estimated cost of &euro;320m. This is a national measure aimed at easing the financial burden on contractors and families at this time. </p>  <p>  Officials from School Transport Section of the Department of Education hold quarterly meetings with members of the Organisation referred to by the Deputy and this issue was recently discussed between both parties.

A Special Transport Grant towards the cost of private transport arrangements may be provided to families of eligible children in certain situations such as where Bus &Eacute;ireann is not in a position to provide a transport service or where a child's age, behavioural difficulties or medical needs are such as to make the provision of a transport service impracticable;</p>  <p>  The reduction in excise on fuel which has been agreed by Government will result in a decrease in the cost of fuel.

This is a national measure aimed at easing the financial burden on contractors and families at this time.  </p>  <p>  As you may be aware my Department commenced a review of the School Transport Scheme in February 2021.

Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.</p><p>SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource.

Determinations will be made before 30 June. Other applications will be processed in order of date received; and <br /><br />As in previous years, where circumstances change during the course of the 2021/22 school year that materially increase the level of care need in a school to the extent that the school can clearly demonstrate that it cannot be met within the existing SNA allocation, the school may apply to the NCSE for a review. Detailed information on the NCSE exceptional review process is published on the NCSE website ncse.ie/for-schools.   </blockquote>  <p>The NCSE have published the SNA allocations on their website www.ncse.ie. </p><p>SNA allocations for special classes and special schools are not affected by this arrangement.</p><p>Circular 0029/2021 has been published and advises schools of the arrangements for the allocation of SNAs for the 2021/22 school year.</p><p>Provisions set out in Circular 0030/2020 has been extended for the 2021/22 school year.</p><p>Circulars 29/2021 and 30/2020 are available on the Gov.ie website. </p><p>www.gov.ie/en/circulars/?organisation=department-of-education  </p><p>My Department does not have a role in making individual school determinations.

The webinars were developed as  part of support and development work by NEPS. The series of Wellbeing and Resilience in schools webinars, explore the use of whole-school, compassionate and trauma-informed approaches to build safe and connected schools. Part 1, is called &lsquo;The Stress factor - Getting the balance right&rsquo; is a webinar for all school staff. This will be followed by a series of special interest modules using the Department&rsquo;s new e- learning platform. The approaches outlined in the workshops are based on research findings, on the experience of experts in their fields and on the experience of practising psychologists working in schools. The focus of the workshops is on exploring and understanding the sources and impact of stress on children and young people including attachment, trauma and adverse experiences. The emphasis is on creating environments to reduce stress and on developing skills all children and young people need to better manage in school. The training will also cover the influences of stress on school staff and how to best to manage this. It is intended that staff will find the content useful in supporting their own wellbeing. The workshops will be available to build the capability of school staff in both primary and post-primary settings. The workshops are for all staff and all students including those with special educational needs or those children impacted by trauma and adverse experiences. NEPS psychologists will be available to support implementation in schools.</p>  <p>  Given the situation with families arriving from Ukraine who will have experienced trauma and loss, plans are under way to make this training available to schools in advance of the launch of the training on the Department online learning management system. </p>  <p>  Individual psychologists also offer bespoke training to schools on trauma informed practice when requested.</p></reply>

In addition to these primary payments, my Department also provides a range of other payments, both cash and non-cash, on a weekly, monthly, or less frequent basis.  These payments are considered secondary in nature.</p>  <p>  The Living Alone Increase (LAI) is one of those secondary payments.  It is not a scheme or a stand-alone payment in itself, but rather it is a supplement to a primary social protection payment of &euro;22 per week made to people aged 66 years or over, who are in receipt of certain social welfare payments and who are living alone.  For those aged 66 or over, these payments include State Pension (Contributory), State Pension (Non-contributory), Widow&rsquo;s, Widower&rsquo;s or Surviving Civil Partner&rsquo;s (Contributory) Pension, Widow's/Widower's Pension under the Occupational Injuries Benefit Scheme, Incapacity Supplement under the Occupational Injuries Benefit Scheme and Deserted Wife's Benefit.  </p>  <p>  Accordingly, there are no circumstances where the Living Alone Increase can be paid to people who are not in receipt of a primary qualifying payment from my Department.  Any decision to allow those who are not in receipt of a qualifying payment to receive the Living Alone Increase - and thereby establish it as a scheme - would have budgetary and administrative consequences and would have to be considered in the context of Budget negotiations.  </p>  <p>  My Department would not have records on the numbers of people currently aged 66 or over, who are not in receipt of a primary social welfare payment, regardless of the class at which they paid PRSI previously, and who are living alone.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputies.</p></reply>

While the Blind Pension is a unique scheme in that it is the only social welfare payment which has been introduced to cater for a specific disability, it was originally legislated for under the Blind Person&rsquo;s Act, 1920 and was initially available only to those between 50 and 70 years. The minimum qualifying age has progressively been reduced to its current level of 18 years.  Persons become eligible to apply for the Disability Allowance at age 16.</p><p>Both are means tested schemes and both have a habitual residency requirement.</p><p>Eligibility for Disability Allowance requires that the disability must be expected to last for at least one year, substantially restricting a person&rsquo;s ability to undertake work which would otherwise be suitable for persons of similar age, experience, and qualification. </p><p>Eligibility for the Blind Pension requires that a person&rsquo;s vision is impaired to such an extent that they cannot perform any work for which eyesight is essential or cannot continue in their ordinary occupation.  </p><p>Both schemes are structured to support recipients to avail of opportunities to pursue their own employment ambitions, be that self-employment or insurable employment. In the means test, both schemes have an income disregard of &euro;140 per week. In addition, 50% of earnings between &euro;140 and &euro;350 are also disregarded, i.e., 50% of earnings in this band are disregarded for the purpose of the means test. Earnings above &euro;350 are currently assessed at 100%.  </p><p>Budget 2022 measures, will see from June:</p> <blockquote> 	-An increase in the upper disregard of &euro;25 per week, from &euro;350 to &euro;375 for both payments; and<br /><br />-An increase of &euro;5.10 being applied to the general weekly means disregard entry point for the Disability Allowance. This increase will bring the entry point of the weekly means disregard for Disability Allowance in line with that of the Blind Pension, at &euro;7.60 per week. </blockquote>  <p>In addition to the age at which a person becomes eligible, there are a number of other differences between the schemes, for example, relating to aspects of the means test, access to the free travel scheme and the concurrent payments available to persons in receipt of the Blind Pension.</p><p>Under Pathways to Work (2021 &ndash; 2025) the Government has committed to &ldquo;Review the current long-term disability payment schemes with a view to removing inconsistencies/anomalies and ensure that they recognise the continuum of disabilities and support employment.&rdquo; I would hope to bring forward proposals on this issue for public consultation later this year.</p></reply>

The payment continues to be paid in respect of children until their 18th birthday who are in full-time education, or who have a disability. Child Benefit is currently paid to over 631,000 families in respect of almost 1.2 million children with an estimated expenditure of more than &euro;2.1 billion in 2022. </p><p>There are currently no plans to extend Child Benefit in respect of full-time students in second level education who are over 18 years of age. Such an extension would have significant cost implications and would have to be considered in an overall budgetary context.  </p><p>Families on low incomes may be able to avail of a number of social welfare schemes that support children in full-time education until the age of 22, including: </p><p>-  Increase for a Qualified Child (IQCs) with primary social welfare payments;</p><p>-  the Working Family Payment for low-paid employees with children; and</p><p>-  the Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance.</p><p>These schemes provide targeted assistance that is directly linked to household income and thereby support low-income families with older children participating in full-time education.</p><p>As part of Budget 2022, I increased the rates for a qualified child aged under 12 by &euro;2 to &euro;40 per week, and for a qualified child aged 12 or older by &euro;3 to &euro;48 per week, from January. I increased the level of the Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance by &euro;10 to &euro;160 for each child aged 4 to 11 years and to &euro;285 for each child aged 12 and over. I also equalised the income limits for one and two parent households, thereby making it easier for lone parents to qualify for that payment.

The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household.</p>  <p>  A household can only be deemed to qualify for Fuel Allowance if they have submitted a completed fuel application form to my Department and a Deciding Officer has approved payment of Fuel Allowance to that household.</p>  <p>  To qualify for Fuel Allowance a household must satisfy a number of qualifying conditions including being in receipt of a qualifying payment, satisfy a means test, satisfy the household composition test and must be unable to provide for their heating needs from the resources of their household.</p>  <p>  Fuel Allowance is not paid if a person&rsquo;s heating needs are provided for in full as part of their accommodation. Therefore, if a household is heated as part of a district heating system and their heating needs are provided for in full, no Fuel Allowance is payable. If the household still contributes towards the cost of heating their home even at a subsidised level, they may still qualify for Fuel Allowance, if they satisfy the other qualifying conditions of the Fuel Allowance scheme.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, as well as Luas and services provided by over 80 private transport operators.  There are currently approximately 1,025,000 customers with direct eligibility.  The estimated expenditure on free travel in 2022 is &euro;95 million.</p><p>I am aware of the campaign by Epilepsy Ireland and recognise the issues and difficulties than can arise due to a person being diagnosed with epilepsy. I have recently met with representatives of Epilepsy Ireland to discuss their proposal in detail.  </p><p>Following the meeting I have asked my Department officials to examine the issues raised by Epilepsy Ireland and to explore options to help alleviate these issues. Further meetings will be arranged once this exploratory work has been concluded.</p><p>However, it is really important to note that, in general, access to a free travel pass for those aged under 66 is linked to a person being in receipt of certain primary Social Protection payments such as Disability Allowance, Invalidity Pension, Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Blind Pension and Partial Capacity Benefit.  Crucially as many illnesses or physical conditions have an impact across a spectrum from mild to severe, entitlement to these schemes is not provided on the basis of a simple diagnosis but on the basis of the impact of that diagnosis on the individual concerned.  In this way resources can be targeted to people with most need.  Therefore, while a diagnosis of a particular medical condition will be required to establish if a person may be eligible for certain social welfare schemes, evidence of impact is also required before entitlement to the scheme or the related free travel scheme is established.  The sole exception to this general approach is in respect of people who are blind.</p><p>It is also important to note that there are a range of disabilities and medical conditions that can prevent a person from holding a driving licence and to award a free travel pass to a person with any one of these conditions in isolation would immediately result in calls for all people who are not allowed to hold a driving licence because of their medical condition to receive the free travel pass and could result in challenges under the Equal Status Act. </p><p>While consideration is always given to any requests to improve or extend eligibility to the free travel scheme, uncoupling the link between receipt of particular social welfare payments and eligibility for the free travel scheme would so fundamentally alter the scheme that it would move it away from being a social welfare measure to being a general transport initiative.</p><p>Under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme, my Department may award a travel supplement, where the circumstances of the particular case so warrant. The supplement is intended to assist with ongoing or recurring travel costs that cannot be met from the client&rsquo;s own resources and are deemed to be necessary.  Every decision is based on consideration of the circumstances of the individual case, taking account of the nature and extent of the need and of the resources of the person concerned.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.  <b></b></p></reply>

The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household.</p><p>The Fuel Allowance payment is targeted towards those who are more vulnerable to energy poverty, including those reliant on social protection payments for longer periods and who are unlikely to have additional resources of their own.  </p><p>If a participant on a Community Employment (CE) scheme was in receipt of Fuel Allowance prior to going on the scheme, they can continue to receive the Fuel Allowance payment while participating on the scheme once they continue to satisfy the qualifying conditions.</p><p>If the CE participant was not in receipt of the Fuel Allowance payment prior to going on the CE scheme they may still apply for and qualify for Fuel Allowance in the following circumstances.</p><p>-  If the CE scheme participant was in receipt of a long-term qualifying payment prior to going on the CE scheme this will allow them to satisfy the qualifying payment element.  However, all other qualifying conditions of Fuel Allowance must also be satisfied.</p><p>-  Where the CE scheme participant has an established underlying entitlement to Fuel Allowance but is not in receipt of the allowance because another member of the household was receiving the payment, it is open to the CE scheme participant to apply for fuel allowance if these circumstances change, e.g., where the fuel allowance recipient leaves the address. </p><p>A CE Scheme helps people to get back to work by offering part-time and temporary placements in jobs based within local communities. Participants can take up other part-time work during their CE placement. A participant's jobseekers payment ceases and payment is made by way of a wage. It is for this reason participants on a CE scheme cannot accrue entitlement to Fuel Allowance. </p><p>In Budget 2022 I announced that from September 2022 the period a person<b></b>must be in receipt of Jobseeker's allowance or Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) to access the Fuel Allowance scheme is reduced to 12 months. This will, of course, also benefit people on CE schemes who previously have been in receipt of the above payments for greater than 312 days but did not meet the 390-day requirement.</p><p>Any decision to extend the eligibility criteria for Fuel Allowance for other people participating on a CE scheme would have to be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations.</p><p>Under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme, Exceptional Needs Payments may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which customers are unable to meet out of their own resources, and this may include exceptional heating costs.  Decisions on such payments are made on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Social welfare legislation provides that the means test takes account of the income and assets of the person (and spouse / partner, if applicable) applying for the relevant scheme.  Income and assets include income from employment, self-employment, occupational pensions, maintenance payments as well as property owned (other than the family home) and capital such as savings, shares, and other investments. </p>  <p>  The assessment of capital reflects an expectation that people with reasonable amounts of capital and property are in a position to use that capital, or to realise the value of the property, to support themselves without having to rely solely on a means-tested welfare payment.</p>  <p>  Savings held for a specific purpose are not, as such, specifically disregarded.  However, most social assistance schemes, such as Carer's Allowance, have a general capital disregard meaning the full amount of capital is not assessed.</p>  <p>  The standard formula for assessing the value of capital for social welfare payments (except Disability Allowance and Supplementary Welfare Allowance) is as follows: the first &euro;20,000 is fully disregarded; the next &euro;10,000 is assessed at &euro;1 per thousand, the next &euro;10,000 is assessed at &euro;2 per thousand, with the remainder assessed at &euro;4 per thousand.</p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2022, I was pleased to announce that, from June this year, the capital disregard for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance will increase to &euro;50,000, bringing it into line with the capital disregard for Disability Allowance.  The new formula will be as follows: the first &euro;50,000 is fully disregarded; the next &euro;10,000 is assessed at &euro;1 per thousand, the next &euro;10,000 is assessed at &euro;2 per thousand, with the remainder assessed at &euro;4 per thousand. </p>  <p>  The weekly income threshold for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance will also increase to &euro;350 for a single person and to &euro;750 for a couple. The combination of these measures means that a couple can have earnings of &euro;750 per week, as well as savings of &euro;100,000, and still receive the maximum rate of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance.</p>  <p>  Any further changes to the means assessment for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance would have to be considered in the overall policy and budgetary context.</p></reply>

In particular, specialised employment services for those farthest from the labour market - currently available in just twelve counties - will soon be available State-wide for the first time.  </p>  <p>  In the first phase of this procurement, contracts for Intreo Partners - Local Area Employment Services (LAES) were agreed in late 2021 across four lots in seven counties in the Midlands and North-East.  These new services are now operational and accepting referrals.  </p>  <p>  Phase two of the Intreo Partners - LAES procurement commenced with the publication of the request for tender on 21 December last.  My Department recently extended the deadline for tenders to 19 April to ensure all interested parties have sufficient time to prepare quality tender responses that reflect their experience and capacity to deliver a quality service.  </p>  <p>  My officials had several meetings prior to the publication of the phase 2 request for tender with the Irish Local Development Network (ILDN), the trade unions SIPTU and F&oacute;rsa, primarily in September, October and November 2021. During these meetings, the ILDN provided feedback on the phase 1 procurement process.</p>  <p>  I meet with the ILDN on a regular basis in my role both as Minister for Social Protection and Minister for Rural and Community Development. One such meeting occurred on 2 December, where the procurement of employment services was discussed.</p>  <p>  External contracting has been a feature of the Department's employment services since it became responsible for these services over a decade ago. Prior to that, external service provision had been a feature of the F&Aacute;S employment service offering since the mid 1990s. I can confirm that neither I nor my officials have been lobbied by any party in relation to expanding the tendering of employment service provision. However, as stated above, I have been lobbied both in meetings and in correspondence from the ILDN and by trade unions regarding the legal requirement to competitively procure these external services. </p>  <p>  Prior to the formal commencement of the current live procurement process, my officials met a broad range of organisations at their request. These organisations included those currently providing employment services in the Irish market, including the bodies referenced above, and other organisations who were considering entering the Irish market.  With the exception of the meetings and correspondence with the ILDN and trade unions, none of these meetings could be described as seeking to influence a policy decision or as lobbying and were in the main introductory meetings.</p></reply>

The schemes require that a person must be available for and genuinely seeking work as well as satisfy the other qualifying statutory conditions. The current annual estimated expenditure on the jobseeker schemes is approximately &euro;2.17 billion.</p>  <p>  The jobseeker schemes allow a person to work up to 3 days per week, but they must be fully unemployed for at least four in any seven consecutive days to be eligible for a payment.</p>  <p>  The current days based system can provide significant support to jobseekers who are casually employed or working part time; for instance, an individual can earn just over &euro;21,000 per year and still retain a small Jobseeker's Allowance payment, while the equivalent threshold for an individual with a qualified adult is just over &euro;36,100 if they are both working.  These figures are based on the current maximum weekly personal rate of &euro;208 and qualified adult rate of &euro;138.</p>  <p>  It is recognised that a changing labour market has resulted in a move away from the more traditional work patterns, resulting in an increase in the number of people employed for less than a full week.  However, any changes to the current criteria, such as moving to an hours-based system, could result in significant numbers of additional individuals becoming eligible for a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment with the substantial corresponding costs for the Exchequer.</p>  <p>  The Deputy  should also be aware that the Programme for Government includes a commitment to consider increasing all classes of PRSI over time to replenish the Social Insurance Fund to help pay for a range of measures including a pay related benefit scheme. Furthermore, the Government&rsquo;s national employment strategy 2021-2025 commits to using the experience from the Pandemic Unemployment Payment to inform the design of a pay-related payment that may be developed, by Q3 2023.</p>  <p>  In addition to the Jobseeker schemes, the Working Family Payment (WFP) is a tax free in-work support available from my Department which provides an income top-up for low-earning employees with children. Once awarded, WFP is generally payable for a minimum period of 52 weeks as long as the recipient continues to be engaged in paid employment as an employee for not less than 38 hours per fortnight with the same employer.</p>  <p>  The Back To Work Family Dividend (BTWFD) scheme allows those who had been in receipt of a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment (including Jobseeker&rsquo;s Transition payment) and recipients of the One-Parent Family Payment, to retain their full increase for a qualified child payment for the first year of employment, tapering to 50 per cent in the second year.</p>  <p>  Where a person has been in receipt of Jobseeker's Allowance for at least 390 days and is offered employment of more than 3 days but less than 24 hours a week, they may be eligible to apply for the Part Time Job Incentive Scheme (PTJI). Those who qualify receive a payment of either &euro;131.80 or &euro;214.90 if they are receiving an increase for a qualified adult. Participants on the scheme are expected to continue to seek full time employment and there is no limit on the employment income that they can earn under the scheme.</p>  <p>  The combination of the Jobseekers schemes, WFP, BTWFD and the PTJI schemes provide considerable income support for individuals who have part time employment by allowing them retain access to a social welfare payment.</p>  <p>  The means tested Supplementary Welfare Allowance Scheme is also available through the Community Welfare Service at the local Intreo Centre for any person who is experiencing financial hardship. Supports provided under the scheme include Supplements and Urgent and Exceptional Needs Payments.</p>  <p>  Any changes to the Jobseeker schemes would have to be considered in a policy and budgetary context.</p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the position at this time.</p></reply>

Foster carers are paid a weekly allowance, which is a payment to meet the needs of the child in their care. The foster care allowance is currently &euro;325 per week for a child under 12 years of age and &euro;352 per week for a child aged 12 years and over. It is paid in respect of the child and provided in order to allow foster carers to meet all of the child's daily living needs, including food, clothing, basic travel, education costs and hobbies and sports activities. The allowance is not considered as means for social welfare purposes, and is not subject to tax. </p>  <p>  If required, Tusla can also provide additional financial supports to foster carers through either additional or enhanced payments.</p>  <p>  Additional payments refers to any payment made to a foster carer that exceeds the standard rate of the fostering allowance.  Such additional payments may be made in respect of children or young people who have additional needs that are not covered by the standardised fostering allowance.  Additional payments can only be made where a child has additional medical or educational needs and when authorisation has been received from the Tusla Area Manager.  Each application for an additional payment will be accompanied by supporting documentation evidencing the need.</p>  <p>  Enhanced allowances for foster carers can be made when a longer term financial need is identified for additional supports for the child. A maximum of twice the weekly allowance may be paid in respect of children aged between 0-18 years if they require significant care over and above the needs of other children in foster care.  This includes children who have been diagnosed with significant special needs and require a high level of personal care and supervision.  The purpose of considering an enhanced allowance in these cases is to support foster carers in providing care to these children who have additional needs. </p>  <p>  The foster care allowance is in respect of and for the benefit of the foster child and therefore must be used to meet the day to day costs associated with looking after the foster child. In considering any enhanced allowance the assessing social worker is required to evidence that the standard fostering allowance does not adequately provide for the cost of caring for the child.</p>  <p>  A request for enhanced supports must certified by the Principal Social Worker and approved by the Area Manager following submission of an assessment of the child&rsquo;s needs and supporting documentation.  A review arrangement for the enhanced allowance must be part of the submission for approval.</p>  <p>  In addition to the foster care allowance, foster carers receive a number of targeted supports to ensure they continue to function as a recognised and valued part of the alternative care system. Key elements of this support include a link social worker, access to training and support group meetings and the allocation of a social worker for each child in care. Respite care for children may be arranged if it is part of their care plan.</p>  <p>  Pre-assessment and ongoing training are compulsory for foster carers in order to equip them with the skills and knowledge to provide high quality care. Recognising the specific dynamics and the personal nature of relative care, Tusla addresses the training needs of relatives who are foster carers separately. In addition, Tusla provides funding for the Irish Foster Care Association which offers a range of supports to carers, including advocacy, mediation, training and a telephone advice service.</p>  <p>  The foster care allowance is one element of the support that Tusla provides to carers when they offer a home and care to children some of whom may have additional, and sometimes significant, needs.</p>  <p>  Tusla have advised that they have recently engaged with foster carers in a consultation. Through this consultation, foster carers highlighted the need for the foster care allowance to be reviewed in light of inflation and increases in social welfare allowances. Tusla is currently preparing a paper on this matter.</p>  <p>   The rate of the foster care allowance is kept under review by officials within the Department and at present there are no plans to change the rate. However, the Department is undertaking an extensive review of the Child Care Act 1991 and will examine foster care arrangements as part of this review.</p></reply>

Tusla is responsible for promoting the welfare of children not receiving adequate care and protection.  In doing so, the best interests of the child are paramount, but Tusla also seeks to have regard to the rights of parents and to the principle that it is generally in the best interests of a child that they are brought up in their own family.</p>  <p>  In this context, Tusla may take a child into care, in accordance with the statutory provisions, when a parent is unable to provide that care and requests that Tusla provide alternative care for their child, or where it has been determined through a judicial process that the child has been exposed to a level of harm and/or will be exposed to a level of harm that cannot be prevented other than removing them from the parent&rsquo;s care.</p>  <p>  There is no formal definition of &ldquo;private family arrangements&rdquo;, but there are a number of circumstances in which Tusla may engage with a child and their family, where the child is not in care.</p>  <p>  As part of Tusla&rsquo;s intervention, a parent and their wider family may agree to a plan that sees a child living with extended family, relatives or friends.  Such arrangements can be a key component of a safety planning process where there are ongoing concerns of harm to a child that require Tusla&rsquo;s ongoing involvement to assure the child&rsquo;s safety.  Tusla remains involved in such cases until such time as the child&rsquo;s safety has been evidenced over time or until a decision is made to invoke formal care arrangements, which can be in the form of relative foster care.</p>  <p>  A parent and their extended family can also agree a temporary arrangement to support the care of the child while the parent gets respite and support. Where support is required Tusla can provide such support to the child, parent and carer through what is often referred to as a family support plan. There are also legal provisions under guardianship legislation for the family to have such arrangements made more formal through the appointment of a temporary or full guardian. Tusla is often made a notice party to such applications to support the Court in its decision making process.</p>  <p>  A parent/family may also enter into a temporary care arrangement with a relative where no support is required and where Tusla has no involvement. Where a parent enters into a private care arrangement with someone who is not a guardian or relative and where Tusla has not had any involvement, the Child Care Act (Part IVB) requires the parent to notify Tusla of such an arrangement.  Tusla has the authority to determine the suitability of such an arrangement if required and to apply to the District Court for directions if it believes the arrangement is not in the child&rsquo;s best interests. Such notifications are rare.</p>  <p>  If Tusla has concerns in relation to a child&rsquo;s safety or welfare or risk of harm, wherever the child is placed, Tusla would provide the same supports and interventions that they provide to any family including invoking the statutory processes to take a child into care under the Child Care Act 1991.</p>  <p>  As you will be aware the Department submitted proposals to amend the Child Care Act, and received Government approval for the drafting of the Heads and General Scheme of a Child Care (Amendment) Bill. The Heads of Bill are currently being drafted, and further policy work is being undertaken. Consideration of the role of Tusla in supporting children and families in the community and in the formal care system forms part of the process.</p></reply>

The package of measures announced in Budget 2022 is designed to ensure that fees to parents do not increase and that the full affordability benefits of the National Childcare Scheme (NCS) are felt without being absorbed in fee increases. </p><p>On 7 December, I was pleased to launch a report on a new funding model for Early Learning and Care (ELC) and School-Age Childcare (SAC), <i>Partnership for the Public Good</i>. This report was delivered by an Expert Group which was independently chaired and comprised national and international experts. The recommendations of the Expert Group are designed to deliver quality for children, affordability for parents, stability for providers, and support employers to improve pay and conditions for staff. </p><p>In Budget 2022 I secured a financial commitment for the introduction of a new Core Funding stream for ELC and SAC services to support improved quality, affordability, and sustainability. This Core Funding stream, which was recommended by the Expert Group, will become available from September 2022 and will be worth up to &euro;73.5 million in 2022 and up to &euro;221 million in a full year from 2023 on. </p><p>Core Funding will require a commitment not to increase fees to parents from the September 2021 rates. This means that parents will not be faced with fee increases, and the full affordability effects of the NCS, and the universal Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) Pre-school Programme, will be felt by parents.</p><p>Providers who do increase their fees will be required to revert to September 2021 levels on or before September 2022 in order to be eligible for the new Core Funding stream.</p><p>In advance of the introduction of the Core Funding Stream, a Transition Fund will be available to providers from May to August, also contingent on an agreement not to increase fees from September 2021 levels. This fund will operate from the end of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (April 2022) until the introduction of Core Funding and make available up to &euro;6.4 million per month to providers.</p><p>The introduction of fee management measures is one of the recommendations of the Expert Group, as approved by Government. Fee management will start with the requirement for providers to maintain fees at or below September 2021 levels to access Core Funding in 2022. Further information on proposed fee management mechanisms in the longer term is available in the Group's report.  </p><p>The work of the Expert Group was informed by an extensive programme of stakeholder engagement, a programme of research on international practice, research on the ELC and SAC costs incurred by families in Ireland, reviews of the costs of delivering services in Ireland, and a range of other inputs.</p><p>I am grateful to the wide range of individuals and organisations that took part in this programme of stakeholder consultation and engagement, including parents, providers and the workforce. Phases 2 and 3 of the consultation process used the Early Learning and Childcare Stakeholder Forum as its reference group which include a large number of provider organisations.  Approaches to fee management were discussed throughout the programme of consultation, particularly during the Phase 2 sessions on Parental Affordability and Partnership between the State and Services. </p><p>All material relating to the work of the Expert Group, including their report, research papers and all outputs from stakeholder consultation, are available on a dedicated website, www.first5fundingmodel.gov.ie.</p><p>The introduction of the requirement to maintain fees at or below September 2021 levels to access the very substantial levels of new funding means that parents will not be faced with fee increases, and the full affordability effects of the NCS, the NCS reform announced in Budget 2022 and indeed any reforms to the NCS in future Budgets can be fully realised. </p></reply>

On 14th March 2022 I published the report which sets out 17 numbered recommendations.</p>  <p>  Recommendation 16 of the report by the Special Rapporteur on Child Protection was that provision should be made to cover legal costs associated with a declaration of parentage of persons affected by illegal birth registrations. In response, the Government approved a once-off payment of &euro;3,000 for the individuals whose illegal birth registration has been confirmed by Tusla from the files of St. Patrick&rsquo;s Guild. </p>  <p>  This once-off payment of &euro;3,000 is intended as contribution towards costs such as creating or amending wills or seeking a declaration of parentage. While it could also be used for DNA testing, Tusla has covered the costs of DNA testing for individuals in cases where records were insufficient to confirm an illegal birth registration and will continue to provide this support.</p>  <p>  Tusla already hold confirmation of illegal birth registrations from the files of St. Patrick&rsquo;s Guild that can form the basis for a payment to the individuals affected without any need to bring forward evidence and meet a certain burden of proof.  There may be potential to extend the payment to other confirmed cases after the Birth Information and Tracing Bill has provided access to records and people with suspicions are, therefore, able to access evidence necessary to confirm illegal birth registration and effect a change in the birth register. </p></reply>

Under the Scheme, grant assistance is awarded to eligible students attending an approved full-time course in an approved institution who meet the prescribed conditions of funding, including those relating to nationality, residency, previous academic attainment and means. </p>  <p>  The decision on eligibility for a student grant is a matter, in the first instance, for the centralised student grant awarding authority SUSI (Student Universal Support Ireland) to determine.</p>  <p>  In line with the Programme for Government commitment to address the gap in postgraduate grants, from September 2021 the postgraduate fee grant increased from &euro;2,000 to &euro;3,500. This increase will allay some of the costs for postgraduate study and will give greater certainty for students in terms of supports. In addition, the fee grant income threshold increased from &euro;31,500 to &euro;54,240 from September 2021. </p>  <p>  Postgraduate students who meet all of the qualifying conditions for the special rate of grant under the Student Grant Scheme are eligible for a maintenance grant of up to &euro;5,915 for the 2021/22 academic year (rising to &euro;6,115 for 2022/23); the income threshold for this grant is &euro;24,500. Qualifying postgraduate students may also be eligible to have their tuition fees paid up to a maximum fee limit of &euro;6,270. </p>  <p>  Students can determine their eligibility at susi.ie/eligibility-criteria/. Alternatively the student may wish to discuss his/her individual circumstances with the SUSI Support Desk by calling 0818 888 777. </p>  <p>  SUSI&rsquo;s online application process for renewal student grant applications for the 2022/23 academic year opened on 10th March, 2022. New applications will be accepted by SUSI from April 28th, 2022.  The priority closing dates for the 2022/23 Student Grant Scheme are 7th July 2022 for new applicants and the 9th June 2022 for renewal students. </p>  <p>    Apart from the Student Grant Scheme, students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the third level institution attended. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis.</p>  <p>In addition, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may also be available in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education. Further information on this tax relief is available from a student's local Tax Office or from the Revenue Commissioners website, www.revenue.ie.  </p>  <p>  The postgraduate office within the higher education institution attended would also be able to advise on funding supports.  </p></reply>

In that regards, I was pleased to be able to allocate additional funding to the IRC in 2021 to enable it to increase postgraduate scholarship by &euro;2,500 per annum, or 16%. This was made effective from 1 January 2021 and, together with an increase to funding for postdoctoral salaries, benefited close to 1,300 early-career researchers in the system.

The Safe Return Plan, which has facilitated the safe return of staff and students to onsite activity since June 2020, supports this wider opening of the sector and continues to provide a comprehensive framework for institutions to plan for the provision of significant on-site activity and a broader student experience fully supported by public health authorities.</p>  <p>  In this way, the Safe Return Plan, facilitates institutions to be flexible and adaptable in response to changes in the public health environment. For activities that are context dependent, the Safe Return Plan supports institutions in using discretion to adopt public health measures appropriate to their own context, actively using significant precautionary measures to mitigate risk based on risk assessment and management systems, engagement with their stakeholders and building on the practices that have been accrued during the pandemic. </p>  <p>  In relation to the holding of in-person examinations, the Department does not regulate sector specific matters at this level and there is no intention to introduce a specific direction in this regard. However, in line with the successful approach taken in relation to the holding of in-person examinations at the end of Semester 1, facilitated by the Safe Return Plan, the basic principle of risk assessment and the considered application of appropriate precautionary measures, continues to apply. In that context, institutions should ensure that in-person examinations are conducted safely and any protective measures considered appropriate are put in place, consistent with local risk assessment of the approach, taking into account the significant contextual factors that arise in different instances.  Institutions should also ensure that the requirements of students who may have Covid-19 or underlying health conditions can be addressed.  </p>  <p>  Consistent with the successful operation of the Safe Return Plan, timely engagement and communications with their stakeholders will be essential and all institutions should continue to engage with their students on their arrangements for the holding of in-person examinations. In all instances public health must remain a priority and I know that there will be a continuing focus on the evolving and often quickly changing public health situation overall. </p></reply>

All proposals made in relation to higher education expenditure, including student grants for the 2022/23 academic year, are considered in the context of the annual budgetary process.  </p><p>For the academic year 2022/23 the Department has secured through Budget 2022:</p><p>- An increase to all student grant maintenance payments, including the special rate of grant, of &euro;200 per year which will benefit all students entitled to receive a maintenance Grant. </p><p>- The income threshold to qualify for the standard rate of student grant has been increased by &euro;1,000. </p><p>- The qualifying distance criterion for students to qualify for the non-adjacent rate of grant has been reduced from 45km to 30km, effective from the start of the 2022/23 academic year.</p><p>In 2020 and 2021, as part of the package of COVID supports, the Department allocated &euro;10m to an Access Funding package which resulted in the doubling of the Student Assistance Fund (&euro;8.1m) and additional funding of &euro;1.9m for other vulnerable students in line with the National Access Plan and through existing structures within HEIs.  </p><p>Also in 2021, an additional &euro;1.3m was allocated to the SAF.</p><p>SUSI&rsquo;s online application process for renewal student grant applications for the 2022/23 academic year opened on 10th March, 2022.

The priority closing dates for the 2022/23 Student Grant Scheme are 7th July 2022 for new applicants and the 9th June 2022 for renewal students.  </p><p>Students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Information on the fund is available through the Access Officer in the third level institution attended.

In the cases of architects, solicitors and medical professionals, this would be the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland (RIAI), the Law Society and, subject to the medical profession in question, the Medical Council, CORU, the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland (NMBI), or the Department of Health to name a few.  A list of all of the regulated professions in Ireland, their corresponding competent authority and the relevant contact information for each authority is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: www.gov.ie/pdf/?file=https://assets.gov.ie/123679/f3dc868b-f95a-42fe-87b3-531983e3bd1f.pdf#page=null  </p>  <p>  My Department is supporting the work of these Competent Authorities by sharing best practice material supplied by the European Commission in relation to the recognition of professional qualifications of Ukrainian people in Ireland. In addition, these Competent Authorities have been advised of further information resources which are available to support their work from NARIC Ireland, which is hosted by Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI). NARIC Ireland provides advice on the academic recognition of a foreign qualification by comparing it to a major award type and level on the Irish National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ). The QQI NARIC database currently lists 18 Ukrainian qualifications, comparable to levels 3-10 on the NFQ, including general professional and higher education. NARIC Ireland is working with the NARIC network across Europe to continue building the list of Ukrainian qualifications.  The NARIC Guide has recently been translated into Ukrainian and the Guide is also available in Polish, English and Russian, which many Ukrainian citizens also speak.</p>  <p>  The NARIC service also helps to inform employers to determine if an applicant holds the academic qualifications necessary for a particular job or employment opportunity. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue its work with the European Commission in relation to the recognition of professional qualifications of Ukrainian people in Ireland to ensure an EU-wide appropriate response. I will share further information and updates across the Houses when these are available. </p></reply>

Additional staff have been assigned to the team, as required.   </p>  <p>  At the end of February 2022, there were 25,048 naturalisation applications in progress. Notwithstanding the restrictions, last year, my Department made 11,512 citizenship decisions, which is the highest level since 2015.</p>  <p>  Currently, there are 2,556 approved applications in the system that require the completion and submission of the Declaration of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State, the payment of the statutory fee and the submission of other required documents by the applicants. These applications will then be finalised and the certificate of naturalisation awarded.</p>  <p>  All applications for a certificate of naturalisation are processed and assessed individually in accordance with the provisions of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended.</p>  <p>  Processing times have been extended due to the combined impact of the 2019 High Court judgment in the Jones case and the necessary health and safety related restrictions imposed as a result of the Covid-19 disruption.</p>  <p>  My Department has also been unable to hold in-person citizenship ceremonies during this time. However, I'm pleased to say that, subject to public health guidelines, my Department intends to host in-person citizenship ceremonies in June and December in Killarney.</p>  <p>  The citizenship application process is reviewed on an ongoing basis to continually improve customer service quality. Feedback from applicants is taken on board and, as a result, a much more simplified, customer-focused and streamlined mechanism for applicants to provide their proofs of residence has recently been introduced. </p>  <p>  To further speed up the processing of applications, a number of digitisation measures have also been introduced to increase efficiency in the process, including eTax clearance, eVetting and online payments. The end result of the digitisation process will be to free up more staff to focus on processing applications in a timely and efficient manner, to improve service to our customers and reduce waiting times. Additional staff have also been assigned to the citizenship team.  </p>  <p>  Since the beginning of this year, new applicants for citizenship no longer have to submit their original passport with their application. Instead, they can provide a full colour copy of their entire passport, including the front and back covers. This change in practice is welcomed by our customers and is also freeing up valuable staff time that up to now has been engaged in returning passports to applicants.</p></reply>

While this strategy supports the vulnerable people who use drugs, it is also matched with strengthened enforcement measures across government to tackle the supply of illegal drugs. </p><p>Sustained action by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has continued unabated throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, bringing significant convictions and ongoing seizures of drugs, firearms and ammunition. I am advised by the Garda authorities that in 2021, the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau (GNDOCB) seized almost &euro;64m worth of illicit drugs and over &euro;5.6m in cash, a significant increase from 2019, when there were over &euro;21m worth of illicit drugs and over &euro;2.5m in cash seized. </p></reply>

Therefore, any person who does not meet the specified undocumented residency criteria for the scheme will not be eligible to make an application.</p>  <p>  Based on the information supplied by the Deputy, the total residency of the person concerned is not clear.

In some instances, completing the necessary checks can take a considerable period of time. </p><p>In addition, the combined impact of the 2019 High Court judgment in the Jones case and the necessary health restrictions arising from the pandemic, has unfortunately resulted in the processing time for standard applications increasing. </p><p>The current average processing time for naturalisation applications is 22 months. However it should be noted that last year, my Department made 11,512 citizenship decisions, which is the highest level since 2015.</p><p>As previously advised to the Deputy, statistics are not maintained by my Department to provide for a breakdown between EEA and non-EEA applicants.</p><p>The citizenship application process is reviewed on an ongoing basis to continually improve customer service quality. Feedback from applicants is taken on board and, as a result, a much more simplified, customer-focused and streamlined mechanism for applicants to provide their proofs of residence has recently been introduced. </p><p>To further speed up the processing of applications, a number of digitisation measures have also been introduced to increase efficiency in the process, including eTax clearance, eVetting and online payments. The end result of the digitisation process will be to free up more staff to focus on processing applications in a timely and efficient manner, to improve service to our customers and reduce waiting times. Additional staff have also been assigned to the citizenship team.  </p><p>Since the beginning of this year, new applicants for citizenship no longer have to submit their original passport with their application. Instead, they can provide a full colour copy of their entire passport, including the front and back covers. This change in practice is welcomed by our customers and is also freeing up valuable staff time that up to now has been engaged in returning passports to applicants.</p><p>I am also pleased to confirm that, subject to public health guidelines, my Department intends to host an in-person citizenship ceremony on 20 June 2022 and further ceremonies on 5 and 6 December 2022 in Killarney.</p><p>The average processing time in months for citizenship applications for the years 2015 &ndash; 2021 are set out in the table below. <table>    <tr>       <th>Year </th>       <th>Number of Applications decided </th>       <th>Average Processing Time (Months) </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2015 </td>       <td>12,869 </td>       <td>7 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016 </td>       <td>11,081 </td>       <td>6 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017 </td>       <td>9,190 </td>       <td>7 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018 </td>       <td>11,139 </td>       <td>10</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019 </td>       <td>9,319 </td>       <td>12 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020 </td>       <td>3,551 </td>       <td>13 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021 </td>       <td>11,512</td>       <td>23 </td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

The table below provides a breakdown of applications by length of time in the system. <table>    <tr>       <th>0 - 12 month </th>       <th>12 to less than 18 months </th>       <th>18 to less than 24 months </th>       <th>24 months+ </th>       <th>Total </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>10,710 </td>       <td>5,800 </td>       <td>3,094 </td>       <td>5,444 </td>       <td>25,048 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>However it should be noted that last year, my Department made 11,512 citizenship decisions, which is the highest level since 2015.</p><p>Currently, there are 2,556 approved applications in the system that require the completion and submission of the Declaration of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State, the payment of the statutory fee and the submission of other required documents by the applicants. These applications will then be finalised and the certificate of naturalisation awarded.</p><p>All applications for a certificate of naturalisation are processed and assessed individually in accordance with the provisions of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended.</p><p>Current processing times have been extended due to the combined impact of the 2019 High Court judgment in the Jones case and the necessary health and safety related restrictions imposed as a result of the Covid-19 disruption.</p><p>My Department has also been unable to hold in person citizenship ceremonies during this time. However, I'm pleased to say that, subject to public health guidelines, my Department currently intends to host in-person citizenship ceremonies in June and December of this year in Killarney.</p><p>The citizenship application process is reviewed on an ongoing basis to continually improve customer service quality. Feedback from applicants is taken on board and, as a result, a much more simplified, customer-focused and streamlined mechanism for applicants to provide their proofs of residence has recently been introduced. </p><p>To further speed up the processing of applications, a number of digitisation measures have also been introduced to increase efficiency in the process, including eTax clearance, eVetting and online payments. The end result of the digitisation process will be to free up more staff to focus on processing applications in a timely and efficient manner, to improve service to our customers and reduce waiting times. Additional staff have also been assigned to the citizenship team.  </p><p>Since the beginning of this year, new applicants for citizenship no longer have to submit their original passport with their application. Instead, they can provide a full colour copy of their entire passport, including the front and back covers. This change in practice is welcomed by our customers and is also freeing up valuable staff time that up to now has been engaged in returning passports to applicants.</p></reply>

My Department is not undertaking any specific recruitment for support teams for refugees. As the Deputy will be aware, the reception and integration arrangements for those arriving from Ukraine are a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. </p><p>The EU Temporary Protection Directive (2001/55/EC) has been activated in response to the Ukraine crisis. Ireland participates in this measure, which is given legal effect under Section 60 of the International Protection Act 2015.</p><p>Those eligible for Temporary Protection (granted initially for one year, but renewable) will have immediate access to the labour market, social welfare, accommodation and other State supports as necessary. A whole-of-Government response is being mobilised to implement the practical arrangements to give effect to these commitments. </p><p>My Department is responsible for immigration controls and permissions at Dublin Airport. Immigration duties at all other airports and ports of entry to the State are the responsibility of the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB). </p><p>So far, approximately 80 per cent of people who have entered the State having fled Ukraine have been welcomed at Dublin Airport. As a result of the large numbers of Ukrainians arriving via Dublin Airport beneficiaries of temporary protection are being provided with their permission letter on arrival in the 'one-stop-shop' established by my Department for that purpose, to ensure early access to all necessary supports. The facility is staffed by officials from my own Department, with the International Organization for Migration (IOM) contracted to provide interpretation and other orientation supports for new arrivals. </p><p>Three Ukraine Support Centres have been established by the Department of Social Protection in Dublin 8, Cork City and Limerick. There, people can also receive assistance from the Department of Social Protection to obtain PPSN numbers, social welfare income supports, and to receive referrals to other State services. Staff from my Department are onsite in the centre in Cork Street, Dublin 8 to provide temporary protection permission letters. Arrangements are also being put in place that will allow people to obtain their permission letters from the Ukraine Support Centres in Cork City and in Limerick. Further details on this will be announced shortly.</p><p>Approximately 10,000 temporary protection permission letters have been issued by my Department since the EU Directive was activated on 4 March.</p><p>Representatives from the Citizens Information Service are also available in the Ukraine Support Centres to help people from Ukraine with enquiries of a more general nature.  Community Welfare Officers are also present to assist with applications for financial support.  Interpretation services are available at the Centres. </p><p>Any person arriving from Ukraine can also attend any of the Department of Social Protection's Intreo Centres, located around the country, to register for a PPS Number and apply for income supports.  </p><p>A centralised Government information portal is available at: www.gov.ie/ukraine, which is regularly updated. My Department&rsquo;s Irish Immigration website also contains a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) page, which can be viewed at: www.irishimmigration.ie/faqs-for-ukraine-nationals-and-residents-of-ukraine/.  </p></reply>

Stamp 4 conditions permit non-EEA nationals to work, study or start their own businesses in Ireland.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-03-29a.1405.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1618" speakername="James Browne" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022032900077#WRAA05100"><p>As the Deputy will be aware, Minister McEntee and I published the Youth Justice Strategy 2021 &ndash; 2027 on 15 April 2021.</p><p>The Strategy includes consideration of the full range of issues connected to children and young people at risk of coming into contact with the criminal justice system, including early intervention and preventative work, family support and diversion from crime, through to court process and facilities, supervision of offenders, detention and reintegration and support post release.</p><p>The measures in the Strategy are premised on the need to maximise opportunities to promote positive behavioural change and desistance from offending. This will require a sustained commitment to collaborative working between State agencies and community partners, as well as a commitment to prioritise resource allocation to address factors connected to early involvement in criminal activity and more serious offending patterns.  The Youth Justice Strategy 2021 &ndash; 2027 is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p><p>The Strategy strengthens and expands the role of the Youth Diversion Projects (YDPs), which are a fundamental support to the operation of the statutory Garda Diversion Programme and provide a vital ingredient in enhancing community policing partnerships. The Strategy promotes appropriate linkages and alignment with other community-based initiatives, including those supported by the Probation Service. Bringing the full range of relevant interventions together in a coherent and holistic response to youth crime will support the objective of diverting young people from crime and anti-social behaviour.</p><p>The Strategy expands the remit of the YDPs to provide a broader range of services for communities, families and children at risk, including family support and early intervention with children aged 8-12 years, as well as developing enhanced approaches to engaging with harder to reach children and young people who may have more entrenched patterns of offending. There are currently 105 YDPs nationally and the intention is to further develop this service so that it is available to every child in the State who could benefit from it, through an ongoing expansion of existing services and the foundation of new projects where necessary.</p><p>Funding for YDPs has increased every year since 2015. &euro;15.3 million was provided in 2019 and &euro;15.6 million was provided for 2020. &euro;18 million funding was provided for 2021 with a further allocation of &euro;3m for the Greentown pilots, Bail Supervision Scheme and the Research Evidence into Policy Programmes and Practice (REPPP) project.</p><p>The additional &euro;6.7m provided for in Budget 2022 represents an increase of one third in support for youth justice services. It provides the resources to kick-start delivery of key objectives in the Youth Justice Strategy and, in particular, the programme to expand and deepen the range of supports made available through local YDP services. The main elements are:</p><p>- Establishment of a limited number of new youth projects and boundary extensions of existing projects so as to ensure that the youth diversion services are available throughout the State by end-2022 or shortly thereafter.</p><p>- Enhancement of the youth diversion service, in accordance with identified local needs, to include:</p><p>-  Early intervention and family support work</p><p>- Outreach with harder-to-engage young people</p><p>- Support for schools to retain challenging children</p><p>- Other specific initiatives e.g. in relation to anti-social use of scramblers and knife crime issues.</p><p>- Dedicated research and expert support, including best practice support for the nationwide project network, facilitated by the Research Evidence into Policy Programmes and Practice (REPPP) project team in the University of Limerick.</p><p>The Bail Supervision Scheme provides an internationally recognised approach to achieving bail compliance, supported by the REPPP University of Limerick partnership. The service has already been expanded beyond the initial pilot in Dublin to Cork and Limerick.</p><p>The Greentown initiative is a broad community-based programme to support children, families and communities most affected by criminal networks, and its development is strongly supported by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The Greentown Report recommended the design of a programme to include interventions with children and their families to help them withstand the influence of criminal networks. The Greentown Programme has been designed by the REPPP project team with the input of leading international expertise on crime and criminal networks, together with Irish scientific, policy and practice expertise in child protection and welfare, drugs and community development.</p><p>Pilot applications of the Greentown programme, developed by the REPPP, commenced in two locations in 2020 and will run for three years. The learning from these pilots will then be incorporated into mainstream YDP practice. This specially designed intervention programme was developed with international expert advice, to tackle coercive control of children by criminal groups which entraps them in offending situations. Funds are already available for the initial pilots from the Dormant Accounts Funds, with a total of &euro;4.2m allocated over three years. </p><p>The implementation of the Greentown pilot programme is part of the Strategic Objectives of the Youth Justice Strategy 2021-2027. This implementation process began with the establishment of the Governance and Strategy Group, and the Youth Justice Oversight Group. Both groups are chaired by my Department, which will provide oversight arrangements for Youth Justice Initiatives to ensure that there is a cohesive response in practice to the needs of particular cohorts of children and particular communities.</p><p>Development and reform of youth justice systems is being taken forward in the context of a specific objective within the Strategy. This objective will ensure that oversight of policy development and implementation takes full account of the situation of children and young people in situations more likely to give rise to offending behaviour, and their families, with a view to enhancing the effectiveness of policies, programmes and practices, and with regard to duties arising from section 42 of the IHREC Act 2014, and aligned with the reform agenda contained in &ldquo;Our Public Service 2020&rdquo;.</p><p>To achieve this the Department will work collaboratively to ensure that the prevention of harm relating to offending behaviour is mainstreamed into Government policies affecting children, young people and their families, including through: </p> <blockquote> 	a) the development of a successor framework to &ldquo;Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures &ndash; the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People 2014- 2020&rdquo; (BOBF);<br /><br />b) the implementation of the recommendations of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland;<br /><br />c) the implementation of other national policies and strategies including, but not limited to drug and substance misuse, mental health, community development, employment and training. </blockquote>  <p>The Deputy will also be aware that almost &euro;200,000 in funding has been made available to YDPs nationally, including in the Deputy's own constituency, for a community-based approach to tackling the misuse of scramblers and other similar vehicles and I thank the Deputy for his contributions to this issue.  </p></reply>

It is also open to the person concerned to continue to engage with the US embassy to secure a visa appointment.</p>  <p>  In addition, the combined impact of the 2019 High Court judgment in the Jones case and the necessary health restrictions arising from the pandemic, has unfortunately resulted in the processing time for standard applications increasing. </p>  <p>  However, my Department is taking a number of steps to speed up the processing of applications and a number of digitisation measures have also been introduced to increase efficiency in the process, including eTax clearance, eVetting and online payments. The end result of the digitisation process will be to free up more staff to focus on processing applications in a timely and efficient manner, to improve service to our customers and reduce waiting times.</p>  <p>  In 2021, my Department issued 11,512 citizenship decisions, which is the highest number of decisions made since 2015, and reflects positively the significant changes undertaken to date. Additional staff have also been assigned to the citizenship team.</p>  <p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility at: INISOireachtasMail@justice.ie, which has been specifically established for this purpose. This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Question process. The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in the cases where the response is, in the Deputy's view, inadequate or too long awaited.</p></reply>

The Directive is an emergency provision designed to quickly and humanely respond to the mass displacement of Ukrainian people by Russian aggression.</p>  <p>  Those eligible for Temporary Protection (granted initially for one year, but renewable) will have immediate access to the labour market, social welfare, accommodation and other State supports as necessary. A whole-of-Government response is being mobilised to implement the practical arrangements to give effect to these commitments.</p>  <p>  The Directive has legal effect under Section 60 of the International Protection Act 2015. Section 60 (14) of the 2015 Act provides that temporary protection cannot be applied to a person who is an international protection applicant. </p>  <p>  Therefore, while those who are eligible for Temporary Protection under the EU Council Decision have a right to apply for International Protection separately under the International Protection Act, 2015, it is not possible for them to benefit from Temporary Protection if they have a current application for International Protection.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will also be aware, international protection applicants are not required to apply for an employment permit from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to legally obtain employment in the State. This applies to all international protection applicants, including those residing in State provided accommodation.</p>  <p>  The European Communities (Reception Conditions) (Amendment) Regulations 2021 (S.I. No. 52 of 2021) reduced the waiting period for labour market access for international protection applicants to 6 months and extended the validity of a labour market access permission to 12 months, with effect from 9 February 2021. The European Communities (Reception Conditions) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 2021 (S.I. No. 178 of 2021) provided for access to the labour market for international protection applicants who are subject to the Dublin III Regulation procedure and came into operation on 15 April 2021.</p>  <p>  Up to and including 1 March 2022, a total of 10,378 applications have been received by my Department for a labour market access permission. Of these applications, approximately three quarters (7,624) have been granted and 2,232 have been refused, with a further 340 applications pending. The pending figure includes applications which have not yet reached the 6 months criterion, and those where the return of requested supporting documents is awaited and may therefore ultimately become granted applications. A further 182 applications have been deemed closed. </p>  <p>  A total of 4,255 people granted a permission have returned an LMA5 form to my Department to indicate they had become either employed or self-employed. Of these, 2,976 resided in State-provided accommodation. </p></reply>

This has streamlined and supported the swift exit of both the Ukrainian family members of Irish citizens, and the family members of people from Ukraine who are resident in Ireland. It applies as an emergency measure to all Ukrainians travelling to Ireland and is a humanitarian response to the rapidly evolving situation in Ukraine.</p><p>Non-EEA family members of Ukrainian citizens, if they are a visa required national, will require a visa to travel to Ireland. However, in view of the circumstances, an application will be accepted for consideration if submitted from a country which is not the applicant's normal country of residence. Such applications will be dealt with speedily and sympathetically. </p></reply>

The Programme closed for applications on 11 March 2022.</p>  <p>  The Programme enabled current or former Afghan nationals living legally in Ireland to apply to  have certain close family members come to live with them in Ireland. There is no prohibition on a resettled refugee making an application under the Programme, as long as they can meet the requirement of providing accommodation and supports for their family member(s). If they are still living in accommodation provided by the International Protection Accommodation Service (IPAS) of the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth they will unfortunately not meet this requirement. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, no immigration programme can be unlimited in scope, therefore, in line with policy considerations, certain conditions must apply. The Programme has been developed to allow as many families as possible the opportunity to have some family members join them here in Ireland. </p>  <p>  The Afghan Admission Programme is additional to the current suite of immigration schemes and should not be viewed in isolation.  Many people are already availing of these other avenues, and will continue to do so.  Since the beginning of August 2021, a total of 133 join family visas have been approved for Afghan nationals and 64 family reunification applications. </p></reply>

This includes funding for the recruitment of up to an additional 800 Garda members and up to 400 Garda staff. It should be noted that many of the Garda members to be recruited will be drawn from the recent Garda recruitment competition which closed on 16 March. I welcome the strong interest in this campaign, with over 10,000 applications received. </p><p>Additionally, over 800 Garda members have also been redeployed in recent years from administrative duties to frontline policing roles where their expertise can be utilised fully. The continual commitment to this policy of redeployment has impacted and will continue to impact positively on local communities across the country, contributing to a more visible police presence.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, in accordance with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 (as amended), the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the management and administration of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which includes decisions on the deployment of personnel among the various Garda Divisions. The Deputy will appreciate that, as Minister, I have no direct role in these operational, policing matters. </p><p>I am assured that Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of policing priorities and crime trends, to ensure their optimum use. The full complement of resources fluctuates on an ongoing basis and where a deficiency in resources is identified, the matter is considered fully and addressed accordingly.</p><p>I understand that it is a matter for the Divisional Chief Superintendent to determine the optimum distribution of duties among the personnel available to them, having regard to the profile of each area within the division and its specific needs. </p><p>In the interests of transparency, detailed information in relation to Garda numbers is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.

Ireland participates in this measure, which is given legal effect under Section 60 of the International Protection Act 2015.</p>  <p>  Those eligible for Temporary Protection (granted initially for one year, but renewable) will have immediate access to the labour market, social welfare, accommodation and other State supports as necessary. A whole-of-Government response is being mobilised to implement the practical arrangements to give effect to these commitments. </p>  <p>  My Department is responsible for immigration controls and permissions at Dublin Airport. Immigration duties at all other airports and ports of entry to the State, including Rosslare Europort, are the responsibility of the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB). </p>  <p>  So far, approximately 80 per cent of people who have entered the State having fled Ukraine have been welcomed at Dublin Airport. Rosslare Europort currently accounts for approximately 8 per cent of all arrivals.</p>  <p>  As a result of the large numbers of Ukrainians arriving via Dublin Airport beneficiaries of temporary protection are being provided with their permission letter on arrival in the 'one-stop-shop' established by my Department for that purpose, to ensure early access to all necessary supports.</p>  <p>  Arrangements have also now been put in place to provide permission letters to those who arrived at Dublin Airport prior to 9 March (when permission letters started to issue) and to those who have arrived at other ports of entry to the State, including Rosslare Europort.  </p>  <p>  For people who are staying in State provided accommodation, staff from my Department are visiting these accommodation locations and will provide permission letters there. </p>  <p>  Alternatively, permission letters can be obtained by visiting the Ukraine Support Centre in Cork Street, Dublin 8. There, people can also receive assistance from the Department of Social Protection to obtain PPSN numbers, social welfare income supports, and to receive referrals to other State services. </p>  <p>  Arrangements are also being put in place that will allow people to obtain their permission letters from the Ukraine Support Centres in Cork City and in Limerick. Further details on this will be announced shortly.</p>  <p>  Approximately 10,000 temporary protection permission letters have been issued by my Department since the EU Directive was activated on 4 March.</p>  <p>  Representatives from the Citizens Information Service are also available in the Ukraine Support Centres to help people from Ukraine with enquiries of a more general nature.  Community Welfare Officers are also present to assist with applications for financial support.  Interpretation services are available at the Centres. </p>  <p>  Any person arriving from Ukraine can also attend any of the Department&rsquo; of Social Protection's Intreo Centres, located around the country, to register for a PPS Number and apply for income supports.  </p>  <p>  A centralised Government information portal is available at: www.gov.ie/ukraine, which is regularly updated.

I fully appreciate the strong emotional attachment we all have to our pets and that theft not only leads to their loss in our lives, but also a high level of concern for their welfare. It is also a crime which often affects, and is indeed often targeted against, older and particularly vulnerable people, for whom their pet is of huge emotional importance.</p>  <p>  It is important to emphasise that theft offences already apply to this crime, and can carry very heavy penalties. The Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001 provides for a maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment in the case of offences of theft and handling of stolen property; while a maximum sentence of 5 years imprisonment is provided for the offence of possession of stolen property.</p>  <p>  When imposing sentence, judges are not limited to considering the monetary value of a pet &ndash; the emotional distress to the victim caused by the offence is absolutely relevant and can be, and is, taken into account where appropriate. However, I acknowledge that the existing offence considers the offence as being one against property rather than a person or an animal and I am committed to examining the options to address the issue, including, if necessary, making legislative changes.</p>  <p>  From an enforcement perspective, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na takes this issue very seriously and has conducted several important actions against those responsible. Garda&iacute; have also disseminated information through the national Crime Prevention Officer Network regarding keeping animals secure and preventing these forms of theft. The Garda National Crime Prevention Unit's advice on pet safety, which is in line with the advice from animal welfare groups and animal insurance companies about keeping animals safe, can be viewed on the Garda website.</p>  <p>  I would like to emphasise the importance of microchipping. Every dog must be microchipped by the time it reaches 12 weeks of age, or earlier if it is sold or moved from its place of birth (Microchipping of Dogs Regulation 2015), and the microchip must be registered with an authorised database. Microchipping of all dogs protects the animals&rsquo; welfare, and assists with speedy identification of lost or stolen dogs and their owners. It is an offence to keep a dog over 12 weeks that has not been chipped and it is an offence to sell such a dog. Microchips can be easily checked at vets and by Garda&iacute;. They are by far and away the most effective means of tracking and identifying dogs.</p>  <p>  The Department of Agriculture have also made regulations covering the advertising for sale of animals under the Animal Welfare (Sale or Supply of Pets Regulations) 2019.</p></reply>

As Minister, I have no responsibility for these matters. </p>  <p>  However, the Government has supported An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in addressing the threat from organised crime gangs through the introduction of legislative measures such as:</p>  <p>-  The Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Act 2016, which provides additional Garda powers for the immediate seizure of assets suspected of being the proceeds of crime to prevent them being disposed of; and</p>  <p>-  The Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009, introduced to protect the justice system from being subverted by criminal groups, including potential intimidation of juries.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na strengthened its capacity to tackle organised crime in 2015, through the creation of the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau (GNDOCB), which is headed by a Detective Chief Superintendent reporting to Assistant Commissioner, Organised and Serious Crime. The role is to proactively, via intelligence led investigations, target top tier Organised Crime Groups (OCGs) impacting on this jurisdiction.  </p>  <p>  GNDOCB enjoys continuing significant success in disrupting drug trafficking and the supply of illicit drugs by organised crime groups. Its work is supported by Divisional Drugs Units, which tackle drug-related crime on a local basis throughout the country, in collaboration with other law enforcement partners and all Garda&iacute; working in local communities. Divisional Drug Units are now established in every Garda Division. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to be aware that Operation Tara was launched by the Garda Commissioner in July of last year and this Operation has had significant success in disrupting, dismantling and prosecuting those involved in drug trafficking networks at international, national and local levels. Under Operation Tara, there have been significant seizures nationwide, with the seizure of approximately &euro;2m worth of cannabis herb last August the most significant.</p></reply>

A concerted effort has been made over the past two years to ensure that the detection and prevention of these types of criminal activity have not been adversely affected by the unprecedented demands placed on policing services by the vital enforcement of public health restrictions. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the management and administration of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including Garda operations aimed at preventing and countering criminal activity, and the enforcement of legislation pertaining to illegal drugs. As Minister, I have no direct role in these matters.</p>  <p>  The Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau (GNDOCB) is having significant success in disrupting drug trafficking and the supply of illicit drugs by organised crime groups. The Bureau&rsquo;s work is supported by Divisional Drugs Units nationwide, and by all Garda&iacute; working in local communities. GNDOCB also works closely and productively with international law enforcement partners. Garda&iacute; continue to work closely with local authorities, the HSE, NGOs, community groups and other State agencies to tackle the problems of drug addiction and abuse.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that the Department of Health leads on Government policy in the area of drugs, and this policy is guided by the national drugs and alcohol strategy "Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery - a health-led response to drug and alcohol use in Ireland 2017-2025". This strategy represents a whole-of-government response to drug and alcohol use in Ireland. The implementation of the strategy is led by my colleague, the Minister for Health, however, the strategy includes actions for all stakeholders, including my Department and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  </p>  <p>  The strategy recognises the need for a balanced health-led approach - reducing demand, while also reducing access to illegal drugs, and is aimed at reducing the number of people criminalised for the possession of drugs for personal use. While this strategy supports vulnerable people who use drugs, it is also matched with strengthened enforcement measures across government to tackle the supply of illegal drugs. Sustained action by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has continued unabated throughout the pandemic, bringing significant convictions and ongoing seizures of drugs, firearms and ammunition.</p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that on 2 July 2021, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na commenced an enhanced national anti-drugs strategy, Operation Tara, which has a strong focus on tackling street-level dealing throughout rural and urban Ireland. The focus of Operation Tara is to disrupt, dismantle and prosecute drug trafficking networks, at all levels - international, national and local - involved in the importation, distribution, cultivation, production, local sale and supply of controlled drugs.</p>  <p>  Recent successes of Operation Tara include:</p>  <p>-  Garda&iacute; attached to the Divisional Drugs Unit in Drogheda conducted a search in the Legavoureen area of Drogheda and seized more than &euro;247,000 worth of Diazepam tablets on 24 November 2021;</p>  <p>-  From 30 November to 3 December 2021, Garda&iacute; in Wicklow, led by the Wicklow Divisional Drugs Unit, searched 26 locations in the county following an extensive investigation targeting the sale and supply of controlled drugs. 19 persons were charged and 12 youths were referred to the Garda Youth Diversion Programme.</p>  <p>-  GNDOCB, assisted by other specialised units, undertook a particular operation designed to address drug-related issues being experienced in West Dublin and wider afield, including drug-related threat-to-life incidents and other forms of intimidation. On 19 January 2022, 24 premises were searched, with &euro;700,000 in cash seized alongside 16 high value watches and eight vehicles. Six suspects were arrested in the course of the operation. </p>  <p>-  On 29 January 2022, Garda&iacute; searched three properties in Tallaght, Dublin 24. During the course of the searches four firearms were seized, along with silencers and ammunition. Garda&iacute; also seized approximately &euro;70,000 worth of suspected heroin as well as small quantities of crack cocaine and cannabis. Two men were arrested at the scene. </p>  <p>  I am advised by the Garda authorities that in 2021, the GNDOCB seized &euro;63.689m in illicit drugs, and seized cash of &euro;5.6m and &pound;38,751 (UK). In addition, &euro;8.23m, &pound;142,520 (UK) and $23 (US) was forfeited to the State in 2021.</p>  <p>  All drugs seized are subject to analysis by Forensic Science Ireland (FSI).</p></reply>

The Bureau has staff drawn from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners (including Customs), the Department of Social Protection and my Department.</p><p>The Bureau&rsquo;s remit is to target the assets, wherever situated, of persons which derive or are suspected to derive, directly or indirectly, from criminal conduct.

All prisoners are eligible and allowed to use the services, including those who are first-time offenders. There is no application process and the Service does not collect data on the number of first time offenders who availed on these services. </p><p>The Prison Service Strategic Plan 2019 - 2022 commits to further develop the integration of prisoner care and support services to deliver more effective rehabilitation to prisoners. It aims to enhance sentence planning through Integrated Sentence Management to maximise the potential engagement of prisoners in constructive and structured activities during their time in custody. </p><p>The prisons Work and Training service make available work, work-training and other purposeful activities to all those in custody. Work Training Officers have been appointed and assigned to areas such as catering, laundry, industrial cleaning and industrial skills. </p><p>The &quot;Working to Change Social Enterprise Strategy - 2021-2023&quot; sets out my Department&rsquo;s direction for supporting employment options for people with convictions by simultaneously working to remove systemic barriers so that people can make sustainable changes. It builds upon a solid foundation of employment supports already in place across the criminal justice sector and is a collaboration between the Prison and Probation Service and my Department.</p><p>The Joint Irish Prison Service/ETBI Education Strategy 2019 &ndash; 2022 commits to the provision of broad based education. The Department of Education and Skills provides an allocation of 220 whole time teacher equivalents to the Service.  The focus is on providing education which is quality assured, student centred and which facilitates lifelong learning. </p><p>As well as seeking to draw on best practice in adult and further education in the community, curriculum development that is specific to prison circumstances have taken place, such as courses on addiction, health issues and offending behaviour. Other areas where there has been significant progress in prison education are in physical education, in the provision for higher education, in the arts, in preparing prisoners for release and supporting their transition to life, and often to education, on the outside.  </p><p>The Prison Psychology Service provide assessment and intervention and operates a &lsquo;proactive&rsquo; referral service for particular cohorts of people in custody. The Psychology Service proactively engages with the following groups of people:</p><p>-  18 &ndash; 24 year olds who are committed to custody with a sentence of one year or more, without Post Release Supervision with the Probation Service;</p><p>-  People committed to custody with a sentence of two years or more for a violent offence, without Post Release Supervision with the Probation Service;</p><p>-  People convicted of sexual violence;</p><p>-  People sentenced to life imprisonment.</p><p>-  The Probation Service have joined this initiative by engaging in assessments with those 18-24 year olds who have post release supervision orders. This multi-agency approach to offender management and rehabilitation is in place in order to reduce re-offending and improve prisoner outcomes. </p><p>Since 2020, due to the pandemic, every effort is made to ensure the delivery of services continued in so far as possible, with course materials and books delivered to people in cells if, for example, they were in quarantine.  A TV Information Channel was also developed and a Covid Communications Group consisting of Red Cross, Healthcare, Psychology, Education, Chaplains, Resettlement member produced regular Prisoner Newsletters (also translated into the main languages) which were delivered to people in custody, to ensure they were kept up-to-date with information and any changes regarding rehabilitation, including educational and library services.</p></reply>

As Minister, I have no direct role in these matters. </p><p>I am advised by the Garda authorities that as of 28 February 2022, the latest date for which figures are available, there were a total of 14,315 current Garda members.</p><p>I am assured that Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of policing priorities and crime trends, to ensure their optimum use.

On the 16 April 2021 I published the General Scheme of the Criminal Justice (Hate Crime) Bill 2021, the text of which can be accessed on my Department's website. Following its publication, the General Scheme was referred to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice for pre-legislative scrutiny, which took place on 17 November 2021. </p>  <p>  I recently published Justice Plan 2022 and it commits to advancing this work and to publishing the Hate Crime Bill in quarter 2 of this year.</p>  <p>  The Bill will create new, aggravated forms of certain existing criminal offences, where those offences are motivated by prejudice against a protected characteristic.

In 2018 Government noted the intention to progress the awarding of the contract for a replacement pharmacy and carpark extension, as key enablers of the main development.

The measure will be ring fenced to staff ordinarily onsite in COVID-19 exposed healthcare environments within the period between 1 March 2020 and 30 June 2021.</p>  <p>  This payment will be made to those eligible public sector frontline healthcare staff (inclusive of agency staff working for the HSE) who worked in clinical settings, noting this list is not exhaustive: those Doctors / Nurses / Health Care Assistants / Porters / Cleaners etc. that work in clinical settings. The measure encompasses Health Care Support Assistants (also known as Home Carers / Home Help) employed by or carrying out duties contracted to the HSE.</p>  <p>  The measure also encompasses those eligible working on site in long term residential care facilities for people with disabilities (inclusive of those facilities whether HSE or section 39). The measure further extends to those equivalent healthcare workers in private nursing homes and hospices. Arrangements for this sector encompassed by this measure are currently being progressed by the Department of Health.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health appreciates the levels of interest this announcement has generated. We are working together with the HSE to provide additional details on this measure including full eligibility criteria, particulars and terms and conditions that apply. Additionally, the Department and the HSE are currently consulting with health sector trade unions on this matter. This consultation is part of the Department and HSE&rsquo;s objective to finalise the application of this measure fairly.</p>  <p>  Upon conclusion of consultations with the trade unions, full details of the application process, FAQs and other particulars shall be published by the HSE. Noting that the details will be finalised once this consultation has concluded, it would be inappropriate to comment any further at this point.</p></reply>

This work is taking place with the support of the Irish Red Cross and NGOs and charities across the country, including Newbridge and Co. Kildare.</p>  <p>  A webpage on the whole-of-Government response is available at www.gov.ie/ukraine and includes information on supports and services available to people arriving from Ukraine. This webpage will be supplemented and updated on an ongoing basis with the support of the relevant Departments.  </p>  <p>  The Department of Health is liaising with other Government departments and agencies to provide humanitarian support for Ukrainian refugees. It is a priority for the Department and the HSE to ensure that Ukrainian refugees are provided with appropriate health and social care services. </p>  <p>  Refugees from the Ukraine will be granted temporary protection status. Under this measure, refugees will be considered ordinarily resident in Ireland for a limited time period and therefore will be entitled to access health care services, in line with other refugee groups and Irish citizens.</p>  <p>  A one-stop-shop is being provided in Dublin airport and other locations for Ukrainian refugees. This includes application for temporary protection status, PPSN and welfare payment, emergency accommodation and information on health services, including a medical card.</p>  <p>  My Department is collaborating with the HSE to ensure that refugees have access to the same range of health care services as Irish and EU citizens. </p>  <p>  Refugees holding temporary protection status will be entitled to apply for a medical card order to access primary care services for each adult and child dependents. A streamlined Medical Card application process for Ukrainian refugees is now in place. A lag in applications is apparent and was expected as people are settling into their accommodation. </p>  <p>  The medical card section on the HSE website is replicated in Russian and Ukrainian. A Ukrainian and Russian version of the medical card form is also available.</p>  <p>  Health care services will include primary health care services for adults, children and older people, ongoing care of priority medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease and other chronic illness, services for psychological stress and mental health, and social care services for people with special needs. It is the intention to provide these services in a culturally appropriate manner and to take into account language and other factors.</p></reply>

While significant work continues to positively impact on waiting times and improve pathways to elective care, acute hospitals have been impacted by operational challenges arising from surges in cases related to the Delta and Omicron variants.</p><p>The HSE has confirmed to the Department that patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p><p>The Department of Health continues to work with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to identify ways to improve access to care, including through increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services, providing virtual clinics, and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.</p><p>&euro;350m is being allocated in 2022 to the HSE and the NTPF to primarily provide additional public and private activity to further stabilise and reduce scheduled care waiting lists and waiting times in tandem with bringing forward much needed longer-term reforms. This will supplement the core activity of the HSE as detailed in the HSE National Service Plan (NSP) 2022.</p><p>The 2022 waiting list action plan, which the Minister for Health will bring to Government shortly, builds on the successes of the short-term 2021 plan that ran from September to December last year. The 2021 plan was developed by the Department of Health, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) and was driven and overseen by a senior governance group co-chaired by the Secretary General of the Department and the CEO of the HSE and met fortnightly. This rigorous level of governance and scrutiny of waiting lists has continued into this year with the oversight group evolving into the Waiting List Task Force. It has produced a comprehensive 2022 waiting list action plan which will set out high-level targets for waiting list improvement including dedicated funding for service reform, patient pathway improvement, and important significant additionality to substantially reduce the backlog of patients waiting. The taskforce will meet regularly to drive progress of the 2022 plan.</p><p>This is the first stage of an ambitious Multi-Annual Waiting List Plan, which is currently under development in the Department. Between them, these plans will work to support short, medium, and long term initiatives to reduce waiting times and provide the activity needed in years to come.</p><p>In regard to the information requested by the Deputy, The National Treatment Purchase Fund has advised my Department, that they do not receive any extract files for Merlin Park Hospital. Data for Merlin Park is instead incorporated into the Galway University Hospital waiting list. In light of this, the NTPF have provided the requested waiting times data at Galway University Hospital. This information is outlined in the following link.  This information is also available on the NTPF website at: www.ntpf.ie/home/nwld.htm </p></reply>

The allocation to the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) has increased year-on-year from &euro;5.1million in 2016, &euro;22.6 million in 2017, &euro;55 million in 2018, &euro;75 million in 2019,  &euro;100 million in &euro;2020, &euro;130 million in 2021 and there was a further increase announced in Budget 2022 to &euro;150 million. For 2021 and 2022 the core NTPF budget was &euro;100 million, additional allocations of &euro;30 million in 2021, as a once off Covid related payment and &euro;50 million in 2022 to help reduce hospital and community waiting lists were granted.</p><p>The NTPF procures capacity for high-volume procedures in order to positively impact waiting time for patients. Such procedures may be procured in both private hospitals (outsourcing), or public hospitals (insourcing). In order to ensure competitive pricing as part of their outsourcing programme, the NTPF works with private hospitals from a panel agreement and engages in procurement processes through e-tender. In relation to insourcing, a public hospital may have some spare capacity but require further funding in order to utilise it. Such public hospitals may make a proposal to the NTPF, whereby the NTPF pay a fixed price per procedure performed. The amount paid by the NTPF meets the extra costs incurred by the public hospital in performing the procedures.</p><p>The information requested by the Deputy in relation to the amount spent by the NTPF in the public system and on private services, is outlined in the following table, provided to my Department by the NTPF. <table>    <tr>       <th>Expenditure incurred by NTPF related to payments to private and public hospitals to provide inpatient and outpatient services to patients. </th>       <th><div>2016*</div></th>       <th><div>2017</div></th>       <th><div>2018</div></th>       <th><div>2019</div></th>       <th><div>2020</div></th>       <th><div>2021**</div></th>       <th><div>Total</div></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Private Hospitals</td>       <td>30,387,932</td>       <td>9,948,651</td>       <td>31,420,173</td>       <td>29,204,118</td>       <td>22,957,536</td>       <td>44,913,597</td>       <td>168,832,007</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Public Hospitals</td>       <td>-</td>       <td>3,101,350</td>       <td>17,364,472</td>       <td>29,750,949</td>       <td>47,516,961</td>       <td>48,004,160</td>       <td>145,737,892</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total</td>       <td>30,387,932</td>       <td>13,050,001</td>       <td>48,784,645</td>       <td>58,955,067</td>       <td>70,474,497</td>       <td>92,917,757</td>       <td>314,569,899</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

For the duration of the Covid-19 public health emergency, where the need for social distancing, reducing personal contacts and reducing the burden on medical practitioners are paramount, it became possible for a woman to access a termination under section 12 of the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 (i.e., before 12 weeks) from her medical practitioner by telephone or video conference consultation.</p>  <p>  There is ongoing engagement between the Department of Health and the HSE to monitor service provision, facilitate the smooth-running of the service and resolve any issues that may arise. However, with restrictions eased, the Department is currently reviewing whether remote consultation as part of a blended approach to termination of pregnancy care should be continued post the COVID-19 public health emergency period.</p>  <p>  At the request of the Department, the HSE conducted a review of the Revised Model of Care for Termination of Pregnancy. The findings of this review are currently being examined.</p>  <p>  It is important to reflect that COVID-19 is still with us and Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) guidance on Managing Risk of Transmission of Respiratory Viruses including COVID-19, continues to advise, amongst other things, to limit footfall in General Practice settings and support telephone consultations where care that meets the needs of the patient can be delivered - this helps to eliminate the risk of transmission of viral infection. As such the arrangements for remote access to this service in the context of COVID-19 remain in place.</p></reply>

This approach must be based on population health needs, reflect the policy agenda, span multiple time horizons, and be informed by international best practice. </p>  <p>  My Department has commenced a programme of work to deliver a Health and Social Care Workforce Planning Strategy and Action Plan and Planning Projection Model. This work is being undertaken with the support of the European Commission under the auspices of their Technical Support Instrument which will provide the technical expertise to deliver this project. The work is due to be completed in Autumn 2023.  The project will build on existing health and social care workforce planning initiatives to develop future health and social care workforce demand and supply planning projections. The HSE is actively supporting and engaged in this work. The Strategic Workforce Planning Unit in my Department are working in collaboration with the HSE, Government Departments, Higher Education Sector, Regulators, and Professional bodies to deliver on this strategic workforce planning initiative. </p>  <p>  The development of an integrated health and social care workforce planning approach will be progressed in the context of strong engagement with key stakeholders across government including the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, the Higher Education Authority, the HSE and other government departments to ensure that sufficient workers are being trained in the right disciplines to meet population needs and to agree new ways of training multidisciplinary teams.</p>  <p>  A subgroup, within existing structures, is being established to engage in detailed workforce planning for the immediate term to support the implementation of the Disability Action Plan, and the training programmes required to produce additional staff with the right skills and qualifications to enable service capacity to grow in line with requirements. This group involves the HSE, and service providers.

Complex policy questions are currently being resolved in order to meet these criteria and mitigate the high risks and costs associated with unintended consequences - including the risks that the Deputy mentions - with a view to introducing legislation as soon as possible once this is complete. </p>  <p>  The Department of Health and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and other Departments have met to discuss the matter a number of times and continue working together on developing a policy in relation to the treatment of rental income. I expect to be in a position to bring legislation forward in the coming months.</p>  <p>  It is also worth noting changes that have been introduced relating to the sale of a residence. Within the NHSS, the asset value of a resident's home, known in the Scheme as the "principal residence", is assessed for 3 years, with 7.5% of its value going towards the cost of care (3.75% in the case of a couple). After 3 years on the scheme, the value of this property is no longer assessed. In practice, this generally reduces the nursing home fees of those maintaining their home, from year four onwards. However, under previous rules, if it was sold, the resulting cash asset was assessable in full for the entire length of stay in care. This could act as a disincentive for those who might otherwise consider selling their homes. The 2021 Act now extends the 3-year cap to cover the proceeds of sale, so that a person will be able to sell their home without incurring additional fees from the fourth year onwards.</p></reply>

The primary legislation underpinning the NHSS is the Nursing Home Support Scheme Act 2009. Participants in the NHSS contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.</p>  <p>  Funding to support people to access services in the sector continues to be provided in line with the long-established statutory mechanisms under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009. This is the mechanism established by the Oireachtas to provide for the processes relating to funding under the NHSS and the negotiation of prices for services for private and voluntary providers with the designated State agency, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF). </p>  <p>  The Department of Health has also provided significant specific supports to the private and voluntary nursing home sector over the course of the pandemic. As you are aware, the COVID-19 Temporary Assistance Payment Scheme, also known as TAPS, was established as part of a package of support measures for nursing homes at the start of the pandemic. &euro;134.5 million was made available under the scheme from March 2020 to June 2021. The outbreak assistance element of the scheme is still in payment. In addition to TAPS, direct support has been provided by the HSE to private nursing homes in many areas, including the provision of PPE, serial testing and support with staffing.</p>  <p>  The Department published a review of the NTPF pricing system in June 2021. This review was conducted by the NTPF with input from stakeholders and external experts. It recommended several actions to improve the pricing system. These are now being taken forward by the Department and NTPF. Given the size and scope of the NHSS, which is expected to cost the State more than &euro;1.04 billion this year, any changes must be delivered carefully and with due consideration to their impact and any unexpected consequences.</p>  <p>  The department is also taking forward the 9 recommendations of the Value for Money Review on Nursing Home Costs, which was published in December 2021. The purpose of the VFM Review was to identify, quantify and analyse the reasons for any cost differential between private/voluntary and public nursing homes and, following analysis, to make recommendations for improving the value for money obtained by the Health sector.</p>  <p>  To continue the substantial progress being made on implementing the recommendations of the COVID-19 Nursing Homes Expert Panel report, nearly &euro;18 million euro was allocated in Budget 2022 including investment in Community Support Teams and Safeguarding supports.</p>  <p>  Finally, in response to the strategic workforce challenges in the nursing home and home care sector, a Cross-Departmental Strategic Workforce Advisory Group has been established. The Group is working to a tight timeline and is committed to providing a set of recommendations to me by September 2022.</p></reply>

While significant work continues to positively impact on waiting times and improve pathways to elective care, acute hospitals have been impacted by operational challenges arising from surges in cases related to the Delta and Omicron variants.</p><p>The HSE has confirmed to the Department that patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p><p>The Department of Health continues to work with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to identify ways to improve access to care, including through increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services, providing virtual clinics, and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.</p><p>&euro;350m is being allocated in 2022 to the HSE and the NTPF to primarily provide additional public and private activity to further stabilise and reduce scheduled care waiting lists and waiting times in tandem with bringing forward much needed longer-term reforms. This will supplement the core activity of the HSE as detailed in the HSE National Service Plan (NSP) 2022.</p><p>The 2022 waiting list action plan, which the Minister for Health will bring to Government shortly, builds on the successes of the short-term 2021 plan that ran from September to December last year. The 2021 plan was developed by the Department of Health, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) and was driven and overseen by a senior governance group co-chaired by the Secretary General of the Department and the CEO of the HSE and met fortnightly. This rigorous level of governance and scrutiny of waiting lists has continued into this year with the oversight group evolving into the Waiting List Task Force. It has produced a comprehensive 2022 waiting list action plan which will set out high-level targets for waiting list improvement including dedicated funding for service reform, patient pathway improvement, and important significant additionality to substantially reduce the backlog of patients waiting. The task force will meet regularly to drive progress of the 2022 plan.</p><p>This is the first stage of an ambitious Multi-Annual Waiting List Plan, which is currently under development in the Department. Between them, these plans will work to support short, medium, and long term initiatives to reduce waiting times and provide the activity needed in years to come.</p><p>The health system does not collect the data necessary to calculate average wait times.  In particular, the time to treatment of patients who have already received their care is not collected.  The NTPF collects data on patients currently on the waiting list and the average time that these patients have been waiting is provided here. <table>    <tr>       <th>Report</th>       <th>Archive Date</th>       <th>Count</th>       <th>Mean Average Wait in Days</th>       <th>Median Average Wait in Days</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>IP waits Paediatric Urology Cavan and Monaghan</td>       <td>24/02/2022</td>       <td>13</td>       <td>384</td>       <td>295</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p><i>The health system does not collect the data necessary to calculate average wait times.

In early February (2022) I met with senior officials of Children&rsquo;s Heath Ireland (CHI) and the HSE, as well as senior orthopaedic clinicians from Temple Street, Crumlin and Cappagh, to discuss the finalisation of this plan to increase orthopaedic activity. Both current and capital funding totalling &euro;19 million is being provided, including investment through the recently launched 2022 waiting list action plan. </p>  <p>  The &euro;19 million plan is an ambitious one and proposes additional activity levels which will work to reduce the number of children waiting long periods for orthopaedic procedures (including scoliosis and spina bifida). The additional funding is being used to provide additional theatre access at Temple Street and Crumlin, as well as diagnostic MRI capacity that will be brought on stream this year at both sites. The funding will also be used to enable further activity and paediatric theatre lists at Cappagh Hospital, or Cappagh Kids. </p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

The committee's recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation. It makes recommendations on vaccination policy to my Department. The NIAC continues to revise recommendations to allow for the introduction of new vaccines in Ireland and to keep abreast of changes in the patterns of disease. Therefore, the immunisation schedule will continue to be amended over time.</p>  <p>  In 2009, the NIAC recommended HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccination for all 12 to 13 year old girls to reduce their risk of developing cervical cancer when they are adults. In September 2010, the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of secondary school.</p>  <p>  In June 2017, on foot of the NIAC&rsquo;s recommendation that the HPV vaccine should also be given to boys, my Department asked the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to undertake a health technology assessment (HTA) to establish the clinical and cost-effectiveness of extending the immunisation programme to include boys in the first year of secondary school.</p>  <p>  The HIQA completed the HTA in December 2018, recommending that the HPV immunisation programme be extended to include boys. A policy decision was made to extend the HPV immunisation programme to include boys, starting in September 2019, with the introduction of a 9-valent HPV vaccine.</p>  <p>  The ages at which vaccines are recommended in the immunisation schedule are chosen by the NIAC in order to give each child the best possible protection against vaccine preventable diseases. As the HPV vaccine is preventative it is intended to be administered, if possible, before a person becomes sexually active, that is, before a person is first exposed to HPV infection.</p>  <p>  Therefore, the gender-neutral HPV vaccination programme targets all girls and boys in first year of secondary school to provide maximum coverage. All vaccines administered through the School Immunisation Programme are provided free of charge.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to be guided by NIAC's recommendations on any emerging evidence on this issue in the future.</p>  <p>  Anyone not in 1st year of secondary school or age equivalent in special schools or home schooled during the 2020/2021 school year who wishes to get the HPV vaccine, must go to their GP or sexual health clinic and pay privately for the vaccine and its administration. This applies to everyone whether or not they have a medical card/GP visit card, as it is outside of the HPV immunisation programme.</p>  <p>  My Department has asked the National Immunisation Advisory Committee to consider the clinical effectiveness of providing the HPV vaccine to: </p>  <p>  - girls and boys in secondary school who were eligible to receive HPV vaccine in 1st year but who did not receive it; and </p>  <p>  - women up to the age of 25 years who have left secondary school and who did not receive the vaccine when eligible.</p>  <p>  If NIAC conclude that there is sufficient evidence to support providing the HPV vaccine to one or both groups, HIQA will undertake a cost-effectiveness assessment on that basis.</p></reply>

Regardless of whether it is a private, voluntary or public nursing home, the resident's financial contribution is the same; the price of care only affects levels of state funding and has no direct impact on the resident.</p>  <p>  In December 2021, the Department published the independently-chaired Value For Money review on nursing home costs, which reviewed the variance in costs between public and private nursing homes.

The role of the group is to examine the strategic workforce challenges in front-line carer roles in the home and nursing homes.  Areas to be examined include recruitment, retention, skills development and sustainable employment of carers into the future.</p>  <p>I opened this Groups inaugural meeting on 3rd March, where the Terms of Reference were agreed.  These are available on the Department&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  The Group will progress a structured programme of ongoing consultative engagements with stakeholders to further explore and define the issues, listen to stakeholder views, and identify approaches to respond to the strategic workforce challenges.  </p>  <p>  The Group will also provide a forum for agreement on strategic approaches to address the workforce challenges in the sector and develop a report for my consideration outlining the Group&rsquo;s key findings, recommendations, and a proposed action plan to support implementation of these recommendations to include periodic monitoring of progress.</p>  <p>  In 2021, the National Skills Bulletin produced by the Skills and Labour Market Research Unit (SLMRU) in SOLAS, presented an overview of the Irish Labour market in relation to care workers. It reports that employment numbers fell over a 5 year period, particularly over the previous year (most likely due to Covid). There is also a high proportion of care workers aged 55 yrs and older (24%) which could affect replacement demand.</p>  <p>  The continuing reopening of the economy and the labour market should help ease the labour shortages in the health care sector.</p>  <p>  Please also know a large proportion of staff who work in the healthcare industry are employed by private companies and as such do not fall under the remit of Department of Health or its agencies.  It would be inappropriate for me to comment on their terms and conditions or contracts of employment.</p></reply>

Given the number of CAs that are committed to in the Programme for Government, and the constraints that had delayed their establishment, these CAs will run concurrently, for the first time. </p><p>It is envisaged that the inaugural meeting of the CAs will take place in April this year, with the assemblies concluding their work and submitting their reports ideally by the end of the year at latest, and earlier if possible. </p><p>It is proposed that a Citizens&rsquo; Assembly on Drug Use will directly follow these two Assemblies, with the intention of running it concurrently with the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly on the Future of Education, if learnings from the concurrent running of CAs suggest that this operational model is the best way forward  <i>.</i></p><p>In line with this decision, I have commenced preparations for the CA on drug use. This is being done to ensure that there will be no delay in establishing the CA when the two other CAs complete their work, before the end of this year or in quarter 1 2023 at the latest. This will allow a period of over one year for the Government to consider its recommendations.</p><p>Drug use affects all members of society, whether directly or indirectly, and imposes very significant social and financial costs. There are two issues in particular I wish the citizens assembly to consider, namely, how can we better meet the diverse health needs of people who use drugs, and also, how can we prevent the harmful impact of drugs on children, families, and communities.</p><p>I would also like to see an international component to the citizens assembly, so that there is an exchange of good practice from the British Ireland Council work sector on drugs (which I chair) and the EU Drugs Strategy and Action Plan, especially on alternative approaches to coercive sanctions.</p><p>The recent meeting of the National Oversight Committee for the National Drugs Strategy afforded me an opportunity to consult with committee members to hear their views and perspectives regarding the content of the citizens&rsquo; assembly.</p><p>As we prepare for the CA on drug use, work will continue in implementing the government&rsquo;s health-led national drugs strategy and the six strategic priorities for the remaining four years of the strategy.</p><p>I am very positive about the potential contribution of the CA to the Government's health-led response to drug use as it will provide an opportunity to reflect on progress made under the national drugs strategy. </p></reply>

Infant formula is needed as not all babies are breastfed. </p>  <p>  The WHO International Code of Marketing of Breast Milk Substitutes is aimed at protecting children and families from inappropriate marketing of breastmilk substitute products. The Code covers infant formula products up to the age of 3 years. </p>  <p>  The Department works closely with the HSE National Breast Feeding Co-ordinator, who has responsibility for the implementation of the HSE Breastfeeding Action Plan 2016-2021. The HSE has established the National Breastfeeding Implementation Group to progress the actions. A new Code of Marketing of Breast Milk Substitutes in public health services has been completed and is effective from 1st October 2021.</p>  <p>  Detailed compositional and labelling requirements for infant formulae and follow-on formulae intended for use by infants in good health are set out in EU Regulations. The importance of the WHO International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes is also recognised in these Regulations. Under the Regulations, the labelling, presentation and advertising of infant formulae and follow-on formulae must be designed so as not to discourage breastfeeding.</p>  <p>  The labelling of infant formula must bear &lsquo;a statement concerning the superiority of breast feeding and a statement recommending that the product be used only on the advice of independent persons having qualifications in medicine, nutrition or pharmacy, or other professionals responsible for maternal and child care&rsquo;.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore, the advertising of infant formula is restricted to publications specialising in baby care and scientific publications. &lsquo;Such advertisements may contain only information of a scientific and factual nature.  Such information shall not imply that or create a belief that bottle-feeding is equivalent or superior to breast feeding&rsquo;.  Point-of-sale advertising, giving of samples or any other promotional device to induce sales of infant formula directly to the consumer at the retail level, is prohibited.</p>  <p>  As the rules on the labelling, presentation and advertising of infant formulae and follow-on formulae are harmonised at EU level, it is not proposed to introduce additional national rules. </p></reply>

The &ldquo;Elective Hospitals Oversight Group&rdquo;, under the joint governance of the Department of Health and HSE has been guiding the development of the elective hospital proposals, following the process outlined in the updated Public Spending Code, setting out the value for money requirements for the evaluation, planning, and management of large public investment projects.</p>  <p>  The provision of additional protected capacity for elective care is further confirmed by the Government Decision, in December 2021 and subject to the necessary approvals and requirements under the Public Spending Code being met, on a new National Elective Ambulatory Care Strategy.</p>  <p>   This new strategy aims to change the way in which day case, scheduled procedures, surgeries, scans and outpatient services can be better arranged to ensure greater capacity in the future and help to address waiting lists. The development of additional capacity will be provided through dedicated, standalone Elective Hospitals in Cork, Galway and Dublin. The Government decision is very clear on this.  No other locations are under active consideration. It is important to note that the locations chosen will allow for new facilities of a size and scale to implement a national elective care programme that will tackle waiting lists on a national basis. This means that the new facilities will be designed to maximise their capacity and in doing so will operate to cover as a wide catchment area as possible, extending beyond existing and future health areas including Limerick and neighbouring mid-west counties.</p>  <p>  The elective care scope of service will be developed in two phases commencing with day cases, diagnostics, and outpatients and then by in-patient treatment. On this basis, the Elective Care Centres (ECCs) will be designed to provide sufficient capacity to facilitate future phases, including some elective in patient capacity, thereby providing a sustainable and strategic response to cater for the highly dynamic landscape of healthcare policy and practice. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-03-29a.1880.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022032900085#WRJJ05900"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 723 and 724 together.</p><p>It is recognised that waiting times for scheduled appointments and procedures have been affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. While significant work continues to positively impact on waiting times and improve pathways to elective care, acute hospitals have been impacted by operational challenges arising from surges in cases related to the Delta and Omicron variants.</p><p>The HSE has confirmed to the Department that patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p><p>The Department of Health continues to work with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to identify ways to improve access to care, including through increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services, providing virtual clinics, and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.</p><p>The 2022 Waiting List Action Plan, which was launched on the 26th of February, allocates &euro;350 million to the HSE and NTPF to reduce waiting lists. Under this plan the Department, HSE, and NTPF will deliver urgent additional capacity for the treatment of patients, as well as investing in longer term reforms to bring sustained reductions in waiting lists.</p><p>The plan builds on the successes of the short-term 2021 plan that ran from September to December last year. The 2021 plan was developed by the Department of Health, the HSE and the NTPF and was driven and overseen by a senior governance group co-chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Health and the CEO of the HSE and met fortnightly.</p><p>This rigorous level of governance and scrutiny of waiting lists has continued into this year with the oversight group evolving into the Waiting List Task Force. The Task Force will meet regularly to drive progress of the 2022 plan.</p><p>This is the first stage of an ambitious multi-annual waiting list plan, which is currently under development in the Department of Health. Between them, these plans will work to support short, medium, and long term initiatives to reduce waiting times and provide the activity needed in years to come.</p><p>Waiting list reductions and maximum waiting time targets apply to all acute hospital scheduled care active waiting lists. The HSE is engaged with hospital groups in a process to focus on specialties and procedures towards which the waiting list fund needs to be specifically directed to ensure the targets are achieved by year end.</p><p>The data requested by the Deputy regarding the number of persons on the waiting list for sleep disorder screening was provided to my department by the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) in the attached document. The document outlines the numbers waiting for an Inpatient sleep disorder test by time band as at 24th February 2022, the most recently published waiting list figures.</p><p>Total Patients Waiting for an Inpatient Sleep Disorder Test by Wait Time Band as at 22/04/2022 <table>    <tr>       <th>0-3 Months</th>       <th>3-6 Months</th>       <th>6-9 Months</th>       <th>9-12 Months</th>       <th>12-15 Months</th>       <th>15-18 Months</th>       <th>18+ Months</th>       <th>Grand Total</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>325</td>       <td>390</td>       <td>224</td>       <td>221</td>       <td>113</td>       <td>90</td>       <td>302</td>       <td>1665</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

The effect of these regulations is to designate the professions of counsellor and psychotherapist under the Act and to establish one registration board for both professions. Members were appointed to the Counsellors and Psychotherapists Registration Board in February 2019 and they held their inaugural meeting in May 2019. The Registration Board has held 16 meetings since it was established. </p>  <p>  Details of board members can be found on CORU's website at coru.ie/about-us/registration-boards/counsellors-and-psychotherapists-registration-board/.</p>  <p>  The work of a registration board includes consideration of the titles to be protected and the minimum qualifications to be required of existing practitioners and the qualifications that will be required for future graduates. The work of the Counsellors and Psychotherapists Registration Board is significantly more challenging than it is for registration boards for some of the more established professions owing to the different and complex pathways into these professions, the variety of titles used, and the variety and number of courses and course providers. </p>  <p>  The work of the Counsellors and Psychotherapists Registration Board is ongoing. Progress by the Board to date has included: </p>  <p>  - the identification, verification and comprehensive assessment of legacy and historical qualifications to determine if they are appropriate for transitioning existing practitioners onto the respective register, and </p>  <p>  - research on the regulation of counsellors and psychotherapists internationally. </p>  <p>  I hope that this information is of assistance to you.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-03-29a.1915.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1608" speakername="Frank Feighan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022032900086#WRKK03400"><p>People who are long-term homeless experience a high prevalence of physical disease, mental illness, and substance use. As a result, they are more likely to die prematurely. A study of mortality among people who are homeless in Dublin (Ivers and Barry, 2018), found the median age at death for people who are homeless is young at just 42 years old, while the median age at death for homeless women is even lower at 37 years. The study recommended that a system of recording and reporting premature deaths among people who are homeless should be rolled out nationally so that data relating to all deaths in people known to be homeless in the state are available.  </p>  <p>  As a social determinant of health, being homeless worsens the physical and mental health of those affected and makes people more vulnerable to problematic drug and alcohol use. Furthermore, homelessness undermines the effectiveness of health care services, as it creates additional barriers for people in accessing treatment in a timely and integrated manner. </p>  <p>  The Health Research Board is responsible for managing the National Drug Related Deaths Index (NDRDI), which is a census of drug-related deaths and deaths among drug users and those who are alcohol dependent. The NDRDI was established in 2005 and is jointly funded by the Departments of Health and Justice and Equality.</p>  <p>  In 2020, the Department of Health asked the HRB to undertake a one-year feasibility study to collect mortality data among people known to be homeless from closed files in the Coroners Service through the existing NDRDI data collection methodology. The extension of this NDRDI methodology has been used successfully to collect data on other premature deaths, including road accidents and suicide.  </p>  <p>  The HRB is currently reviewing the data collected for deaths in 2019, including deaths among people who were homeless, in approximately 17,000 files from all Coroner districts. However, due to public health Covid-19 restrictions, data collection has been delayed and is not yet completed. The HRB hopes to have the report finalised by early summer, but this is contingent on continued access to the coroner&rsquo;s offices.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the feasibility study is to strengthen the evidence base for preventing premature death among people who are homeless. The public health response to Covid-19 greatly minimised the risk of illness and death for people who are homeless and improved their access to healthcare services. The ambitious targets in the Housing First Implementation Plan 2022-2026 is a further expression of my determination to break the vicious cycle of homelessness and premature death.</p></reply>

The public health response to the pandemic greatly minimised the risk of illness and death for people who are homeless and improved their access to healthcare services. More resources, better ways of working and client-centred delivery were key ingredients in providing a more effective health care service for people who are homeless during Covid-19.</p>  <p>  In 2021, the Department of Health provided additional funding of &euro;11 million to enhance health services for people who are homeless, and to continue the protective public health measures for the medically vulnerable and Covid positive homeless population.</p>  <p>  Housing for All sets out the Government policy for reducing and preventing homelessness. It commits to maintain and consolidate the enhanced healthcare services put in place in response to the pandemic. Accordingly, in Budget 2022, I provided a further &euro;10m in Covid funding for people who are homeless. </p>  <p>  Housing First is a long-term strategy to reduce homelessness and to enable those with complex health needs, including drug and alcohol use, to access permanent secure accommodation. The ambitious targets in the Housing First Implementation Plan 2022-2026 is an expression of the Government's determination to break the vicious cycle of homelessness and ill-health. Providing people with a home of their own is the critical ingredient that enables the effective and timely delivery of health care services. It allows health care professionals to put in place the wrap around supports that people who are long-term homeless urgently require. </p>  <p>  I am keen for the lessons learned on better ways of working and enhanced service provision for people who are homeless to be continued beyond the pandemic. In that context, I will consider further funding for medically supervised shielding facilities as part of the 2023 Estimates, taking into account the public health situation at the time.</p></reply>

They may engage in on-site and off-site private practice, and their private practice activity in the public hospital is subject to a 20% maximum limit (serving consultants whose private practice in 2006 was greater than 20% are permitted to retain this higher ratio, subject to an overriding maximum ratio of 70:30%).</p>  <p>  - Contract Type C - Consultants holding a Type C Contract may engage in on-site and off-site private practice.

While significant work continues to positively impact on waiting times and improve pathways to elective care, acute hospitals have been impacted by operational challenges arising from surges in cases related to the Delta and Omicron variants.</p><p>The HSE has confirmed to the Department that patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p><p>The Department of Health continues to work with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to identify ways to improve access to care, including through increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services, providing virtual clinics, and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.</p><p>The 2022 Waiting List Action Plan, which was launched on the 26th of February, allocates &euro;350 million to the HSE and NTPF to reduce waiting lists. Under this plan the Department, HSE, and NTPF will deliver urgent additional capacity for the treatment of patients, as well as investing in longer term reforms to bring sustained reductions in waiting lists.</p><p>The plan builds on the successes of the short-term 2021 plan that ran from September to December last year. The 2021 plan was developed by the Department of Health, the HSE and the NTPF and was driven and overseen by a senior governance group co-chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Health and the CEO of the HSE and met fortnightly.</p><p>  This rigorous level of governance and scrutiny of waiting lists has continued into this year with the oversight group evolving into the Waiting List Task Force. The Task Force will meet regularly to drive progress of the 2022 plan. </p><p>This is the first stage of an ambitious multi-annual waiting list plan, which is currently under development in the Department of Health. Between them, these plans will work to support short, medium, and long term initiatives to reduce waiting times and provide the activity needed in years to come.</p><p>The information requested by the Deputy concerning the number of patients waiting for knee &amp;amp; hip replacements by wait times, is outlined in the table below.</p><p><b>IP Hips and Knees as at 24/02/2022</b> <table>    <tr>

Under the Plan, &euro;5 million has been allocated to secure an additional 30,000 acute diagnostics appointments. Waiting list management, processes and systems are also being developed for acute diagnostics as part of the longer-term reform actions. A programme of work is due to commence, subject to my Department&rsquo;s approval, to deliver full waiting list data collection for all radiology diagnostics as well as a waiting list management protocol for radiology diagnostics, to be developed by the National Treatment Purchase Fund and the HSE. The Plan will also progress towards achievement of the Government maximum waiting time targets. The DoH, in consultation with the HSE, will work with key stakeholders to define the scope of diagnostics, procedures, and related services to be included within the maximum wait time target across acute scheduled care.</p>  <p>  Longer-term fundamental reform is dependent on resolving the delivery of integrated care which is patient focused and requires that delays in access to community care are addressed. Therefore, under the Waiting List Action Plan, important exploratory and foundational actions will be undertaken to map out and take short, medium-and long-term action to improve access and address waiting lists and waiting times in the community. These actions include the design and implementation of the Integrated Community Case Management System (ICCMS) as a foundational case management system to support communication between healthcare providers and effective management, planning and delivery of services; and the development of a process to complete a capacity and demand analysis across community waiting lists.</p></reply>

There is a process in place to offer newly qualified nursing and midwifery graduates permanent positions in the HSE. This process is managed through the Hospital Group and CHO networks. All Nursing and Midwifery graduates were offered permanent contracts in 2020, 2021 and the same is planned for 2022.</p>  <p>  In relation to the Health and Social Care Professionals, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that all graduates from Irish Colleges (Speech and Language Therapists, Occupational Therapists, Dieticians and Physiotherapists) from 2021 were given the opportunity to apply for positions in the HSE through a single national process.   Most of the Health and Social Care Professional graduates availed of this opportunity. These were all interviewed and placed on a HSE national panel.  Each member of the panel was offered multiple job opportunities across the country. It is planned to offer the same opportunities to the Health and Social Care Professional graduates in 2022.</p>  <p>  All eligible CAO entrants to Irish Medical Schools who are work permit exempt are guaranteed an internship place in the HSE following completion of their medical degree. It is a priority for CAO graduates to have access to internships in order that they may obtain full registration with the Medical Council of Ireland, and subsequently obtain specialist registration with a view to permanent employment in the Irish health service. This protects the State investment in their undergraduate education. It also supports Ireland's commitment under the World Health Organization&rsquo;s Global Code on the Recruitment of International Health Personnel to strive for self-sufficiency in the domestic production of doctors. </p>  <p>  Applicants for a medical internship are applying for an employment position and are recruited directly by the HSE. The HSE applies the Employment Permits Act in relation to recruitment for intern posts. Irish Medical School CAO entrants who are work permit exempt are guaranteed an intern post in the HSE. Following that, the remaining posts are allocated to all remaining and eligible EEA applicants, followed by all remaining and eligible non-EEA applicants.  All eligible CAO applicants have been allocated an intern post since 2016.</p></reply>

Some &euro;263m, of the &euro;350m fund made available via the 2022 WLAP, has been allocated to the HSE and National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) this year to source additional outpatient (OPD), endoscopy (GI Scopes), diagnostics and inpatient daycase (IPDC) activity to achieve this.</p>  <p>  A substantial piece of work with Hospital Groups and CHI to identify the specialties and indeed procedures to target is nearing completion. In the meantime, the HSE and NTPF are collaborating to procure as much additional activity as possible using existing arrangements.</p>  <p>  The HSE will continue to prioritise the delivery of care based on robust clinical guidance. Ongoing monitoring will take place to identify evidence of unmet historical, clinically urgent demand. To the extent that these demands are displacing non-urgent waiting list activity, further efforts will be made to secure additional capacity.</p>  <p>  The 2022 Waiting List Action Plan will also progress work towards the achievement of intermediate waiting time targets this year, as set out in the 2022 National Service Plan (98% of all patients on active waiting list will wait less than 18 months for their first Outpatients appointment and less than 12 months for their procedure).</p>  <p>  The 2022 Plan also focuses on 15 high volume inpatient day case procedures, including cataracts and hip and knee replacements, so that every person waiting over 6 months for one of these procedures, and who is clinically ready, will receive an offer of treatment via the NTPF.</p></reply>

Taking place within the broader context of the Sl&aacute;intecare reforms, this work encompasses the development of the regulatory framework for the new scheme; the examination of the options for the financing model for the scheme; and the development of a reformed model of service-delivery.</p>  <p>  With the aim of ensuring that all service-users are provided with a standard, high-quality level of care which is safe, effective, and person-centred, it is envisaged that the regulatory framework will comprise: (i) primary legislation for the licensing of public and private home-support providers; (ii) minimum requirements (i.e., regulations); and (iii) HIQA National Standards for Home Support Services.</p>  <p>  In April 2021, Government gave approval to draft a General Scheme and Heads of a Bill to establish a licensing framework for home-support providers. This is being progressed by the Department with a view to bringing it through the Houses of the Oireachtas at the earliest opportunity. It is expected that the primary legislation will give the Minister for Health the power to make regulations in respect of minimum requirements which will form the criteria against which a provider&rsquo;s eligibility to hold a licence will be determined. A regulatory impact analysis will be undertaken by the Department in 2022 to ensure effectiveness and mitigate risks.</p>  <p>  In collaboration with HIQA and in consultation with the Health Service Executive and other key informants, the Department developed draft regulations and a targeted stakeholder consultation was undertaken in January 2022. Evaluating the feedback of this consultation is informing amendments in the draft regulations in advance of a public consultation planned in Q2 2022.</p>  <p>  On 24th February, the ESRI published a report on the demand for and cost of home support. This is the final output from a programme of research that the ESRI has undertaken to support the Department of Health to progress the development of the new home support scheme.  This research will form an important part of the evidence base for the development of a sustainable funding model for home support services in the context of our ageing population.  Government approval will be sought in due course on any proposed legislation to provide for a financial support scheme, taking into consideration the cost associated with the various options.</p>  <p>  In addition, work is ongoing in relation to the development of a reformed model of service delivery for the new scheme. In 2021, funding was secured for the Health Service Executive to: (i) progress the roll-out of interRAI as the standard assessment tool for care-needs in the community; (ii) pilot a reformed model of service-delivery for home-support; and (iii) establish a National Office for Home Support Services.</p>  <p>  The Pilot for testing of a reformed model of service for the delivery for home-support is fully operational. It commenced in November in CHO 8, which is the first of the four pilot sites. The three other sites CHO2, CHO 4 and CHO 7 became operational in January 2022. Funding has been approved for 128 interRAI Care Needs Facilitators to progress the national rollout of interRAI as the standard assessment tool for care-needs.  The interRAI outputs and pilot site evaluation will be critical to the development of the new home-support scheme. A National Home Support Office is in the process of being established.</p></reply>

There is ongoing engagement between my Department and the fertiliser sector in Ireland.  Fertiliser companies provide sales data on a quarterly basis to my Department.  </p>  <p>  Additionally, I met with representatives of both the Irish Fertiliser Manufacturers and Blenders Association and the Fertiliser Association of Ireland on 10 March where we had a useful discussion on the challenges facing the industry arising from the ongoing serious situation caused by Russia&rsquo;s illegal war on Ukraine, including the impact on fertiliser price and availability.</p>  <p>  I raised concerns in relation to the impacts of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on agri-food supply chains, and especially on input costs at the extraordinary informal meeting of European Union Agriculture Ministers held on 2nd March.  I underlined the need for market support and the need to maintain supply chains and to ensure an effective and functioning Single Market. </p>  <p>  At the AgriFish Council of 21st March, I asked the EU Commission, as part of its work on monitoring markets, to keep a very close eye on the issue of fertiliser availability across the EU and to be ready to consider any measures that may help to alleviate the difficulties caused. The EU Commission is considering bringing in a private storage aid scheme for the pigmeat sector, as well as allowing other exceptional measures at Member State level to respond to market disturbances.</p>  <p>  At a meeting of farm organisations on 8th March, I established a National Fodder and Food Security Committee to explore all options to minimise the impact on farms and plan in the short to medium term. This Group continues to meet and it is expected that its outcomes will be presented shortly.</p>  <p>  I announced a package of targeted interventions for the tillage sector and a multi-species sward initiative worth over &euro;12 million to support Irish farmers. The package supports the growing of additional tillage and protein crops and the establishment of multi-species swards lowering demand for chemical fertiliser.</p>  <p>  I continue to closely monitor the evolving situation and both my Department is actively engaging with the fertiliser industry to evaluate stock levels and availability and assist in ensuring the ongoing continuity of supply. I will continue to back our farm families and their businesses through this challenging time. </p></reply>

To reduce reliance on chemical nitrogen, this package includes support for farmers who wish to establish multi-species swards and/or red clover silage swards.</p>  <p>  The Multi-Species Swards Measure was launched last Friday and remains open for applications until 4th April 2022. My Department is working on other initiatives within the package of measures, including the Red Clover Silage Measure which I expect to launch shortly.   </p>  <p>  Subject to farmer uptake and seed availability, these measures aim to establish approximately 12,000ha of Multi-Species Swards and 4,000ha of Red Clover Silage Swards. It is important to highlight that the target area in these schemes is limited by the availability of seed, most particularly clover and also herds.</p>  <p>  Last year I launched the Soil Sampling and Analysis Programme where sampling and analysis, including testing for soil pH, is provided free of charge for farmers.  This provides information on lime and other soil requirements which assist improving nutrient use efficiency. </p>  <p>  To achieve optimum soil pH on intensive farmers, under the Good Agricultural Practice for the Protection of Waters Regulations, a liming programme is required for each holding with a grassland stocking rate of 170 kg organic Nitrogen per hectare, or above prior to export of organic manure.</p>  <p>  The Organic Farming Scheme is currently open for applications.  This year, an additional &euro;5m has been allocated to the Scheme to facilitate additional farmers entering organic farming. Under Ireland's draft CAP Strategic Plan (CSP) &euro;256m has been allocated to this Scheme, with increased payment rates across all sectors and a target of significantly increasing Ireland's area under organic production by 2027.</p>  <p>  Ireland's draft CSP which is currently being considered by the European Commission, also includes Eco-Scheme options relating to establishment and correction of soil pH, as well as sowing of multi-species swards. </p></reply>

Agroforestry had not previously featured in Ireland&rsquo;s forestry support schemes and the measure is mainly targeted at silvopastoral Agroforestry systems which combine forestry and pasture, including grazing and the growing of fodder. The Programme contained a cumulative target of the establishment of 195ha of Agroforestry between the years 2015 and 2020. To the end of 2021, 42 ha of new agroforestry systems were established, as per yearly breakdown given in the table below. <table>    <tr>       <th>Year </th>       <th>2016 </th>       <th>2017 </th>       <th>2018 </th>       <th>2019 </th>       <th>2020 </th>       <th>2021 </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Area of Agroforestry   established (ha)</td>       <td>0.58 </td>       <td>5.07 </td>       <td>6.84 </td>       <td>0.71 </td>       <td>24.95 </td>       <td>3.76</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>It should also be noted that since Agroforestry was introduced, my Department has received 90 applications for a total area of 334ha, of which 18 applications, comprising 42ha, were approved and subsequently planted. </p><p>A number of applications were withdrawn by the applicants before the approval process was finished and approximately a third of the applications was approved, but have not progressed to planting, yet. 22 agroforestry applications are currently being processed, comprising an area of 122ha.</p><p>The Programme offers substantial grants and premiums for farmers considering agroforestry.  These rates were trebled under the mid-term review of the current Programme in order to further incentivise this type of planting. </p><p>Due to restrictions in the number of premiums that can be paid for agroforestry in accordance with the State Aid Guidelines for the agricultural and forestry sectors for the 2014 to 2020 programming period, not more than five premiums could be offered under this Scheme. The reduced number of premiums available under the Scheme is seen as the main barrier for increased take-up. </p><p>The new Forestry Strategy for Ireland that is being developed under Project Woodland will provide a coherent policy framework within which a new Forestry Programme along with other supporting measures can be implemented. It is envisaged that increasing the options that landowners have for managing their forests sustainably will be a central consideration in the new strategy. </p><p>Agroforestry is a land use option that is positive for animal welfare, improves biodiversity, can off-set emissions from other farming practices, and can prevent nutrient runoff when planted in strategic locations.

Each application for an afforestation licence must be assessed on its own merits having regard to the specificities of the proposed location, and as a result it has been difficult to accelerate the consideration of individual licences as we would have liked.</p>  <p>  We issued 4,050 forestry licences in total  2021, which was an increase of 56% on the number issued in 2020. These approvals included 2,877 felling licences.  Critically, the availability of this volume of timber, at nearly 8.5 million cubic metres, stabilised supply to the processing sector in 2021. This is the highest volume ever issued in a single year. </p>  <p>  In addition,  264 kilometres of forest roads were licensed  more than double the target in the Climate Action Plan 2021. This is also the highest ever volume of forest roads issued in a single year. The number afforestation licences remained static, with 502 afforestation licences issued, which represents 4,245ha of forestry.</p>  <p>  We intend to build on this momentum in 2022, and to issue 5,250 licences, which is a year-on-year increase of 30%. In particular we are going to prioritise afforestation licences and increase the number issued to 1,040, which is more than double our output in 2021. This will be brought about by system improvements and increased resources focussed on ecology.  </p>  <p>  Eleven new ecologists recruited through competitive tenders are currently being trained in and will be working exclusively on afforestation files.  It will take some weeks before  the  effect of the new ecologists will be seen on the dashboard as many of the files when processed will require a 2nd stage 30 day consultation period and only after that can an Appropriate Assessment Determination be finalised and an approval letter issue.  </p></reply>

The Forestry Programme 2014-42020 (extended to end 2022) offers a wide range of generous grants and 15 annual premiums that makes forestry an excellent land use option which can complement existing farming enterprises and throughout the years of the Programme efforts have been made to encourage landowners to plant.</p>  <p>  A mid-term review of the Forestry Programme was completed in 2018. The review included measures aimed at increasing afforestation rates including an increase in grant and premium rates and the commitment to explore the potential of a forestry fund for establishing native woodlands. This commitment resulted in the Woodland Environmental Fund which facilitates the planting of more native woodlands within Ireland by providing an access point for businesses to part fund the establishment of these forests.</p>  <p>  In addition to supporting the planting of forests on private lands, the Creation of Woodland on Public Lands Scheme was launched in August 2020 to fund the creation of new native woodlands on publicly owned lands. In accordance with the Programme for Government objectives,</p>  <p>  The Forestry (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2020  was enacted on 5th October 2020. This legislation was introduced to give the Forestry Appeals Committee (FAC) greater flexibility to manage its workload, and to address the backlog of forestry licences held up in the appeals process. This has lead to an impressive increase in efficiency by the FAC  with the number of decisions currently outstanding at 27, as compared to the approximately 1,000 cases on hand when the legislation was being introduced. </p>  <p>  We are  also actively addressing the backlog of forestry licence  and  looking to the future of trees and forests in Ireland under  the framework of Project Woodland, which  commenced in March 2021.</p>  <p>  The licensing situation is improving as a result of increased investment in resources and a continual improvement in processes. We issued 4,050 licences in 2021 and intend to increase this to 5,250 in 2022.

These bar charts are automatically generated and will default to an appropriate value on the Y axis, unless altered manually  The Y axis generated in January, in line with output was 140, and to compare like with like this was the value maintained for February, when both were represented side by side.  Likewise February and March have a Y axis of 120 to reflect output in February.   Our objective at all times is give easily understandable  and comparable data and that is the reason for this change. </p>  <p>  Along with Minister of State Pippa Hackett, who has overall responsibility for the sector, my priority this year is to deliver on the ambition outlined in the Licensing Plan and to issue 5,250 licences and the dashboard affords full transparency in monitoring our progress towards this target.</p></reply>

Protected urea is a urea-based chemical nitrogen fertiliser coated with a urease inhibitor. This inhibitor reduces emissions of ammonia when applied to land. Urea based fertilisers have significantly less nitrous oxide emissions (a greenhouse gas (GHG)) associated with them compared to Calcium Ammonium Nitrate (CAN). </p>  <p>  Under the Climate Action Plan, the plan is to replace 65% of CAN fertiliser with protected urea (or other protected nitrogen products) by 2030. Assuming a total chemical nitrogen usage of 325,000 tonnes in 2030, as per the Climate Action Plan, this replacement rate will lead to a reduction in nitrous oxide emissions of approximately 0.8 million tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent (MT CO2 eq). </p>  <p>  In summary, reducing total chemical nitrogen use on farms as well as changing the type of chemical nitrogen applied are two of the most important measures for reducing overall GHG emissions from agriculture. In view of this, I have put in place additional supports to drive the adoption of multispecies and clover swards. These measures, when adopted on farms, will significantly reduce chemical nitrogen demand over the course of the decade.</p></reply>

Low Emissions Slurry Technology (LESS) refers to trailing hose and band spreader slurry application technologies. The main objective for using this technology is to reduce emissions of ammonia to enable compliance with our limits under the National Emissions Ceiling Directive. In addition, the use of LESS enables better recovery of nitrogen from our organic manures thus reducing our dependence on chemical nitrogen. </p>  <p>  The uptake of the technology has been growing in recent years, from 5% of total slurry applied by LESS in 2018, to 16% in 2019 and 36% in 2020.  These figures are taken from the Teagasc National Farm survey. The objective is to achieve a 90% uptake rate by 2027, and based on current trends, we are on track to meet this ambitious target. My Department will continue to financially support farmers to transition to the technology through the provision of grant aid for LESS machines. </p>  <p>  By achieving an uptake rate of 90%, starting from a base of 0% LESS usage, approximately 12,000 tonnes of ammonia will be abated, making a significant contribution to the achievement of our targets under the National Emissions Ceiling Directive. </p></reply>

Afforestation is the process of establishing a forest on lands not previously forested. In 2021, 2,016 hectares of afforestation was achieved in Ireland. The breakdown of this is 41% broadleaf (829 ha) and 49% conifer (1,187 ha). </p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s forests and harvested wood products play a significant role in climate change mitigation by removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. Carbon sequestration by forests is influenced by a range of factors including species, soil type, site conditions and management practices. The Department has funded a number of large-scale research projects which have examined carbon stocks and stock changes in Irish forests.</p><p>Using the total conifer and broadleaf afforestation area for 2021, the Department has projected that these new forests will remove 0.15 Mt CO<sub>2</sub>eq between 2021 and 2030. Although this rate of sequestration is low, it is important to remember that the rate of sequestration changes over time as a forest develops and matures. As these newly planted trees mature, their ability to sequester carbon dioxide  increases. This is reflected in projections which show that from 2031 to 2050, the 2,016 ha will sequester a further 0.5 Mt CO<sub>2</sub>eq.</p><p>Afforestation is a voluntary land use choice for landowners and building confidence among landowners of the benefits of forestry will be key to increasing afforestation rates on recent low trends. The Forestry Programme has a wide range of generous grants and annual premiums that makes forestry an excellent land use option which can complement existing farming enterprises.  The Department and stakeholders are working together to deliver Project Woodland with a view to resolve the current difficulties in the forestry sector and revitalise the creation of forests in Ireland.</p></reply>

This low conversion rate is a challenge and every unused hectare is a waste of resources that should not happen. There are currently 5,200 ha in the system, which have a valid approval, but have not gone ahead to planting. We have written to applicants with unused licences to remind them that their licence is still valid and to encourage them to consider using them before their approval lapses.   </p>  <p>  Communication and positive messaging about the benefits of afforestation is crucial. On most farms, planting can comfortably co-exist with livestock enterprises and can significantly increase the net income from the holding. We must work together to communicate this positive message consistently.</p>  <p>  The full details of the current payment rates are available in Circular 3/2018 available on the website at wayback.archive-it.org/11501/20201125173540/www.agriculture.gov.ie/forestservice/grantsandpremiumschemes2014-2020/schemecirculars/2018circulars/</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, an extensive public consultation process on the new  forest strategy has commenced, with an on-line portal opened on 16th March and stakeholders will have an opportunity to raise any issues that they feel need to be addressed with my Department.

Organic manure is the only permitted fertiliser for use on organic farms as outlined in the EU organic regulations. Organic farm management practices such as crop rotations are an essential part of successful organic production to help maintain soil fertility, reduce weeds, pests and disease. </p>  <p>  Analysis by the Department has found that the level of climatic benefits derived from the conversion to organic farming resulting from the elimination of chemical N fertiliser and associated management changes is 0.1MT co2eq/annum reduction per 100,000 ha. Consequently achieving our target of 7.5% would equate to a reduction of 0.337MT co2eq/annum. A reduction of approximately 14000 tonnes of nitrogen is expected if all land converted has been extensively farmed. This figure would increase if more intensively land is converted to organic farming.</p>  <p>  Under the new CAP, I have proposed the allocation of &euro;256 million for the Organic Farming Scheme, with enhanced payments for each sector.

They are the backbone of huge parts of rural Ireland and drive a multi-billion euro sector.</p>  <p>  Ireland's Climate Action Plan in 2021 includes an action to increase beef herd weight recording from 30% to 70% by 2030. </p>  <p>  Weight recording was a mandatory measure in the BEEP-S schemes from 2019 to 2022. Participant feedback on the BEEP-S measure to date support the assertion that it has helped farmers recognise the benefits of weighing their animals and the data generated has been shown to have improved the accuracy of genetic evaluations. The BEEP-S scheme has demonstrated that the higher replacement index cows have a lower liveweight (circa 20 kg) than lower index cows but produce a heavier calf (circa 10 kg) at weaning.</p>  <p>  Weight recording in the context of the measurement of weaning efficiency is one of a number of measures included in the proposed Suckler Carbon Efficiency Programme aimed at improving the economic and environmental sustainability of beef production in Ireland through enhancing the genetic merit of national herd.</p>  <p>  This proposed scheme is aimed at making a positive contribution towards supporting farm incomes in the suckler sector directly through the payments under the programme but also indirectly through increasing the efficiency of the animals supported by the scheme.  The proposed scheme, as with all environmental measures under the CAP, will operate on a five-year contract.  Participation is voluntary.</p>  <p>Further details on this draft scheme can be found here: www.gov.ie/en/publication/76026-common-agricultural-policy-cap-post-2020/</p></reply>

There are currently circa 800 FAS approved advisors.  It is envisaged that the CPD programme will be delivered in 2022 via an online DAFM e-learning platform. The provision of the online e-learning platform and content in each of the key priority areas was secured via competitive tender processes in 2021. The CPD Programme is expected to be launched in mid-2022, with the first training module on climate change adaptation and mitigation. The full cost of the CPD programme is &euro;245,000.</p></reply>

The then Minister amended the Mackerel policy in July 2017 after intensive review and public consultation, however this particular amendment did not involve the hook and line fishery.  </p>  <p>  In order to amend Mackerel Policy, I must be satisfied that there is satisfactory evidence of changed circumstances to justify a policy review.  If I consider there is a case for review of any aspect of  a  policy, it would require due process, involving an assessment of all issues arising, including a full public consultation. </p>  <p>  There has been, for the past 20 years or so, intensive competition within the industry for a higher share of the mackerel quota. The EU-UK Trade and Co-operation Agreement (TCA) provides for the transfer of 26% of Ireland&rsquo;s mackerel quota to the UK by 2026.  This will only increase demands for a higher share of Ireland&rsquo;s Mackerel quota from all sectors within the fishing fleet. The Deputy should be aware that the 400 tonne limit for the hook and line fishery has not been reduced and has remained the same as in previous years.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, the situation is that if there is an increase in the Mackerel quota for any sector in the allocation made available, such as for the hook and line fishery, it must be taken from others who are already facing significant cuts under the TCA.  </p>  <p>  The management arrangements, within the policy, for the Mackerel hook and line fishery has been on the agenda and discussed with Industry representatives at recent meetings of the Quota Management Advisory Committee (QMAC). It is important to note  that the remit of the QMAC is to examine and make recommendations within Ministerial Policy. I have asked the QMAC to examine measures to strengthen the management arrangements for the 2022 Mackerel hook and line fishery, within the policy, for my consideration.   </p></reply>

I heard directly from representative groups at a meeting a fortnight ago about the impacts of the high fuel prices on the profitability of fishing.  The Government is also very conscious of the impacts of high fuel costs on many other sectors of the economy.</p><p>On 23 March 2022, the European Commission published its &lsquo;<i>Temporary Crisis Framework for State Aid measures to support the economy following the aggression against Ukraine by Russia</i>&rsquo;.  The purpose of the Temporary Crisis Framework is to specify the criteria for the assessment by the Commission of the compatibility with the internal market, of State Aid measures, that Member States may take to remedy the economic effects arising from the war and related market disruption.  The Framework provides that the Commission will consider temporary limited amounts of aid to undertakings affected to be compatible with the internal market provided that certain conditions are met.  A State Aid Notification is required for any measure proposed. </p><p>In relation to primary producers in the fisheries and aquaculture sectors, the Framework provides a State Aid basis for Member States to propose in a State Aid Notification a support scheme for undertakings affected, granting aid no later than 31 December 2022 and to a maximum of &euro;35,000 per undertaking.  Of course, such a scheme has to demonstrate that the aid proposed is proportionate to the impacts on the undertakings concerned.</p><p>Separately, on 25 March 2022, the European Commission adopted a Commission Decision under article 26 of the European Maritime Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund Regulation (2021/1139), recognising  in accordance with that article the Ukraine war as an 'exceptional events causing a significant disruption of markets'.  That Commission Decision facilitates Member States in using, if they so choose, article 26 as a basis to make available compensation under their EMFAF Programmes to operators in the fisheries and aquaculture sectors for their income foregone or additional costs related to the exceptional event, or alternatively to provide aid to producer organisations for storage aid, a market support mechanism that aids the freezing and cold storage of fish in periods of market turbulence and its subsequent release to the market when matters improve.  Related to implementation of the article 26 measures, the Commission is presently preparing a working paper on methodologies to calculate income foregone and additional costs.</p><p>The Commission has also stated that it is examining a possible legislative proposal for an amendment of the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund Regulation (508/2014) to facilitate Member States in using remaining funds in their EMFF Programmes for the 2014-20 period for this same purpose. </p><p>I await the detail of the Commission working paper and possible proposals for EMFF amendment and will review the situation further at that point, with full regard to the trends in market prices for marine diesel.</p></reply>

Generally, most stock areas straddle more than one EEZ area. These stock areas can include EU Member States' EEZs, third countries' EEZs and international waters. </p>  <p>  The 1980 Agreement is the main bilateral agreement governing the EU's fisheries relations with Norway.  It covers the North Sea, Skagerrak and the North East Atlantic and allows for the setting of Total Allowable Catches (TACs) for joint stocks, transfers of fishing possibilities, joint technical measures and issues relating to control and enforcement.  </p>  <p>  As a consequence of the UK's withdrawal from the EU, the UK is now an independent Coastal State.  Therefore, in addition to the bilateral EU-Norway consultations, trilateral consultations between the EU, Norway and the UK take place to cover stocks shared by the three parties.  The majority of stocks and fisheries which had been covered bilaterally under EU-Norway, now come under trilateral EU-Norway-UK joint management.  Therefore, the EU-Norway consultations now focus on access to waters, exchange of fishing opportunities and setting Total Allowable Catches (TACs) for a limited number of stocks in the Skagerrak.    </p>  <p>  The Agreed Records of the EU-Norway and EU-Norway-UK fisheries arrangements for 2022 are available on the European Commission's website from the following links:</p>  <p> ec.europa.eu/oceans-and-fisheries/system/files/2021-12/2022-eu-norway-fisheries-consultations_en.pdf</p>  <p> ec.europa.eu/oceans-and-fisheries/system/files/2021-12/2022-eu-no-uk-fisheries-consultations_en.pdf</p>  <p>  The main stocks of interest to Ireland which are covered by the arrangements with Norway are Arctic Cod (which is fished in Norwegian waters of ICES areas 1 and 2), Atlanto-Scandian herring which covers Norwegian, United Kingdom, Faroese, and international waters of ICES areas 1,  2 and 5.   Also some widely distributed stocks such as Blue Whiting quota areas include Norwegian waters.  The details of these quotas are set out in the TAC and Quota Regulation each year. </p></reply>

The Scheme was established as a transitional measure for certain segments of the fishing fleet to mitigate the loss of income in 2021 arising from the significant quota reductions under the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, pending more permanent restructuring arrangements.  The scheme had very strong take up, with a total of 177 vessels being aided to tie-up at a total cost of &euro;10 million.</p><p>The Task Force report also recommended the extension of the scheme into 2022, in recognition of the fact that there will be larger reductions in quotas in 2022 arising from the TCA and that the anticipated benefits of the recommended fleet decommissioning scheme will not be realised until the fourth quarter of 2022.  The report noted that this will require a new State Aid Notification.  </p><p>Work on examining this stakeholder recommendation is very well advanced and I anticipate making an announcement in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

These United Nations agencies along with a third, the International Fund for Agricultural Development, provide core funding equally to the multi-stakeholder Committee on World Food Security (CFS).  In 2021, my Department provided funding of &euro;25 million to WFP and &euro;3.65 million to FAO, with similar amounts budgeted in 2022.</p><p>  My Department actively contributes to the work of CFS. Over a period of eighteen months, Ireland engaged with other EU member states in the drafting of the CFS Voluntary Guidelines on Food Systems and Nutrition. This was the core document underpinning the UN Food Systems Summit held in September 2021.  The CFS Voluntary Guidelines on Food Systems and Nutrition is a framework to support the work on global food systems transformation, where Ireland is taking a leading role through the funding and technical support of a food systems transformation facility based in FAO. Currently Ireland is engaged on the drafting of the CFS Voluntary Guidelines on Gender Equality and Women&rsquo;s Empowerment in the context of Food Security and Nutrition.</p><p>  Agroecology is an evolving and important element of food systems transformation. Following the UN Food Systems Summit, a coalition on agroecology was established and joined by Ireland with my Department involved in the coalition sub-committees on research and on policy. Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the work of the coalition on agroecology will continue in the coming months in collaboration with UN member states and agencies. </p><p>  One of the innovative aspects of the new Food Vision 2030 agri-food strategy is its adoption of a food systems approach, taking a more holistic view of agri-food by ensuring an interconnectedness between it and the areas of health &amp;amp; nutrition and the environment. In adopting such an approach, Ireland is seeking to become a global leader of innovation for sustainable food and agriculture systems. In addition, one of its goals is to ensure Policy Coherence and Synergies in Sustainable Food Systems between Ireland&rsquo;s Domestic Policy and its Development Cooperation and Foreign Policy.</p></reply>

The requirements for a dog to enter Ireland as a commercial movement are outlined in Regulation (EU) 429/2016. </p>  <p>  All dogs entering Ireland must be microchipped, vaccinated against rabies and treated for tapeworm (Echinococcus multilocularis). Dogs from certain high-risk countries must also have a successful rabies serological test. Dogs which do not meet these requirements are either taken into official quarantine until they are compliant or returned to the country of origin. This is done at the owner's expense.</p>  <p>  Recognising the exceptional circumstance created by the invasion of Ukraine, temporary arrangements have been put in place to allow people travelling from Ukraine to Ireland to be accompanied by their pets, even if the pets are not in compliance with EU Travel Regulations.

These measures  include microchipping animals, providing tapeworm treatment and rabies vaccination for pets,  as required. All non-compliant pets must then be quarantined for a minimum of four months after vaccination. My Department is keeping this exceptional response measure under review. </p>  <p>  These exceptional measures only apply to accompanied pets from Ukraine.  All other movements of animals (unaccompanied, commercial, unknown origin, stray animals, animals from shelters) that do not meet regular requirements for entry, cannot be accepted into Ireland without full compliance with legislatively prescribed health certification.</p></reply>

It seems unlikely that fertiliser prices will ease in the short term.  Russia&rsquo;s illegal invasion of Ukraine has led to significant hikes in energy prices and significant concerns around supply chain disruption for all sectors but agriculture is particularly impacted. </p>  <p>  I launched the 2022 Soils, Nutrients and Fertiliser Campaign at Teagasc&rsquo;s Ballyhaise College in January in response to the unprecedented fertiliser price levels.  This is a credible roadmap that will help reduce their dependency on chemical fertiliser in the longer-term. Teagasc has also recently issued revised advice to farmers on the recommended application amounts of fertilisers for silage fields to reflect the increase in fertiliser price.</p>  <p>  I raised concerns in relation to the impacts of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on agri-food supply chains, and especially on input costs at the extraordinary informal meeting of European Union Agriculture Ministers held on 2nd March.  I underlined the need for market support and the need to maintain supply chains and to ensure an effective and functioning Single Market. </p>  <p>  At the AgriFish Council of 21 March, I asked the EU Commission, as part of its work on monitoring markets, to keep a very close eye on the issue of fertiliser availability across the EU and to be ready to consider any measures that may help to alleviate the difficulties caused. The EU Commission is considering bringing in an exceptional aid measure at Member State level to respond to market disturbances.</p>  <p>  At a meeting of farm organisations on 8th March, I established a National Fodder and Food Security Committee to explore all options to minimise the impact on farms and plan in the short to medium term. This Group continues to meet and it is expected that its outcomes will be presented shortly.</p>  <p>  I announced a package of targeted interventions for the tillage sector and a multi-species sward initiative worth over &euro;12 million to support Irish farmers. The package supports the growing of additional tillage and protein crops and the establishment of multi-species swards lowering demand for chemical fertiliser.</p>  <p>  I continue to closely monitor the evolving situation and with the relevant committees in place, we stand ready to protect our farm families and their businesses.</p></reply>

Many forest owners and importers rely on independent certification that provides due diligence that timber has come from sustainably managed forests. </p>  <p>  The Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC) is one of the large certification bodies used to market timber. The PEFC have announced recently that all timber originating from Russia and Belarus is &lsquo;conflict timber&rsquo; and therefore cannot be used in PEFC-certified products. This also applies to all timber originating from occupied Ukrainian territory. </p>  <p>  The PEFC defines conflict timber as, "Timber that has been traded at some point in the chain of custody by armed groups, be they rebel factions or regular soldiers, or by a civilian administration involved in armed conflict or its representatives, either to perpetuate conflict or take advantage of conflict situations for personal gain". Although conflict timber is not necessarily illegal this decision will impact the flow of timber to the EU.</p>  <p>  Ireland's exposure to the Russian market is small and amounted to approximately 4% of total sawnwood imports in 2020. The price of timber and other world traded commodities such as fertiliser and steel have seen large increases in prices within the last 12 months.  The cost of housing reflects many different factors.</p></reply>

Participants must also meet a minimum retention period of 7 seven consecutive months. </p>  <p>  From 2023 it is proposed that the livestock unit coefficients to be used for the minimum stocking requirements will be amended to match the current Eurostat livestock coefficients. Based on these new Eurostat coefficients, it is proposed the minimum stocking requirement would be set at 0.10 Livestock Units per hectare (LU/HA), reduced from the current minimum requirement of 0.15 LU/HA. </p>  <p>  This will maintain the link with one Ewe equivalent per hectare (1 Ewe = 0.10 LU) as it is in the current CAP. As a result, there will no change to the stocking rates required to meet the minimum stocking requirement on sheep farms. A reduced stocking level may apply where it is justified on environmental grounds.</p>  <p>  In relation to the new Organic Farming Scheme from 2023, the new coefficients and the minimum stocking requirement of 0.10 livestock units per hectare will also apply. The lower minimum stocking rate requirement will allow many of the current participants receive a full organic scheme payment and will also encourage farmers on marginal land to consider converting to organic farming.</p></reply>

There is a derogation under the EU Marketing Standards Regulations which allows for eggs from birds that are housed to be marketed as Free Range for a period of 16 weeks.  The issue now arising is that the 16 weeks has elapsed for some birds, and the birds are still required by law to be kept indoors as the risk of Avian Influenza is still high.  Under the EU Regulations, the eggs from laying hens that have been housed for a period of 16 weeks cannot be marketed as free range now that the derogation period has elapsed. </p>  <p>  At the Council of Agriculture Ministers Meeting on the 21st February, I asked the European Commission to consider this issue and I supported a proposal for an extension to the 16-week period because it is essential for bio-security reasons to keep these housing measures in place for as long as is necessary. </p>  <p>  The European Commission advised that it was not possible to amend the legal requirement for the current outbreak of avian influenza disease in 2022. However, the EU Commission has committed to examine this issue as part of the on-going review of EU Marketing Standards Legislation.</p></reply>

Vaccine production would need to be flexible and adaptable to protect again predominant virus strains in circulation at any one time, with financial impacts</p><p>Furthermore the source of virus spread is often wild birds, which are not amenable to vaccination. There are currently no vaccines with Irish market authorisation and vaccination in Ireland is prohibited.</p><p>My officials continue to engage with their counterparts and experts on the matter to try to find a workable solution to these issues. An evaluation of costs and benefits could be undertaken if and when the issues mentioned above have been worked through at an EU and international level. </p></reply>

This transition to a net source is due to number of factors which include high levels of afforestation in earlier decades; a projected increase in harvesting as forest mature over the coming decade;<b></b>deforestation;<b></b>and higher emissions of CO<sub>2</sub>from peat soils under forestry than previously estimated.</p><p>In 2024, the forest estate is estimated to become a source of 0.5 Mt CO<sub>2</sub>eq. The potential sequestration associated with an afforestation rate of 8,000 ha in both 2020 and 2021 would not have had the capacity to reverse this trend in 2024, due to the significant influence of the aforementioned factors. It is important to remember that when new afforestation takes place, the planted trees are only a half metre in height. The sequestration rates of these trees are quite small to start but their ability to sequester carbon dioxide increases over time as these forests develop and mature.</p><p>An expanded and sustained afforestation programme of 8,000 ha or more will improve the sink capacity of the estate.  The total forest estate is on course to be a sink again circa the year 2050, as harvested forests are replanted and new afforestation increases sequestration.</p></reply>

The rate of afforestation is a function of the number of applications for licences received by my Department, the rate at which these are processed and the number of licences which are ultimately converted into planting.  </p>  <p>  These elements have been impacted by the complexity of the legal and administrative system, judicial decisions, the efficiency of the forestry licensing system, the appetite among landowners to convert land to afforestation usage and, in some areas, complex societal attitudes and responses to afforestation. Both myself and  Minister of State Pippa Hackett as well as the Department are very conscious of the need to increase afforestation rates given the  target of 8,000 hectares set out in the Climate Action Plan. </p>  <p>  The Department has focussed on addressing the licensing issue and on looking to the future of trees and forests in Ireland under  the framework of Project Woodland. This Project commenced in March 2021 and has four Working Groups the membership of which is drawn from the Forestry Policy Group.  The Forestry Policy Group has a membership of 26 and has a wide range of stakeholders representing the forestry sector, farmers, forest owners, environmental groups, community groups and public bodies. The group meet every two months and the question of afforestation is frequently discussed while the Working Groups have been meeting weekly or fortnightly as the need arises. Both Minister Hackett and I  also meet regularly on a bilateral basis with forestry stakeholders.</p>  <p>  The licensing situation is improving as a result of increased investment in resources and a continual improvement in processes. We issued 4,050 licences in 2021 and intend to increase this to 5,250 in 2022. We aim to more than double the number of afforestation licences to 1,040 and this should have the effect of encouraging confidence in the system.  Of course last year, 502 afforestation  licences issued for 4,246 hectares, but only 2,016 hectares were planted. This low conversion rate is a challenge. There are currently 5,200 ha in the system, which have a valid approval, but have not gone ahead to planting. We have written to applicants with unused licences to remind them that their licence is still valid and to encourage them to consider using them before their approval lapses.  </p>  <p>  Communication and positive messaging about the benefits of afforestation is crucial. On most farms, planting can comfortably co-exist with livestock enterprises and can significantly increase the net income from the holding. We must  work together to communicate this positive message consistently.</p>  <p>  There is also an opportunity to contribute to the shared national vision for forestry by mean of the online public consultation which was launched on 16th March, 2022</p></reply>

The continued development of the pigmeat sector is a priority for me given the pivotal role the industry plays in the national economic context. It is the third largest agri-food sector, and supports approximately 8,000 rural jobs.</p>  <p>  Last month, I announced the Pig Exceptional Payment Scheme (PEPS), with a fund of up to &euro;7 million, for commercial pig farmers. This is an urgent, short-term response to assist producers that would be viable but for the extreme current circumstances, and allow space for a more medium-term adjustment to market signals. </p>  <p>  This scheme is a once-off exchequer funded scheme open to commercial pig undertakings which had produced more than 200 pigs in the period 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2021 inclusive. This includes pigs sent to slaughter, exported or sold commercially from a breeding herd. </p>  <p>  The scheme was notified to the European Commission under the agriculture de minimis rules, which provide for a maximum payment per undertaking of &euro;20,000.</p>  <p>  Applications for the PEPS closed on 20th March 2022. The first tranche of payments was made last week, with the remaining applications due for processing as soon as possible. All information on the scheme can be found on my Department's website.</p>  <p>  This scheme is part of a wider package of measures to support the pigmeat sector, including intensified efforts by Bord Bia to promote quality assured Irish pigmeat in the domestic and export markets with dedicated media advertising campaigns underway nationally, as well as EU-funded pigmeat promotion programmes running in key export markets.</p>  <p>  Teagasc has also intensified its dedicated, ongoing advisory supports being provided to pig farmers and is actively engaging with pig farmers to explore the  options potentially available to them. </p>  <p>  There is also support for access to finance through the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI), particularly the Brexit Impact Loan Scheme and the COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme. Both of these SBCI finance products, which are part-financed by my Department, can be used for working capital and include features which will assist the current financial needs of pig farmers.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, my Department continues to engage at EU level to ensure a joined-up EU approach to the challenges arising from Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine, including through the European Food Security Crisis preparedness response Mechanism (EFSCM). Last week, the Commission announced the adoption of exceptional support measures across the agriculture sector, along with a communication on Food Security.

This programme is a multi-annual programme which is delivered through Local Action Groups (LAGs) in each of the 28 LEADER sub-regional areas around the country.  </p>  <p>  Funding is provided under a broad range of themes, including enterprise development and social inclusion.  In order for a project to be eligible for LEADER funding, it must be compatible with the actions outlined in the approved Local Development Strategy for the relevant LEADER area, and it must comply with the Operating Rules and EU Regulations in place for the programme. </p>  <p>  The decision to approve a project, or otherwise, is a matter for the LAG which administers the programme in each LEADER area.  Interested applicants should, in the first instance, contact the relevant LAG through its Implementing Partner to discuss the eligibility of the project and the funding that may be available. The list of all Local Action Groups, their Implementing Partners and their contact details, is available on my Department's website at the following link: www.gov.ie/en/publication/c45498-local-action-groups. </p>  <p>  The Town and Village Renewal Scheme is part of a package of national and local support measures to rejuvenate rural towns and villages throughout Ireland through the Government&rsquo;s Project Ireland 2040 Rural Regeneration Programme. The Scheme, funded by the Department of Rural and Community Development, is administered by the Local Authorities.</p>  <p>  Local Authorities are required to advertise for expressions of interest from towns/villages in their area and can select proposals for development into detailed applications to be submitted to the Department. The central aim of the Town and Village Renewal Scheme is to support the revitalisation of towns and villages, to improve the living and working environment of their communities, and increase their potential to support increased economic activity into the future. It is anticipated the 2022 application period for the scheme will be in April.</p>  <p>  Groups or organisations qualify for support schemes or programmes provided by my Department where they meet the requisite eligibility criteria. Groups should check my Department's website for scheme announcements and regarding closing dates for applications at gov.ie </p></reply>

During periods of scheduled routine maintenance in the past, the Council have provided a temporary ferry service to the island.</p>  <p>  The decision to withdraw the service was taken by Cork County Council without any prior consultation with the Island residents, with Island representative groups or indeed with the Department of Rural and Community Development. When maintaining any infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, or in this case the cable car, the Local Authority is responsible for providing alternative routes to minimise any access disruptions. </p>  <p>  I understand the urgency of the situation facing Dursey Island residents, the local farming community and the impact that the withdrawal of the cable car service will have on the tourism sector in that region.</p>  <p>  I had advised Cork County Council that my Department was available to discuss proposals from the Local Authority on how an appropriate alternative service can be provided during the period in which the cable car is closed. The Chief Executive of the Council has written to me in recent days in that regard and my officials will be meeting with the Council this week to discuss the matter further.</p></reply>
