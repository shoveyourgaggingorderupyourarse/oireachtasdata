Difficult discussions took place over four days, but the Government has welcomed this agreement. It is a fair and balanced outcome<b></b>and demonstrates that Europe can work collectively to deal with this once-in-a-generation crisis. Council conclusions set out the leaders&rsquo; agreement for the European Commission to borrow &euro;750 billion, supporting Member States with &euro;390 billion in grants and &euro;360 billion in loans. Agreement was also reached on a new Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) from 2021 to 2027, totalling &euro;1.074 trillion, which will support rural and regional development, and the transformation of our economies in line with the climate transition, research and development, and digital agendas.</p><p>Ireland has been a net contributor to the EU Budget since 2014, and this position is set to grow further over the course of the next MFF. In May 2020, the European Commission produced a needs assessment underpinning the proposed Next Generation EU. In this needs assessment the European Commission estimated that Ireland&rsquo;s contributions to the Next Generation EU package would in the region of approximately &euro;18.7 billion over the next thirty years and estimated that Ireland would potentially receive a total of up to &euro;2 billion in grants, with a further &euro;1 billion in loans available up to 2024 should Ireland decide to borrow same. However, these estimates were overtaken by the European Council agreement of 21 July 2020. </p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s contributions to the EU Budget are projected to increase considerably over the coming period in all scenarios as a result of economic growth in recent years.<b></b>Irish contributions to the EU budget are expected to rise over the coming MFF period from approximately &euro;3 billion in 2021, to approximately &euro;4 billion in 2027, an average of &euro;3.5 billion.  </p><p>Exact contributions to the repayment of Next Generation EU borrowing are yet to be determined but are expected to be significant, and will depend significantly on what new own resources arrangements are agreed. It is not possible to give an accurate overall figure until we make a decision on new own resources at EU level. At this time of crisis, the Covid recovery funds are needed now, and will be received by Member States up to 2026, but will be paid back over 30+ years. These repayments are not expected to begin for a number of years yet, and the contribution Ireland will make will depend on our share of the overall EU budget over the course of those repayments. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-09-29a.17.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020092900066#WRB00700"><p>I understand that the Deputy is referring to the recently published Central Bank report &ldquo;Household Wealth: What is it, who has it, and why it matters&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  This report presents the results from the Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS) 2018, which collects data on households&rsquo; financial positions. That survey was undertaken prior to the outbreak of COVID-19, but in time will provide a starting point against which to benchmark impact of the pandemic on household finance positions and consumption patterns. It reports that the survey data indicates an improved financial position and resilience for households prior to the COVID-19 crisis when compared to the situation leading into 2008. </p>  <p>  I am informed that the HCFS indicates that household net wealth grew by over &euro;76,000 for the median household, or by 74 per cent, to &euro;179,200 from 2013 to 2018, driven primarily by house price growth and declining mortgage debt. The Central Bank report also highlights that a significant portion of wealth for most households was tied up in the family home, and that increases in house prices (74% increase for the period) was a major factor in the reported increase in household wealth.  This net wealth grew across the entire wealth distribution, while inequality, as measured by the Gini coefficient, fell over the same period. The decline in negative equity from 33 per cent in 2013 to 4 per cent in 2018 was a key driver of this.</p>  <p>  Whilst the net wealth of the top 20 per cent of households increased by approximately 52 per cent from &euro;560,000 to &euro;853,000, the relative share of net wealth held by the top 10 per cent of households - which stood at 50.4 per cent in 2018 - decreased by 2.6 per cent from 2013, and is 1.3 per cent lower than the equivalent figure for the Eurozone as a whole. </p>  <p>  My officials continue to examine all issues related to taxation, including wealth taxation, on an on-going basis, and they and I will monitor and consider any additional information and data, such as that in the new report, that comes to light. I do not, however, have any plans to introduce wealth tax measures along the lines of those sought by the Deputy.&rdquo;</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-09-29a.31.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020092900066#WRB01900"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 46, 55, 89, 262, 283 and 314 together.</p>  <p>  The design of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) reflects the changing environment around the COVID-19 pandemic which has shifted from crisis mode to one of living alongside the virus, in line with the recently announced Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with COVID-19.  </p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s focus has therefore shifted from an employee income support paid via the employer that maintained the existing employee/employer relationship insofar as was possible, to a direct employer subsidy to help support viable firms and encourage employment, including prospective employment of new hires and seasonal workers. </p>  <p>  It is appropriate that the level of State subsidy be moderated as many of the strictest public health restrictions on the economy have been eased and so it is expected that businesses are able to shoulder more of the economic burden of their businesses, including wages.  At the same time, it is recognised that economic outputs are unlikely to return to normal for many businesses for much of the rest of 2020, which is why the Government remains committed to supporting employers by means of a wage subsidy.   </p>  <p>  A number of new flexibilities have been included in the EWSS, while the rates and eligibility criteria have been modified so that the support is sustainable into the more medium term.  In that regard, I would note that the level of subsidy being granted under the EWSS is commensurate with the average payment per worker under the TWSS which had been reducing since the start of June and when the TWSS ceased at the end of August was &euro;282 across all recipients and &euro;225 in the case of first-time recipients.</p>  <p>  It is important to emphasise that the adaptation from the TWSS to the levels of support in the EWSS will allow employers to rely on the continuation of support over a longer period of up to 8 months while also ensuring such support is sustainable and affordable. </p>  <p>  With regard to the request for the number of employees on the Employment Wage Subsidy scheme, Revenue has begun to publish weekly statistics updates on the EWSS as employers continue to complete the registration process. These statistics are available on the Revenue website at www.revenue.ie. As of 25 September 2020, over 36,746 employers had registered for the scheme and the published statistics include a breakdown of employers by size, sector and county.  EWSS registered employers must file payslips with Revenue for eligible employees in respect of relevant pay periods. Until these processes are completed it is not possible to know the number of employees (nor their characteristics or locations) that will be supported under the scheme. The payslip information for EWSS recipient employers for the period 1 September onwards will be available from October and Revenue has confirmed that it will publish employee level information as soon as is practicable after that date.</p>  <p>  With regard to the number of employees earning less than &euro;151.50, I am advised by Revenue that it is not possible to predict in advance the number of employees likely to be paid at or below a certain income range in September 2020. Incomes in earlier months do not provide a reliable guide to possible September levels, given the volatility in the labour market this year as well as the usual seasonal changes observed month to month.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-09-29a.46.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020092900066#WRB03100"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 49, 50, 54, 56, 73, 76 and 305 together.</p>  <p>  On 18 March last, the Banking and Payments Federation of Ireland (BPFI) announced a coordinated approach by banks and other lenders to help their customers who were economically impacted by the Covid-19 crisis.  The measures included flexible loan repayment arrangements where needed, including loan payment breaks initially for a period up to three months and then subsequently extended for up to six months.</p>  <p>  Banks have now provided for flexible options for borrowers who can recommence payments following a payment break, and the BPFI has produced a useful guide on this - https://www.bpfi.ie/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Final-BPFI-Coming-off-the-COVID-19-Payment-Break.pdf.  Also, the Central Bank has also updated its Covid-19 FAQ in relation to mortgage payment breaks on 18 September. </p>  <p>  However, I continue to make it clear to lenders - and I reiterated the point at the meeting with the main banks this week - that they should continue work with and pro-actively assist their customers who are still experiencing difficulty as a consequence of Covid-19.    I would also encourage any borrower who feels he or she may have difficulty in resuming payments after a Covid-19 payment break to contact their lender and if possible to do so before the payment break end date.  Borrowers have a suite of regulatory protections and lenders have specific obligations, under the Central Bank consumer protection framework, to support and work with borrowers in arrears or in pre-arrears. In particular, lenders are obliged to engage and work with co-operating borrowers to identify an appropriate alternative repayment arrangement having regard to the particular circumstances of a case, and lenders should use the full suite of solutions available to them for their borrowers who continue to be impacted by Covid-19. In this regard, it is important to note that, while the European Banking Authority recently stated it would not extend its 30 September closing date to qualify for a Covid-19 payment break, banks can continue to support their customers with an extended payment break after 30 September on a case by case basis if needed with such loans classified according to the normal prudential framework.</p>  <p>  I will also continue to work with the Central Bank, as regulator, to ensure that the Central Bank consumer protection framework will be fully available to mortgage and other borrowers that will still need support following a Covid-19 payment break. In this regard, the Central Bank wrote to all regulated lenders on 8th June setting out its expectations in relation to payment breaks. That letter requested that firms confirm that they are adhering to the Bank&rsquo;s supervisory expectations and what the Bank expects in firms&rsquo; communications with borrowers. In addition, it requested that firms submit their Board approved strategic and operational plans for managing the increase in distressed debt, including supports for those borrowers unable to resume full payments after a payment break. The Central Bank has advised that it has challenged the five retail banks and six retail credit firms/credit servicing firms on their plans. While it is broadly satisfied with the firms&rsquo; plans, the Central Bank will continue to engage with all firms to ensure that these plans are effective.</p>  <p>  In relation to the accrual of interest on loans, it should be noted that lenders will continue to incur costs (both in respect of funding and enhanced operational requirements) and that other borrowers will continue to be liable for their interest charges.  However, apart for normal interest, no other specific charge or fee will be imposed on a borrower who avails of a Covid-19 payment break.  Covid-19 payment break measures do not come without cost to the banking sector and these costs will also have to be managed in a way that protects their business and will be as fair as possible to the various stakeholders.  Nevertheless, it has also been made clear to banks that it will not be acceptable for them to make excess profits on payment breaks and that it will be a matter for them to demonstrate that such a situation will not arise.</p></reply>

The establishment of the Judicial Council in December is very important in this regard, and it is expected that the Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee will submit draft Guidelines to the executive board of the Judicial Council shortly. While the adoption of those Guidelines will be a matter for the Judicial Council, it is desirable that the Guidelines could play a role in the lowering of award levels and also could lead to a more consistent application of making awards in courts.  Insurance Ireland has indicated that if award levels come down so will premiums charged by its members. I believe that this is a very important statement and this Government intends holding the insurance industry to this commitment.</p>  <p>  In conclusion, I wish to emphasise that prioritising delivery on the commitments to insurance reform remains a priority for the Government and this is reflected in the Programme for Government. </p></reply>

The reason for this approach is that the capital being transferred has not been earned by the beneficiary. In this context,  the effective taxation of windfall capital is an important tool for addressing income and wealth inequality, thus enabling our tax code create a fairer society.</p>  <p>  In my view, there are already very generous rules in relation to inheritance tax on agricultural property. For instance, qualifying farmers can avail of agricultural relief, which reduces liability to CAT by 90%. The relief operates by reducing the market value of &lsquo;agricultural property&rsquo; (including farmland, buildings, stock) by 90%, so that inheritance tax is calculated on an amount, known as the &lsquo;agricultural value&rsquo;, which is substantially less than the market value.</p>  <p>  To qualify for agricultural relief, 80% of the beneficiary&rsquo;s assets, after having received the gift or inheritance, must consist of qualifying agricultural assets. The beneficiary must also be an active farmer, or lease the land to one.</p>  <p>  In addition, another valuable CAT relief is the CAT Favourite Nephew or Niece relief. This relief allows a nephew or niece to be treated as a child for CAT purposes, subject to certain conditions. This means that they will be entitled to the Group A tax-free threshold of &euro;335,000, instead of the Group B tax-free threshold of &euro;32,500, which would normally apply to this relationship. </p>  <p>  The aim of this relief is to target a nephew or niece who  has worked for their aunt or uncle over a 5-year period prior to inheritance for a minimum number of hours per week, putting their labour and expertise at the disposal of the aunt or uncle and making a sustained contribution to the business before inheritance.</p>  <p>  When combined with CAT Agricultural Relief, this relief is intended to support the intergenerational transfer of a family farm and is particularly important in circumstances where a farmer may not have a direct descendant (e.g. child) to whom they may bequeath the family farm.</p>  <p>  However, extending the Favourite Nephew or Niece relief to allow the nomination of a &lsquo;Favourite Successor&rsquo; would clearly represent a fundamental departure from the principles underpinning our current CAT regime, as well as a significant departure from the policy rationale of the Favourite Nephew or Niece relief. Such a move would also lead to an erosion of the revenue base. For example, this could result in a beneficiary who does not have a family relationship with the disponer becoming entitled to the same tax-free threshold as a child of the disponer, currently &euro;335,000, instead of a tax-free threshold of &euro;16,250. </p>  <p>  In addition, this would most likely be followed by pressure to extend this to other reliefs, such as CAT business relief, or more broadly for disponers to seek to nominate a &lsquo;Favourite Successor&rsquo; for their estate.</p>  <p>  On this basis, there are currently no plans to extend the CAT Favourite Niece or Nephew Relief or to amend the operation of CAT Agricultural Relief to allow for the nomination of a Favourite Successor.</p>  <p>   </p></reply>

While the effects of Covid-19 and Brexit are expected to be severe, these factors support the enduring competitiveness of the Irish economy.</p>  <p>  The Stability Programme Update (SPU) published in April this year projected a sharp decline in GDP in 2020.  This decline will be particularly evident in the labour market, where an unemployment rate of over 15 per cent was recorded in August. As was announced on the 16th of September, Budget 2021 will be framed along the assumption of a disorderly Brexit in January 2021, which will further negatively impact the Irish economy.</p>  <p>  While the domestic sector suffered a severe hit in the second quarter this year, the multinational sector has proven resilient demonstrating the competitiveness of Irish exports on world markets.</p>  <p>  As the global economy is experiencing the shock of the Covid-19 pandemic in a reasonably symmetric way, Ireland&rsquo;s relative competitiveness on the international stage is not expected to be significantly affected. The recent series of external surpluses in Ireland&rsquo;s modified current account is expected to continue. The pandemic has put downward pressure on prices meaning significant inflationary pressures are not expected to impact competitiveness in the short to medium term. The 2020 IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook recently ranked Ireland as the 4th most competitive country in the EU and the 12th most competitive country in the world.</p>  <p>  The extent of the recovery over the short to medium term will be a function of many factors, including the path of the virus, the future availability of a vaccine, and the success of containment measures, both domestically and abroad, as well as the future trading relationship with the UK.</p></reply>

Difficult discussions took place over four days, but the Government welcomes this agreement. This is a fair and balanced outcome<b></b>and demonstrates that Europe can work collectively to deal with this once-in-a-generation crisis. Council conclusions set out the leaders&rsquo; agreement for the European Commission to borrow &euro;750 billion, supporting Member States with &euro;390 billion in grants and &euro;360 billion in loans. Agreement was also reached on a new MFF from 2021 &ndash; 2027, totalling &euro;1.074 trillion, which will support rural and regional development, and the transformation of our economies in line with the climate transition, research and development, and digital agendas.</p><p>As part of the final agreement reached, leaders also agreed on the setting up of a new special Brexit Adjustment Reserve of &euro;5 billion. This Reserve will help to counter the unforeseen and adverse consequences in Member States and sectors that are worst affected by Brexit. Leaders invited the European Commission to present a proposal on the Brexit Adjustment Reserve by November 2020. </p><p>We await publication of the European Commission's proposal including their proposal for allocating the funds. Thus, I am not in a position to provide details on how much Ireland may be able to draw down from the Reserve in 2021 or in the years after or indeed on the way in which funds may be allocated across sectors and measures. However, I can assure the Deputy that I am aware of the importance which this Reserve is likely to have for Ireland. I can also assure the Deputy that the Government will continue to communicate with the European Commission and other Member States the needs arising from our unique situation in relation to Brexit, in order to ensure that Ireland, as the Member State likely to be the hardest hit by Brexit, receives its fair share of the Brexit Adjustment Reserve. </p></reply>

It was replaced by the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) from September 1 2020, which was legislated for under the Financial Provisions (Covid-19) (No. 2) Act 2020.  The specific nature and terms of the EWSS are separate and distinct from the TWSS.</p>  <p>  It is important to emphasise that the EWSS is a subsidy to the employer, unlike the TWSS which was an income support to the employee paid via the employer.  The EWSS is an economy-wide scheme that focuses primarily on business eligibility, delivering a per-head subsidy on a flat rate basis.  A subsidy of either &euro;151.50 or &euro;203 may be claimed by the employer retrospectively for every worker who is paid between &euro;151.50 and &euro;1,462 per week. </p>  <p>  EWSS registered employers must file payslips with Revenue for claims in respect of relevant pay periods. Until these processes are completed it is not possible to know the number of employees (nor their characteristics or locations) that will be supported under the scheme. For example, the payslip information for EWSS recipient employers for September will be available in mid-October and Revenue has confirmed that it will publish employee level information as soon as is practicable after that date.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may be interested to note that Revenue has already begun to publish weekly statistics updates on the EWSS as employers continue to complete the registration process. These statistics are available on www.revenue.ie.  By 25 September 2020, some 36,746 employers had registered for EWSS.

In 2013, the Central Statistics Office conducted the Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS) providing the first comprehensive data on household wealth in Ireland. The survey provides information on the ownership and values of different types of assets and liabilities along with more general information on income, employment and household composition. The data indicated that wealth inequality in Ireland for 2013, as measured by the Gini Coefficient, was lower than the euro area average. </p>  <p>  The Central Bank recently published a research report presenting results from the 2018 HFCS which highlights the improved financial position and resilience of households prior to the COVID-19 crisis.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank's new report 'Household wealth: what is it, who has it and why it matters' shows that Irish household net wealth grew by over &euro;76,000 for the median household between 2013 and 2018, and that wealth inequality here for 2018, as measured by the Gini Coefficient, remains lower than the euro area average It also notes that "the data highlight the improved financial position and resilience of households".</p>  <p>  The report highlights that a significant portion of wealth for most households was tied up in the family home,  and that increases in house prices (74% increase for the period) was a major factor in the reported increase in household wealth.   </p>  <p>  My officials continue to examine all issues related to taxation, including wealth taxation, on an on-going basis, and they and I will monitor and consider any additional information and data that comes to light. I do not, however, have any plans to introduce a tax measure along the lines of that sought by the Deputy at this time.</p></reply>

LPT has yielded over &euro;3 billion for local authorities since its introduction. The taxation of property through a recurring annual tax is less economically distortionary than tax imposed on either income or capital. This is supported by analysis and international experience where, for example, the OECD in 2011 suggested that tax on property is considered the least harmful to growth. It is also the International and European norm. If the tax were abolished revenue from other taxes would have to be raised to make up the difference in funding for local government.  </p><p>The 2020 Programme for Government includes the following commitments in relation to LPT-</p><p>1.

Recently the EBA announced that there would be no further extension to the guidelines. </p>  <p>  The guidelines were put in place to ensure banks could effectively manage the large volume of requests for payment breaks anticipated the beginning of the pandemic. Following the 30 September deadline, the pre COVID-19 standards will apply whereby banks consider requests from borrowers on a case by case basis.</p>  <p>  The expiry of the guidelines do not prevent banks from engaging with customers who continue to experience difficulty beyond the deadline and all applicable consumer protections remain in place.  Borrowers who cannot return to full repayments following the conclusion of their payment break should engage with their lender as early as possible. The Central Bank expects lenders to take a consumer-focused approach at this worrying time for some of its customers.</p>  <p>  Covid-19 related payment breaks provided under the industry led moratorium fall under the EBA guidelines which require that such loans are not automatically classified as defaulted. The Central Bank calculated that the number of Irish mortgage accounts with payment breaks provided by lenders was over 73,000 up to 29 May.</p>  <p>  The longer term impact of COVID- 19 on bank capital levels will take some time to materialise however some increase in non performing loans is to be expected. The key retail Banks announced a significant increase in their provisioning for the first half of 2020 and this can be attributed to the deterioration in macroeconomic outlook due to COVID-19 and the potential risk that some loans may not be repaid.</p>  <p>  However, it is important to note the efforts undertaken by the Central Bank of Ireland and the EU institutions to ensure that banks can absorb losses and continue to lend into the economy. The Central Bank have reduced the Countercyclical Capital Buffer (CCyB) from 1% to 0% and they estimate this will free up about &euro;940 million of capital across the Irish retail banks to facilitate lending or help banks absorb losses. At an EU level, a number of support measures have already taken place. The European Central Bank announced that banks can temporarily operate below the Capital Conservation Buffer (CCB). Member States also passed a package of temporary measures known as the &lsquo;Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) quick fix&rsquo; which are designed to mitigate the economic consequences of COVID-19 and ensure that banks have sufficient capacity to lend.</p>  <p>  I had a constructive meeting with the five CEOs of our retail banks and with Banking and Payments Federation Ireland (BPFI) yesterday, Monday 28 September. This discussion focused on payment breaks, the options available to borrowers once payment breaks expire and also on the level of credit and lending in the economy.</p></reply>

At the time of the SPU, my Department projected that GDP would decline by -10.5 per cent this year. This was based on a scenario in which COVID-19 related containment measures remained in place for three months. Thereafter, a very gradual recovery commencing in the third quarter was assumed. </p>  <p>  As expected, the suspension of all &lsquo;non-essential&rsquo; economic activity during the second quarter of the year resulted in the Irish economy suffering the largest contraction on record, with a contraction in GDP of 6.1 per cent relative to the previous quarter.  As a result, the level of GDP was three per cent lower year-on-year. However, modified domestic demand, perhaps the best indicator of domestic economic activity, declined by 15.7 per cent year-on-year in the second quarter indicating that the domestic economy took the brunt of the economic shock.</p>  <p>  Looking forward, a partial recovery in GDP is expected for the third quarter.  Retail sales in July were 4.7 per cent above the pre-pandemic (February) level with a range of ultra-high frequency indicators (e.g. payments data) pointing to a general stabilisation in August and September. Similarly in the labour market the numbers of persons on the pandemic unemployment payment has fallen by around two-thirds from a peak of 600,000 in early May, with large declines seen throughout July and early August.</p>  <p>  Overall, while a contraction of the economy is still likely this year, it is not expected to be as severe as the GDP projection at the time of the SPU. This is largely due to the earlier than expected re-opening, and the resilience of Ireland&rsquo;s export portfolio. However, the hit to the domestic economy will still be severe. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to analyse incoming domestic and global economic data, along with epidemiological developments, in preparation for its upcoming forecast as part of the Budget. </p></reply>

For example, as part of the July Stimulus Plan, a number of tax measures were introduced or put on a legislative basis including: liquidity supports in the form of enhanced income tax and corporation tax loss reliefs, wage subsidy support and the warehousing of certain tax liabilities.</p>  <p>  It is acknowledged that some sectors of the economy continue to trade profitably and may even have experienced increased demand as a result of the pandemic. However, the sustained tax receipts from these sectors, including corporation tax, VAT and income taxes, are critical to maintaining Exchequer revenues. In addition, all businesses, regardless of profitability, have had to adapt to operate in accordance with public health guidelines through the physical adaptation of premises to ensure social distancing, the provision of PPE and the facilitation of remote working, thus facing additional costs. </p>  <p>  Changing the current corporation tax rate (or imposing additional levies on corporate profits) for specified businesses would involve increased complexity and could change the attractiveness of Ireland's corporate tax offering. It is not possible to accurately predict the effect that changes to the rate would have on the behaviour and decisions of multinational or domestic companies. While it is possible that imposing such a levy could lead to theoretical gains, it could also potentially lead to lower levels of economic activity and/or to companies passing the additional tax burden onto their staff, customers, suppliers and/or investors. Taking all these factors into account, I do not feel an additional levy of the nature proposed by the Deputy would be appropriate at this time. </p></reply>

For example, interest rates on fixed rate mortgages (excluding renegotiations) have fallen from 4.11% in December 2014 to 2.67% in July of this year. There have also been reductions in interest rates on loans to SMEs from 5.19% to 4.26% from Q1 2015 to Q1 2020, as well as reductions in interest rates on consumer loans (for example, from 8.13% to 7.08% on APRC consumer loans over the same period).</p>  <p>  Nevertheless, it should also be noted that Irish loans, particularly with respect to Irish mortgages, can have different characteristics from those offered by other EU banks making direct comparison of headline mortgage rates inconsistent. For example, many Irish banks include incentives such as cash back offers, which reduce the effective Irish mortgage interest rate. Irish mortgages are also not subject to upfront fees typically charged by banks in other EU jurisdictions, and which can result in lower EU headline rates.</p>  <p>  Nevertheless, there are a number of important factors determine the interest rates charged on Irish mortgages. These include operational costs, certain structural factors as referenced above (such as incentives offered), as well as the fact that pricing will reflect: </p>  <p>  - credit risk and capital requirements which in Ireland are elevated due to historical loss experience;</p>  <p>  - the level of non-performing loans which is higher in Ireland relative to other European banks (as provisioning and capital requirements are higher for these loans to reflect their higher risk and this in turn results in higher credit and capital costs for the Irish banks);</p>  <p>  - there are lower levels of competition in the Irish banking market compared to other jurisdictions (however, it is noted that a new entrant has recently entered the residential mortgage market and that it is offering fixed rate mortgages at competitive interest rates). </p>  <p>  The Central Bank has a range of measures to protect consumers who are taking out a mortgage.  The consumer protection framework requires lenders to be transparent and fair in all their dealings with borrowers and that borrowers are protected from the beginning to the end of the mortgage life cycle; through protections at the initial marketing/advertising stage, in assessing the affordability and suitability of the mortgage and at a time when borrowers may find themselves in financial difficulties.</p>  <p>  In particular, the Central Bank introduced of a number of increased protections for variable rate mortgage holders which came into effect in February 2017. The enhanced measures, which are provided for in an Addendum to the Consumer Protection Code 2012, require lenders to explain to borrowers how their variable interest rates have been set, including in the event of an increase. The measures also improve the level of information required to be provided to borrowers on variable rates about other mortgage products their lender provides which could provide savings for the borrower and signpost the borrower to the CCPC&rsquo;s mortgage switching tool.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank also introduced additional changes to the Consumer Protection Code in January 2019 to help consumers make savings on their mortgage repayments, provide additional protections to consumers who are eligible to switch, and facilitate mortgage switching through enhancing the transparency of the mortgage framework. </p>  <p>  Ultimately, however, the price lenders charge for their loans is a commercial matter for individual lenders.  Nevertheless, I will continue to work with the Central Bank and also engage with lenders to encourage, within a framework which seeks to maintain overall financial stability, greater price and other competition in the mortgage market, both for new and existing borrowers.  It is, therefore, a welcome development that a new residential mortgage lender has recently entered the market and it will be of benefit to new mortgage borrowers and also to borrowers, in particular to borrowers who may still on a standard variable rate with the lender, who may wish to consider switching to a new lender.  </p></reply>

Revenue has advised me that compliance checks have been completed in respect of more than 23,000 employers to date representing almost 67% of employees that were supported by the scheme. The checks have confirmed high levels of compliance with the terms of the scheme by most employers. However, a relatively small number of cases have been identified as needing closer examination and these enquiries are ongoing. Where issues are identified, Revenue expands the examination to include the employer&rsquo;s overall tax situation.</p>  <p>  Regarding EWSS, Revenue has advised me that its current focus is to assist eligible employers with the registration process and to provide them with any support they might need in claiming their entitlements under the scheme.  As of 25 September, some 36,746 employers have successfully registered for the scheme and the intention is that payments in respect of September will be made in mid-October.  Revenue has also advised me that it has very recently made EWSS payments for July and August 2020 to almost 2,700 employers in respect of newly hired or seasonal staff that were not previously included in the TWSS. EWSS related compliance checks will start once the scheme is fully operational.</p>  <p>  Regarding publication of TWSS recipients, Section 28 of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 provides that the names and addresses of all employers to whom a subsidy payment was made will be published by Revenue. However, the names of employers who registered for the TWSS but did not subsequently operate the scheme and did not receive any payments will not be published. Also, the details of employers who may have unintentionally applied for and received payments, or who sought to leave the scheme for other legitimate commercial reasons, will not be published providing the amounts received are repaid and all associated tax and PRSI issues are fully addressed. Revenue has advised me that the list of employers that received TWSS payments will be published as soon as possible once these employer related adjustments are finalised.</p>  <p>  Regarding the EWSS, section 28B of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 provides that the names and addresses of all employers to whom a payment is made during the period July to December 2020, will be published by Revenue as soon as is practicable in January 2021. Publication of employers who receive a payment between January and March 2021, will be published as soon as practicable in April 2021.</p>  <p>  The relevant legislation makes no provision for the publication of individual employees that benefited from either TWSS or EWSS payments.</p>  <p>  I will continue to closely monitor the administration of the EWSS as well as the uptake and utilisation of this important economy-wide employment measure in the weeks and months ahead to with a view to ensuring that it achieves its objective of supporting viable enterprises and employers. I can also reassure the Deputy that as part of the policy development process relating to supports for business and employment retention, my Department and I take into account similar schemes in operation in other jurisdictions, including the specific one he mentions.</p>  <p>  On the question of effective oversight and implementation of taxpayer funded support to businesses via the employment wage subsidy scheme, I would draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that, under section 28A(4) of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020, as amended, I am obliged, as Minister for Finance, to monitor and superintend the administration of the wage subsidy scheme.</p>  <p>  I would also point out that, as was the case with the TWSS, I will actively take into account the views of all stakeholders, including the social partners, as I seek to ensure that the EWSS remains an effective instrument in support of business and employment through the Covid-19 crisis. </p></reply>

Also, the Central Bank has advised that it expects all regulated firms to take a consumer-focused approach and to act in their customer's best interests at all times, including during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>Lenders continue to process mortgage applications and have supports in place to assist customers impacted by COVID-19. The BPFI has published a Covid-19 Support FAQ document which customers can consult, or customers can contact their lender directly, if they have any queries or concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on their mortgage application ().</p><p>However, within the parameters of the regulatory framework below, the decision to grant or refuse an individual application for mortgage credit, or temporarily suspend a mortgage approval in principle, is a commercial and contractual decision to be made by the regulated entity and it is not appropriate or possible for me to instruct lenders in that regard. Furthermore, a loan offer may contain a condition that would allow the lender to withdraw or vary the offer if in the lender&rsquo;s opinion there is any material change in circumstances prior to drawdown and, in such cases, the decision to withdraw or vary the offer is also a commercial decision for the lender.</p><p>The European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016 (CMCAR) provide that, before concluding a mortgage credit agreement, a lender must make a thorough assessment of the consumer&rsquo;s creditworthiness. The assessment must take appropriate account of factors relevant to verifying the prospect of the consumer being able to meet his or her obligations under the credit agreement and must be carried out on the basis of necessary, sufficient and proportionate information on the consumer&rsquo;s income and expenses and other financial and economic circumstances. The CMCAR further provide that a lender should only make credit available to a consumer where the result of the creditworthiness assessment indicates that the consumer&rsquo;s obligations resulting from the credit agreement are likely to be met in the manner required under that agreement. Also, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 also imposes &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer and Suitability&rsquo; requirements on lenders, which require lenders to assess affordability of credit and the suitability of a product or service based on the individual circumstances of each borrower. </p><p>However, if a mortgage applicant is not satisfied with how a regulated firm is dealing with them, or they believe that the firm is not following the requirements of the Central Bank&rsquo;s codes and regulations or other financial services law, they should make a complaint directly to the regulated firm. If they are still not satisfied with the response from the regulated firm, they can refer the complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.</p></reply>

It is my full expectation this will be positive for Irish consumers. For example, amongst other things, the Act obliges insurers to engage meaningfully with consumers when a claim has been submitted; places a limit on the amount of a claim settlement offer that an insurer can retain until repairs have been completed; and restricts the circumstances in which insurers can repudiate the contract on materially unrelated grounds.</p>  <p>While the majority of the Act is now law, I have made the decision that sections 8, 9, 12, 14(1)-(5) will come into effect on the 1st   September 2021. It is important to note that significant systems changes are required by the industry before the related provisions could go live. Accordingly, the sections being commenced next year broadly relate to insurers' obligations to provide more detailed information when signing consumers up to a contract (Section 8), and providing greater consumer transparency about their  claim and premium history at renewal (Section 12). In turn, Section 9 and 14(1)-(5) are intrinsically linked to the information requirements set out in section 8 and therefore also require a longer commencement period. All of these significant new contract and renewal requirements will require insurers to upgrade their systems, which require time to implement because of the technical nature and scale of what will be required.</p>  <p>  Separately, I will consider the commencement of Section 18 when a specific technical legal point has been resolved.</p>  <p>  In conclusion my decision to implement the Act in this manner is based on my considered  judgement which recognises the significant impact some aspects of this Act has on insurers&rsquo; operations, whilst at the same time proceeding with the wider reforms this Act provides. This I believe is the most appropriate way forward for industry and consumers alike in these circumstances.</p></reply>

Figures released by the Banking and Payments Federation of Ireland show that daily contactless spending reached a new monthly high of &euro;27.7 million in June of this year. The Central Bank&rsquo;s payment statistics show that E-commerce expenditure for July was 16% higher than in the same month last year.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding a significant increase in electronic payments, cash remains a vital part of the Irish payment system and also helps to reduce financial exclusion across Ireland. A study undertaken by the Department of Finance in 2019 concluded that a fully cashless society would not be an appropriate policy objective.</p>  <p>  As we continue to adapt to Covid-19, I am aware that a small number of retailers are choosing to only accept card and contactless payments in store. I understand that this may cause difficultly for consumers who do not have access to debit or credit card facilities. However, where retailers are accepting a limited range of payment options, consumers must be informed of the payment options available in advance of a transaction. This can be achieved by displaying signs at the store till or entrance. If a retailer does not clearly specify in advance of a transaction the means of payment they are prepared to accept, they must accept cash.</p>  <p>  Since 2016 banks offering payment accounts are required to offer an account with basic features free of charge for at least one year to consumers who do not already have a bank account. These basic features include a debit card, direct debits and the ability to pay for goods and services online. </p>  <p>  This means that unbanked customers in any part of the country are able to open a bank account whatever their personal financial situation. I would encourage anyone without access to an account to contact a bank about opening a basic bank account. </p></reply>

HTB was extended to the end of 2021 in Finance Act 2019.</p>  <p>  The measure is designed to stimulate supply of new houses in the housing market and to assist first time buyers in accumulating a deposit for a new home. In order to help further meet these goals, I announced a temporary enhancement to the existing HTB scheme for the remainder of 2020 as part of the July Stimulus Package. The legislation to give effect to this is set out in the Financial Provisions (Covid-19) (No.2) Act 2020.</p>  <p>  The enhanced level of support under the scheme, announced as part of the July Stimulus Package, applies to applicants who, on or after 23 July 2020 (and up to 31 December 2020), enter into a contract for the purchase of a new house or who make the first draw down of the mortgage in the case of a self-build.  </p>  <p>  With regards to the Deputy&rsquo;s question regarding the potential extension of the enhanced level of HTB support into 2021, With less than three weeks to go to the Budget, I am sure he will appreciate that I cannot comment on an issue that would have to be considered in the context of that Budget and the subsequent Finance Bill. </p>  <p>  In relation to second-hand properties, an increase in the supply of new housing remains a priority aim of Government policy. The HTB scheme is specifically designed to encourage an increase in demand for affordable new build homes in order to encourage the construction of an additional supply of such properties. If HTB were also available for second-hand properties, it would limit the incentive effect on the provision of additional supply. There are no plans to extend HTB to second-hand properties.</p></reply>

The funding forms part of the Government&rsquo;s overall proposed &euro;9.6m investment in the Loughlinstown Flood Relief Scheme.  The scheme is being led by Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, with funding provided by the Office of Public Works. </p><p>The Loughlinstown scheme was listed amongst the first tranche of schemes prioritised by Government in its Flood Risk Management Plans announced in 2018.  The proposed plans emanated from the Government&rsquo;s Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme, which studied 80% of our primary causes of flooding in communities that house almost two thirds of our population. The implementation of the Plans is supported by the Government&rsquo;s commitment of almost &euro;1 billion for flood risk management in the National Development Plan 2018 - 2027.</p><p>While Loughlinstown is a single Flood Relief Scheme, it consists of 2 river catchments, namely Deansgrange and Carrickmines/Shanganagh.

In light of this, work is ongoing in assessing the impact of Covid-19 costs in 2021. Consequently, there is a range of potential expenditure requirements that need to be worked through in detail.  At this stage, on a no policy change basis, and assuming an improved position in relation to employment next year based on the latest macroeconomic projections, it is estimated that there could be a cost of approximately &euro;9 billion in relation to Covid-19 expenditure reflecting:</p>  <p>  - the carryover costs of the July stimulus programme;</p>  <p>  - significant expenditure on automatic stabilisers including job-seekers payments and related supports;- ongoing costs in health to deal with Covid-19;</p>  <p>  - the carryover costs relating to both the Roadmap for Reopening Schools, and to the package of supports to enable further and higher education students to return to college;</p>  <p>  - And the ongoing requirement to fund public transport while employees continue to be encouraged to work from home.</p>  <p>  Further details will be set out in detail in the 2021 Expenditure Report. It should be noted that these pressures will be dealt with separately from core expenditure increases and given their scale, will form a significant part of budgetary package. </p>  <p>  In relation to core expenditure programmes, &euro;70.4 billion in gross voted expenditure was allocated to Departments in the Revised Estimates for Public Services (REV) 2020 published in December 2019. At this stage it is planned that the Budget Estimates for 2021 will include an increase of approximately &euro;3 billion in this core expenditure, comprising:</p>  <p>  - &euro;2 billion in current expenditure </p>  <p>  - &euro;1 billion in capital expenditure;</p>  <p>  Of the &euro;2 billion in current expenditure it is estimated that there are pre-commitments of &euro;1.1 billion to be funded in relation to demographics, and to meet the carryover costs of prior year measures and of public service pay deals. Work is also ongoing in finalising these costs, and on the emerging core expenditure position for this year for this year. Outside of these expenditure pressures, it is estimated that there is an amount of &euro;0.9 billion available to meet other day to day pressures on existing services across all areas of Government. </p>  <p>   In relation to Capital expenditure, we will also ensure that the increase in capital investment set out in the National Development Plan is implemented in order to support the recovery in the economy. This would see core gross voted capital expenditure of almost &euro;9.2 billion next year, an increase of almost &euro;1 billion on the gross voted expenditure amount set out for this year in REV 2020. </p>  <p>  Finally, Budget 2021 will also be prepared on the assumption that the trading relationship between the UK and EU will be on WTO terms in 2021. This will necessitate additional supports for the most affected sectors of the Irish economy next year. The costs associated with these supports will form an essential part of budgetary discussions and details of these costs will be set out in the 2021 Expenditure Report on Budget day.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-09-29a.173.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1494" speakername="Patrick O'Donovan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020092900069#WRE01000"><p>In line with Government guidelines and Public Health advices relating to the COVID 19 emergency, OPW closed many of the heritage sites in its care and control to the public on March 15th.</p>  <p>  OPW parks and gardens became critical facilities in their locales in the initial period of the lockdown where travel was restricted to within 2Km of one&rsquo;s home. OPW staff working at these sites which included locations such as John F. Kennedy Arboretum in New Ross, Kilkenny Castle Parkland, Doneraile Park, Glebe Gallery Gardens in Donegal and the Phoenix Park in Dublin continued to work to care for and present the properties to the highest standards while ensuring the safety of all visitors to our sites. </p>  <p>  In May, the Government published the road map for reopening society and the economy which set out very specific phasing for the reopening of outdoor and indoor visitor facilities including museums, galleries and heritage attractions. In line with this roadmap of phased reopening, the OPW developed a clear plan for how various heritage sites nationwide would return to operation across Phases 1 -4 and what facilities would be available to patrons. A key part of the approach is to ensure that sites could only reopen where it is possible to do so in accordance with public health guidance and, in particular, with the Return to Work Safely Protocol published by Government. In addition, the OPW emphasised the need to address the needs of vulnerable groups and has made special provision at certain sites in relation to people who have been cocooning. This plan was published on line and clearly set out for example if car parking, toilets and cafes were open, operational and what level of service visitors could be expect.</p>  <p>The vast majority of OPW Heritage sites with Visitor services therefore reopened to the public by Phase 3 (June 29th  ). The majority are operating with some form of changes e.g. no group tours or self-guide visits only, in order to meet the public health guidelines for social distancing, the safe return to work of our staff and the safe return of visitors to our attractions. </p>  <p>  There are certain tourism site locations however where the position cannot be mitigated sufficiently to operate safely and so these locations must therefore remain closed in the short term and possibly for the remainder of the 2020 visitor season. This very limited number of sites includes for example, Skellig Michael.</p>  <p>  In relation to admission charges and access, in July, as part of the Government&rsquo;s Economic Stimulus Package the Government announced an initiative to support local tourism and the restarting of the hospitality sector by providing free or reduced admission to OPW heritage sites nationwide. The purpose of this was to ensure that domestic visitors would choose to holiday at home but would also choose to explore the national heritage estate across the country and our heritage sites would act as significant attractors of tourism in their locales. </p>  <p>  I am also pleased to advise that OPW Heritage Services has engaged with the Failte Ireland Covid Safety Charter and a large number of sites have been audited and certified with the Covid Safety certificate. Visitors can be assured that sites are operating to the highest safety standards and OPW is delivering a very safe and enjoyable experience for both our staff and our visitors.</p>  <p>  During the summer as a measure of our confidence in the strength of our visitor offering OPW also formally opened a number of new heritage offerings such as the Viewing Point at the Blaskets Centre in Kerry and the newly refurbished Carlingford Castle in Co. Louth, both projects which were supported with capital funding from Failte Ireland. </p>  <p>  OPW continues to operate Heritage sites in line with Government guidelines on public health. To this end, the recently published plan for living with Covid 19 sets out clear guidance for what can and cannot continue to operate at the various levels in the plan. For example in Dublin which is now at Level 3, a number of indoor heritage attractions are closed to the public for three weeks including Dublin Castle and Kilmainham Gaol. However popular outdoor sites which can remain open at Level 3 such as the National Botanic Gardens, St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green and the Iveagh Gardens are fully open to the public, seven days a week. </p>  <p>  I would encourage the public to consult Heritageireland.ie and opw.ie to access the most up-to-date information on access to our sites which are open to visitors. OPW heritage properties which continue to play an important part in supporting local tourism across the Country. A number of iconic sites including Rock of Cashel, Kilkenny Castle and Bru na Boinne will remain fully open to the public throughout the Winter in line with the prevailing public health advices and government restrictions as they might apply in the months ahead. </p></reply>

Meath).</p>  <p>  Through the Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme, detailed engineering analysis, assessment and extensive public consultation was undertaken for 300 communities throughout Ireland, including 90 coastal areas, which in 2012 were identified as being most likely to be impacted by future coastal and fluvial flooding.  The CFRAM Programme studied 80% of properties at risk from the primary causes of flooding in Ireland, in communities that house almost two thirds of the national population.</p>  <p>  The key outputs of the CFRAM Programme were Flood Maps showing the flood risk for the 300 communities, which support planning decisions and emergency response, and Flood Risk Management Plans (FRMP&rsquo;s) - one for each River Basin in the country. The FRMP&rsquo;s contain proposed flood relief measures - informed by costs, benefits and environmental factors - to address the flood risk in each community and nationwide. As portions of County Louth are located in two River Basins, Louth is included in both the Neagh-Bann and Boyne FRMP&rsquo;s.</p>  <p>  The evidence provided by the CFRAM Programme, which was launched by the Office of Public Works in May 2018, supports the Government&rsquo;s &euro;1bn planned investment to complete 151 flood relief schemes through the National Development Plan 2018-2027 as part of Project 2040.  </p>  <p>  As part of this, Louth County Council, working with the Office of Public Works, has agreed to be the Lead Authority in the delivery of flood relief schemes at Dundalk / Blackrock South, Drogheda, Carlingford / Greenore, Baltray and Ardee, all of which are in the first tranche of projects to be progressed.</p>  <p>  - The proposed flood relief scheme at Dundalk / Blackrock South, Co. Louth, for which the current estimated total project cost is &euro;80.9 million (this also includes the budget for the Ardee Flood Relief Scheme) would involve a series of hard defences, including flood embankments and walls, rock armour coastal protection, demountable barriers, road raising, a sluice gate and tanking of two properties, protecting 1,880 properties when completed.</p>  <p>  - The proposed flood relief scheme at Drogheda, Co. Louth, for which the CFRAM Programme estimated a preliminary total cost of &euro;16.83 million, would involve construction of a series of hard defences (flood embankments and walls) along the River Boyne and improvement of conveyance, hard defences and a flow diversion channel on various tributaries, protecting 381 properties when completed.</p>  <p>  - The proposed flood relief scheme at Carlingford and Greenore, Co. Louth, for which the CFRAM Programme estimated a preliminary total cost of &euro;23.41 million would involve construction of a series of hard defences (flood embankments and walls) and two pumping stations, protecting 409 properties when completed.</p>  <p>  - The proposed flood relief scheme at Ardee, Co. Louth will also be progressed directly by Louth County Council in tandem with the Dundalk/Blackrock South Scheme with full funding from the Office of Public Works, the cost of which is included in the budget for that Scheme. The work proposed will involve the construction of a series of hard defences (embankments and walls) protecting 7 properties when completed.</p>  <p>  - There is one proposed scheme initially not included in the first tranche of implementation. The scheme at Baltray, Co. Louth at a projected cost estimate of approximately &euro;1.93 million would involve the construction of a series of hard defences (embankments and walls) protecting 73 properties when completed. However, the countywide project steering group comprising Office of Public Works and local authority representatives, has decided to progress the development of this project simultaneously with that for Drogheda. </p>  <p>  While the CFRAM process investigated possible structural flood relief measures for both Annagassan and Termonfeckin, economically viable schemes for these communities were not identified, and so a review of the risk in these communities and the likely costs and benefits is to be undertaken to determine if viable schemes may be available.  The Office of Public Works has put in place a process for undertaking such reviews as recommended in the FRMPs nationally, which is currently being piloted in a number of areas, and it is envisaged that these reviews, including those for Annagassan and Termonfeckin, will be complete within the next 12 months.</p>  <p>  In Co. Meath, the CFRAM process also identified an outline flood relief scheme for Mornington, and this was included among the priority schemes to be progressed in an initial tranche of flood projects announced by Minister of State Moran on 3 May 2018.  The Office of Public Works is currently engaging with Meath County Council to determine how best to proceed with appointing consultants to progress the project-level development and assessment of this Flood Relief Scheme, including environmental assessment as necessary and further public consultation, for refinement and preparation for planning / Exhibition and, if and as appropriate, implementation.  Meath County Council has informed the Office of Public Works that they should be in a position to commence work on appointing consultants in Q4 of this year.</p>  <p>  When developing detailed Flood Risk Management options for the selected projects, the adaptability of the option to climate change will also be assessed; for example, in a Project where a significant increase in risk is shown under the future scenarios, options with the best climate change adaptability are more important, whereas climate change adaptability in Projects with low-sensitivity is not as critical.  The appointed Design Teams will produce the detailed design of the options in areas of high sensitivity and will assess whether it is appropriate for the option to be designed to handle climate change from the start of the design process, or whether it is designed to be adaptable later, e.g. building extra capacity into the foundations of a wall to allow it to be increased in the future, or to leave undeveloped areas for flood storage to be added in the future.</p>  <p>  The Office of Public Works has also established Engineering Consultancy Framework Agreements, which Louth County Council are using to procure services to progress the design, development and planning of each project and which will help to speed up the process to construction. In addition, the Council has been provided with additional staffing resources by OPW to assist in the implementation of these schemes.</p>  <p>  The Steering Group for flood relief schemes in County Louth has proposed the following prioritisation for progression of first tranche projects for County Louth:</p>  <p>   1. Dundalk/Blackrock South and Ardee - to be progressed simultaneously. The tender for Engineering Consultancy Services for Dundalk / Blackrock South and Ardee was advertised on 16 October 2019, with five tenders received on 24 January 2020. Tenders have been evaluated and the contract has been awarded. </p>  <p>  2. Drogheda and Baltray - to be progressed simultaneously. The consultants brief for Drogheda and Baltray scheme is currently being finalised and is hoped to be advertised to the framework in the coming months. </p>  <p>  3. Carlingford/Greenore. Progress on the Carlingford / Greenore consultants brief will begin following completion of the Drogheda / Baltray brief. </p>  <p>   The Steering Group last met on 24 September 2020 where the project is now being progressed with the consultants now appointed on the Scheme.  Louth County Council is expected to tender for environmental and design consultants for the Drogheda and Baltray Flood Relief Schemes in the coming months. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the measures set out in the flood risk management plans are not definitive and final, and that as part of the project-level assessment required to prepare the measure for planning/ Public Exhibition, more detailed assessments are required at a local level and further public and stakeholder consultation will be undertaken. As such, there is further scope for the community's views to influence the measures that are progressed to implementation. </p>  <p>  Once consultants are appointed to progress each scheme, consultation with statutory and non-statutory bodies, as well as the general public, will take place at the appropriate stages to ensure that all parties have the opportunity to input into the development of the proposals within the scheme.</p></reply>

Individual Accounting Officers are responsible for ensuring that their public procurement functions are discharged in line with the standard accounting and procurement rules and procedures and that contract prices are fair and reasonable and represent best value for money.</p>  <p>  Public Procurement is governed by EU and National rules. The aim of these rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers best value for money. It is a basic principle of public procurement that competitive tendering should be used except in justifiably exceptional circumstances. The EU Directives acknowledge that there can be legitimate reasons for awarding contracts without the use of a competitive process, such as extreme urgency brought about by unforeseeable events or where there is a single supplier to perform the contract. Consequently, a procurement without a competitive process is not necessarily non-compliant with procurement rules.</p>  <p>  Department of Finance Circular 40/02 places the obligation on Government Departments and Offices to report all contracts above &euro;25,000 (exclusive of VAT) awarded without a competitive process to the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&amp;AG) by 31 March of the following year. The C&amp;AG publishes this information in the Appropriation Accounts. These reports are copied to the Office of Government Procurement for information. Circular 40/02 further states that contracts awarded without a competitive process should be subject to an internal review, preferably by the Internal Audit Unit or alternatively by an appropriate senior officer who is not part of the procurement process.</p>  <p>  The Office of Government Procurement supports compliance with the procurement rules by putting in place compliant procurement solutions, publishing guidelines and template documentation and proactive engagement with Government Departments and Offices including our sourcing partners in the Health, Education, Defence and Local Government Sectors through the Procurement Executive.</p>  <p>  Circular 10/14 sets out a number of measures Contracting Authorities should implement to assist SMEs in competing for public contracts as follows.</p>  <p>  - Proportionate financial capacity criterion (turnover requirements limited to twice the contract value)</p>  <p>  - Contracting authorities are  encouraged to divide public contracts into lots</p>  <p>  - Provision for &ldquo;consortia bidding&rdquo; to assist SMEs to participate in procurement procedures where they would not have  the relevant capability or scale</p>  <p>  - Public bodies are required to advertise contracts for goods and services valued above &euro;25,000 on the national eTenders portal.</p>  <p>  Contracting Authorities are reminded that any measures undertaken must be implemented in accordance with the principles of EU law, and in a manner that is fully compliant with EU public procurement law and national guidelines.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-09-29a.186.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1494" speakername="Patrick O'Donovan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020092900069#WRE01900"><p>At this time of the year, as we approach the Winter season, it is opportune that we consider our preparedness as a country to respond to severe weather events such as flooding.  I am acutely aware of the impact that the recent flooding has had on individual households and on communities at large.  Since taking up my current position I have visited a number of areas affected by the recent storms, witnessed the damage caused and met and spoken with the people and business owners directly affected.  </p>  <p>  I acknowledge that people want assurance that the Government can provide support to them in response to a flood event and also assurance that it is planning to mitigate the risk from flooding in the future. </p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s Framework for Major Emergency Management underpins coordination of response to all emergencies in Ireland, including flooding.  Through that Framework, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government is the Lead Government Department with national responsibility for co-ordinating the response to Severe Weather Emergencies including flooding.  Local Authorities are designated as &ldquo;lead agency&rdquo; for response to flooding events within their administrative areas and for ensuring that effective arrangements are put in place to receive and respond to public service weather warnings issued by Met &Eacute;ireann.  </p>  <p>  I want to recognise the proactive planning of the Local Authorities in putting in place temporary flood defences and putting response staff on standby in preparation for these recent weather events. Their planning and rapid response to flood events helped to mitigate the damage and devastation caused. Each local area has its own individual plan in the event of flooding.  An Garda S&iacute;ochana, Civil Defence and the HSE are all involved in these plans and I want too to acknowledge their work in responding to the recent floods. </p>  <p>  In addition, the OPW is co-ordinating Ireland&rsquo;s whole of Government approach to flood risk management across three strategic policy areas - Prevention, Protection and Preparedness.  The Interdepartmental Flood Policy Co-ordination Group was established for the purpose of examining the potential non-structural measures that will inform the ten-year implementation strategy of the Flood Risk Management Plans and to ensure that policies that can benefit communities directly &ndash; to be prepared for and respond to flood risk, are carefully considered. </p>  <p>  The Government also established the Shannon Flood Risk State Agency Co-ordination Working Group in 2016 to support existing plans in place to address flooding on the Shannon and to enhance the ongoing co-operation of all State Agencies involved with the River Shannon. </p>  <p>  The Group has taken a number of significant decisions since its establishment, including targeted maintenance activities at a number of locations, trialling the lowering of the levels on Lough Allen and a study on the cause, degree and rate of restriction downstream of Parteen Weir.  In October 2019, the Group agreed to a &euro;7m strategic programme of maintenance and the removal of constrictions or &lsquo;pinch points&rsquo; on the bed of the River Shannon at the Callows Region between Athlone and Meelick Weir.  Progression of these works will be subject to the full environmental assessments required and planning consent to proceed.  The decision to undertake these projects was noted by the Government in December 2019. Waterways Ireland has advised that it has commenced work on advancing the various interventions for these works with implementation expected to commence in 2021. </p>  <p>  This investment as well as helping to manage flooding can support the tourism, navigation and agricultural sectors for this region. </p>  <p>  In relation to the water levels on the River Shannon, the ESB manages the weirs, sluices and other works that are part of the Shannon Scheme, and the water levels on Lough Allen, Lough Ree and Lough Derg. The levels in between the lakes are managed by Waterways Ireland for navigation purposes.  Both organisations are members of the Group and communicate on a daily basis to ensure a co-ordinated approach to managing water levels on the river.  Queries arising on the protocols for managing the water levels at any given time should be directed to the ESB and Waterways Ireland. </p>  <p>  In relation to planning to mitigate flood damage in the future - on 3rd May 2018, the Office of Public Works launched 29 Flood Risk Management Plans and &euro;1bn investment in flood risk over the coming decade. These Plans are the output from the Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme - the largest ever flood risk study carried out in the State.  The Plans set out the measures proposed to address the flood risk nationally, and include 119 new schemes to protect towns, villages and cities nationally.  These include flood relief schemes recommended for both Rahan and Birr, Co. Offaly.  Procurement of 60 of the 119 flood relief schemes is now progressing or, in some places, complete.  These schemes will together with the 46 already complete (including a scheme in Tullamore, Co. Offaly) mean that 95% of at risk properties will be protected by Flood Relief Schemes. </p>  <p>  I would like to conclude by assuring the Deputy and the Members of this House that I and the Government are working extremely hard to ensure that the greatest possible progress is made over the next number of years on the continued delivery of a very ambitious programme of investment in flood defence and flood risk management measures.  The commitment of &euro;1 billion in the National Development Plan to this objective is a clear sign of how high a priority this is for the Government.</p></reply>

This strategy will outline an ambitious programme of reform for the Irish Civil Service over a 10 year period.  There is no doubt that the changes in how we work and where we work that have come about as a result of the pandemic will inform the next Renewal Plan.  </p>  <p>  The public health requirements brought about by the pandemic have led to the transformation of work arrangements across all sectors and businesses. It has highlighted the potential for the Civil Service to work from locations beyond the 'traditional office'. Like many other organisations the Civil Service has shown that much of the work previously done in offices can be done remotely. </p>  <p>  Our experience over the last six months has shown that we must now consider new and alternative work practices that can achieve positive outcomes for our Civil Service. Different working models are possible, and one that has been mentioned by the deputy is the concept of regional Government office &ldquo;hubs&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  Similar to many Government buildings in provincial towns, establishing well located departmental office hubs is certainly one option for consideration.  Hub spaces facilitate remote working for those where home based work is not a real alternative beyond COVID. They also have the potential to address staff commuting issues and the cost issues associated with a concentration in Dublin and the Central Business District.  </p>  <p>  Any decision to set up regional hubs requires: careful analysis of the most suitable locations; must meet the operational needs of Government departments;  and must be consistent with the National Planning Framework.  As part the analysis on regional hubs over 18500 Civil Servants nationwide to-date have shared their views on this issue through the Civil Service Employee Engagement Survey. </p></reply>

Mayo is a privately-owned National Monument which is in the care of the Office of Public Works. Some years ago, the building was closed to the public because of certain serious Health and Safety risks arising. While work was underway in relation to mitigating these risks in recent years, it also became apparent that there was also a serious structural defect in the building which would require a substantial conservation project to correct. This will be addressed by the OPW's directly-employed skilled labour force in the context of their ongoing work to preserve National Monuments in their care in the western region. To this end, OPW is currently pursuing relevant statutory permissions to enable the project to go ahead including a Foreshore Licence Application, Natura Impact Statement and Ministerial Consent under the National Monuments Acts and is also in direct contact with Inland Fisheries Ireland.   Anticipating a works start on site this year, the building was scaffolded prior to the Covid-19 shutdown and work will progress on the project as soon as it is practicable and safe for OPW staff to do so. </p>  <p>  Clare Island Castle in Co. Mayo (reputed as another of Granuaile's Castles) is a National Monument in State Ownership standing on a prominent site at the entrance to Clare Island harbour. The Monument is a roofless ruin and, following engagement with a local group, OPW have carried out general maintenance work to improve the appearance of the site to visitors including cleaning and removal of debris surrounding the structure and provision of new fencing and interpretative signage. Some minor works remain to complete the landscaping at the site which will be addressed as soon as access is feasible.</p>  <p>  As both these undertakings fall within the general maintenance and conservation remit of the OPW, they will be fully funded from within the OPW's allocation for National Monuments.  Some expenditure has already obviously been incurred and it is expected that the remainder will fall into 2021.</p></reply>

It is estimated that approximately &euro;16 billion will be provided over the course of the year to respond to Covid-19 across a wide range of sectors, including; </p>  <p>  - the additional funding provided for labour market supports that will bring Social Protection expenditure to over &euro;30 billion for the year;</p>  <p>  - &euro;2 billion voted by the D&aacute;il for the Health sector, with further expenditure to be allocated by way of Supplementary Estimate that will help deliver the winter plan and meet further costs in relation to PPE;</p>  <p>  - additional Exchequer funding of &euro;1.5 billion provided to support businesses including through restart grants, liquidity measures and commercial rates waivers; and </p>  <p>  - the significant resources allocated to support the reopening of schools and the return to higher and further education.</p>  <p>   Looking at the position at the end of August, gross voted expenditure was &euro;10 billion or 24% ahead of the same period in 2019.  The main drivers of this increase are in the areas of Social Protection, Health and business supports, and is reflective of the additional Covid-19 related expenditure introduced by Government to date. All told, it is currently estimated that gross voted expenditure for 2020 will be over &euro;86 billion, an increase of over &euro;19 billion or almost 30% relative to the outturn last year.  </p>  <p>  In relation to Budget 2021, which is now just weeks away, as per the Programme for Government, the sectoral priorities for this Government will primarily be concerned with addressing issues in the key sectors of health, housing and climate change. Further to this, assessing the appropriate Covid-19 measures for next year will also form a key part of the Estimates process. Ensuring that our existing services also continue to be delivered to citizens efficiently and effectively will also be a key consideration, particularly as we continue with reopening our society and turn our attention towards economic recovery. Further details will be set out in detail in the 2021 Expenditure Report on Budget day.</p></reply>

These are:</p>  <p>  - Supporting the productive capacity of the economy;</p>  <p>  - Eventually setting a path to a lower and more sustainable debt and deficit ratios; and</p>  <p>  - Building resilience to future shocks. </p>  <p>  The Governor acknowledges the significant supports that have been put in place thus far in response to Covid-19 and notes that the scale of these supports has helped to contain the extent of the downturn and mitigate some of its impact. In terms of protecting the productive capacity of the economy, this is something that the Government has prioritised. It is clear that the labour market has borne much of the economic impact of the crisis to date. Significant steps have been taken to cushion the impact of this on households and firms and to minimise the potential longer term effects on businesses and employment. Protecting incomes and supporting business through this time has been a central element of the Covid-19 crisis. This is reflected in the level of additional funding allocated in 2020 including:</p>  <p>  - over &euro;9 billion for income support and job activation schemes bringing total Social Protection spend to over &euro;30 billion; and</p>  <p>  - approximately &euro;1&frac12; billion provided for a range of business supports to help firms that have been impacted by the crisis. </p>  <p>  As we  look towards the medium term a crucial part of any sustainable expenditure strategy is prudent use of funds. There are a number of processes and frameworks already in place that aim to embed value for money, efficiency and effectiveness in public expenditure policy. This includes initiatives such as Performance Budgeting and the Spending Review process. These projects are important pillars in evidence-based approaches to policy development. </p>  <p>  Looking at the economic, social and environmental return generated from expenditure, there are also frameworks in place which aim to examine the ways in which public expenditure impacts on peoples&rsquo; lives and wellbeing. Equality Budgeting, which was introduced in 2017, considers the budget as a process that embodies long-standing societal choices about how resources are used, rather than simply a neutral process of resource allocation. Dedicated equality indicators are included in the REV and, since 2017, the Public Service Performance Report has included an Equality Budgeting Update. </p>  <p>  Further to this, the Programme for Government set out a commitment to develop a set of well-being indices to create a well-rounded, holistic view of how Irish society is faring; to use these well-being indicators, as well as economic indicators, to highlight inequalities and ensure that policies are driven by a desire to do better by people. Officials in my Department are now preparing a programme of work that will support the Government in meeting this commitment, building on the experience to date with Performance and Equality Budgeting. </p>  <p>  All of these initiatives are about ensuring that public services are being delivered in the best possible way, identifying and acting on areas for improvement over time and making sure that the citizen is at the heart of policy decisions. </p>  <p>  Finally, as Budget 2021 is now fast approaching, budget discussions are well underway. Official level bilateral meetings have been underway for a number of weeks. I am engaging with my Ministerial colleagues over the coming weeks with a view to agreeing allocations for next year.</p></reply>

The Living Wage has no legislative basis and is therefore not a statutory entitlement. It currently stands at &euro;12.30 per hour according to the Living Wage Technical Group document 2020.</p>  <p>  The National Minimum Wage is a statutory entitlement and has a legislative basis. The Low Pay Commission annually assesses the appropriate level of the National Minimum Wage. The current national minimum hourly rate of pay, since 1 February 2020, is &euro;10.10 per hour, as set out in the National Minimum Wage Order 2020.  </p>  <p>  The actual number of employees working in the public sector with salaries below the living wage would require individual level data on the position of staff on each salary scale across the public service and details of the standard working hours per week for each individual grade. This data is not available to the Department.  </p>  <p>  However, an analysis of the most recently available (Q2 2020) pay band data indicates that some 97% of all public service staff are on salary points in excess of &euro;25,000 per annum. The suggested wage at &euro;12.30 per hour based on the Civil Service 37 hour standard net working week equates to an annual salary of &euro;23,747.</p>  <p>  More detailed data on Civil Service staff indicates that only some 0.2% of staff (FTE) in the Civil Service are on salary points less than &euro;23,747. Further to this, all civil servants are paid at rates above the minimum wage of &euro;10.10 per hour.</p>  <p>  Any of those currently on an annual salary of less than &euro;23,747 may be receiving remuneration in excess of the suggested living wage through additional premium payments in respect of shift or atypical working hours or are on salary scales that progress to the suggested living wage and above through incremental progression. </p>  <p>  Pay increases within the public service are set through collective agreement. Pay increases under the Public Services Stability Agreement 2018-2020 include: 1% January 2018; 1% October 2018; 1% for those earning under &euro;30,000 January 2019; 1.75% September 2019; 0.5% for those earning under &euro;32,000 and 2% October 2020. These annualised pay increases, which have been banded in favour of those earning under &euro;32,000, have reduced the cohort earning less than the suggested living wage.</p></reply>

Scattery Island in Co. Clare is another such example; in the week ending 16<sup>th</sup>August, the site had 893 visitors, an increase of over 123% over the total of 400 for the same week in 2019.I know the Deputy will also be interested to hear that Portumna Castle in Galway, which experienced an overall drop in the period of about 36% nevertheless has had a similarly strong performance in August.In the week to the 16<sup>th</sup>August for example, the site had 2,169 visitors, an approximately 55% increase on the same week last year.All these 3 sites which I mention have a strong outdoor element which is obviously particularly prized by visitors currently and as such their performance, as I say, reflects the broader experience nationally.</p><p>Clearly, with only partial statistics available and many sites experiencing particular local constraints, it is too early to arrive at any definitive results for the year overall.I remain personally convinced however that making the majority of OPW&rsquo;s paid admission sites available free of charge was a necessary and an opportune move and will have helped at a local level to sustain, even if only in a small way, many other attractions and tourism businesses through an exceptionally difficult period.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-09-29a.236.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1494" speakername="Patrick O'Donovan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020092900070#WRF01600"><p>As I have indicated to the Deputy in a recent Parliamentary Reply, the Office of Public Works are open to the idea that the St. Laurence's Gate Monument in Drogheda would in future be available to visitors and would play a part in the tourism attractions within the town. Indeed, access to the public is already available on special occasions such as Heritage Week, Fleadh Ceol etc and this will continue to be the case.  However, opening the site on a more permanent basis is challenging because of a number of factors and as I explained in my recent reply, is dependent on the successful resolution of two major issues in particular which must be addressed in sequence:</p>  <p>  - the structural condition of the building, which is poor currently</p>  <p>  and</p>  <p>  - the need to develop a sustainable and efficient visitor presentation model</p>  <p>  In regards to the necessary works, I think it has been well understood in PQ responses by my predecessor that there are multiple serious structural issues with the building and I believe former Minister Moran widely shared the relevant Structural report with local public representatives. Currently the OPW are working on a range of project solutions for this work. I cannot at this stage promise the Deputy when that will come to fruition as there are many challenges currently at various National Monument sites throughout the North East and many demands on the OPW team in that area. However, I can assure the Deputy that we will make every effort to progress the project as quickly as is feasible.</p>  <p>  The visitor management issue is, in fact, potentially much more challenging and I would suggest will require the participation of a number of actors outside the OPW to resolve it. The Gate building is very confined and has a very limited access so it can only admit a small number of people at any one time. It is unlikely therefore to ever be a high visitor volume proposition and will in all likelihood remain as a local visitor site rather than a national attraction. Ideally, in OPW's view, it should be managed locally and, to this end, OPW have had a number of discussions with Louth Co. Council to try and see if this can be achieved. No firm outcomes have emerged to date from this but I would like perhaps to take this opportunity to seek the Deputy's own advice and assistance in making progress on this. It may be that there is a local group, such as a business development organisation or a historical society who might be willing to work in partnership with the OPW on this issue, perhaps sponsoring a T&Uacute;S trainees or a volunteer group. Is there perhaps a possibility that a local keyholder might be available to manage the access on the ground on request, as happens in many other locations managed by the OPW around the country?</p>  <p>  There has been good progress on working with local organisations on these kinds of initiatives in a number of places - including most recently Carlingford Castle which I visited a few weeks ago - where strong partnerships have emerged to work collaboratively on issues such as these and perhaps that should be the focus in Drogheda also. I would therefore encourage the Deputy if he has any ideas on this front to bring them to me and I will certainly have them considered by my officials.</p></reply>

Four locations were considered in the report and were ruled out for varying reasons, including environmental impacts, technical difficulties, impacts on the safety in the harbour, limited upstream storage capacity or inadequacy in terms of climate adaptability.  A tidal barrier for the City would not address the issue of fluvial flooding, which is a great risk to the city, and would have an estimated cost between &euro;1Billion and &euro;2Billion.  Such costs would be prohibitive at this point and any such project would not be cost beneficial when all financial benefits are taken into account.  The Report concluded that a tidal barrier is not currently viable for the City and will not likely become viable for approximately 50 years or more. </p><p>The report can be viewed at:</p><p>.</p><p>OPW is continuing the design of the flood relief scheme for Cork City which addresses both fluvial and tidal flood risks and expects to submit the scheme to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform for confirmation in the first half of next year.</p></reply>

However, it is open to local authorities to apply for funding under the Minor Works Scheme which was introduced by my Office on an administrative, non-statutory basis in 2009.</p><p>The purpose of the scheme is to provide funding to local authorities to undertake minor flood mitigation works or studies to address localised fluvial flooding and coastal protection problems within their administrative areas. The scheme generally applies where a solution can be readily identified and achieved in a short time frame. The works to be funded are carried out under local authority powers and ongoing maintenance of the completed works is the responsibility of the Council. </p><p>Under the scheme, applications are considered for projects that are estimated to cost not more than &euro;750,000 in each instance. Funding of up to 90% of the cost is available for approved projects.  Applications are assessed by the Office of Public Works having regard to the specific economic, social and environmental criteria of the scheme, including a cost benefit ratio and having regard to the availability of funding for flood risk management. Full details of this scheme are available on www.gov.ie/opw.</p><p>To date, over 550 Minor Works projects have been completed to the end of 2019, providing local flooding solutions to over 6,800 properties with expenditure amounting to over &euro;51m since the scheme began in 2009. In 2019, &euro;4.75m has been approved for 49 projects with &euro;4.4m been drawn down by local authorities to end of 2019.</p><p>The OPW is currently considering applications for projects at Ballyhaise Pitch, Ballyhaise Cavan Rd, Breandrum Kilmore Lower, Corgarve Castletara, Mullinavaranogue Redhills,Drumliffe Ballyhaise, Knockateery Cloverhill and Aghadreenagh Redhills submitted by Cavan County Council and an application for Drumfalra, Ballybay submitted by Monaghan County Council under the OPW Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme.</p><p>Since assuming my role as Minister of State for the Office of Public Works, I have seen the benefits of the Minor Works Scheme and I am actively encouraging Local Authorities to avail of the Scheme and I will ensure that funding is provided for viable projects. </p><p>The OPW also has statutory responsibility for and carries out a programme of Arterial Drainage Maintenance. These maintenance works relate to arterial drainage schemes completed by the OPW under the Arterial Drainage Acts 1945, with the primary purpose of improving the drainage of agricultural lands.</p><p>The OPW&rsquo;s annual Arterial Drainage Maintenance Works Programme includes the following river catchments in the Cavan and Monaghan areas: Boyne, Inny, Blackwater and Glyde &amp;amp; Dee.</p><p>The Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme, the largest ever flood risk study carried out in the State, culminated with the launch on 3<sup>rd</sup>May, 2018 of 29 flood risk management plans which propose 118 new outline flood relief projects on top of the 42 major projects already completed and the 33 major schemes within the existing capital works programme of the Office of Public Works (OPW).  All of these projects are to be funded under the Government's 10 year flood risk investment programme of almost &euro;1 billion under the <i>National Development Plan 2018 &ndash; 2027</i>.</p><p>As it is not possible to progress all 118 proposed new schemes at once, funding of &euro;257 million for an initial phase of 50 flood relief projects throughout the country was also announced which would be progressed to detailed design and construction, including the five largest schemes identified in the Plans and 31 small or minor projects under &euro;1 million which will be progressed directly by local authorities.Aside from the 5 largest schemes and the 31 small or minor projects, the remaining projects in the initial phase of implementation were selected on the basis of those projects which would provide the greatest benefit in terms of the greatest number of properties protected on a regionally.</p><p>A flood relief scheme for Cavan Town has been included in this initial phase of implementation, and Cavan County Council confirmed in May 2019 that the Council would act as lead agency on the management and delivery of the proposed flood relief scheme in Cavan Town and a steering group, comprising of representatives from the Office of Public Works and Cavan County Council, is now in place to progress the Scheme. </p><p>Potentially viable flood relief works for Cavan, to be implemented as appropriate after project-level assessment and planning (or Exhibition and confirmation), would include Fluvial Flood Defences comprising of walls and embankments.</p><p>These measures have a preliminary Total Project Cost Estimate of &euro;4.4m and would protect 110 properties. Cavan County Council, in partnership with the OPW, is currently finalising tender documentation for the procurement of Engineering Consultants to progress the development of this scheme and the tender is due to be advertised very shortly to the OPW Framework of Consultants.</p><p>Once consultants are appointed to progress the Flood Relief Scheme for Cavan, consultation with statutory and non-statutory bodies, as well as the public, will take place at the appropriate stages to ensure that all parties have the opportunity to input into the development of this scheme. In the meantime, the Council continues to carry out treatment of Invasive Alien Plant Species (IAPS) in the scheme area.  </p><p>While the three proposed schemes in County Monaghan, for Ballybay, Iniskeen and Monaghan town, are not in the first tranche of projects to be progressed, the OPW and Monaghan County Council will work closely to ensure that they will be commenced as soon as possible.</p></reply>

This ensures that consideration of budgetary priorities are continued throughout the year and are not confined to focusing on the budget discussions announced on Budget Day. This process is facilitated by the publication of a range of documents at various points in the year to enhance engagement on relevant budgetary issues.   </p>  <p>  Further to this, improving and supporting the evaluation capacity within Government Departments has also formed an important part of the reform programme. Supported by the establishment of the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service, this has led to the development of a number of additional processes and reports to support the budgetary framework. In this regard, the spending review has become a key step in the budgetary cycle. It has and continues to assist in preparations for the Budget by providing analyses of existing expenditure programmes. By continuing to expand the evidence base, the process also enables longer-term improvements in how policy is designed, implemented and evaluated. </p>  <p>  Looking forward, from 2021 onwards, the Programme for Government commits to continuing reform and improvement of the Budgetary process and proposes that each Minister will be required to produce service improvement and reform plans in conjunction with my Department, within an overall context of an enhanced focus across Government on issues of well-being.  In implementing this reform, my Department will look to build on the budgetary reforms already in place and the significant work on public service reform already completed.</p>  <p>  Adopting this approach will ensure stronger dialogue in this House on key elements of budgetary policy and will help to facilitate the continued development of budgetary decisions, consistent with the maintenance of stable public finances.</p></reply>

Visits must be during the school year and follow the national curriculum approved by the Department of Education and Skills. The Scheme has been in place for many years and has proven hugely popular with students and teachers alike.  In 2017 76,928 children visited our sites under the scheme, 83,769 in 2018 and 90,472 in 2019.  </p><p>In the current circumstances, the OPW will be operating the Scheme in line with prevailing NPHET guidelines and in this context, they have advised me that they do not feel that an active marketing campaign to publicise the offer would be appropriate, as any resulting rush by schools to the Scheme in the short term would inevitably lead to problems of overcrowding at popular sites.Within the capacity constraints currently in force at sites I can, however, assure the Deputy that the OPW will continue to welcome and accommodate school visits where they can. Teachers can book visits directly with the sites; full terms and conditions are available on the Heritage Ireland website.</p><p>In recognition of the fact that some visits planned previously may be not now be possible, our sites are working on outreach to schools and on developing new ways of engaging with students.  For example, at Br&uacute;<i>na B&oacute;inne</i>, the guides will send the teacher a free DVD which is a 20-minute film about the monuments and in particular, the Winter Solstice at Newgrange. They will also send out free school worksheets and invite schools to get in touch via video-conferencing so that their pupils can ask questions and chat to some of the guides. </p><p>Another example is Glebe House and Gallery in Letterkenny, where the staff have put an art teachers focus group together and are developing a series of blended learning tools for Junior and Leaving Certificate students. This represents an expansion of the services previously offered at the site as they could only work with Leaving Certificate students in the past due to the time resources necessary to facilitate each group. They will reach a lot more students than in ordinary circumstances as a result of this new initiative. </p><p>I am confident that OPW guide staff will continue to find new and innovative ways of engaging with this most important segment of their audience.</p></reply>

These strategies outline Government plans to deploy digital technologies and shared approaches for more efficient, effective, and joined-up services for citizens and businesses.</p><p>COVID-19 has had a significant impact on all aspects of life in Ireland, and Government has had to react, adapt and seek alternative means of engaging with citizens and businesses in the delivery of public services. In addition,  there has been a significant increase in demand placed on public services during this challenging time.</p><p>Digital Public Services such as the COVID-19 app, the Temporary Wage Subsidy scheme, the Pandemic Unemployment payment and many others have seen very significant demand. It is clear that the capability to provide Public Services digitally is more important now than ever before when responding and adapting to the volatile situation and the related needs of citizens and businesses.</p><p>While there has been much progress in recent times across a wide variety of sectors, there continues to be opportunities to leverage digital to streamline and automate our back-end processes.

Mayo. </p>  <p>  There were some delays to the programme as a result of the Covid-19 restrictions, due to the consultants being unable to carry out the final environmental surveys during the nationwide lockdown. Since the easing of restrictions, the consultants carried out the final elements of these environmental surveys, and the project team are now in the process of finalising this suite of documents for the confirmation process. It is anticipated that the scheme documents will be finalised and submitted to DPER in the coming weeks.  </p>  <p>  The Scheme now requires formal confirmation to proceed from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform (MPER). This is a statutory requirement under the Arterial Drainage Acts , which now, under the recent European Union (Environmental Impact Assessment) (Arterial Drainage) Regulations 2019, also requires the MPER to carry out an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) of the proposed Scheme.  This will involve, inter alia, a formal review by MPER of the Environmental Impact Assessment Report (EIAR) prepared by the Commissioners and recently submitted (along with a Natura Impact Statement) to the MPER as part of the formal confirmation process.  </p>  <p>  In order to assist the MPER in making an informed decision to consent to the scheme, the EIA will require appropriate assessment, as required under the 2019 regulations, public consultation for a period of 30 days and a detailed technical review of the scheme by environmental consultants appointed by the MPER.  </p>  <p>  If DPER find that they are satisfied with the proposed scheme, the next stage in the process will be the construction phase. In order to expedite this timeline, the project team will prepare for construction in parallel with DPER&rsquo;s review. This will ensure that we are in a position to mobilise as soon as we are given approval to implement the flood defences for the town of Crossmolina. It is anticipated that the construction phase will take up to 24 months to complete. This may be subject to change as otherwise unforeseen issues may become apparent once the construction team are on the ground.</p>  <p>  With regard to preparing for the flood threat in winter of this year, Mayo County Council, with funding provided by the OPW, have already rolled out an Individual Property Protection project, which has provided flood gates to over 100 residents in the town of Crossmolina. Additionally, the OPW has also approved Mayo County Council&rsquo;s (MCC)&rsquo;s application for funding for a number of minor works projects in the town, and these have been put in place by Mayo County Council. Since 2016, &euro;230,000 has been approved for minor works in Crossmolina. And finally, the OPW Western Drainage Maintenance Section have carried out a number of maintenance works along the River Deel, and continue to do so in line with their maintenance plan. I understand that residents of Crossmolina will be fearful coming into the winter months, and empathise completely with their situation.</p>  <p>   The implementation of this flood relief scheme is a priority for myself and for the OPW as a whole, and we have taken all possible measures to provide a standard of protection in the interim. </p></reply>

In this context I have taken the opportunity to meet with the relevant parties involved in these schemes to hear at first hand their issues of concern. </p>  <p>  The particular matter raised by the Deputy is a complex one that raises significant policy, legal and exchequer cost issues. The Deputy may be aware that the State is not the employer of the workers concerned. It is the posiiton that this matter was discussed extensively at meetings of the Community Sector High Level Forum between public service management, which included inter alia officials from my Department, and union representatives. My Department carried out a detailed scoping exercise in 2017 in order to comprehensively examine and assess the full potential implications, in both cost and precedent terms, of the issues involved. The outcome to the scoping exercise was that the matter has potentially very significant implications for the exchequer, particularly if consequential demands were to be made by all similar State funded Community and Voluntary organisations whose employees are in a similar position to the Community Employment scheme supervisors. </p>  <p>  This is a factor which must be borne in mind in our approach to this issue. While CE supervisors and assistant supervisors represent a small part of the wider community and voluntary sector, consideration must be taken for the potential liability to the State if similar claims are made by the many workers in the broader community and voluntary sector. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, we are now facing major challenges in managing the public finances. However, I intend,  with my colleague the Minister for Employment Affairs &amp;amp; Social Protection  to consider all the issues involved in relation to this matter and will continue to engage constructively with the relevant stakeholders. </p></reply>

This year Christmas will be like no other but OPW is committed to ensuring that buildings and properties which traditionally presented a range of events at Christmas will continue to do so at a reduced scale and in line with the prevailing public health guidelines and Government restrictions as they might apply at the time.  </p>  <p>  OPW visitor sites have always been seen as not themselves primary generators of income, but as anchor attractions that draw people into local areas around the country, enabling private sector businesses to service the tourists they bring and driving secondary spending locally. This has always been a strong attribute of the Heritage visitor portfolio and the OPW sites around the country will I think continue to participate to drive and support local tourism enterprise in this way for the 2020 Christmas season. </p>  <p>  Of course, all activity at heritage sites will have to undertaken in line with public health guidelines and Government restrictions relating to Covid 19. OPW is currently examining the roadmap for living with Covid19 which the Government published last week. In particular, officials are examining the thresholds in relation to indoor and outdoor events with a view to planning what Christmas programmes might be possible at the various levels in the roadmap.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to advise that at Dublin Castle for example, &lsquo;Christmas at the Castle&rsquo;, which was a highly successful event in Dublin City last year will likely proceed albeit at a reduced scale.  This event is devised in collaboration with Dublin City Council. It will feature as part of Failte Ireland&rsquo;s &lsquo;Winter in Dublin&rsquo; campaign to encourage Irish citizens to visit Dublin City in the run up to Christmas if possible and within the context of the prevailing public health guidelines. </p>  <p>  A reduced programme of outdoor Christmas events will be presented at Farmleigh House, the Phoenix Park Visitor Centre and the National Botanic Gardens. At Kilkenny Castle, the team is examining what, if any, indoor events can proceed and will be working closely with Kilkenny County Council to ensure a Christmas programme at the Castle supports the local tourism economy over the season. </p>  <p>  A number of OPW Heritage sites remain open to the public for people to visit during the Winter season and a range of our usual tours and self-guide opportunities at sites will continue to be available. OPW publishes very detailed information in relation to the operation of all heritage sites, including details of all events, on heritageireland.ie. Full details of all sites which are open in December and indeed all events taking place over the Christmas season will be published in due course online both here and on site-specific web pages and social media channels. </p></reply>

This approach will be maintained into 2021. </p>  <p>  In relation to my own Department specifically, the OGCIO &ndash; which is an office of the Department - has spent &euro;267,000 to date on capital equipment for the Department (including for itself) from its Vote. The vast majority of this expenditure has been aimed at facilitating staff to work remotely through the purchase of IT equipment. This cost is being met internally through existing capital budgets by reprioritising expenditure. My Department has also spent &euro;22,000 on remote working equipment from its own Vote to date. </p></reply>

The Live Register is compiled from returns made to the Central Statistics Office (CSO) by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection (DEASP) and comprises of persons under 65 years of age in the following classes:<ul type="disc"><li>All Claimants for Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit (JB) excluding systematic short-time workers</li><li>Applicants for Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance (JA) excluding smallholders/farm assists and other self-employed persons</li><li>Other registrants including applicants for credited Social Welfare contributions but excluding those directly involved in an industrial dispute.</li></ul>Although the Live Register is not designed to measure unemployment as it includes part-time, seasonal and casual workers entitled to JA or JB, it has however been used for many decades by the CSO as a key input in determining short-term trends in unemployment. The Live Register is a series which is of immense historical value and is available back to 1967 on the CSO&rsquo;s StatBank tabular data service.

The suite of enterprise and finance supports in place cover the spectrum of potential Brexit impacts and aims to assist businesses in identifying key risk areas and the practical preparatory actions to be taken.</p><p>On 9th September last, the Government published our Brexit Readiness Action Plan. The Action Plan is a call to action setting out a broad range of changes that will occur in less than four months&rsquo; time, regardless of the outcome of the ongoing EU-UK negotiations. It provides clear and concise advice on steps that need to be taken now by businesses and individuals in order to prepare for the end of the Transition Period on 31 December 2020. As of 1 January 2021, the UK will be outside the EU&rsquo;s Single Market and Customs Union. This will have significant implications for every business who moves goods to, from, or through Great Britain.</p><p>All Government Departments and agencies and regulatory bodies are preparing for the end of the transition period. It is important that we use the most appropriate mix of timely, practical assistance to companies trading with, or through the Great Britain, when Brexit becomes a reality on the 1st January next. </p><p>That is why we announced a number of new measures to help businesses to get ready for the introduction of new customs arrangements from 1 January 2021, in addition to supports in place already to help with COVID-19 and Brexit. </p><p>These include a new &euro;20 million &lsquo;Ready for Customs&rsquo; support scheme which is part of the Government&rsquo;s &euro;5 billion July Stimulus package. Enterprise Ireland are rolling out this new &lsquo;Ready for Customs&rsquo; scheme to help businesses recruit and build staff expertise in customs declarations and provide for related investment in relevant ICT. This financial incentive of up to &euro;9,000 will help businesses meet the challenge that will become very real on 1st January next.  </p><p>My Department is also work with Skillnet Ireland which has launched a free online customs training programme, Clear Customs, to support the customs intermediary sector and businesses that moves goods frequently to, from, or through Great Britain.</p><p>The range of measures in place to assist businesses include Brexit checklists and advisory tools, direct grants and funding supports:</p><p>- Enterprise Ireland are running an on-line Customs Insights course and EI will also launch a new Brexit Readiness Checker.  The tool will produce a report assessing a company&rsquo;s readiness for Brexit; </p><p>- the Local Enterprise Offices are running a second phase of their one-to-one successful Brexit mentoring and training &ldquo;Prepare Your Business for Customs&rdquo; workshops, which commenced last week and will continue to offer their grants to business responding to Brexit challenges including the Technical Assistance for Micro Exporters (TAME) grant of &euro;2,500 and LEAN for Micro grants to assist productivity improvements;</p><p>- the new &euro;2 billion Credit Guarantee Scheme, which we launched last week, is the largest guarantee scheme that has ever been provided for Irish businesses to date to ensure there is financing available for Irish businesses as they reboot and rebuild both through Covid-19 and Brexit;</p><p>- we have also provided further funding to MFI to ensure it can meet the needs of microenterprises that can not avail of bank funding over the coming period;  </p><p>- businesses also need longer term funding for investment purposes, and we have expanded the SBCI Future Growth Loan Scheme up to &euro;800m in lending; and,</p><p>- we will consider what further measures are needed in the context of Budget 2021 as the shape of the final deal with the UK becomes clear. </p><p>Supports and advice are also available from the National Standards Authority of Ireland, the Health and Safety Authority, IDA Ireland, Revenue, Skillnet Ireland, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, Bord Bia and F&aacute;ilte Ireland.

The introduction of travel restrictions around the world is already, for example, disrupting the typical way in which the IDA engages with investors, resulting in fewer numbers of site visits and client meetings. The pandemic has also impacted investor confidence and has likely caused some investment decisions to be delayed or postponed.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding these challenges, which are also faced by our competitor countries, IDA Ireland's results for the first six months of this year have demonstrated the resilience of our FDI base. The Agency has secured over 130 investments to date in 2020, which have the potential to create almost 10,000 jobs. Almost half of these new projects were secured for locations outside Dublin, with 53 investments from companies investing in Ireland for the first time. </p>  <p>  I believe that these 2020 investments reflect our continuing attractiveness to overseas firms. Overseas companies continue, the evidence would suggest, to value our FDI strengths. These include our talented and flexible work-force, a track record as a successful home to global businesses and a hard-won reputation as a pro-enterprise jurisdiction. Our continued commitment to the European Union, the single market and Eurozone, as well as to free trade and multilateralism, are other key selling points that help us convince multinational companies to establish operations and create jobs here.  </p>  <p>  At the same time, we do recognise that the global competition for FDI is intensifying and we are under no illusions that the time ahead will prove more challenging. We will have to fight, harder than ever before, for new investment projects and the jobs that go with them. This will include working with the IDA on the formulation of a new strategy that will guide the Agency's work in the time ahead.</p></reply>

The events industry is comprised of a number of diverse industry sectors comprising a mixture of large and small firms. Many event industry firms do currently use large online platforms to generate income, increase online visibility and to reach new international markets. These online platforms are key enablers of entrepreneurship, digital trade and innovation. Ireland has a strong base of firms in the audio visual and digital technologies that can partner with those in the events industry on new modes of developing and distributing content. </p>  <p>  The digital economy permeates all aspects of society, influencing the way people interact and bringing about broad societal changes.  The current COVID-19 crisis has brought this into even sharper relief by highlighting the dependence for both individuals and businesses, particularly SMEs, now have on the digital economy and, in particular, online digital platforms through their disruptive digital technologies and the services they provide. </p>  <p>  On 9 September last my colleague the Minister for Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the Gaeltacht, Catherine Martin, T.D, announced a new pilot &ldquo;Live Performance Support Scheme&rdquo; to assist commercial promoters and producers to employ artists, musicians, performers, technicians and other support staff in live performances, which may subsequently have to be curtailed, cancelled or postponed due to Covid-19.  The key aim of &ldquo;Live performance Support Scheme&rdquo; is to assist commercial venues, producers and promoters of live performances to provide employment to workers in the creative industries while also producing high quality live performances for the public.</p>  <p>  It is proving particularly challenging for project promoters currently to implement social distancing while also being commercially viable for live performances to take place.  The sector is proactively working to implement measures to enable their industry to reopen as soon as it is safe, practicable and viable to do so; and this scheme aims to support the live performance sector in achieving this. Applicants can apply for a grant from &euro;10,000 to a maximum of &euro;800,000 on a matched funding basis which can be used to fund a percentage of eligible costs. </p>  <p>  For micro- business in the events sector, the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) in each county provide access to training, mentoring and funding assistance for those considering their digital transformation strategies. As part of the Government's July Stimulus Package, we have expanded the LEO's Trading Online Voucher Scheme to assist small businesses with up to 10 employees to trade more online, boost sales and reach new markets. It offers financial assistance of up to &euro;2,500, covering up to 90 of the costs for businesses to develop their online presence.</p></reply>

There can be no doubt about the difficulties these sectors have faced in recent months due to the impact of social distancing requirements and large gatherings.</p>  <p>  My Department has had recent engagement with those representing the events sector.  Minister of State for Trade Promotion, Digital and Company Regulation Mr. Robert Troy TD, is also in ongoing contact with sector representatives.  The Minister of State for Employment Affairs and Retail Businesses, Mr. Damien English TD, recently met with representatives of the newly formed Events Industry Ireland (EII), which represents event professionals and business owners from the Irish events industry.  Discussions were held concerning the adverse effects of COVID- 19 on the events sector in general, the Government supports available to sectors and to certain suggestions which the EII had put forward to assist their sector to recover. Some of these suggestions included potential for funding for business transformation both digital and environmental, a tax incentivisation scheme and further assistance with finance / loan forbearance and on insurance issues.  </p>  <p>  The &euro;7.4 billion July Jobs Stimulus Plan itself provides scope for some businesses within the events sector to avail of the continuation of measures such as the income support package consisting of the PUP extension and the employment wage support scheme and additional liquidity, enterprise investment and taxation measures.  </p>  <p>  The Government's COVID-19 'Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with COVID-19' specifically deals with organised events and we will continue to work with the industry to progress the development of agreed protocols and innovative ways to enable the hosting of such organised events into the future.  Government will also continue to work with the sector to explore what supports are available through Enterprise Ireland to assist events businesses transform and change their business models by availing of innovation and technology over the longer term.  </p>  <p>  In addition to the wider range of supports now available, there may be scope for some businesses within the events sector to avail of the new measures introduced by the Minister for Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the Gaeltacht, Ms. Catherine Martin TD, under the July stimulus package. For example, Minister Martin announced on 9th September last an allocation of &euro;5 million under the &ldquo;Live Performance Support Scheme&rdquo; which aims to assist commercial venues, producers and promoters of live performances and provide employment to workers in the creative industries.  The scheme will help to de-risk the costs of preparing for new productions which may subsequently have to be postponed, cancelled or curtailed due to restrictions to safeguard public health. The main objective of the scheme is to provide employment opportunities in the ticketed performance sector and allow commercial organisers of live performances to commence preparations immediately and productions to go ahead in the near future while also complying with public health protection measures. This scheme has been developed following consultation with the sector and will be managed directly by the Department of Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the Gaeltacht.</p>  <p>  A further support package, the Music Stimulus Package, involves three funding schemes designed to help sustain the popular and commercial music sector across all music genres.  Under this package, a fund of &euro;1,000,000 is being put in place to stimulate areas of work which artists would usually fund with income from own sources including live event fees.  The aim is to ensure that Irish musicians, engineers, PR, media, agents, labels and publishers can continue to develop and share their work in the context of COVID restrictions. </p>  <p>  In the wider context of the Government&rsquo;s Resilience and Recovery Plan, the operation and reopening of sectors will be guided by the need to manage risk and repairing the damage that COVID-19 has inflicted on society and business.  At the same time, all decisions taken by Government on the timing of any lifting of restrictions will continue to be informed by the public health advice in terms of whether to increase or remove the limits on mass indoor gatherings having regard to the public health advice. </p></reply>

The supports available from Government are designed to help businesses to open, to help those that are already open to stay open, to get staff back to work and for those who cannot go back to their old jobs, to transition to new opportunities as soon as possible. </p>  <p>  On 23 July the Government announced the July Stimulus Package, a substantial financial package to stimulate our economy worth more than &euro;5 billion, with an additional &euro;2 billion in loan guarantees. These new measures are in addition to those already announced since the onset of the Pandemic, including the Temporary Wage Subsidy, the Restart Grant and Restart Grant Plus, grant supports. cash for businesses, low cost loans and commercial rates waivers. </p>  <p>  Significantly, to support viable businesses and jobs, including new hires, we have extended the wage subsidy scheme, which will run until the end of March 2021 and we have also improved eligibility criteria for the Pandemic Unemployment Payment. In addition:</p>  <p>  - We are providing more and cheaper loan finance through MicroFinance Ireland, SBCI and the new &euro;2bn Credit Guarantee Scheme. </p>  <p>  - We announced a six-month reduction in VAT, going from 23% down to 21%, together with a range of additional measures designed to stimulate domestic demand. </p>  <p>  - We also announced a &euro;2 million assistance fund for Micro-Enterprises that cannot avail of any sectoral specific supports. </p>  <p>  The range of measures in place to assist businesses include direct grants and supports such as the:</p>  <p>  - Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS)</p>  <p>  - The Restart Grant Plus</p>  <p>  - Liquidity supports such as 0% finance for 6 months from MicroFinance Ireland</p>  <p>  - Low cost working capital is also available through the SBCI schemes</p>  <p>  - State-backed Future Growth Loan Scheme which makes available longer-term lending for strategic investment, with &euro;500 million expansion of the scheme </p>  <p>  The Retail Forum, an initiative of my Department, provides a platform for engagement between retail representative bodies, retailers and government on key concerns for the retail sector, including COVID-19 and Brexit. My colleague, Damien English TD Minister of State for Business, Employment and Retail chairs the Retail Forum and continues to engage with the retail sector through this Forum.  The most recent meeting of the Retail Forum was on 24 September 2020.  Additionally, in recent weeks, Minister English has held a series of one-to-one introductory bilateral meetings with the retail representative bodies as members of the Retail Forum.</p>  <p>  Trading online is a very important route for retail businesses to grow and improve their business in the current crisis and will be an important element in their recovery over the longer term.  The COVID-19 Online Retail Scheme - a competitive scheme, administered on my Department's behalf by Enterprise Ireland, is to support companies in the indigenous retail sector who have already started an online journey, to further enhance and strengthen their online presence, which will have the most immediate impact enabling them to respond to both domestic and international consumer demand with a competitive online offer. </p>  <p>  My Department proposed this Scheme in response to the COVID-19 crisis and the urgent need for retail companies to achieve a step change in online capability. Applicant companies must be an indigenous retailer, employing 10 or more people, have an existing online presence (e.g. website or social media), and have a retail outlet through which they derive the majority of their revenue. The Scheme was launched with an initial fund size of &euro;2m. Due to significant levels of interest for the Scheme from eligible retailers and the particular challenges facing the retail sector during the pandemic, the funding available for Call 1 was increased. On the 2 July 2020, I was pleased to announce that 185 retailers were approved &euro;6.6m in funding as part of the scheme. A second Call, with a total fund size of &euro;5.5m. which was launched by Minister of State English closed on the 28 September 2020.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware of the Trading Online Voucher Scheme administered through the Local Enterprise Offices. As part of the July Jobs Stimulus the Scheme was expanded to assist even more small and micro enterprises, with no more than 10 employees, including those in the retail sector, to get online quickly. Although not designed exclusively for the retail sector it provides significant assistance to retailers to start to trade online. Following a previous expansion of the Scheme in early April, total additional funding for the Scheme is now almost &euro;20m in 2020. Under the Scheme, small businesses can claim up to &euro;5,000 in two vouchers worth &euro;2,500 each. </p>  <p>  I am committed to supporting the needs of the retail sector and will work closely with my colleague Minister English and the Retail Forum in ensuring that the needs of the sector are considered including in the development of forthcoming National Economic Plan. I expect that the Plan will set longer term objectives for the economy post crisis and identify policies and strategies to achieve those objectives. The Plan will be progressed over the coming weeks and I would expect it to launch in November.</p></reply>

For some sectors, especially those that require personal contact with customers, such as retail and hospitality, it has been more difficult to adapt to social distancing requirements.  Amongst the most heavily-impacted are those where the duration of the disruption, ongoing restrictions on international mobility and distancing requirements necessary to prevent spread of the virus, remain a barrier to capacity or resumption of normal activity and productivity.</p>  <p>  The priority of the Government continues to be the wellbeing of our people and communities and the best economic policy is to put public health first. But we are increasingly focussing on business and on getting as many people as possible back to work.</p>  <p>  To date the Government has provided enhanced provisions to a value of almost &euro;20 billion. While these supports are wide ranging, they will by their nature be of most assistance to the most heavily impacted firms and sectors. </p>  <p>  The July Stimulus Package was, as promised, a package of measures of sufficient scale that demonstrates the commitment this Government has to save enterprises, limit the damage to our economy wreaked by this pandemic and get our people back to work. Indeed, it is bigger in scale than most budgets and it is being deployed at speed.</p>  <p>  Businesses, including those in the retail and hospitality sector, will be able to benefit from many of the actions within the July Stimulus including:</p>  <p>  - The Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme and its successor the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme has, and will provide, absolutely critical assistance to impacted businesses right across the economy.  For the most heavily impacted sectors such as hospitality, the schemes will give businesses a chance to resume activity while operating under the constraints demanded by public health requirements by heavily subsidising probably their largest variable cost.  </p>  <p>  - The Online Retail Scheme, administered by Enterprise Ireland, helps support companies in the indigenous retail sector with a pre-existing online presence to respond to both the domestic and international consumer demand for a competitive online offer. To date, funding under this scheme has been provided to 185 retailers with a total of over &euro;6.5 million awarded.  </p>  <p>  - We have provided substantial Restart Grants of up to &euro;25,000 to a broad category of businesses such as hairdressers, sports clubs, cafes, restaurants, B&amp;Bs, independent hotels to help cover the costs incurred during closure and reopening costs. By the 4th September, approvals to the value of &euro;155 million were approved under the Restart Grant and &euro;187 million under the enhance Restart Grant; a total of &euro;342 million.</p>  <p>  - We have introduced a temporary reduction in VAT from 23% to 21%, this will assist retail in particular but also benefit many other sectors of the economy.  </p>  <p>  - The &lsquo;Stay and Spend&rsquo; initiative will see consumers benefit by up to &euro;125 each for expenditure on hospitality activities during the traditional &lsquo;off peak&rsquo; for this sector. </p>  <p>  - We also allocated &euro;10 million to a Restart Fund for the Tourism Sector to aid recovery.</p>  <p>  - Recognising the economic impact of Covid-19 on pubs, bars and nightclubs, and to assist planning and adaptation for their re-opening, an additional &euro;16 million support package for the sector was announced at the end of August. This included a 40% Restart Grant Plus Top Up for pubs, bars and nightclubs that remain closed to help them to reopen; a waiver of court fees and associated excise and stamp duties relating to the renewal of pub and other liquor licences in 2020; and a waiver of excise duty on on-trade liquor licences on renewal in 2020.</p>  <p>  - Several other initiatives to provide vital liquidity to all firms who are experiencing impacts have been introduced including rates waivers, delayed payment of PAYE and VAT debts, in part or in full, for a set period with no interest or penalties, and the early carryback of trading losses providing immediate cash-flow support to previously profitable companies.</p>  <p>  - Most recently, I announced the opening of the new &euro;2 billion COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme to provide Irish businesses with access to low cost loans as they respond to the impacts of COVID-19. This is the biggest ever state-backed loan guarantee in Ireland. A large number of non-bank finance providers, including a number of Credit Unions have also applied to participate in the scheme, as part of an open call process. </p>  <p>  - The Microfinance Ireland Covid-19 Loan scheme also recently reopened. Under the first phase of this scheme, 687 loans were approved to a value of &euro;18.68 million. This represents three years of normal lending volumes for MFI in a period of just over four months. I expect the new tranche of funding will provide a lifeline to even more micro-enterprises enabling them to re-open, stay afloat or expand.</p>  <p>  Having come through the initial economic shock with unprecedented levels of State intervention stabilising the economy, the focus is now on sustaining the recovery in the face of uncertainty and disruption while seeking to minimise permanent loss of economic activity and employment. As such, the next steps in our recovery journey will be mapped out in the October budget and the subsequent National Economic Plan. </p>  <p>  As per the recent Budget 2021 Strategy announcement, Budget 2021 will see additional crisis-related supports tailored to those sectors and workers who are most in need.</p>  <p>  The National Economic Plan will set out a vision for what our post-Covid economy will look like. The plan will set longer term objectives for the economy post crisis and identify policies and strategies to achieve those objectives. While the focus of Government action up to now has been on protecting workers, households and firms, the plan will need to look to the future and show how our economy can be positioned to exploit opportunities for growth in emerging sectors and in areas such as new ways of working, while also addressing how we will prepare for the transitioning of enterprises and workers in response to technology and climate change developments. Ireland&rsquo;s flexible and skilled labour force has traditionally been a strength of the country and reskilling and upskilling of the labour force in response to anticipated future skills needs a core element to be progressed under the plan.</p>  <p>  The plan will be progressed over the coming weeks and I would expect it to launch in November. </p></reply>

The numbers receiving the PUP have fallen from 598,000 at the beginning of May to 206,341 on 22nd September; a decrease of over 65%.  </p>  <p>  Over 663,600 employees received a subsidy through the TWSS during its operation. By 17th September, over 34,300 employers had registered with Revenue for the new Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS).  According to the Revenue data, 85.2% of these employers are in their Business Division which is predominantly comprised of small and micro enterprises. </p>  <p>  These schemes have played an important role in maintaining incomes throughout the pandemic. The TWSS has helped to maintain that important link between employers and their workers.  Furthermore, the design of the TWSS has allowed it to provide vital supports to businesses right across the economy, including many of those who continued to trade despite the extremely challenging trading environment of the past few months.</p>  <p>  The EWSS, which was introduced in the July Stimulus, provides a crucial support to businesses as they resume activity in the face of challenges to their business models brought about by COVID-19.  It represents a weekly subsidy to each job provided by that business, thereby reducing the costs of labour, which are typically amongst the most significant costs incurred by businesses.  The EWSS has broader application than the TWSS; for example it includes employees that were not previously eligible, such as seasonal workers and newly hired personnel.  The EWSS will run until 31 March 2021. </p>  <p>  In addition to the EWSS, the July Stimulus Package included a variety of measures aimed at retaining jobs and supporting people back into employment through further education and training and labour market activation measures.</p>  <p>  Enterprise supports include the extension of the Restart Grant and the Commercial Rates Waiver, the introduction of the Credit Guarantee Scheme, additional resources for MicroFinance Ireland and the Local Enterprise Offices, an expansion of the Future Growth Loan scheme, Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Sustaining Enterprise Fund, and the Online Retail and Online Trading Voucher schemes.</p>  <p>  Reskilling and Upskilling supports include 12,500 additional places for short-term skills training and 35,000 additional places in further and higher education (Skillnet Ireland, Springboard+, Human Capital Initiative) including 19,000 on the new SOLAS Skills to Compete programme which will support people in developing and attaining qualifications for emerging growth sectors and occupations.  A temporary Apprenticeship Incentivisation Scheme was introduced along with a Retrofit Skills Training Initiative to support the expansion of the National Retrofitting programme. </p>  <p>  Labour activation supports include 8,000 recruitment subsidies under the JobsPlus scheme, an increasing of the capacity of the Public Employment Service to support jobseeker job search advice and assistance, extension of the Back to Work Enterprise and Back to Education Allowances to people currently in receipt of the PUP. Some 10,000 additional work placement/experience scheme places for those unemployed for over 6 months are also being provided. </p>  <p>  While uncertainty remains as to the course and duration of the virus, as well as a threat of a no deal Brexit, a number of forecasts for the medium-term trajectory of the labour market have been published.  The Central Bank in its Quarterly Bulletin, July 2020, under a baseline scenario, projects that unemployment will average 14.5% in 2020, decline to 9.2% in 2021, and decline further to 7.3% in 2022.  Under a severe scenario, it is projected that unemployment will average 16.6% in 2020, decline to 12.4% in 2021 and decline further to 9.4% in 2022.  The Department of Finance forecast in April that unemployment will reach 10.9% by the end of 2020, and 9% by the end of 2021.  The ESRI&rsquo;s Summer 2020 Quarterly Economic Commentary sets out baseline, severe and benign scenarios for unemployment in 2020, of 17%, 19% and 15% respectively. </p>  <p>  The focus is now on sustaining the recovery in the face of uncertainty and disruption while seeking to minimise permanent loss of economic activity and employment. As such, the next steps in our recovery journey will be mapped out in the October budget and the subsequent National Economic Plan.</p>  <p>  The National Economic Plan will set out a vision for a post-Covid economy and identify policies and strategies to achieve those objectives. While the focus of Government action up to now has been on protecting workers, households and firms, the plan will look to the future and set out how our economy can be positioned to exploit opportunities for growth in emerging sectors and in areas such as new ways of working, while also addressing how we will prepare for the transitioning of enterprises and workers in response to technology and climate change developments and the acceleration of trends as a result of COVID-19. Anticipating future skills needs, and re-skilling and upskilling of the labour force will be a core element to be progressed under the plan with increased support for job or role transitioning.  The plan will be progressed over the coming weeks and I would expect it to launch in November. </p>  <p>  In terms of cross government engagement on labour market issues, the Labour Market Advisory Council was set up to provide advice to the Minister and the Government with advice regard to the labour force participation rates, minimising unemployment levels and reducing average unemployment durations. The onset of the pandemic meant that the first task of the Council was to advise on measures to tackle the labour market challenges arising from the pandemic with an aim of supporting broader economic recovery in the State. The Council will also advise on the wider labour market and employment policy challenges that face the Irish economy in the post-pandemic recovery period.  Under its Terms of Reference, a central function of the Council is to advise Government on the development of the Pathways to Work strategy. </p>  <p>  The forthcoming Pathways to Work 2020-2025 strategy, which is the Government&rsquo;s overall framework for activation and employment support, is expected to be published in Q4 2020 and will complement the National Economic Plan.</p>  <p>  The Labour Employer Economic Forum (LEEF) comprises representatives of employers and trade unions with Government Ministers and is chaired by the Taoiseach.  The LEEF was established to bring together representatives of employers and trade unions with Ministers to exchange views on economic and employment issues as they affect the labour market. The aim of the LEEF is to provide a space to discuss areas of shared concern affecting the economy, employment and the labour market on a thematic basis, such as competitiveness, sustainable job creation, labour market standards and equality and gender issues in the workplace.</p></reply>

It also provides that an employer must notify the employee of any changes in the particulars given in the statement.  The Act provides a right of complaint to the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) where an employer fails to comply with either of the above.  The WRC is an office under the aegis of my Department. As part of its functions the WRC provides information relating to employment entitlements/obligations and industrial relations matters by means of their telephone service. This service is manned by experienced Information Officers.</p>  <p>  While an employer may renegotiate the terms and conditions of the contract of employment with an employee, they may not reduce any term or condition to a level lower than statutory entitlement.  It is best practice that any such renegotiation should be undertaken in consultation with the affected employee, and taking a long-term view of the employment relationship. </p>  <p>  An employee may have recourse to pursue a complaint to the Workplace Relations Commission under the Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977 to 2015, the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 or the Employment Equality Acts 1998 to 2015. </p></reply>

The wage subsidy schemes have been the most important supports and have allowed businesses to retain the link with employees even as revenues have fallen away.  Other supports such as the tax warehousing scheme have been important in allowing businesses to retain short-term liquidity.  Costs such as rates have been waived for many businesses.  Additionally, my Department has a wide range of supports which are available to businesses within this sector.  The Restart Grant is a direct cash injection of up to &euro;25,000 into eligible businesses, easy to access loans are available from Microfinance Ireland, the new COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme offers a range of loans from &euro;10,000 up to &euro;1M.  Mentoring and other such soft supports which can help businesses navigate their way through this crisis are available through the Local Enterprise Office network.</p>  <p>  I understand that my colleague the Minister for Transport who has responsibility for this sector has provided a special financial guarantee under a Refund Credit Note scheme for the sector.  This guarantees credit notes that licensed travel agent and tour operators issue to their customers; without this guarantee, it is likely that the industry would otherwise have to pay back cash refunds.  I understand that credit notes in excess of &euro;17m have already been issued to consumers under the scheme. </p>  <p>  I am aware that businesses in the sector are looking for more assistance and the Irish Travel Agents Association has made representations on behalf of its members for additional financial supports in the form of top-ups to business support schemes announced in the July Stimulus. These proposals will be considered by Government in due course.</p></reply>

I am informed that over 56% of companies who are due to file by end October have already completed their filing while a further 20% have partly filed. This reflects the normal experience of companies filing with CRO.</p>  <p>  I understand that the Registrar, having considered the issues and bearing in mind the current level of restrictions in operation, considers that it is not appropriate to further extend the filing period beyond 31st of October.

The 2014 Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan (OREDP) sets out the Government&rsquo;s policy for the sustainable development of our abundant offshore renewable energy resources.  The Strategic Environmental Assessment that underpinned the OREDP found that 4,500 MW of offshore wind and 1,500 MW of wave and tidal generation could be sustainably developed in Irish waters in the period to 2030. The OREDP can be found on my Department&rsquo;s website (www.dccae.gov.ie). Work has commenced on updating the 2014 Plan.   The Climate Action Plan includes a commitment to deliver at least 3.5 GW of offshore wind by 2030; the Programme for Government also commits to producing a plan setting out a path to achieve 5 GW of offshore wind by 2030.</p>  <p>  In contrast to offshore wind, wave energy is still at the research and development stage globally. Notwithstanding the development of promising experimental devices, more research, development and trials are required to bring wave energy technology to commercial viability. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to producing a plan setting out how we will take advantage of the massive potential of offshore energy on the Atlantic Coast. This plan will focus on utilising our existing energy and maritime infrastructure and will seek to create the right investment environment and support ocean energy research where necessary in the areas of floating wind, tidal, and wave power.</p></reply>

The report was prepared by an inter-agency working group following on from the submissions received in response to the publication of an issues paper on the review. Arising from the report, the Minister of State intends to establish a working group to include representatives from relevant Government Departments and State Agencies, Environmental Non-Governmental Organisations and industry stakeholders under an independent chairperson to examine the issues which have been identified during the review. The report recommends that the working group consider investment in further research into the development, education and use of alternatives to peat moss and graduating the elimination of the use of peat moss in the horticulture industry over an agreed period of years.  </p>  <p>  The High Court judgement in September 2019 to set-aside Regulations introduced to amend the existing consenting process means that planning permission and an Environmental Impact Assessment are required for large-scale peat extraction. In light of this decision, my Department is engaging with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, together with the Attorney General's Office to ensure the Ireland's legislation is in-line with all relevant EU legislation. </p></reply>

The scheme is a collaboration between my Department and the Department of Health and is jointly administered by the Health Service Executive and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland. Since 2016 over 1,200 homes have received free upgrades to their homes, including attic and wall insulation, window and door replacement and heating system upgrades where needed.   According to SEAI, the average cost per home completed to date is &euro;22,800. This investment has significantly improved the warmth and comfort of the homes. Initial reports have indicated that the upgrades are also delivering benefits to the health and wellbeing of participants, including reports of needing fewer GP and hospital visits. An independent analysis is being carried out by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), in collaboration with the Health Service Executive.</p>  <p>  Earlier this year, in line with public health and Government guidelines in place to stop the spread of COVID-19, all works under SEAI funded schemes were advised to pause for a period of time. The priority at all times was to minimise the risks for the homeowners and property occupants, contractors, their employees and the wider community. SEAI also advised contractors that any works that were incomplete should either be completed or postponed where possible and to ensure that the properties were left in a safe and habitable state before postponement. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that this scheme is only available to households where a member of the household aged either 55 and over or 12 and under has a diagnosed chronic respiratory condition, such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Further, the scheme is only available in specific Dublin areas.  SEAI has confirmed that works remain postponed on all of these homes as the occupants are extremely likely to be in the &lsquo;very high risk&rsquo; group, as defined by the HSE. This is due to the intrusive nature of the works on the schemes, with multiple crew members in homes working in close proximity and often over long periods.</p>  <p>  SEAI is mindful of the concerns that homeowners have with winter approaching and this is taken into account in its decision making as to how soon the scheme can restart. However, this must be balanced with the continuing risks of COVID-19 for applicants, contractors and the wider community. SEAI is considering a number of options that would allow work to recommence, and their associated risks. SEAI expects to complete this review by the end of this month.  The recently published 'Plan for Living with Covid-19' will be fully taken into account in these deliberations.  </p></reply>

Ireland introduced its Eel Management Plan under EU Regulation 1100/2007 in 2009, following approval by the European Commission. In addition to annual research and in line with the requirements of the EU Regulation, Ireland&rsquo;s Plan was reviewed in 2012, 2015 and 2018 and each review included a detailed scientific and research element. Further reviews will be undertaken as required by the Regulation.</p>  <p>  The European eel is a panmithic stock &ndash; a single stock across the entire continent - which spawns in the Sargasso Sea before arriving into European rivers and lakes.  The distribution is naturally random between countries. </p>  <p>  Ireland follows the objective of the EU Regulation which aims to ensure that escapement of eels to the sea should be at 40% relative to &ldquo;pristine conditions&rdquo; - those pertaining in the early 1980s which was the reference years selected.</p>  <p>  The latest advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas (ICES) is that the species remains critically endangered and that recruitment of juveniles in the Northern part of the Atlantic is currently at 1% relative to pristine conditions.  This advice states that anthropogenic (man-made) mortality should be kept at zero or as close to zero as possible.   </p>  <p>  Given the very long maturation period of each generation of eels in Irish waters, the impact of the very low annual recruitment of juvenile eels for more than 25 years means that recovery of the stock will only be sustained over the long term by commitment to consistent and equally long term conservation measures.</p></reply>

This represents an increase from the 150Mbps committed to under the Contract. The deployment plan forecasts premises passed in all counties within the first 2 years and over 90% of premises in the State having access to high speed broadband within the next four years.</p><p>  As of 29 September, design work is complete or on-going in target townlands across 23 counties and steady progress is being made with over 96,000 premises surveyed to date. This activity is increasing week on week and by year end, NBI expects to have completed some 120,000 surveys. </p><p>  This activity involves physically walking the routes and documenting images, notes and measurements of the poles, cables and underground ducts in each area. This is informing design solutions for provision of the fibre network. This detailed design is then used to initiate the &lsquo;make ready&rsquo; project with eir for the area, where eir ensure any poles and ducts being reused are fit for purpose. It is also used to initiate works with the subcontractors deploying the actual fibre in the area. The laying of fibre should commence shortly with the first fibre to the home connections expected around December this year. </p><p>  Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. Some 155 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through 'service provider' contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly available sites and by the Department of Education and Skills for schools. </p><p>  Approximately 300 sites in rural areas are targeted for completion by the end of 2020 including 75 schools. My Department will work with the Department of Education and Skills to prioritise the remaining schools to be connected over the term of the NBP.  Further details can be found at https://nbi.ie/bcp-locations/. </p><p>  While substantial progress has been made to date, the Covid 19 pandemic has had an impact on the delivery of the fibre network. The extent of this impact is currently being assessed and NBI has committed to put in place measures to mitigate the impact in as far as possible.The Covid 19 pandemic has also highlighted the importance of good reliable broadband to ensure that citizens across Ireland can avail of remote working, education and other essential online facilities. This is reflected in the commitments in the Programme for Government where delivery of the National Broadband Plan will be a key enabler to many of the policies envisaged particularly around increased levels of remote working.</p><p>  The Programme for Government has committed to seek to accelerate the roll out of the National Broadband Plan. In this regard, my Department continues to engage with NBI to explore the feasibility of accelerating aspects of this rollout to establish the possibility of bringing forward premises which are currently scheduled in years 6 and 7 of the current plan to an earlier date. Exploring the potential to accelerate the network rollout is being undertaken in parallel with the measures required to mitigate delays arising as a result of Covid-19.</p><p>In April 2020, all major telecommunications providers committed to a number of measures to help people stay in touch and work from home during the Covid-19 pandemic, with one particular commitment relating to the zero-rating of various educational and health related resource platforms. Since then, a number of operators have implemented further supports for consumers, such as third level students, who require a high data usage package, by increasing data limits on many existing packages and by the introduction of new packages with very high, or unlimited data offerings. The market for mobile packages with very high, or unlimited data offerings, is becoming increasingly competitive and this is positive for all consumers.</p></reply>

Of these, five are rolling in nature and will continue to be progressed in the normal course of events, while the remaining seven recommendations are not being implemented given the potential implications of their implementation on the effectiveness of the EPA to carry out its statutory functions, or where practical or technical issues have been identified. </p><p>In 2018, a further review of the EPA was commissioned (by the EPA itself) from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), using a framework developed by the OECD to assess and strengthen the organisational performance and governance of regulators. This review examined the EPA&rsquo;s institutional and organisational set-up, including how it assesses its own performance, and compared the Agency&rsquo;s governance arrangements against the Best Practice Principles and practices of other OECD Countries. The OECD report, 'Driving Performance at Ireland&rsquo;s Environmental Protection Agency,' was published in May 2020 and is available at </p><p>The OECD review concluded, <i>inter alia, </i>that &ldquo;the EPA has established itself as a trusted and respected body for environmental and radiological protection that is recognised for its scientific integrity.

To date over 142,000 homes have received free upgrades under the scheme, leaving the occupants better able to afford to heat their homes to an adequate level. In 2019, &euro;39.8 million was allocated to the Scheme with over 3,000 homes upgraded.  Budget 2020 announced a budget allocation for the scheme of &euro;52.8 million.  This represents the biggest ever budget for the Warmer Homes Scheme.   Although the budget for the scheme has been significantly increased in recent times, the current very high level of demand does directly impact waiting times. Prior to COVID-19 disruptions, the waiting time on the Warmer Homes Scheme, from application to completion of works, was between 18 and 24 months. In line with Government COVID-19 guidelines, the scheme was fully paused between March and June.  Works have recommenced for homes that can be categorised as lower risk, subject to homeowner consent, though some restrictions continue to apply. COVID-19 has therefore negatively impacted waiting times. SEAI has further advised that average waiting times should only ever be used as a general guide and waiting times may vary, based on the demand for the scheme at the time of application. SEAI are continuing to work through applications on a first-come, first-served basis.</p>  <p>  The Climate Action Plan includes a commitment to review ways to improve how current energy poverty schemes target those most in need, including how to reduce waiting times. Recommendations in relation to the implementation of changes to the scheme will be finalised shortly.</p>  <p>  The July Stimulus commits to increasing the SEAI budget by &euro;100 million in 2021. This additional funding will be focused on community retrofit schemes, retrofit schemes supporting those in energy poverty as well as other initiatives to support the achievement of our retrofit targets.  The funding supported the first call for projects under the new National Homes Retrofit Scheme which was launched last week (25 September).  This scheme is suitable for one-stop-shops, residential service providers, employers, financial institutions, Approved Housing Bodies and local authorities.  Details are available at: www.seai.ie.       </p>  <p>  Additional detail on other new and expanded schemes as well as an increased allocation for the Warmer Homes Scheme will be announced in the coming weeks. The additional funding will enable an increased level of activity which will positively impact the waiting list.</p></reply>

Ireland engages in negotiations through its membership of the European Union. In this regard, the EU aims to be climate-neutral by 2050. The European Commission recently presented its plan to reduce EU greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels. It is intended that both the 2030 and 2050 targets will be enshrined in the EU Climate Law. As Minister for Climate Action, I will lead on delivering our shared commitment in the Programme for Government to achieve an average 7% per annum reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions from 2021 to 2030, and to achieving net zero emissions by 2050. </p>  <p>  The 2050 target will be set in in the Climate Action (Amendment) Bill, which will be introduced in the D&aacute;il in early October. The Climate Action (Amendment) Bill will build on the existing Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015, and provide for a significantly strengthened statutory framework for governance of the climate challenge. The Bill will ensure delivery of successive Climate Action Plans and Long-Term Climate Action Strategies, supported by a system of carbon budgeting and sectoral targets with appropriate oversight by Government, the Oireachtas, and a strengthened Climate Change Advisory Council. The proposed Bill will define how five-year carbon budgets will be set, with every sector contributing, ensuring we continue to work to achieve a broad political and societal consensus on a Just Transition to a sustainable future for all communities. The 2015 Act provides for a voluntary contribution to be made from Local Government on climate action; the proposed Bill will establish a clear requirement on Local Authorities to develop and publish Climate Action Plans. </p>  <p>  My Department is reviewing the suite of actions recommended and required of the public sector to be a leader in addressing climate change. To this end, we are preparing a strategy for a cohesive approach to management, delivery and engagement across the Public Sector Framework for Climate Action. This approach will seek to ensure that the changes made and actions recommended under the Climate Action Plan and in the Programme for Government deliver impact under the targets committed to, support long term change, and are operational across the system.</p>  <p>  The actions we are taking should be demonstrably linked to delivering the targets committed to. They should primarily focus on delivering and underpinning the 50% decarbonisation target by 2030 for the public sector. In this context, Government is addressing the issue of ensuring that the climate impact of all policy matters being taken to Government is considered. This will ensure that Climate Action becomes embedded across all levels of Government activities.</p></reply>

The scientific consensus is clear, we must cut CO2 emissions in half by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050 to ensure we protect our planet and our country from the most severe impacts of global warming. I welcome the judgement of the Court. </p>  <p>  Since the 2017 National Mitigation Plan was published, the previous Government produced the 2019 Climate Action Plan which is designed to fully deliver Ireland&rsquo;s 2030 emissions reduction target of 30%. This Government is now committed to an average 7% per annum reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions from 2021 to 2030, equivalent to a 51% reduction over the decade and to achieving net zero emissions by 2050. </p>  <p>  A key aspect of delivering upon this commitment will be setting our 2050 target in law through the Climate Action Bill, which will be published shortly. The Bill will define how five-year carbon budgets will be set, and every sector must contribute towards meeting this target by implementing policy measures. The Programme for Government also recognises that the strategies to deliver these emissions reductions will require genuine consultation, detailed planning, organisation and adequate mechanisms for funding and incentives, and to this end allows for annual updating of the Climate Action Plan.</p>  <p>  I will work with colleagues across government to develop a new Climate Action Plan in 2021, prioritising initiatives in every sector to bring about the significant change needed to build a sustainable future for all.</p></reply>

The primary focus of this scheme is to provide support for the installation of infrastructure which will facilitate owners of EVs, who do not have access to a private parking space but rely on parking their vehicles in public places near their homes, to charge their EVs.</p><p>My Department, via the SEAI, currently provides a grant of up to &euro;5,000 to support the installation of these charge points. Since the launch of the scheme, the SEAI has received requests from twelve local authorities for applications under the scheme with two completed applications, (Louth County Council and Dublin City Council), currently being assessed for approval, to install a total of 24 charge points within their respective jurisdictions. In addition, the four Dublin local authorities are examining their approach for a network of charging infrastructure in the metropolitan area. </p><p>While Covid has introduced significant delays with respect to progressing supports under the scheme I expect interest in the scheme to intensify as we continue on into the recovery phase of the pandemic. Local Government has been to the forefront in recent times in addressing the climate challenge and the sector will have a key role to play in helping to decarbonise our national fleet through facilitating the provision of EV charging infrastructure in appropriate locations at both the local and regional level. </p><p>In this regard it should be noted that my Department is working closely with a number of key stakeholders, including Local Government, on developing a strategy to ensure electric vehicle charging infrastructure stays ahead of demand. This includes developing appropriate guidance for local authorities in line with the Programme for Government and will ensure we can continue to expand our national charging network through the relevant SEAI supports for on street chargers.</p><p>The Government is fully committed to supporting this programme and the other supports it has made available for the roll out of EVs so as to ensure we meet  our ambitious commitments as set out in the Programme for Government and the Climate Action Plan. </p><p>In this regard, &euro;10 million has been committed from the Climate Action Fund to promote the charging network and this has leveraged a further &euro;10 million investment from ESB. This intervention alone will result in: <ul><li>90 additional high power chargers (150kW), each capable of charging two vehicles</li><li>52 additional fast chargers (50kW), which may replace existing 22 kW standard chargers</li><li>264 replacement standard chargers (22kW) with more modern technology and with each consisting of two charge points</li></ul>Since the delivery stage of the project commenced in October 2019, 159 22kW chargers, each with two charge points, have been replaced bringing the total number of these chargers nationally to 318. Three multi charger sites have also been delivered, while the programme to upgrade 22kW chargers to 50kW has already commenced with 10 installations now in place. More information on these upgrades can be found at .</p><p>Combined with an effective public charging network, Ireland's home charging policy will help sustain and service the expected growth of electric vehicles on Irish roads. Charging while at home accounts for around 80% of electric vehicle charging in Ireland and it is best practice, internationally, to promote home charging as the most common and cheapest form of charging. To support home charging, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), on behalf of my Department, administers an EV Home Charger Grant of up to &euro;600 towards the purchase and installation of an EV home charger unit.</p></reply>

The 2020 budget allocation for this scheme is &euro;21 million.  Grants for domestic fossil fuel boiler replacement are not available under the Scheme and there are no plans for the reintroduction of such supports. Given the need to decarbonise our homes, grants are instead focused on renewable heating systems such as heat pumps and solar thermal.</p>  <p>  Heat pumps are an attractive and extremely efficient alternative to fossil fuel heating systems such as oil, gas, solid fuel and electric home heating systems. Furthermore, heat pumps are very economical to run offering lower energy costs to homeowners as well as reduced carbon emissions. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government and the Climate Action Plan set ambitious targets for the number and depth of residential retrofits to be completed by 2030. The targets are to retrofit 500,000 homes to a Building Energy Rating of B2 and to install 400,000 heat pumps in existing buildings over the next 10 years. </p>  <p>  The July Stimulus commits to increasing the SEAI budget by &euro;100 million in 2021. This additional funding will be focused on community retrofit schemes, retrofit schemes supporting those in energy poverty as well as other initiatives to support the achievement of our retrofit targets.  The funding supported the first call for projects under the new National Homes Retrofit Scheme which was launched last week (25 September).  This scheme is suitable for one-stop-shops, residential service providers, employers, financial institutions, Approved Housing Bodies and local authorities.  Details are available at: www.seai.ie.   </p>  <p>  Additional detail on other new and expanded schemes will be announced in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

Throughout, the NTA has been engaging directly with the public transport operators in both the public service obligation (PSO) and the commercial parts of the sector.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, since Phase 2 of the Re-opening Roadmap commenced on 8 June last, Dublin Bus has reverted to a full timetable with some limited exceptions at peak times where demand has remained low on certain routes.  Bus &Eacute;ireann and Go-Ahead Ireland PSO bus services returned to a full time-table on the same date and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann returned to a full time-table on 31 August.</p>  <p>  The Government's new "Living with Covid" Plan sets out capacity guidance for public transport at each of the 5 risk levels identified in the new Plan.  At current levels of risk, public transport operators are restricted to having only 50% of their passenger-carrying capacity on vehicles.  The Plan provides guidance for the public about using public transport at the different risk levels, including that wearing face coverings is mandatory, and encouraging use of off-peak services and sustainable active travel alternative options where feasible.  Importantly, the continued guidance under the Plan on working from home where possible and the restricted level of opening of social, leisure and other facilities has reduced the demand for public transport well below normal levels.</p>  <p>  The NTA will continue to work with public transport operators to monitor demand against capacity and where issues arise and where spare fleet and drivers are available, additional services will be provided.</p>  <p>  The Government is financially supporting the continued provision of public transport services over the course of this very difficult year where demand collapsed, and where capacity is now restricted for public health reasons, this support takes the form of a substantial funding increase to keep PSO services running, and also the introduction of a new, temporary financial support for commercial public transport operators.</p></reply>

That should be sought from the travel agent, in the first instance.  Such a refund must be made within 14 days.  Where a flight has been booked directly with an airline, the relevant legal protections are different and fall under EU Regulation 261, which covers the rights of airline passengers in instances of flight cancellations.  Under that Regulation, an airline has 7 days to make a cash refund to its customers when it cancels a flight.  However, if a flight goes ahead and a customer either cancels or does not use their ticket, they are not entitled to a refund under EU law, irrespective of the circumstances.  That said, I understand that the main Irish airlines have waived flight change fees in circumstances where a flight occurs and people are not able to present because of Government advice, although fare differences and date restrictions may apply.  </p>  <p>  Evidently, the existing consumer protections and legal obligations on airlines and the broader travel sector did not envisage the current circumstances of mass cancellations and stringent travel restrictions for countries that are not on the 'Green' list.  That has, not surprisingly, put the entire system under immense pressure and it is causing real difficulties for people and businesses.  </p>  <p>  I am mindful that the options put forward by airlines may not be workable for customers in all instances.  My colleague the Minister of State Hildegarde Naughton continues to engage with the airlines in respect to consumer rights issues, with calls for the airlines to offer fair and reasonable alternatives to passengers who wish not to travel at this time. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that there is no mechanism to compel airlines to cancel planned flights or to provide refunds or specific alternatives to refunds when there is no legal requirement to do so. </p></reply>

These recommendations included a loosening of international travel restrictions, the finalisation of safe air travel protocols for airports and airlines and the provision of Exchequer funding for airlines and airports.  </p>  <p>  Where it has been able to, the Government has responded positively to the Report's recommendations.  The wage subsidy scheme - which benefits aviation companies - has been extended out to April next year, a safe air travel protocol document has been published and liquidity supports are available through the ISIF Pandemic Stability Fund.  Moreover, the Government is working hard at European level to secure a common EU-wide approach to air travel that offers the prospect of easing some travel restrictions in a safe way.</p>  <p>  Whilst we clearly have not yet arrived at a point where it makes sense for the Government to try to stimulate growth in air travel, as envisaged by the Taskforce Report, consideration is being given to what more needs to be done to protect key connectivity - including outside of Dublin - without undermining the central public health objective of reducing the spread of Covid-19.  It should be noted that additional emergency funding has already been allocated to Shannon Airport, and the Regional Airports Programme is continuing to provide important financial supports for our regional airports.  </p></reply>

These include wage subsidy schemes, grants, low-cost loans, waiver of commercial rates  and deferred tax liabilities.  </p>  <p>  Up to the end of August, the regional airports of Cork, Donegal, Ireland West, Kerry and Shannon Group (including Shannon Airport) had collectively received, or were in the process of applying for horizontal supports to a value of approx &euro;6.5 million.  </p>  <p>  The smaller of these airports, those that typically handle less than 1 million passengers, are also receiving &euro;6m in Exchequer grants this year from Current and Capital Schemes under the existing Regional Airports Programme.  </p>  <p>  In addition to the grant aid, regional connectivity continues to be subsidised through Government funded PSO air services between Dublin and the airports of Donegal and Kerry.  Over &euro;7m is being provided to support this service in 2020.</p>  <p>  A new Regional Airports Programme for a five year period starting in 2021 is also being finalised.  This will help eligible airports remain viable as they begin to plan for recovery and transition away from the devastation of Covid. </p>  <p>  Prior to Covid-19, the State-owned airports of Shannon and Cork had more than 1 million passengers.  As a result, and because of their commercial status, these airports were never part of the Regional Airports Programme.  </p>  <p>  While State aid rules do not preclude these airports from receiving capital funding, it has been a matter of national policy to target limited supports at our smallest airports &ndash; those that would ordinarily struggle, because of their size, to finance projects/activities that would ensure ongoing compliance with safety and security obligations.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, as a result of Covid, an emergency Exchequer contribution of &euro;6.1million was approved for a Hold Baggage Screening project at Shannon Airport in June this year.  </p>  <p>  In relation to any future support mechanisms for the aviation sector, my Department will continue to work closely with aviation stakeholders and continue to review options in the context of the Government&rsquo;s plans for international travel, having regard to the recommendations of the Aviation Taskforce. </p>  <p>  I cannot give specific commitments at this time because any further supports that may be considered will be part of the ongoing Budget deliberations, and there are many competing demands on the Exchequer.  However, I can assure the Deputy that the importance of these airports to the regions is well understood by Government.</p></reply>

Minister of State Naughton has also recently met with the Managing Director of Cork Airport. </p>  <p>  In order to assist businesses in facing the challenges of Covid-19 and further protect employment, the Government has put in place a comprehensive suite of supports for companies of all sizes, including those in the aviation sector, which includes the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) (and its predecessor the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme), extended until April 2021, commercial rates waiver and deferred tax liabilities. daa is availing of these supports which are designed to assist businesses, including our airports in terms of the management of their companies during this unprecedented time.</p>  <p>  The Aviation Recovery Taskforce set out recommendations for consideration by Ministers and Government on what needs to be done to assist the Irish aviation sector to recover from the COVID-19 crisis. The taskforce report contains a number of recommendations on how to support Irish aviation, which has been badly affected by the almost complete shutdown of international air travel. The recommendations include measures to sustain the industry for so long as travel restrictions are in place and also measures to help stimulate a return to growth, when the time is right. The Government has already implemented several recommendations, including the extension of the wage subsidy scheme and the publication of safe air travel protocols. We have also progressed a European slot rule waiver for airlines in consultation with the European Commission.  </p>  <p>  The other recommendations, including further targeted financial supports to help reinstate connectivity (including for Cork Airport), regional development and sustainability in the sector are being examined.  Work is required to develop these recommendations into effective interventions, and that work is underway by my Department.  It will feed into the Government&rsquo;s further plans to aid broader economic recovery, including in the aviation sector.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s recently published Resilience and  Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with Covid-19 specifically addresses the approach to international travel and proposes that Ireland will broadly support the European Commission&rsquo;s recently published proposal to promote a common approach to travel restrictions and movement within the EU/EEA.  This proposal will now be considered by the Council of Ministers.</p>  <p>  In relation to any future support mechanisms for the aviation sector, my Department will continue to work closely with aviation stakeholders and continue to review options in the context of the Government&rsquo;s plans for international travel, having regard to the recommendations of the Aviation Taskforce. </p>  <p>  I cannot give specific commitments at this time because any further supports that may be considered will be part of the ongoing Budget deliberations, and there are many competing demands on the public purse.  I want to assure you Deputy that my Department is in continuous contact with the daa, in terms of both Dublin and Cork airports and that the importance of these airports to the regions is well understood by Government.  </p></reply>

There is a significant risk of loss of essential connectivity and market access opportunities for movement of goods and people this winter and beyond. Reduced connectivity leads to a rise in costs for essential travel and air cargo, with implications for the wider economy, competitiveness and investment, as well as a risk to the aviation industry itself.</p>  <p>  The Government's approach to international travel to date has sought to protect public health and contain the disease while respecting that in certain circumstances travel will be essential. Under the plan for living with Covid-19, it is proposed that Ireland will broadly support the European Commission proposals for an EU common approach to COVID-19 and International travel, whereby testing would be considered as a viable alternative to travel restrictions.  </p>  <p>  The European Commission proposal would see the mapping of States by the European Centre for Disease Control according to the Epi data available, as a basis for applying a proposed common EU framework for COVID-19 restrictions, including testing for travel from higher risk locations for COVID-19.  The details of the EU proposal are still being worked through by Member States at a European level. Ireland will continue to engage with Member States and the Commission to develop a regime that is consistent with the public health requirements. </p>  <p>  The Government will continue to ensure that any proposed testing arrangements to facilitate international travel do not impact on resources and capacity available in the health sector for the testing and tracing of symptomatic patients and serial testing of high-risk groups or workplace environments.</p>  <p>  My Department is engaging with colleagues across Government, including with Department of Health and the HSE, to explore the possibility of a robust testing and screening regime for international travel. In addition, my Department is continuing to engage with the aviation industry on the feasibility of airport testing, including pre-departures testing. </p>  <p>  I hope to bring forward a Memo for Government concerning International travel within the coming fortnight.</p></reply>

In this context, the 2020 Programme for Government has committed to review and reduce speed limits, where appropriate, to address both road safety issues and carbon emissions, and ensure greater compliance.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s road network is extensive and inconsistent, which means that a &lsquo;one size fits all&rsquo; solution for Speed Limits for the circa 100,000 kilometre road network is not always possible and queries will arise.

These include wage subsidy schemes, grants,  low-cost loans, waiver of commercial rates  and deferred tax liabilities.   Up to the end of August, the airports of Cork, Donegal, Ireland West, Kerry and Shannon Group (including Shannon Airport) had collectively received, or were in the process of applying for horizontal supports to a value of approx &euro;6.5 million.  </p>  <p>  Government is also providing the smaller of these airports, those that typically handle less than 1 million passengers, &euro;6m in Exchequer grants this year under Current and Capital Schemes under the existing Regional Airports Programme.  </p>  <p>  In addition to the grant aid, regional connectivity continues to be subsidised through Government funded PSO air services between Dublin and the airports of Donegal and Kerry.  Over &euro;7m is being provided to support this service in 2020.</p>  <p>  A new Regional Airports Programme for a five year period starting in 2021 is currently being finalised.  This will help eligible airports remain viable as they begin to plan for recovery and transition away from the devastation of Covid. </p>  <p>  In addition to the above, an Exchequer contribution of &euro;6.1million for a Hold Baggage Screening project at Shannon Airport was approved in June this year.  This project was suspended because of Covid and Government intervened to ensure Shannon Airport's capacity to remain compliant with related EU regulations.  </p>  <p>  In relation to any future support mechanisms for the aviation sector, my Department will continue to work closely with aviation stakeholders and continue to review options in the context of the Government&rsquo;s plans for international travel, having regard to the recommendations of the Aviation Taskforce.  </p>  <p>  I cannot give specific commitments at this time because any further supports that may be considered will be part of the ongoing Budget deliberations, and there are many competing demands on the public purse.

According to Articles 3(1)(d), 4(1) and 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009, natural persons engaged in the occupation of road transport operator in the EU and transport managers employed by an undertaking engaged in the occupation of road transport operator have to hold a certificate of professional competence (&quot;CPC&quot;) issued by the authorities of an EU Member State, or by bodies duly authorised by an EU Member State, for that purpose.  </p><p>The Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport (CILT) is the body authorised to organise and certify the examination for Transport Manager CPCs in Ireland. </p><p>The European Commission in its Brexit stakeholder notices published in January 2018 outlined that at the end of the transition period, if the UK leaves the EU without an agreement, Transport Manager CPCs issued by an authority of the UK or a body authorised by the UK will no longer be valid in EU Member States.</p><p>In the absence of an EU-UK agreement, the options for Irish road transport operators employing someone with a UK-issued transport manager CPC resident in Ireland are therefore as follows:</p><p>In accordance with Article 13 of Regulation (EC) 1071/2009, a road transport operator is permitted a period of up to a maximum of six months in which to ensure that the professional competence requirement for their operator licence is once again satisfied.  </p><p>This means that in the event of no EU-UK agreement having been concluded by end year, within six months from the end of the transition period, operators affected must either:</p><p>1. Ensure that a Transport Management CPC issued by an EU Member State is obtained by the existing Transport Manager who is resident in the EU. A Transport Manager holding a UK-issued CPC may apply to obtain an Irish Transport Management CPC &ndash; this requires passing the Transport Management CPC examination administered by the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport (CILT) - the requirement of 100 hours tuition in advance of the exam, which is normally mandatory, will be waived and candidates can apply to CILT to sit the examination directly)<b><i>OR</i></b></p><p>2. Appoint a new Transport Manager who holds a Transport Management CPC issued by an EU Member State. </p><p>It is understood that approximately 200 of our licenced Road Transport Operators engage a UK CPC qualified Transport Manager.  </p><p>My Department has already written to the affected road transport operators pointing out these circumstances in the event that the UK leaves the EU without an agreement.  </p><p>With regard to driver CPCs, drivers working for an EU haulage or bus transport operator are required to hold a driver CPC. The CPC certifies the qualifications and periodic training of drivers. As set out in the European Commission notice to stakeholders in 2018, as of the withdrawal date, driver CPCs issued by the UK or by an approved training centre in the UK will no longer be valid in the EU-27.  A driver with a UK-issued driver CPC who is resident in Ireland or working for an Irish operator may exchange the UK CPC for an Irish CPC, in advance of 31 December 2020.</p></reply>

As the Deputy is aware, Shannon Airport is part of Shannon Group and Shannon Group is availing of these supports which are designed to assist businesses, including our airports in terms of the management of their companies during this unprecedented time.  Government has already also provided emergency funding of &euro;6.1m to Shannon Airport to complete a vital Hold Baggage Screening project - a safety and security requirement under EU Regulations. </p>  <p>  The Aviation Recovery Taskforce set out recommendations for consideration by Ministers and Government on what needs to be done to assist the Irish aviation sector to recover from the COVID-19 crisis. The taskforce report contains a number of recommendations on how to support Irish aviation, which has been badly affected by the almost complete shutdown of international air travel. The recommendations include measures to sustain the industry for so long as travel restrictions are in place and also measures to help stimulate a return to growth, when the time is right. The Government has already implemented several recommendations, including the extension of the wages subsidy scheme and publication of safe air travel protocols. We have also progressed a European slot rule waiver for airlines in consultation with the European Commission.   </p>  <p>  In relation to any future support mechanisms for the aviation sector, my Department will continue to work closely with aviation stakeholders and continue to review options in the context of the Government&rsquo;s plans for international travel, having regard to the recommendations of the Aviation Taskforce.  </p>  <p>  I cannot give specific commitments at this time because any further supports that may be considered will be part of the ongoing Budget deliberations, and there are many competing demands on the public purse.

I acknowledge that third- level students are one of many cohorts across all areas of society who have being impacted by the increased demand since services resumed. </p>  <p>  The Driver Test service has seen its weekly capacity reduced significantly in order to comply with occupational and public health requirements. As an example, due to the additional hygiene and sanitation procedures that are now absolutely necessary, each testing slot now takes a much longer time to complete.

Please advise my private office if you do not receive a reply within 10 working days. </p><p>With regard to Public Transport, continued investment in public transport and active travel measures will help to ease traffic congestion. The DART+ Programme is a transformative programme of projects which aims to modernise and improve existing rail services in the Greater Dublin Area (GDA). It will provide frequent, modern, electrified services to Hazelhatch-Celbridge on the Kildare Line, Maynooth and M3 Parkway on the Maynooth/Sligo Line. In this regard, the Deputy may be interested to note the recently launched and ongoing Public Consultation process in regard to the DART+ Maynooth line, the duration of which has been extended to 7 October.</p><p>Separately the Deputy may be aware of Government's approval last year of the proposed purchase of 41 additional carriages to the InterCity Railcar fleet, which will increase capacity across intercity services on both the Maynooth and Kildare Lines. </p><p>In May of this year the National Transport Authority (NTA) wrote to all 31 local authorities to offer its financial and technical support for COVID mobility measures and this support is being funded through my Department's sustainable mobility investment programme. The approach taken was to engage with all local authorities to see what their requirements were and to grant-aid in full, various temporary intervention proposals, subject to those proposals being agreed with the NTA in advance of implementation. </p><p>In addition, under the July Stimulus an additional funding was announced to support pedestrians and cyclists in urban and rural Ireland in the coming months. The Stimulus programme aims to further support local authorities across the country as they respond to the needs of local communities and businesses in the months ahead. Funding under the Stimulus programme must be expended by year end. I can advise that Kildare County Council were allocated &euro;1.8m in funding under this programme.</p><p>Outside of these funding streams, funding has also been provided under my Departments sustainable mobility investment programme to Kildare County Council through the NTA for a number cycling and walking infrastructural projects. Current cycling and walking projects in the area that the Deputy refers to include Royal Canal Greenway (Maynooth to Fingal), North South Corridor Scheme - Maynooth (inc Footbridge) and Celbridge Bridge. Also in Kildare County, the GDA cycle network in Naas, Kill and Kilcullen and a bus priority scheme in Naas and Newbridge.</p></reply>

I have therefore referred this part of the Question to the Authority for direct reply.  I would ask the Deputy to contact my office if a response has not been received within ten days.   </p>  <p>  As you can appreciate Covid 19 has had a profound effect on the delivery of  many services. The Driver Test service has seen its weekly capacity reduced significantly in order to comply with occupational and public health requirements. As an example, due to the additional hygiene and sanitation procedures that are now absolutely necessary, each testing slot now takes a much longer time to complete. In addition to this, the number of testers working in any centre at the one time has to be reduced to ensure physical distancing rules can be maintained.  </p>  <p>  Those who had appointments cancelled due to Covid 19 are being prioritised in the first instance. Initially, only those who are frontline healthcare workers will be deemed eligible for an urgent test slot. This approach for prioritising customers will be kept under review as the RSA moves through the service resumption. </p>  <p>   My Department is remaining in close contact with the RSA who are examining ways of increasing the number of tests within the current health constraints. One option is the employment of additional testers, something which has been done in the past to address backlogs.  However, I would  like to stress,  many of the issues impacting on the delivery of service are concerned with the throughput of centres themselves in light of the restrictions, rather than on the availability of staff.</p>  <p>   In the meantime, my Department has give approval to the RSA to retain 18 driver testers on  temporary contracts due to expire in October and November, and to rehire up to 19 testers whose contracts expired in May.   </p>  <p>  While I regret the inconvenience caused by the necessity to adhere to the restrictions imposed on us by NPHET and other experts, the safety of the public, whether through contracting Covid or through deaths or injuries on our roads, must be of paramount importance.</p></reply>

It does not extend to private property, or to public parks which are under the jurisdiction of local authorities.</p>  <p>  The user of a scrambler motorbike, a quad bike or similar vehicle, in a public place must have insurance, road tax and a driving licence, and must also wear a helmet, with severe penalties under the road traffic laws (including fixed charge notices, penalty points, fines and possible seizure of the vehicle) for not being in compliance with these requirements.  It is also, incidentally, and offence to supply a mechanically propelled vehicle to a minor. </p>  <p>  For the purposes of the Road Traffic Acts, a &ldquo;public place&rdquo; means any public road, and any street, road or other place to which the public have access with vehicles whether as of right or by permission and whether subject to or free of charge.  Road traffic law does not extend to the use of mechanically propelled vehicles on private property.  Certain places, such as parks under the control of local authorities, can be subject to bye-laws, which those authorities have the power to introduce, to prohibit the use of vehicles.  Gardai can also prosecute scrambler and quad bike users in these areas under public order laws.</p>  <p>  In April 2018, the Department of Justice convened a task force comprising representatives from an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Department of Justice, my Department, the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, the local authorities and the National Parks and Wildlife Service, to examine the current legislative provisions in place and to examine whether further laws need to be enacted to deal with the problem of quads and scramblers.  </p>  <p>  The taskforce concluded that there is a already a wide suite of legislation available to an Garda Siochana, including road traffic legislation (for using these vehicles illegally in a public place), and public order legislation (for using them on public land).  There is no jurisdiction for using quads or scramblers on private land.  Consideration was given to whether an extension of the concept of 'public place' in the Road Traffic Acts to cover parks would assist in this area.  However, it was concluded following legal advice that the extension of such a fundamental concept in road traffic law in an attempt to address one particular issue would have wide-ranging unintended consequences, and would not be a viable solution.</p>  <p>  The Task Force has since met to consider other more precise legal avenues, and will be meeting again shortly to follow up on the options being considered.  Any solution will need to involve a combination of legislation - whether new or existing,- enforcement, public awareness campaigns, and approaches to local youth groups, to educate teens on the dangers of using such vehicles.  I will be happy to consider any recommendations resulting from this process which fall within my remit.</p>  <p>  I would add that, whatever the legislation and whether we are talking of a 'public place' or a park, there remains a major difficulty of enforcement.  A Garda giving chase to a youth on a scrambler must be mindful of the safety of other members of the public in the area, and this makes it more difficult to detain the scrambler drivers, whatever the legislation in place. </p></reply>

Its design reflects the changing environment around the COVID-19 pandemic which has shifted from crisis mode to one of living alongside the virus, in line with the recently announced Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with COVID-19. </p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that, as of 25 September 2020, there were 36,746 employers registered for the EWSS which is considered a strong level of participation so far and, notably, over 82% of the employers availing of the TWSS when it finished at the end of August.</p>  <p>  The EWSS &ldquo;turnover test&rdquo; has been specifically designed so as to target the subsidy at otherwise viable employers whose businesses continue to be adversely impacted by COVID-19 by requiring a comparison of the firm&rsquo;s pre-pandemic operations with their current operations.   The legislation provides that the employer must be able to demonstrate that they are operating at no more than 70% in either the turnover of the employer&rsquo;s business or the customer orders received by the employer by reference to the period from July to December 2020 compared with the same period in 2019.  </p>  <p>  There is additional flexibility in the application of the turnover test to allow employers to take account of potentially sudden changes in turnover on a month-to-month &ldquo;opt-in/opt-out&rdquo; basis.  Under the legislation, an employer is required to carry out a review of their turnover each month and confirm that they are still eligible for the scheme.  At the same time, there is no cut-off deadline for access to the scheme, so if there is a reduction in turnover later in 2020 because of an unexpected reduction in business activity or a sudden change in business circumstances the employer may be entitled to make a claim for that future period.  </p>  <p>  The EWSS has broader application than the TWSS, for example to include employees that were not previously eligible, such as seasonal workers and newly hired personnel.  The EWSS will also be in place for longer than the TWSS.  The trade-off is that it has been necessary to narrow some other criteria to ensure the EWSS is sustainable in terms of cost. </p>  <p>  I would note that the strictest public health measures that were in place in April and May have been eased and so it is reasonable to expect that businesses are able to shoulder more of the economic burden of their businesses.  At the same time, the retention of a wage subsidy scheme is to recognise that economic outputs are unlikely to return to normal for many businesses for some time to come because of the continued need to observe public health requirements such as social distancing.</p>  <p>  All the conditions of the turnover test have been carefully calibrated in that regard and there are no plans at present to re-visit the core eligibility criteria for the EWSS.  </p>  <p>  I will continue to closely monitor the administration of the EWSS as well as the uptake and utilisation of this important economy-wide employment measure in the weeks and months ahead to with a view to ensuring that it achieves its objective of supporting viable enterprises and employers. In fact, the relevant legislation obliges me to monitor and superintend the administration of the scheme and empowers me to make certain adjustments across the whole scheme where I determine that these are necessary.</p></reply>

To assist that registration process Revenue has provided on its website a helpful step by step guidance video for businesses. </p>  <p>  At the start of September, Revenue wrote to some 90,000 businesses, both those with an EORI and those without an EORI, who traded in goods with the UK at any time in 2019 or in the first half of 2020. These are businesses who if they continue trade, either by way of imports or exports or both with Great Britain after I January will need to be Brexit ready in less than just 100 days from now. The  business concerned must be able to complete the necessary customs formalities from that date in order to be able to move goods to and through Great Britain. For trade with Northern Ireland only, customs formalities will not apply. </p>  <p>  Revenue is now undertaking, as part of this intensified engagement, follow-up telephone calls with some 14,000 businesses of the 90,000 that it has written to, who Revenue identified as likely to be the most significantly impacted by Brexit. </p>  <p>  In addition to the letters and follow up telephone contacts, a further initiative under Revenue's trade engagement programme, is a two-day series of live streamed Brexit information sessions which will take place on the 5th and 6th of October 2020. Revenue will provide important information to help businesses to get ready for trading with Great Britain from 1 January 2021. Full details of each session and a link to participate can be found on www.revenue.ie/brexit. </p>  <p>  The work being undertaken by Revenue to support businesses and trade to get Brexit ready is hugely important. The message for trade and business that will be impacted by Brexit is very clear. Its time to get ready and its essential to be ready for 1 January.</p></reply>

The establishment of the Judicial Council in December is very important in this regard, and it is expected that the Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee will submit draft Guidelines to the executive board of the Judicial Council shortly. While the adoption of those Guidelines will be a matter for the Judicial Council, it is desirable that the Guidelines could play a role in the lowering of award levels and also could lead to a more consistent application of making awards in courts.  Insurance Ireland has indicated that if award levels come down so will premiums charged by its members.  I believe that this is a very important statement and this Government intends holding the insurance industry to this commitment. </p>  <p>  In conclusion, I wish to emphasise that prioritising delivery on the commitments to insurance reform remains a priority for the Government and this is reflected in the Programme for Government. </p></reply>

While many households suffered a fall in income in the second quarter of the year, Government schemes such as the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme and the Pandemic Unemployment Payment offset some of this shock. However, the reduction in spending was much larger than the fall in household disposable income. On one hand the sale of goods and services was restricted due to containment measures. On the other hand, households responded to the uncertain economic environment by building up precautionary savings. While some easing of savings may be expected next year, savings will likely remain elevated relative to historic levels in the face of continued uncertainty surrounding the path of the virus. </p>  <p>  The Government has acted decisively to counteract the worst effects of the COVID-19 induced economic shock by providing supports with a total value of around &euro;24.5 billion to date, mostly in the form of labour supports, investment in the health service and through direct supports to businesses. The July Stimulus package, when combined with previously announced measures, represents unprecedented levels of Government intervention in the economy. It is centred on the twin objectives of assisting business and getting as many people back to work as quickly as possible. The measures announced in the July Stimulus Package include a &lsquo;stay and spend&rsquo; initiative to support the hospitality sector, loss relief measures for self-employed individuals and other businesses, and a temporary reduction in the standard rate of VAT from 23 per cent to 21 per cent.  All of these measures will be beneficial to the retail and hospitality sectors, which have suffered greatly during the crisis. </p>  <p>  Due to prudent management of the public finances in recent years, we entered this crisis from a position of strength and resilience and we are now able to run budget deficits in order to provide counter cyclical support to the economy and to promote the retention and creation of jobs. While I cannot announce the contents of Budget 2021 in advance, the Budget will provide support for those sectors most in need in the short-term.  As set out in the Programme for Government, a &lsquo;Recovery Fund&rsquo; will be established as a further support and Minster McGrath and I will provide more details of this on Budget day. </p></reply>

These measures were in addition to other Government supports already in place. They provide supports for businesses to retain existing jobs and to create new ones, and they will help build confidence in consumers and communities all over Ireland.</p>  <p>  The Tourism Recovery Taskforce is expected to publish its Final Recovery Plan in the coming weeks and Minister Catherine Martin will consider its recommendations at that stage.  In the context of the Budget and the development of the National Economic Plan, the Government will review and refine existing supports, and consider any further necessary measures as we adjust to managing COVID-19. </p>  <p>  Other specific policy matters  in relation to the retail and hospitality sectors are matters, in the first instance, for an T&aacute;naiste, for the Minister for Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the Gaeltacht and for the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation.</p>  <p>  With regards to a gift card/voucher system, the Stay and Spend Incentive (SASI) was introduced earlier this year. The purpose of the SASI is to incentivise taxpayers to support registered/accredited providers of accommodation and/or food during the off-season, thus providing support to a particularly vulnerable sector that will continue to be constrained by public health limitations. All food service providers and F&aacute;ilte Ireland registered or listed providers of accommodation are eligible to take part in the scheme. </p>  <p>  The SASI will provide a maximum of &euro;125 in income tax credits to tax-payers who spend up to &euro;625 in restaurants, pubs, hotels, B&amp;Bs etc. in the period from October 2020 to the end of April 2021. Where an individual or jointly assessed tax-payer has insufficient income tax liability to fully benefit from the measure, they may still avail of the relief against their USC contributions.</p>  <p>  It was decided not to implement a gift card/voucher system for the following reasons:</p>  <p>  - A voucher system would be slow to implement, as well as costly to administer</p>  <p>  - There may be the potential for unlawful use of any vouchers, including for fraud and money laundering</p>  <p>  - The SASI was designed to incentivise consumers to spend more. By covering a proportion of the eligible spend (20%) rather than its entirety, it was designed to leverage money people may have saved over recent months and get them to spend not just &euro;125 but &euro;625. </p></reply>

The European Commission will borrow on financial markets to finance loans to Member States, allowing Member States benefit from the EU&rsquo;s strong credit rating (AAA) and low borrowing costs. </p>  <p>  Following detailed discussion with the Commission it was determined that Ireland would be eligible to recoup the substantial majority of expenditure already accrued under the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) from SURE. The TWSS has been the main scheme implemented in Ireland to date that meets the application criteria for this European response mechanism.</p>  <p>  The Commission intends going to the market in final quarter of 2020 to start procuring the funding for the first tranche. This is expected to take a number of months and is expected to be paid to Member States over coming months, meaning that it could be the early/mid part of 2021 before the full draw-down is paid to all requesting Member States.</p>  <p>  A decision to make a formal application to the SURE loan scheme will be taken by Government shortly and the necessary information is being prepared at present.

Significantly, in my view, where cover and related issues are disputed, the Bank expects firms to pay the reasonable costs of customer plaintiffs in agreed test case litigation.  </p>  <p>  The Central Bank has informed me that it is currently pursuing a multi-pronged approach to this issue which it believes is the most effective way forward in terms of producing clarity for affected businesses in Ireland in circumstances where there are a variety of insurers, policy types and approaches to dealing with their customers.  The Bank has stated that it will leave all possible options open as it takes this work forward.  In the meantime, it states that it will continue its robust supervisory engagement with firms in line with the requirements set out in the Framework, which I welcome.</p>  <p>  In conclusion, the Deputy should be assured that officials will continue to monitor the business interruption issue and engage as needs be with the Central Bank on the matter and advise Minister of State Fleming and myself as appropriate. </p></reply>

Its design reflects the changing environment around the COVID-19 pandemic which has shifted from crisis mode to one of living alongside the virus, in line with the recently announced Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with COVID-19<i><font color="#0000FF">.</font></i></p><p>I am advised by Revenue that, as of 25 September 2020, there were 36,746 employers registered for the EWSS which is considered a strong level of participation so far and, notably, over 82% of the employers availing of the TWSS when it finished at the end of August.</p><p>I am aware of the concerns that have been raised regarding the pace of recovery for some sectors of the economy and that it has been suggested that the application of the EWSS should be delineated on the basis of explicit sectoral qualification criteria.  However, I would note that the reality of COVID-19 is that our whole economy and labour market have been rapidly transformed by this unprecedented shock and nearly all sectors have been negatively impacted either directly or indirectly.  The EWSS has therefore been deliberately designed as an economy wide measure that is open to all sectors as was the case for the TWSS before it. The availability of the support by reference to a turnover test means that the scheme can be applied across the whole economy while at the same time remain targeted at employers who are considered to be most in need of support, including the sectors mentioned by the Deputy.</p><p>It is important to emphasise that the adaptation from the TWSS to the levels of support in the EWSS will allow employers to rely on the continuation of support over a longer period of up to 8 months while also ensuring such support is sustainable and affordable.</p><p>I will continue to closely monitor the administration of the EWSS as well as the uptake and utilisation of this important economy-wide employment measure in the weeks and months ahead to with a view to ensuring that it achieves its objective of supporting viable enterprises and employers. In fact, the relevant legislation obliges me to monitor and superintend the administration of the scheme and empowers me to make certain adjustments across the whole scheme where I determine that these are necessary.</p><p>For those businesses who need further support, there are a number of options open to them &ndash; including State backed loans which may be repaid using EWSS funds as well as grants.  Particular attention is drawn to the comprehensive package of business and employer supports that have been made available as part of the July Stimulus Plan - including the Credit Guarantee Scheme, the SBCI Working Capital Scheme, Sustaining Enterprise Fund, and the Covid-19 Business Loans Scheme.</p><p>Finally, in the case of the sectors highlighted by the Deputy, I would note that my colleague the Minister for Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the Gaeltacht, Ms. Catherine Martin T.D., has recently announced the establishment and membership of the Arts and Culture Recovery Task Force and funding for a Live Performance and Music Industry Support Package.  </p><p>Any other additional income supports are a matter for the Department of Social Protection.</p></reply>

Therefore on a straight-line basis the cost of a cut in the CGT rate from its current rate of 33% to 25% is estimated to be &euro;256 million. </p><p>The Deputy may be interested in the analysis included at link: , which includes information on the incomes of individuals making CGT payments - see Tables 12 and 13 in particular. As can be seen CGT is paid by individuals across all income deciles and therefore any change to the CGT regime would impact all income deciles. </p><p>Finally, the Deputy should note that any changes to the CGT regime are considered in the context of the annual Budget and Finance Bill process.</p></reply>

These include increasing transparency; reviewing duty of care legislation; looking at how to further enhance the role of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, and increasing competition in the market.  Making progress on this work will involve a cross-departmental approach and will build and expand upon previous work done by the Cost of Insurance Working Group.</p>  <p>  The issue of insurance reform was the subject of discussion at a recent meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Economic Recovery and Investment and there have also been a number of meetings, held at Ministerial level, chaired by An T&aacute;naiste on the issue of insurance since the formation of the Government in July. Work is progressing to ensure that this agenda can be implemented in a coordinated fashion in order to ensure maximum effect and benefit for insurance policyholders.  In that regard, both the T&aacute;naiste and I are keen to progress a Whole-of-Government structure which will ensure these reforms can be implemented in an effective and timely manner. </p>  <p>  In conclusion, the Deputy can rest assured that insurance reform is a key priority issue for the new Government and that Minister of State Fleming and our officials are working to ensure that progress is made in this policy area.</p></reply>

The TWSS, which ceased on 31 August 2020, was a fully automated solution designed around Revenue&rsquo;s real-time PAYE (employer) system and could not operate where employers failed to meet their statutory PAYE return filing obligations. </p><p>The Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) was introduced as part of the July Stimulus Package and replaced the TWSS from 1 September 2020. The scheme provides a flat-rate subsidy to qualifying employers based on the number of qualifying employees on their payroll. For every qualifying employee paid between &euro;203 and &euro;1,462 in gross wages per week, the level of subsidy is &euro;203.  For every qualifying employee paid between &euro;151.50 and &euro;202.99 in gross wages per week, the subsidy is &euro;151.50.  No subsidy is paid for employees paid less than &euro;151.50 gross per week or more than &euro;1,462 gross per week.  Payment of the EWSS will be made following receipt of the regular monthly payroll return to Revenue which is due on the 14<sup>th</sup>of the month following payment of the emoluments. The intention is that payments in respect of September will be made in mid-October.</p><p>Revenue has confirmed that the business registered for the EWSS on 27 August 2020. If it has concerns or requires any specific advice regarding the EWSS registration process or the eligibility requirements, it should contact Revenue&rsquo;s National Employer Helpline at the telephone number 01-7383638. The company may also be eligible for a &lsquo;sweepback&rsquo; payment of EWSS for July and August 2020 in respect of new hires or seasonal workers that were not previously included in the TWSS.

Where an individual or jointly assessed tax-payer has insufficient income tax liability to fully benefit from the measure, they may still avail of the relief against their USC contributions.</p>  <p>  Revenue have advised me that registrations can continue to be made in respect of qualifying service providers both before and during lifetime of the scheme. F&aacute;ilte Ireland is marketing the scheme and has been involved in sectoral/industry marketing and marketing to the public.  That marketing included highlighting the requirement to register with Revenue and the ease in so doing.  The marketing campaign was also supported by F&aacute;ilte Ireland sending out marketing content, logos, etc. to registered businesses to assist them in publicising their participation in the incentive scheme.</p>  <p>  Details of the qualifying service providers are published on the Revenue website.  For the ease of citizens searching for Stay and Spend service providers, the listing can be searched by County and by type of service.  As of 24 September 2020, there were 1,375 service providers listed on the website across the 26 Counties. </p></reply>

The industry in Ireland is going to become deeper and more diverse. My Department has been working with other relevant Departments and state agencies, such as the IDA, to fully capture any opportunities for inward investment that emerge through promoting Ireland as a committed English-speaking member of the EU with unfettered access to the EU Single Market, our continued access to EU talent and that of the Common Travel Area, in addition to our pro-business environment underpinned by a strong, fully-independent financial services regulator in the Central Bank of Ireland.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank of Ireland has been focused on the impact of Brexit on financial stability, for which it has statutory responsibility, since before the UK referendum. It is working closely with financial services firms to ensure that they have contingency plans in place for the end of the transition period on 31 December, and that they are adequately prepared to cope with the possible effects of Brexit, with as little disruption for consumers, investors and markets as possible. On the basis of its work and engagement across the sector, the Central Bank has been able to assure me that, while some level of market disruption is inevitable, the financial system as a whole should be resilient enough to withstand a hard Brexit and that the most material &lsquo;cliff edge&rsquo; financial stability risks arising from Brexit have been largely mitigated.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, my Department recently worked with the ESRI on an examination of the sectoral overlap of COVID-19 and Brexit shocks, which found that there is limited overlap in the sectors exposed to the different shocks, and limited connection between the sectors exposed to each shock. In this regard, exposures to Brexit in the area of financial services should not be magnified by additional exposure to Covid-19.</p>  <p>  The 2020 Brexit Bill includes a number of measures which will minimise disruption. This includes measures in relation to settlement finality, and to enable UK and Gibraltar insurance undertakings and intermediaries to continue to fulfil contractual obligations to their Irish customers following the end of the transition period.</p>  <p>  On Tuesday 22 September the milestone of 100 days left until the end of the transition period passed.  Regardless of the outcome of the negotiations between the EU and the UK on the future relationship, the UK will not have the same access to the EU&rsquo;s Single Market for financial services that it enjoys today. This will mean change. The Brexit Readiness Action Plan, published by the Government on 9 September, clearly sets out that firms in the financial services sector should finalise their readiness and contingency plans and take necessary actions in accordance with the relevant European Commission guidance. In addition, the Central Bank website contains FAQs on Brexit which are targeted at both financial services firms and consumers. My Department will continue to work closely with the Central Bank of Ireland and the NTMA to monitor the situation as we get closer to the end of transition, and to identify any emerging risks.</p></reply>

The main finding of the analysis is that the overlap of the sectors exposed to the different shocks is found to be limited. The sectors most exposed to both the COVID-19 and no deal Brexit shocks appear to be distinct and relatively unconnected. Having assessed the impact of no deal Brexit and COVID-19 on 57 sectors of the economy, no sector was found to be severely exposed to both shocks. The research also examines interlinkages between the exposed sectors in terms of domestic supply chains. It found that sectors that are severely affected by COVID-19 typically sell a greater share of their output to sectors that are likely to be relatively unaffected by Brexit and vice versa. This implies relatively limited exposure of producers to their customers experiencing one of the shocks while they experience the other shock. Overall, the analysis suggests that while a combined shock from a no deal Brexit and COVID-19 results in a wider range of sectors exposed to risk, the impacts of each shock to the overall economy are not magnified by spill-overs between the two effects. However, it is important to note that as the analysis was conducted at the sectoral level, the impacts may vary at a firm level with some firms possibly facing a double shock from both COVID-19 and a no deal Brexit. Moreover, it is likely that the capacity of businesses and households to manage a second economic shock will be more limited. My Department will publish updated macroeconomic forecasts as part of Budget 2021 which will take account of the impact of both COVID-19 and a no deal Brexit on the economy. </p>  <p>  We face these challenges from a position of strength, including running a budget surplus last year.  The Government's responsible economic management has allowed us to direct an unprecedented level of resources to addressing these challenges.  Further targeted measures to support businesses and affected sectors prepare and adapt will be considered in the context of Budget 2021 which will be based on the assumption of a disorderly Brexit. </p></reply>

There are also three horizontal priorities which apply across the four pillars: regionalisation, sustainable finance, and workplace diversity.  The vision of this strategy is for Ireland to be a top-tier location of choice for specialist international financial services and to enhance and protect our future competitiveness. The employment target for the Strategy is to reach 50,000 people in direct employment in the sector by 2025. According to the enterprise agencies, at the end of 2019, approximately 47,000 jobs are in international financial services, this is an increase of approximately 11,500 net new jobs in the five years since 2015.</p>  <p>  The Ireland for Finance strategy is the successor to the IFS2020 strategy and a succession of Government strategies for the development of the international financial services strategy in Ireland.  It is important to note that the IFS2020 Strategy had been in place long before the UK decision to leave the EU. The Ireland for Finance strategy provides a clear roadmap to maximise any opportunities that might arise.</p>  <p>  I&rsquo;m pleased to report that the Ireland for Finance strategy was included in the Programme for Government and we expect to bring an updated Ireland for Finance Action Plan 2020 to Government for approval and publication in the next few weeks.  Stakeholders have been engaging on action measures in the draft Plan throughout 2020.</p>  <p>  Minister of State Fleming and our officials have also started work on Ireland for Finance Action Plan 2021. All representative bodies and key stakeholders have been invited to return their proposals for action measures for 2021. The Ireland for Finance strategy and the Action Plan for 2021 will be informed by EU developments and the important work that the Ireland for Finance team have been carrying out with the European Commission on their consultations on Fintech and Sustainable Finance.</p>  <p>  The 2021 Plan will also consider what measures may assist the national recovery, minimise Covid 19 impacts, and increase preparedness for Brexit. We believe that this 2021 Plan should be the focus of our energies in this regard and would be advocating that it would be brought to Government after it is finalised at the Joint Committee meeting in Q4 of this year for publication early in 2021.</p>  <p>   Since the Brexit referendum in UK, we can point to the success of Barclays and Bank of America Merrill Lynch in banking plus the many investment firms who have chosen Ireland as their European base such as Legal and General and Aberdeen Standard. Three of the largest market infrastructure players in their respective markets have made Ireland their post Brexit location for their European business, namely Refinitiv, Equilend and DTCC. Marine insurers The Standard Club, and North P&amp;I Club are also establishing operations here.</p>  <p>  Kroll/KBRA became the first ratings agency to announce that their EU HQ location would be in Dublin and this was followed by S&amp;P&rsquo;s announcement in December 2017 that Dublin would become their EMEA HQ.</p>  <p>  The Government and the state agencies, such as IDA, continue to work to fully capture any opportunities for inward investment that emerge through promoting Ireland as a committed English-speaking member of the EU with unfettered access to the EU Single Market, our continued access to EU talent and that of the Common Travel Area, in addition to our pro-business environment underpinned by a strong, fully-independent financial services regulator in the Central Bank of Ireland.</p>  <p>  The character and composition of Ireland&rsquo;s international financial services sector is going to fundamentally change in a number of ways as a result of the extensive financial services investments won in recent years, including Brexit relocations and the pipeline of future projects. The industry in Ireland is going to become deeper and more diverse. </p>  <p>  The real impact of Brexit for the industry in Ireland may not materialise for some years. At present, firms are establishing the foundations of a new or significantly expanded presence in Ireland, while simultaneously meeting regulatory requirements, reconfiguring their overall EU business, and monitoring the process of the UK exit from the EU. When this phase is complete, they will then begin to consider future plans and ways in which to leverage and develop their new Irish entities. The future conversations with firms will be around back, middle and front office activities, product range and distribution, service offering, digital transformation, innovation and optimisation. </p></reply>

This estimate is based on trends seen to date during the year, including the fall in consumption due to COVID-19 restrictions. </p>  <p>  With regard to carbon tax receipts over the period 2021 to 2025, this will depend on a number of factors, such as changes in the world price of crude oil, exchange rate movements, general economic performance, changes in consumer behaviour arising from increases to the carbon tax, the uptake in cleaner technologies for transportation and heating purposes, potential changes to EU legislation which are directed at reducing or dis- incentivising fossil fuel consumption, and indeed several other considerations including any enduring Covid impacts.</p>  <p>  Based on the 2019 tax base,  where the tax was applied to a volume of fossil fuels which in total when combusted releases approximately 21 million tonnes of carbon dioxide, the full year receipts from a tax rate of &euro;26 per tonne CO2 are of the order of &euro;550 million (VAT exclusive).</p></reply>

It and the Industry Advisory Committee meet jointly as the Ireland for Finance Joint Committee each quarter.</p><p>Minister of State Sean Fleming TD at the Department of Finance chairs the public sector High Level Implementation Committee, which consists of senior officials in the Departments of the Taoiseach, of Finance, of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, of Education and Skills, and of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and the CEOs of Enterprise Ireland and the IDA. The High Level Implementation Committee provides strategic leadership to continue the development of the sector and ensures coordinated, timely and effective implementation of the strategy.</p><p>The Industry Advisory Committee consists of executives from Irish and international firms representing all sub-sectors in the international financial services sector. The Industry Advisory Committee supports the High Level Implementation Committee in implementing the strategy and in monitoring and reporting on progress.  </p><p>A list of members of the public sector High-Level Implementation Committee and the Industry Advisory Committee who meet together as the Joint Committee is set out below: </p><p><b>Current members of the High-Level Implementation Committee (HLIC)</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Name </th>       <th>Role </th>       <th>Organisation </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Se&aacute;n Fleming TD </td>       <td>Minister of State (chair) </td>       <td>D/Finance </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Martin Fraser </td>       <td>Secretary General </td>       <td>D/Taoiseach </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Orlaigh Quinn </td>       <td>Secretary General </td>       <td>D/Enterprise, Trade and Employment </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Jim Breslin</td>       <td>Secretary General </td>       <td>D/Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Niall Burgess </td>       <td>Secretary General </td>       <td>D/Foreign Affairs </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Michael McGrath </td>       <td>Assistant Secretary General </td>       <td>Financial Services Division D/Finance</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Julie Sinnamon </td>       <td>CEO </td>       <td>Enterprise Ireland </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Martin Shanahan </td>       <td>CEO </td>       <td>IDA Ireland </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Karen Cullen </td>       <td>Secretary to HLIC </td>       <td>Head, International Financial Services Unit D/Finance </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p><b>Current Members of the Industry Advisory Committee (IAC):</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Name </th>       <th>Firm </th>       <th>Nominated By </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Deirdre O'Connor </td>       <td>International Member</td>       <td>(public competitive process)</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Ruth McCarthy </td>       <td>Fexco Corporate Payments </td>       <td>Enterprise Ireland </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Aidan Holton </td>       <td>SCOR RE </td>       <td>Insurance Ireland </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Declan Lynch </td>       <td>Elavon Financial Services </td>       <td>Banking &amp;amp; Payments Federation Ireland/Fintech and Payments Association of Ireland </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Derek Kehoe </td>       <td>BNP Paribas Group </td>       <td>Banking &amp;amp; Payments Federation Ireland/Federation of   International Banks in Ireland</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Joe Duffy </td>       <td>BNY Mellon </td>       <td>Financial Services Ireland </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cecilia Ronan</td>       <td>Citi </td>       <td>Financial Services Ireland </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Ann Prendergast (temporary   replacement for Victoria Brown of Aberdeen Standard Investments)</td>       <td>State Street </td>       <td>Irish Association of Investment Managers </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Olwyn Alexander </td>       <td>PwC </td>       <td>Irish Funds </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Tadhg Young </td>       <td>State Street </td>       <td>Irish Funds </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>David Swan </td>       <td>SMBC Aviation Capital </td>       <td>Aircraft Leasing Ireland </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Teresa O'Flynn </td>       <td>BlackRock </td>       <td>Sustainable finance rep </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Gary Conroy </td>       <td>TransferMate Global Payments </td>       <td>Enterprise Ireland </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Andrea Reynolds  </td>       <td>Swoop Funding </td>       <td>Enterprise Ireland </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Barrie O'Connell </td>       <td>KPMG </td>       <td>Chartered Accountants Ireland </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Maurice Crowley </td>       <td>Banking &amp;amp; Payments Federation Ireland (Secretariat) </td>       <td>IAC Secretariat (Banking &amp;amp; Payments Federation Ireland) </td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

The Joint Committee consists of two committees which have continued into the Ireland for Finance strategy, the public service High Level Implementation Committee (HLIC) and the Industry Advisory Committee (IAC). The Chair of the Joint Committee is the Minister of State in the Department of Finance. Further details have been provided on this change in PQ REF 27347/20. </p>  <p>  Since the advent of the Covid-19 pandemic earlier this year, the Ireland for Finance Joint Committee held a meeting in May 2020. At this meeting, discussions were held around the resilience of the international financial services sector and how the public and private stakeholders had responded to Covid-19. </p>  <p>  It is understood from stakeholder feedback that the early signs are that the IFS sector has been fairly resilient to the impact of Covid-19 but the true impact won&rsquo;t be clear until at least the end of the year.</p>  <p>  With the onset of the pandemic, the enterprise agencies of IDA and Enterprise Ireland have engaged in an extensive, country-wide client outreach programme to offer support to businesses during this difficult period. This involved virtual bilateral engagements with companies, as well as virtual group meetings to share experiences around working safely and effectively during the pandemic and to discuss best practice with regard to returning to the office. It was important that the IFS sector was included as an &lsquo;essential service&rsquo; early on and the transition to working from home went relatively seamlessly for most companies.</p>  <p>  Having said that, FDI is not immune to Covid-19, and IDA are dealing with supply and demand shocks.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland has been working on connecting companies to financial supports is part of their stabilisation process. EI&rsquo;s overseas offices have been offering guidance on the different markets and how things are shifting.</p>  <p>  As work gets underway to develop Action Plan 2021, there will be engagment with the public and private stakeholders on the Joint Committee to consider what measures may assist the national recovery and minimise Covid 19 impacts.</p>  <p>The minutes of the public sector High-level Implementation Committee and the Joint Committee meetings are published on the Department of Finance website once agreed by the Joint Committee members at their next meeting on Tuesday, 29th   September. </p></reply>

Ulster Bank is also important in terms of providing competition in the Irish retail banking market. </p>  <p>  The Bank will also have to keep the Central Bank of Ireland fully informed and comply with its requirements in its decision making process. The Deputy should note that the Central Bank's consumer protection framework for all bank customers is comprehensive and covers a very wide range of situations.  However, I must reiterate that I have no role in any review undertaken by a commercial entity and I cannot comment or speculate on such a process because it would be inappropriate and I have no basis to do so.  My officials will continue to monitor developments.</p></reply>

It is my full expectation this will be positive for Irish consumers. For example, amongst other things, the Act obliges insurers to engage meaningfully with consumers when a claim has been submitted; places a limit the amount of a claim settlement offer that an insurer can retain until repairs have been completed, and restricts the circumstances in which insurers can repudiate the contract on materially unrelated grounds.</p>  <p>While the majority of the Act is now law, I have made the decision that sections 8, 9, 12, 14(1)-(5) will come into effect on the 1st   September 2021. It is important to note that significant systems changes are required by the industry before the related provisions could go live. Accordingly, the sections being commenced next year broadly relate to insurers' obligations to provide more detailed information when signing consumers up to a contract (Section 8), and providing greater consumer transparency about their  claim and premium history at renewal (Section 12). Section 9 and 14(1)-(5) are intrinsically linked to the information requirements set out in section 8 and therefore also require a longer commencement period. All of these significant new contract and renewal requirements will require insurers to upgrade their systems, which require time to implement because of the technical nature and scale of what will be required.</p>  <p>  Separately, I will consider the commencement of Section 18 when a specific technical legal point has been resolved.</p>  <p>  In conclusion my decision to implement the Act in this manner is based on my considered  judgement which recognises the significant impact some aspects of this Act has on insurers&rsquo; operations, whilst at the same time proceeding with the wider reforms this Act provides. This I believe is the most appropriate way forward for industry and consumers alike in these circumstances. </p></reply>

Difficult discussions took place over four days, but the Government welcomes this agreement. This is a fair and balanced outcome<b></b>and demonstrates that Europe can work collectively to deal with this once-in-a-generation crisis. Council conclusions set out the leaders&rsquo; agreement for the European Commission to borrow &euro;750 billion, supporting Member States with &euro;390 billion in grants and &euro;360 billion in loans. Agreement was also reached on a new MFF from 2021 &ndash; 2027, totalling &euro;1.074 trillion, which will support rural and regional development, and the transformation of our economies in line with the climate transition, research and development, and digital agendas.</p><p>As part of the final agreement reached, leaders also agreed on the setting up of a new special Brexit Adjustment Reserve of &euro;5 billion. This Reserve will help to counter the unforeseen and adverse consequences in Member States and sectors that are worst affected by Brexit. Leaders invited the European Commission to present a proposal on the Brexit Adjustment Reserve by November 2020. </p><p>We await publication of the European Commission's proposal including their proposal for allocating the funds. Thus, I am not in a position to provide details on how much Ireland may be able to draw down from the Reserve in 2021 or in the years after or indeed on the way in which funds may be allocated across sectors and measures. However, I can assure the Deputy that I am aware of the importance which this Reserve is likely to have for Ireland. I can also assure the Deputy that the Government will continue to communicate with the European Commission and other Member States the needs arising from our unique situation in relation to Brexit, in order to ensure that Ireland, as the Member State likely to be the hardest hit by Brexit, receives its fair share of the Brexit Adjustment Reserve.</p></reply>

This report has a chapter focused on the needs in the Northern Western region. This chapter was included in the report in recognition of the change in the region's status under the European Commission's methodology to a region in transition, and the unique challenges faced in the region. </p>  <p>The Northern and Western Regional Assembly and the other two Regional Assemblies are also part of a working group which launched a consultation process to inform the selection of priorities for the use of EU cohesion funding for the next period.  As part of this consultation a webinar was held on the 28th of July, breakout sessions were organised on a regional basis, and this included a focus on the main priorities of the individual Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies. The working group is currently preparing a report, the primary purpose of which is to present the findings and analysis from the public consultation submissions, including the qualitative messages from the national workshop event conducted on 28th   July. This report, along with the Needs Analysis, adopted by the PPSG in July, will inform the ERDF programming for 2021 &ndash; 2027.</p></reply>

The focus of the review is on improving the delivery of construction projects in terms of quality, timely delivery and cost outcomes.  </p><p>The OGP has developed a high-level strategy with the GCCC to guide the implementation which will be addressed primarily through the progressive refinement and enhancement of the CWMF.  The following objectives summarise the strategy:</p><p>The CWMF will enable the delivery of sustainable assets under the NDP by:</p><p>- Developing procurement and contracting strategies that prioritise quality solutions and support the most efficient means of delivery;</p><p>- Embedding appropriate risk management measures within the project development, procurement and construction stages;</p><p>- Deploying digital solutions throughout the project delivery stages.</p><p>The review will deliver significant changes to the CWMF over the coming years. The OGP has prepared a methodology for extensive structured engagement, both with industry stakeholders, and with the public bodies charged with the delivery of public works projects to inform the implementation of the strategy. It is planned to publish a series of position papers on a broad range of issues to foster debate and engagement on specific issues such as:</p><p>- price variation;</p><p>- risk management;</p><p>- creating a better quality: price balance in the award of contracts;</p><p>- adoption of Building Information Modelling (BIM) on public works projects;</p><p>- liability, indemnity and insurance requirements;</p><p>- performance evaluation;</p><p>- encouraging collaborative working.</p><p>Risk and quality information are two aspects that will inform any amendments that may be introduced to the CWMF.  Risk is to be brought front and centre with regards to the decisions that are to be taken during a project&rsquo;s development.  It will be a requirement for risk to be identified at the outset and evaluated before determining how it is best addressed and, crucially, who is to manage it.  Risk weightings will be applied to projects which will translate to a contingency sum at each of a project&rsquo;s review gates.</p><p>Quality information will become a central tenet to all aspects of project delivery.  Standards will be set for information at all stages of a project&rsquo;s development.  Whilst this measure is being introduced to ensure informed decisions are made at critical points in the project&rsquo;s development it also anticipates the widespread adoption of BIM across the NDP over the coming years.</p><p>Upon conclusion of the consultation period for each issue, the GCCC will prepare a recommendation for approval at the appropriate level.  It is envisaged that the process of engagement will extend over the next 12 &ndash; 18 months, however where the GCCC&rsquo;s recommendations are accepted they may be implemented without waiting for the entire process to conclude providing it is practicable to do so.</p><p>The onset of Covid-19 impacted on the conduct of the review both in terms of engagement with stakeholders and reassignment of internal resources in order to address the impact of the shutdown and the restart phase on the NDP.</p><p>- The initial focus is on the engagement of consultancy services, which is aimed at driving better project definition, in order to provide greater certainty for all those engaged in the construction stage.  Overall improvement in project definition is required through establishing minimum standards for information at the different stages of a project&rsquo;s development.  A consultation paper was published in May 2019 setting out four measures that will improve the service provided:</p><p>1. Setting minimum standards for Project Briefs;</p><p>2. Establishing standard definitions for the scope of services required from the main consultancy appointments;</p><p>3. Linking the fee makeup to the scope of services;</p><p>4. Introducing clear reporting lines for each member of the design team with a particular focus on cost reporting.</p><p>1. Work is ongoing on the detailed implementation aspects which will be delivered by means of changes to the template tender documents, publication of new guidance material and exploring digital solutions to the presentation of 2) and 3) above.  Work on implementing the changes will commence in 2021.</p><p>- A review of the price variation mechanisms used in both the CWMF consultancy and construction contracts is currently underway with a view to publish revised contracts and guidance on price variation mechanisms early in 2021.</p><p>- BIM has the potential to transform the processes surrounding project and data management on construction projects and can drive significant efficiencies.  The OGP is currently engaged with National Standards Authority of Ireland on preparing a national annex to the international standard (ISO) for BIM implementation.  The aim is to ensure a consistent approach to its application across the public and private sectors.  An implementation plan for the adoption of BIM will be launched shortly setting out dates for a phased adoption of BIM.</p><p>- The OGP is engaging with key stakeholders on the issue of liability, indemnities and insurance and is also reviewing broader aspects of the required terms in the contracts used to engage design teams and contractors.  A number of meetings have been held in February/March with further engagement necessary before a position paper is prepared for consultation purposes.</p><p>- Engagement is ongoing in developing standard metrics for life cycle costing and life cycle analysis that can be applied to the evaluation of projects&rsquo; cost of use in service and full life cycle analysis, including the carbon impact of individual projects.  The OGP is liaising with the GCCC and the Irish Green Building Council in developing these metrics.</p><p>- The Cost Control Templates published under the CWMF are undergoing review to incorporate the International Construction Measurement Standard (ICMS).  A working group has been established and revised templates will be published in 2021. ICMS is a global standard for benchmarking and reporting of construction project cost and covers both capital and whole life costing while providing a way of presenting costs in a consistent format.</p></reply>

These figures remains a work-in-progress, with significant moving parts in relation to both revenue and expenditure still being considered in the context of the upcoming Budget 2021.  </p>  <p>  Excluding Covid-19 related expenditure, it is estimated that for core current expenditure there are pre-commitments of &euro;1.1 billion, relating to demographics &euro;0.5 billion, carryover costs of Budget 2020 measures of over &euro;0.2 billion, and approximately &euro;0.35 billion in relation to pay costs reflecting the carryover impact of the public service stability agreement.</p>  <p>  Further to this, and as announced in the July stimulus plan, capital expenditure would increase from the amount of &euro;8.16 billion for 2020 as set out in the Revised Estimates for Public Services 2020 published in December last year, to &euro;9.16 billion in 2021.    </p>  <p>  There will also be an ongoing requirement to provide funding in respect of Covid-19 with, on a no-policy change basis, expenditure required to fund the Health service, meet the carryover costs relating to already agreed measures including the July stimulus plan, the Roadmap for Reopening Schools, and the plan for return to further and higher education. In addition the macroeconomic projections that are currently being worked through will impact on the level of expenditure on income supports next year. It is estimated that there could be a cost of approximately &euro;9 billion in relation to these Covid-19 expenditure costs. </p>  <p>  Finally, Budget 2021 will also be prepared on the assumption that the trading relationship between the UK and EU will be on WTO terms in 2021. This will necessitate additional supports for the most affected sectors of the Irish economy next year. The costs associated with these supports will form an essential part of budgetary discussions and details of these costs will be set out in the 2021 Expenditure Report on Budget day.</p></reply>

Since the easing of restrictions, the consultants carried out the final elements of these environmental surveys, and the project team are now in the process of finalising this suite of documents for the confirmation process. It is anticipated that the scheme documents will be finalised and submitted to Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER) in the coming weeks.  </p>  <p>  The Scheme now requires formal confirmation to proceed from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform (MPER). This is a statutory requirement under the Arterial Drainage Acts , which now, under the recent European Union (Environmental Impact Assessment) (Arterial Drainage) Regulations 2019, also requires the MPER to carry out an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) of the proposed Scheme.  This will involve, inter alia, a formal review by MPER of the Environmental Impact Assessment Report (EIAR) prepared by the Commissioners and recently submitted (along with a Natura Impact Statement) to the MPER as part of the formal confirmation process.  </p>  <p>  In order to assist the MPER in making an informed decision to consent to the scheme, the EIA will require appropriate assessment, as required under the 2019 regulations, public consultation for a period of 30 days and a detailed technical review of the scheme by environmental consultants appointed by the MPER.  </p>  <p>  If DPER find that they are satisfied with the proposed scheme, the next stage in the process will be the construction phase. In order to expedite this timeline, the project team will prepare for construction in parallel with DPER&rsquo;s review. This will ensure that we are in a position to mobilise as soon as we are given approval to implement the flood defences for the town of Crossmolina. It is anticipated that the construction phase will take up to 24 months to complete. This may be subject to change as otherwise unforeseen issues may become apparent once the construction team are on the ground.</p>  <p>  With regard to preparing for the flood threat in winter of this year, Mayo County Council, with funding provided by the OPW, have already rolled out an Individual Property Protection project, which has provided flood gates to over 100 residents in the town of Crossmolina. Additionally, the OPW has also approved Mayo County Council&rsquo;s (MCC)&rsquo;s application for funding for a number of minor works projects in the town, and these have been put in place by Mayo County Council. Since 2016, &euro;230,000 has been approved for minor works in Crossmolina. And finally, the OPW Western Drainage Maintenance Section have carried out a number of maintenance works along the River Deel, and continue to do so in line with their maintenance plan. I understand that residents of Crossmolina will be fearful coming into the winter months, and empathise completely with their situation.</p>  <p>   The implementation of this flood relief scheme is a priority for myself and for the OPW as a whole, and we have taken all possible measures to provide a standard of protection in the interim. </p></reply>

Mayo is a privately-owned National Monument which is in the care of the Office of Public Works.   Some years ago, the building was closed to the public because of certain serious Health and Safety risks arising.   While work was underway in relation to mitigating these risks in recent years, it also became apparent that there was also a serious structural defect in the building which would require a substantial conservation project to correct.   This will be addressed by the OPW's directly-employed skilled labour force in the context of their ongoing work to preserve National Monuments in their care in the western region.   To this end, OPW is currently pursuing relevant statutory permissions to enable the project to go ahead including a Foreshore Licence Application, Natura Impact Statement and Ministerial Consent under the National Monuments Acts and is also in direct contact with Inland Fisheries Ireland.   Anticipating a works start on site this year, the building was scaffolded prior to the Covid-19 shutdown and work will progress on the project as soon as it is practicable and safe for OPW staff to do so. </p>  <p>  Clare Island Castle in Co. Mayo (reputed as another of Granuaile's Castles) is a National Monument in State Ownership standing on a prominent site at the entrance to Clare Island harbour.   The Monument is a roofless ruin and, following engagement with a local group, OPW have carried out general maintenance work to improve the appearance of the site to visitors including cleaning and removal of debris surrounding the structure and provision of new fencing and interpretative signage.   Some minor works remain to complete the landscaping at the site which will be addressed as soon as access is feasible.</p>  <p>  As both these undertakings fall within the general maintenance and conservation remit of the OPW, they will be fully funded from within the OPW's allocation for National Monuments.   Some expenditure has already obviously been incurred and it is expected that the remainder will fall into 2021.</p></reply>

A Public Exhibition of the preferred scheme is now expected to take place later this year.  This will give the community an opportunity to examine and provide formal comments and observations over a four-week period. </p>  <p>  In the interim, Cork County Council has been approved funding under the OPW&rsquo;s Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection scheme an additional &euro;187,248 in October 2018 for the provision of temporary flood defence measures including a sand bag defence structure, two non-return valves at existing drainage outfalls and pumping sumps to allow over pumping during flood events. A Part 8 planning application is currently being progressed by Cork County Council, and following approval, works will then commence. </p>  <p>  A Preliminary Invasive Alien Species Management Plan (IASMP) was prepared for the Scheme identified the presence of invasive species around or close to the works area of the FRS, including Giant Knotweed, Japanese Knotweed and Himalayan Knotweed.   Cork County Council has appointed Japanese Knotweed Ireland to undertake the planned treatment of these species in the immediate vicinity of the proposed works, and have confirmed that a second round of treatment of knotweed was completed in September 2019.A further round of treatment is to be carried out in October 2020.</p>  <p>  The flood relief scheme will be funded from within the allocated &euro;1 billion for flood risk management over the period 2018-2027. Provision for the cost of the Scheme is included in the Office of Public Works' multi annual capital allocation.</p></reply>

The Shannon CFRAM involved extensive public consultation so that local knowledge and opinions have informed its output.</p><p>The output of the CFRAM Programme was the Flood Risk Management Plans (FRMPs) that include 34 new flood relief schemes to protect towns in the Shannon River Basin District, as part of the Government&rsquo;s &euro;1bn investment in flood relief over the decade to the year 2027.  These new schemes will be subject to a public consultation process and are additional to 13 schemes already completed or under construction.  Together, these will protect 95% of properties against their significant risk from flooding.  Overall, work is now complete or underway to protect 80% of at risk properties.  Details of these schemes are available on www.floodinfo.ie.</p><p>The CFRAM Programme and the FRMPs has informed the work of the Shannon Flood Risk State Co-ordination Working Group, established by the Government in 2016 to support the CFRAM and FRMPs and to enhance the ongoing co-operation of all State Agencies involved with the River Shannon.  </p><p>On its establishment, a priority for the Group was to develop a Work Programme that was informed through public consultation days. The Programme together with local knowledge demonstrated the extensive range of activities and co-ordination by all State Agencies already underway to jointly and proactively address flood risk along the Shannon. The Group&rsquo;s Annual Work Programmes are available at www.opw.ie</p><p>The Group has taken a number of significant decisions since its establishment including:</p><p>- Targeted maintenance at a number of locations on the River Shannon.</p><p>- A study to examine the removal of constrictions resulting in lower summer water levels through the Shannon Callows, to help address the summer flooding in this area while maintaining the appropriate navigation requirements.</p><p>- A study to examine the cause, degree and rate of restriction downstream of Parteen Weir in the Lower Shannon.</p><p>- A pilot to lower the lake levels in Lough Allen to help alleviate any significant flooding that may occur.</p><p>- A preliminary assessment of the potential for strategic maintenance on the River Shannon.</p><p>In October 2019, the Group agreed to a &euro;7 million strategic programme of maintenance works and the removal of constrictions or &lsquo;pinch points&rsquo; on the bed of the River Shannon between Athlone and Meelick Weir to improve the conveyancing of the River Shannon. The decision to undertake these works was noted by the Government in December 2019.  Public consultation will be required and progression will be subject to full environmental assessment and planning permission.  Waterways Ireland has advised that it has commenced work on advancing the various interventions for these works with implementation expected to commence in 2021.</p></reply>

The Office of Public Works has been in contact with the Parks department of DCC in relation to the presentation of this area.</p>  <p>  The main parkland at the demesne immediately surrounding the monument itself is in the care of the OPW and is maintained and managed in line with OPW landscape practice across all National Historic Property sites. </p>  <p>  The parkland is managed for biodiversity and in recent years OPW has implemented a reduced mowing regime to support the natural biodiversity of the site. In line with these practices, the parkland will receive a final mow and final landscape works for the year will be completed in October of this year. This parkland area continues to be fully accessible to the public for access to walk and enjoy seven days a week from 7am to 6.45pm. This parkland has been much used during the COVID19 restrictions and is frequented on a daily basis by the local community.</p>  <p>  Separately, the OPW is in ongoing discussions with DCC to agree a possible transfer of lands surrounding the Casino, including the area identified by the Deputy, from DCC to OPW, in order to facilitate the development of a new visitor facilities on site and to reinstate a heritage landscape at Casino Marino.  As part of a strategic partnership between OPW, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, for capital investment in visitor infrastructure at heritage sites, funding has been approved for a project to improve facilities through provision of a new visitor welcome facility (including caf&eacute; and interpretive space) additional visitor car parking and improvements to the landscape. </p>  <p>  This project has significant potential to impact on the tourism attractiveness of Marino and this part of the City. The reinstatement of the heritage landscape and provision of new visitor facilities will improve accessibility to this unique and important monument. The project will also address the issues the deputy has identified by improving the wider landscape and public realm surrounding the Casino resulting in improved facilities for the local community to access and enjoy. </p></reply>

My report was submitted in June this year and highlights:</p><p>- the economic circumstances of the State,</p><p>- the budgetary outlook,</p><p>- debt,</p><p>- returns from taxation,</p><p>- BREXIT and preparedness for other economic shocks.</p><p>It concluded, on the basis of the prevailing economic and fiscal outlook, that the timetable for pay and pensions restoration up to July 2022 continued to be appropriate and necessary.</p><p>The report references the Public Service Pay and Pension Act 2017. This Act provides for the restoration of reductions made to public service pay and pensions by the FEMPI Acts 2010-2013.</p><p>In that regard, on 1st October 2020, public servants will receive a 2% pay increase. This will complete pay restoration for public servants earning up to &euro;70,000 per annum. Also on 1st October, reductions of between 5% and 8% made to certain allowances in 2010 will cease.</p><p>In addition to pay the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 provides that by end 2020, an order is made to restore,  at a date to be decided, reductions made to certain public service pensions.</p><p>Taking the above into account, very substantial progress will be made in completing the FEMPI restoration process by end 2020.</p><p>I would highlight that the elements set out above relate to the thousands of public servants who have been at the frontline in delivering key services in the current pandemic. These services are critical across health, education, justice, welfare and business support sectors to name but a few. They have ensured that this Government continues to deliver a comprehensive national response to the COVID 19 pandemic.</p></reply>

A General Government surplus of 0.4% of GDP was recorded in 2019, a balanced budget in structural terms was delivered, and debt to GDP ratio of 59%.</p>  <p>  From an expenditure perspective the initial response to the Covid-19 crisis was swift, with emergency measures introduced to support and protect households and enterprises. In total, it is estimated that additional Covid-19 related expenditure supports of approximately &euro;16 billion are to be provided this year, a significant investment that equates to 9% of GNI*. These additional expenditures would bring gross voted expenditure for 2020 to over &euro;86 billion, an increase of over &euro;19 billion or almost 30% relative to last year.</p>  <p>  In July, D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approved additional Covid-19 health expenditure in the Health Revised Estimate. This Estimate included a &euro;2 billion increase relative to the Health allocation set out in the REV published in December last year. Further resources have also been recently agreed by Government in relation to the 2020/2021 Winter Initiative and officials in my Department are actively engaging with their counterparts in the Department of Health and the HSE on the scale of additional funding that will be required over the rest of this year. </p>  <p>  The labour market has borne a significant brunt of the impact of the crisis so far. In light of this, the Government has taken significant steps to cushion, where possible, the impact on households and businesses. Taking into account expenditure on the Pandemic Unemployment Payment and the Wage Subsidy Scheme, Social Protection expenditure will be over &euro;30 billion this year, an increase of over &euro;9 billion relative to REV 2020. In addition &euro;1 &frac12; billion of Exchequer funding has been made available for liquidity measures, restart grants and commercial rates waivers to support business. Further to this, additional resources have also been made available to support the significant efforts undertaken to ensure the safe reopening of our Education systems.</p>  <p>  Looking forward, the overall Budgetary Strategy for 2021 will focus on prioritising crisis management measures to address the challenges posed by Covid-19 and Brexit while preserving and maintaining existing levels of service within core expenditure programmes. Work is ongoing in assessing the impact of Covid-19 costs in 2021 and further details will be set out in the 2021 Expenditure Report. </p>  <p>  The Government will need to continue to run a deficit next year to address the challenges posed by Covid-19 and Brexit. The State will borrow to cover this deficit. We are in a position to borrow this money because of the actions of the European Central Bank and the credibility of our public finances. Taking a longer-term view, it is important that, as the economy returns to growth and employment is restored, the deficit is reduced year-on-year to underpin the sustainability of the public finances and to ensure the funding for our key public services. </p>  <p>  In support of this process, the Programme for Government commits to continuing reform and improvement of the Budgetary process and proposes that each Minister will be required to produce service improvement and reform plans in conjunction with my Department, within an overall context of an enhanced focus across Government on issues of well-being.  In implementing this reform, my Department will look to build on the budgetary reforms already in place and the significant work on public service reform already completed.</p>  <p>  Adopting this approach will ensure stronger dialogue in this House on key elements of budgetary policy and will help to facilitate the continued development of budgetary decisions, consistent with the maintenance of stable public finances.</p></reply>

I expect to be in a position to set out next steps in this regard once the important work of Budget 2021 has been completed.</p></reply>

The aim of these rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime that delivers best value for money.</p>  <p>  The Office of Government Procurement (OGP) has responsibility for the National Public Procurement Policy Framework which sets the overarching policy framework for public procurement in Ireland.  This framework enables a more consistent approach to public procurement across the public sector.</p>  <p>  The OGP facilitates a smooth flow of procurement activity by providing procurement solutions, advice, guidance and systems for public bodies, promoting good practice and proactive engagement with our sourcing partners in the Health, Education, Defence and Local Government Sectors through the Procurement Executive. </p>  <p>  The OGP&rsquo;s Public Procurement Guidelines for Goods and Services provide a comprehensive interpretation of the public procurement directives designed to improve consistency and promote best practice in the application of the public procurement rules.

Individual Accounting Officers are responsible for ensuring that their public procurement functions are discharged in line with the standard accounting and procurement rules and procedures and are publicly accountable for expenditure incurred. Individual contracting authorities are responsible for establishing arrangements for ensuring the proper conduct of their affairs, including conformance to standards of good governance and accountability with regard to procurement. </p></reply>

Tourism and hospitality enterprises will also benefit from wider horizontal supports such as the new Employment Wage Support Scheme, liquidity and enterprise investment measures,  warehousing of tax liabilities and the extension for a further three months of the waiver of commercial rates.</p>  <p>  As part of its response to Covid-19, and to drive bookings for short breaks and holidays in Ireland in 2020, F&aacute;ilte Ireland has invested in a number of domestic holiday campaigns since June of this year.</p>  <p>  The Tourism Recovery Taskforce is currently finalising its recommendations for the ongoing survival and stabilisation of the Tourism sector.  The Taskforce is expected to publish its Final Recovery Plan in the coming weeks and I, together with my colleagues in Government, will consider its recommendations at that stage.  In the context of the Budget and the development of the National Economic Plan, the Government will review and refine existing supports, and consider any further necessary measures.</p></reply>

Organisations can apply to re-purpose up to &euro;10,000 of their grant which can be used to fund eligible costs at a 90% funding rate or up to &euro;5,000 which will not require match funding.  Repurposed funding required for the original purpose of the grant will be restored when required at a later date.</p><p>Organisations that do not hold a capital grant, can apply for funding under Stream D Cultural Capital Scheme of up to &euro;10,000.  The scheme applies for the period of the coronavirus crisis and applications can be made by organisations at any point throughout the crisis.

At that time the Government also approved the detailed drafting of the proposed Bill by the Office of the Attorney General and forwarded the General Scheme to the Joint Oireachtas Committee for Communications, Climate Action and Environment for pre-legislative scrutiny. Due to the dissolution of the D&aacute;il and Committees in January, pre-legislative scrutiny did not commence at that time. </p><p>  The enactment of the proposed Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill is a commitment in the Programme for Government. The proposed Bill will establish a multi-person Media Commission, including an Online Safety Commissioner, dissolve the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, establish regulatory frameworks for online safety and the regulation of audiovisual media services, and transpose the revised Audiovisual Media Services Directive. The regulatory framework for online safety will be overseen by the Online Safety Commissioner. The Commissioner will have the power to designate online services for regulation and to create and enforce binding online safety codes. These will seek to minimise the availability of harmful online content through oversight of the systems that online services use to deliver and moderate content. The regulator will have the power to sanction non-compliant online services, including financial sanctions.</p><p>Engagement with the Attorney General's Office is continuing on the detailed drafting of the Bill and I intend to bring proposals to Government shortly to advance this important Government priority.</p></reply>

It is available to Irish and international film production companies that are resident in the State or in an EEA State and carry on business in the State through a branch or subsidiary.   Section 481 is State Aid and requires the agreement of the European Union.</p>  <p>  The Finance Act 2018 provided for a short-term, tapered regional uplift, commencing at 5%, for productions being made in areas designated under the State aid regional guidelines. </p>  <p>  The regional uplift is phased on a tiered basis with an additional 5% available in years 1 and 2 which are 2019 and 2020.  This reduces to 3% in year 3 which is 2021 and reduces again to 2% in year 4, which is - 2022.  It will be 0% from year 5 on.  The purpose of the regional uplift is to support the development of new, local pools of talent in areas outside the current main production hubs and to support the geographic spread of the audio-visual sector.   </p>  <p>  In considering whether the regional film development uplift applies, the following factors are relevant - </p>  <p>  - whether the production of the film is substantially undertaken in an assisted region; </p>  <p>  - whether there is limited availability of individuals with suitable experience or training who habitually reside within a 45 kilometre radius of the place of production to provide services, and </p>  <p>  - in respect of the areas of expertise where there is limited availability, the company provides training for individuals that habitually reside within that 45 kilometre radius. </p>  <p>  The regions availing of the uplift are limited to areas in Ireland sanctioned to receive regional aid under the EU regional aid guidelines.  The EU Regional Aid Guidelines allow each Member State to provide enhanced rates of State aid in the least economically developed areas of each country. This enables the State to grant State aid, at enhanced rates, to businesses in order to support new investment and new employment in productive projects in Ireland's most disadvantaged regions.  The least economically developed area of Ireland does not include County Cork and for this reason, the Regional Film Development Uplift cannot be extended to Cork.</p></reply>

The National Development Plan has provided a capital allocation of at least &euro;100m over the period to 2027 for the Fund. The aim of the fund is to provide support for larger sports facilities where the Exchequer investment is greater than the maximum amount (&euro;300,000) available under the Sports Capital Programme (SCP). </p>  <p>  Provisional grants totalling &euro;82.5m were announced in January of this year. The evaluation procedures and guidelines for the LSSIF provide that once provisional allocations are announced, the successful projects will undergo a further process of due diligence. This process includes a further review of projects including economic appraisals and feasibility studies as appropriate to comply with the Public Spending Code. This work is continuing and the priority in the short term is on advancing the projects allocated funding in January. While it is not proposed to open the fund for new applications at present, it is planned to review progress on existing grants in 2021 when the question of whether or not it would be appropriate to seek new applications will be considered.</p></reply>

In this context, the Deputy will understand the 2021 allocation for Irish Language and Gaeltacht organisations, including &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, is currently being considered as part of this process.  </p>  <p>  My Department continues to increase funding to support the Irish Language as resources allow.  The Revised Estimates Volumes for the Public Service, published earlier this year by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, outlines total funding of &euro;58m for the Irish Language, the Gaeltacht and the Islands included in Programme C of my Department's Vote for 2020. This significant exchequer allocation represents an increase on the &euro;55.5m allocation in 2019.</p>  <p>  Since then, in light of the impact of Covid-19 on our society and economy, the Government has provided additional funding and supports to the Department and the Irish language and Gaeltacht sector, through targeted national and sectoral measures.</p>  <p>  For example, the July Jobs Stimulus package includes a significant additional capital allocation of &euro;8m for &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta in order to enable it to undertake essential upgrades to existing building stock and water treatment facilities, thereby facilitating the marketing of currently dormant factory spaces for modern job-creation projects. </p>  <p>  This will create 40-50 new construction jobs across Gaeltacht communities in the short-term while the re-developed building stock will support the longer-term creation of 320 new jobs in the Gaeltacht, in &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta client-companies. </p>  <p>  Coupled with the additional funding of &euro;250,000 being provided to Eala&iacute;n na Gaeltachta in support of the traditional arts in school settings and the overarching language planning process in Gaeltacht regions, this specific additional investment will further assist in underpinning the language in Gaeltacht regions.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government acknowledges the importance of the Irish language as the first language of the State, as a living language and as a vital component of the heritage of this island, and I will be underlining this commitment in all discussions in relation to policy and funding to support the Irish language.</p></reply>

The archaeological recommendations issued by the National Monuments Service, as statutory consultee under the Planning Acts, in relation to the proposed development would, of course, have taken full account of the presence of those monuments. It would also have had due regard to the location and context of the site, which is directly adjacent to existing housing estates extending eastwards from the town in question.

The scale of housing needed now, following the economic downturn and consequential curtailment of supply, means that we must deploy multiple programmes, using a blend of capital and current funding, to meet the immediate, mid-term and long-term needs of households.</p>  <p>  Next year, the target is to deliver over 12,000 long-term housing supports for families and individuals. This will include building by local authorities on local authority land, local authorities working with developers to provide housing where demand is high and land is neither available or active, approved housing bodies delivering new build at scale, public private partnerships delivering social homes, Part V, acquisitions and leasing.</p>  <p>  Since 2013, the capital investment in housing has increased from just under &euro;300m to the over &euro;1.5bn available in 2020. By using blended delivery, we maximise the output for that investment.</p></reply>

This included sixteen new builds and ten upgrade/refurbishment projects. </p>  <p>  A new fire station at Crossmolina is provided for in this Capital Programme. Mayo County Council has indicated that Crossmolina is their number one fire station priority. The Council submitted an outline design and cost plan for a new station to my Department in December 2019. The Council completed a tender process in August 2020, and submitted the tender report and cost plan to my Department two weeks ago. This is currently under review and my Department will continue to work with Mayo County Council to progress this project.  </p>  <p>  In order to maximise the available Capital Programme funding, my Department re-assesses the status of projects in the Programme on an annual basis, and some flexibility is normally available to advance projects that are ready and that offer best value-for-money taking account of the state of readiness of projects more generally. </p>  <p>  A new capital programme for the period 2021-2025 is currently being finalised. Following extensive engagement with fire authorities a number of proposals for station works etc. have been received. The proposals will be evaluated and prioritised on the basis of the:</p>  <p>  - Area Risk Categorisation of the fire station (population, fire risks, etc.)</p>  <p>  - Established Health and Safety needs and</p>  <p>  - State of development of the project (is site acquired, etc.?) </p>  <p>   In recognition of the current economic situation faced by the State as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the speed and extent to which proposed expenditure can stimulate local economies will also be a key consideration in the first few years of the new programme.</p>  <p>  I hope to be in a position to make an announcement regarding this new programme in the near future, and my Department will continue to work with Mayo County Council to progress the Crossmolina fire station project.</p></reply>

The adaptation of existing as well as the design of new buildings will, of course, be critical to meet the targets set by the Climate Action Plan 2019. </p>  <p>  My Department, supported by a steering committee including officials from the Office of Public Works, the Department of Education and Skills, the Health Service Executive, the City and County Architects Association, the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland, the Arts Council, the Heritage Council, the schools of architecture and the Irish Architecture Foundation, recently undertook a public consultation process allowing the opportunity for all communities, stakeholders and citizens to have their say on the proposed new Policy. </p>  <p>  The consultation phase considered the main ways in which architecture and our built environment affect society, our health and well-being and our ability to prosper. These include climate adaptation and mitigation and sustainable development, the benefits for everyone of obtaining high quality in the built environment, the protection and reuse of our built heritage, ways we can demonstrate built environment leadership and the need to foster education about our built environment. We invited online and written submissions, and social media engagement, alongside a series of workshops and meetings, including virtual workshops in line with public health restrictions, to allow wide-ranging involvement in the drafting of the new policy, as well as consideration of the effect of Covid-19 on our built environment. </p>  <p>  It is my intention that a new National Policy on Architecture will play an integral part in implementing our vision for the future, providing policy actions that will encourage best quality in researching, understanding, managing, enhancing and reusing our existing built environment assets as well as delivering sustainable new places and spaces. </p>  <p>  The Policy will be informed by the feedback from the consultation phase, with over 150 submissions received, as well as by a review of the previous policy by the Office of Public Works and our involvement in a European Commission working group on high quality architecture and built environment. The analysis of the consultation phase is currently underway with a report due in the next month or so which will help shape a draft policy. </p>  <p>  I will, of course, be happy to consult with the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage at the earliest opportunity in relation to the Policy.</p></reply>

Development plans are generally drafted and adopted in accordance with national policies and objectives, as well as statutory planning guidelines which are current at the time of their adoption. </p>  <p>  However, there can be instances where new Government policies and objectives are adopted after the adoption of a development plan - for example, by way of "specific planning policy requirements" included in new or updated planning guidelines issued by the Minister - thereby superseding specific local policies in the development plan, and which consequently the Board is required to have regard to in the determination of planning appeals or applications before it. This can result in the Board attaching greater significance to new and updated Government policy than to a development plan objective that may have been adopted a number of years ago, thereby resulting in the contravening of specific aspects of the development plan by the Board in making its determination on a planning appeal or application.</p></reply>

Accordingly, under existing arrangements, a household that applies, for example, to Dublin City Council can, if qualified for support and should they choose to do so, be entered on the waiting list of three of the four local authorities in Dublin city and county. </p>  <p>  All four Dublin authorities have provisions in their allocation schemes for inter authority/mutual transfers for sitting tenants whereby the authority is prepared to accommodate applications for inter authority/mutual transfers provided certain criteria are met. All four Dublin authorities also make provision in their allocation schemes for households wishing to move to a home more suitable to their household needs. However, decisions on all applications are entirely a matter for the local authority concerned. </p>  <p>  Recipients of the Housing Assistance Payment can also move between local authorities in Dublin. Guidelines on inter-authority movement were introduced in 2017 to allow for local authorities to facilitate movement of HAP households from one local authority area to another in cases where a HAP tenant, currently on a local authority waiting list, wishes to access rented accommodation with HAP support in another local authority area.</p></reply>

The Code is overseen by an interim Regulatory Committee supported by a Regulation Office which is based in the Housing Agency.</p>  <p>  The Regulation Office&rsquo;s Governance Standard (Principle 4) sets out that &ldquo;No individual should be elected or appointed as a director or trustee of an organisation, or retain such a position, where he or she has any direct material interest of significance in relation to the income or any other benefit derived from any commercial contract or other arrangements for the construction of houses for the approved housing body, or in the supply of goods and services to the approved housing body&rdquo;. </p>  <p>  Under the voluntary framework, the use of the word &ldquo;should&rdquo; represents recommended best practice. Therefore, this does not represent a requirement of the Standard and is not based on a legal, statutory, or regulatory requirement. </p>  <p>  In December 2019, the Housing (Regulation of Approved Housing Bodies) Act 2019 was signed in to law. This Act provides for, amongst other things, the establishment of a Regulator to oversee the effective governance, financial management and performance of voluntary and co-operative housing bodies. Section 37 of the Act provides for the drafting and adoption of standards for AHBs. </p>  <p>  The Regulator will publish draft standards on its website and must consider any representations made by any persons before finalising these standards and submitting them for Ministerial approval. The standards will cover issues of governance, financial management and reporting, property and asset management and tenancy management. </p>  <p>  The Act sets out that the governance standard may, in particular, provide for the membership and governance structure of an AHB, the procedures for decision making, the management of conflicts of interest and a code of conduct for the board of an AHB.</p>  <p>  Separately, credit union policies are a matter for the Minister for Finance.

To achieve that, we are developing a Cost Rental model for delivery of housing that creates affordability for tenants and a sustainable model for construction and management of homes. Cost Rental is housing where the rents charged cover the cost of delivering, managing, and maintaining the homes only. Cost Rental is not intended to overlap with or replace traditional social housing for low-income households.  </p>  <p>  Work to outline the consistent and sustainable delivery of Cost Rental at scale is underway through an inter-departmental multi-agency Cost Rental Working Group, and is being assisted by an external research project sponsored by the European Investment Bank (EIB) on behalf of my Department. Furthermore, three initial Cost Rental projects are already being progressed, including 50 units at Enniskerry Road in Stepaside, that is currently under construction, while sites at Emmet Road, Inchicore (the former St Michael&rsquo;s Estate) and Shanganagh Castle, Shankill, are at the design phase.  </p>  <p>  In terms of affordable housing more generally, I will outline my detailed plans in the near future, taking account of progress to date under the SSF, experience from these Cost Rental pilots, a number of other measures, as well as the input of key delivery partners.</p></reply>

Further orders were signed on 16 April 2020 and 9 May 2020, the last of which expired on 23 May 2020. The three Orders had the combined effect of extending the relevant planning periods and timelines, including the duration of planning permissions, by an aggregate of 56 days/8 weeks during the time period in which they had effect.</p>  <p>  On 15 September 2020, the Government published its latest response to managing Covid-19 - Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for living with Covid-19.  While I don't envisage any further actions will be required for the planning system in the context of this framework at this time, I continue to keep this matter under review.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-09-29a.1004.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020092900082#WRS05700"><p>As Minister with policy and legislative responsibility for fire safety and the provision of fire services by local authorities, my primary concern, as set out in the Fire Services Acts 1981 and 2003, is that local authority provided fire services are meeting their statutory obligations in respect of provision of fire services and fire safety.</p>  <p>  Fire services are provided in Ireland by local authorities in accordance with the provisions of the Fire Services Acts, 1981 and 2003. </p>  <p>  The most recent review of fire services in Ireland resulted in the publication of &ldquo;Keeping Communities Safe - A Framework for Fire Safety in Ireland&rdquo; (KCS) in 2013. This was the report on the outcome of a wide-ranging review of fire services in Ireland which was undertaken in 2011/2012, and was endorsed as national policy in early 2013. It concluded that local authorities were best positioned to continue to provide fire services in Ireland. </p>  <p>  However, fire authorities do cooperate with each other as and when required and on a regular basis on a number of matters. For example, they are enabled by the Fire Services Act, 1981 and 2003 to assist each other and provide support on a &lsquo;mutual-assistance&rsquo; basis, and this is the expected norm for fire services. The Chief Fire Officer for the area where a large scale incident is located will typically engage neighbouring services when required, on the basis of agreed pre-planned arrangements. </p>  <p>  At national level, a National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management (NDFEM) was created within my Department in 2009 to give central direction and leadership for the fire and emergency management services. The 2009 arrangements put in place a management structure at central government level with a clear mandate and visibility to develop national policy and to drive consistent achievement of quality fire services by local authorities. Under the system, responsibility for the day-to-day operation of fire services remains with the local authorities. However, the National Directorate&rsquo;s mandate includes developing national policies and national standards, and supporting and overseeing their implementation at local level.</p>  <p>  The NDFEM administers the Fire Services Central Training Programme supplements training arranged by fire authorities. It represents an efficient service delivery model by offering train-the-trainer courses on a regional basis, therefore ensuring consistency of approach throughout the service.</p>  <p>  The KCS policy document sets out the overall approach, the methods and the techniques to achieve the objective of keeping communities safe from fire and, for the first time, set out national norms, standards and targets against which local authorities can benchmark their fire services.</p>  <p>  Over the course of 2014/2015, the National Directorate&rsquo;s Management Board's External Validation Group (EVG) visited every fire service in the country as part of a new external validation process arising from implementation of KCS. In April 2016, the Management Board published the first EVG Report titled &ldquo;Local Delivery - National Consistency&rdquo;. The report concluded that current arrangements, as outlined, are working effectively to meet the challenges involved in trying to protect communities from fire and other emergencies. A copy of this report is available on my Department's website at the following link: </p>  <p>  http://www.housing.gov.ie/local-government/fire-and-emergency-management/fire-services-ireland-local-delivery-national. </p>  <p>  Unfortunately, the current COVID situation has understandably delayed a new (second) EVG process. I now expect it to begin next year. It will focus once again on the delivery standards of our fire services. I understand that part of the review includes an assessment of how the structure of the service impacts on delivery.</p></reply>

The Workforce Plan aims to ensure a long-term, proactive and strategic plan by which my Department aims to have the right people, with the right levels of talent and skills, in each location and Division, doing the right thing at the right time.  </p>  <p>  My Department operates in a rapidly changing environment and its structure must facilitate the flexibility to deploy resources to priority work, as the need arises.  As business needs arise, staff are allocated to support organisational priorities within my Department.  Overall staffing levels within Divisions are continually monitored and staff transfer in and out of Divisions as the workload demands.  Where skills gaps have been are identified, the HR Division reviews these requests on a quarterly basis and approves staff assignments on the basis of business cases made by Divisions.  One such iteration of this process has just been completed, so no requests are currently on hand for consideration from within the Department. </p>  <p>  The question of staffing levels in the State Agencies under the aegis of my Department is an operational matter, generally delegated to the Agencies themselves and I will ask the Agencies to respond directly to the Deputy on this matter.  However, I am aware of one request for additional staff resources, related to Brexit.</p></reply>

The advice is based on consultation with our Embassies and Consulates on the ground, the relevant local authorities in each country and our international partners, together with our domestic partners where appropriate. In the context of COVID-19 and the priority of protecting public health, we have worked particularly closely with the Department of Health and the HSE.</p>  <p>  On 15 September, as part of its medium-term plan for living with COVID-19, the Government agreed that Ireland should broadly support the European Commission proposal for a common approach to travel within the EU / EEA, which is currently under discussion in Brussels. The Government also agreed that, pending the outcome of the discussions on the EU approach, Ireland&rsquo;s &lsquo;Green List&rsquo; would be updated to include EU / EEA countries with a 14-day cumulative disease incidence rate of 25 or less per 100,000, based on data provided by the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC). The Green List is to be reviewed every Thursday, with any changes taking effect from the following Monday morning. In line with the Government decision, the list including any updates are made available on my Department's website (www.dfa.ie). We continue to advise against non-essential travel overseas, other than to countries on the &lsquo;Green List&rsquo; where the &lsquo;normal precautions&rsquo; security status rating applies. </p>  <p>  The Travel Advice published by my Department is intended to help citizens make informed decisions for themselves when planning a trip overseas.  As the Deputy will appreciate, and as commercial entities will be aware, issues relating to terms and conditions of flights, holiday packages, insurance policies or refunds are not within the remit of my Department, and these should be pursued directly with the airline, tour operator or insurer. Any citizens seeking further information in relation to their consumer rights would be advised to contact the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission.</p></reply>

It is a relief that there were no deaths or injuries, but the very sudden displacement of thousands of people, including children, has caused great suffering and created a major humanitarian emergency as well as posing a huge logistical challenge for the Greek authorities in the midst of the COVID pandemic.</p>  <p>  My colleague, the Minister for European Affairs, Thomas Byrne, spoke with his Greek counterpart on 9 September immediately after the fire to offer Ireland's full solidarity and support. The Greek authorities have requested assistance from EU Partners in dealing with the immediate humanitarian needs arising. My Department, through our Embassy in Athens, has confirmed Ireland&rsquo;s readiness to provide assistance from our humanitarian logistics base in Brindisi, Italy. The Greek authorities have thanked us for our offer of assistance and we now stand ready to respond to a request for the deployment of emergency humanitarian supplies.</p>  <p>  As Minister for Foreign Affairs, I have repeatedly urged the need for greater solidarity and burden-sharing among Member States in dealing with the wider issue of migration. The migration crisis continues to be one of the major challenges confronting the European Union and it needs to be urgently addressed. We must find more sustainable solutions involving consensus among Member States based on solidarity and responsibility. I am committed to continuing to work with our EU partners to resolve these issues and to ensure that humanitarian and legal obligations continue to be met. </p>  <p>  On 23 September 2020, the Commission published a major new proposal on reforming the EU migration and asylum system - a &ldquo;New Pact on Migration and Asylum&rdquo;- and has also established a dedicated Taskforce to resolve the emergency situation on Lesvos effectively and humanely. I welcome both initiatives by the Commission. The publication of the Migration Pact proposals represents an opportunity to renew and intensify efforts to agree a common approach and put in place more effective and humane arrangements to manage the considerable migratory pressures that Europe continues to face. </p>  <p>  We in Ireland are endeavouring to do our part, having already received 1022 asylum seekers (including six unaccompanied minors) from Greece under the first phase of the Irish Refugee Protection Programme. We have also committed to accept 36 unaccompanied minors in need of international protection in Greece, and I was pleased that the first group of eight such minors arrived in Ireland last June. In the context of the very difficult situation now arising from the destruction of the Moria refugee camp, the Government has decided to accept another group of four unaccompanied minors, as part of this overall commitment, and is continuing to keep under review what further actions it can take to meet the enormous humanitarian and relocation needs arising from this tragic event.</p></reply>

In this regard, the full spectrum of Defence Forces personnel and equipment, commensurate with operational requirements, is available for deployments.

Primary schools are currently provided with class teachers on the basis of one teacher for every 26 pupils which is at its historically lowest level.  Under the Programme for Government there is a commitment to seek to make further progress in reducing the pupil teacher ratios in primary schools and it is my intention to make progress on this in future budgets.</p>  <p>  Since 2017, 1700 additional leadership posts have been invested in our primary schools which has led to 1 in 3 teachers now holding promoted positions.  The Department has committed to revising the allocation of Posts of Responsibility to take into account retirements during the school year. This ensures that the current level of Posts of Responsibility are maintained in the school system.</p>  <p>  The main capitation grant used for general running costs of schools has also increased in each of the last two budgets.  I understand the need for improved capitation funding and I am pleased the combined increases given in Budgets 2019 and 2020 mean that circa 40% restoration has been achieved.</p>  <p>  The financial package approved by Government to support schools recognises that COVID-19 poses significant challenges. The Government published the Roadmap for the Full Return to School, along with details of a financial package of over &euro;375 million to support the implementation of the measures in the roadmap which included &euro;10.2m in additional funding to support Principals and Deputy Principals who also undertake teaching duties in primary schools.  This funding will provide each teaching principal with one release day per week, and release days for Deputy Principals in those schools that have an existing administrative principal.</p>  <p>  The public service agreements have allowed a programme of pay restoration for public servants to start. The starting salary for a new entrant teacher in 2012 was &euro;30,702. As a result of the programme of pay restoration, the starting salary of a teacher is now &euro;36,953 and from 1 October 2020 onwards will be &euro;37,692.  Section 11 of the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 provides that &ldquo;the Minister [for Public Expenditure and Reform] shall, within three months of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before the Oireachtas a report on the cost of and a plan in dealing with pay equalisation for new entrants to the public service. The report laid before the Oireachtas on foot of this provision by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform assesses the cost of a further change which would provide a two scale point adjustment to new entrants recruited since 2011. The total cost of such an adjustment across the public sector is of the order of &euro;200 million, of which Education accounts for &euro;83 million. The report also acknowledges that, during the financial crisis, there were policy changes which affected remuneration in different occupations across the public sector (including education).</p>  <p>  The matter of new entrant pay is a cross sectoral issue, not just an issue for the education sector alone. The Government supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants. On 24 September 2018, an agreement was reached between the Government and the public services committee of ICTU in respect of new entrant pay. This agreement is benefitting 16,000 teachers and nearly 5,000 SNAs within the education sector. The deal provides for a series of incremental jumps for new entrants. In accordance with the Public Service Stability Agreement, the Principal&rsquo;s allowance was increased to its pre-FEMPI rate with effect from 1 October 2020. </p>  <p>  I am fully aware that the teacher unions have outstanding issues of concern following the September 2018 agreement. These outstanding matters will be given full consideration in the context of the next round of pay talks. Regarding the competing demands for the next Budget, I must have regard to the level of resources which will be available to my Department, in the context of the continuing need for the Government to prudently manage the economy and the public finances and have regard to risks, including those associated with the COVID pandemic and Brexit.   </p></reply>

In the 2019/20 school year over 120,000 children, including over 14,200 children with special educational needs, were transported in over 5,000 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country covering over 100 million kilometres at a cost of over &euro;219m in 2019.</p>  <p>  Based on the public health advice published in early July, my Department has been planning for School Transport Scheme services for the 2020/2021 school year to fully operate, but with additional measures and hygiene requirements in place. The Department has been engaging intensively with Bus &Eacute;ireann in regard to the logistics for the safe operation of School Transport Scheme services for the 2020/2021 school year. </p>  <p>  The Department has issued detailed information and guidance to parents and children on the operation of school transport services for the 2020/2021 school year.  All children using school transport scheme services are being asked to comply with the a number of guidelines, including not  to use school transport if they are displaying obvious symptoms, to maintain physical distancing while waiting for transport, to always sit in their pre-assigned seating, to use hand sanitiser prior to or on boarding the bus,  to observe respiratory etiquette at all times  and that all children on post-primary transport are required to wear facemasks while waiting for and on-board transport services (with the exception of children who for medical or special educational needs reasons are not in a position to wear a facemask or face covering). </p>  <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann has and continues to engage with their own drivers and with private contractors who are contracted to provide school transport services in regard to sanitisation and additional cleaning requirements on school transport services. </p>  <p>  Updated health advice was received from NPHET on the 18th August, which impacts on the operation of post-primary school transport services.  This advice stated that for secondary school students on school transport, strict distancing should be ensured in line with that on public transport along with the wearing of face coverings and that primary school students should distance where possible. </p>  <p>  Following the most recent advice from NPHET, the Government decided that the post-primary scheme (including SEN post-primary services) would commence operation when schools re-open with additional measures in place, such as pre-assigned seating and additional hygiene and cleaning measures on services and with the rolling implementation of measures to provide physical distancing, in line with those required on public transport, which is using 50% of passenger capacity, on the post- primary services as required.  </p>  <p>  My Department is engaging with Bus &Eacute;ireann in respect of these plans, to implement measures so that any services that can operate from the start of the school year at 50% capacity will do so and over the coming period all other post-primary transport services will be re-organised and additional services will be provided as required to allow for physical distancing.</p></reply>

They included links to a range of materials developed by the Digital Technologies team of the Professional Development Service for Teachers (a Department support service for teachers) such as learning platforms and online tools which can be used to support remote/distance teaching and learning. Those resources continue to be available to schools. There is also ongoing consultation with the management bodies and unions from both sectors on all matters relating to the safe return to school in the context of the ongoing Covid 19 pandemic, which is an evolving situation. All guidance documents are under review and will be updated to take account of the current situation and to support schools further in maintaining continuity of schooling for all learners including those at very high risk and unable to return to school at this time. </p><p>As a contingency for any future school closures, whether localised or at a bigger scale, and to ensure compliance with any public health restrictions, it is essential however that all schools are prepared and have in place appropriate measures to continue to deliver teaching and learning whether for closure of a class group or the school. In this regard, my Department is in the process of drafting a circular that will issue to schools to help in their preparation for such an event. The circular will provide guidance and support to schools, building on the work already done by schools, to put in place appropriate arrangements to facilitate communication with and between staff, between staff and learners and to facilitate development of online approaches to remote and blended learning in the event that such is required. My Department will engage with education stakeholders, including unions and management bodies, to inform the final drafting of the circular.  </p><p>A commitment of &euro;210m was provided under the Digital Strategy for Schools 2015-2020 for improved ICT infrastructure, of which &euro;160m has issued to schools to date, including &euro;50m which issued earlier this year. In the context of the current public health crisis schools can use this funding to address ICT needs including devices, software and other ICT solutions to support the provision of remote learning. This may include the purchase of ICT devices that can be shared with learners who do not have access to devices and for the purchase of essential learning platforms. The remaining &euro;50m under this provision will issue to schools during the current school year (2020-2021) subject to the availability of exchequer funding.  Separately, and through the Schools Broadband Access Programme, my Department provides for improved ICT infrastructure for the supply of internet connectivity for all recognised primary and post primary schools and some 98% of schools avail of this service. All post-primary schools and some special schools are now included in the High Speed Broadband programme. Schools in this programme are monitored and selected for upgrade where usage signals this requirement. The primary broadband scheme is based on locally available infrastructure accessed by the providers of the service to my Department.  My Department continues to fund the upgrade of services as improved infrastructure becomes available subject to contractual and other budgetary constraints. </p><p>The Department of Climate Action, Communication Networks and Transport is responsible for the enhanced provision of broadband through the National Broadband and State Intervention Plan. By the end of this year some 70 primary schools will be connected to high speed broadband through the National Broadband Plan first phase of delivery through Broadband Connection Points (BCP) programme. My Department continues to liaise with that Department to seek to improve broadband connectivity for primary schools and to raise issues of barriers to connectivity impacting access to remote learning.</p></reply>

Analysis of the parental preferences expressed in each area surveyed indicated that there was sufficient parental demand to support changes in school patronage in 28 areas, including in Nenagh.</p>  <p>  Under the patronage divesting process, a school can be opened where a school building became, or was due to become, available as a result of an amalgamation/closure of an existing school.  In some areas, including in the case of Nenagh, in responding to demand for diversity where existing patrons were unable make school properties available, my Department also included an examination of properties held in public ownership.</p>  <p>  To date, it has not been possible to secure a school property to facilitate a new school being established in Nenagh. However, the Department is continuing its efforts in relation to identifying a suitable solution under the patronage divesting process, which would facilitate a new Educate Together school being established to serve the Nenagh area.</p></reply>

The purpose of this process is to allow as many students as possible to progress to employment, further education and training, or higher education in a way that is fair and equitable to all Leaving Certificate students.</p>  <p>  Schools provided an estimated percentage mark and a rank order for each student&rsquo;s subjects.  The process of national standardisation was applied to the school information in order to ensure comparability between the standards applied by individual schools and the national standard. We know from research that teachers are very good at making judgements about their students in the local context of the school.  It was inherent to the system of calculated grades that school estimates would be subject to adjustment through this standardisations process.  The adjustments that occurred through standardisation resulted in the school estimates staying the same or being revised upwards or downwards. The standardisation process operated on the premise that the school estimates should only be adjusted through the standardisation process where there was credible statistical evidence to justify changing them.  </p>  <p>  Following standardisation, the estimated percentage mark was converted to a calculated mark and subsequently, a calculated grade which was provided to students on 7 September. It is only at this point that students were awarded a grade.  </p>  <p>  Therefore, it is not accurate to state that student(s) were downgraded, or upgraded, through the standardisation process.  Rather the grade that was awarded following the standardisation process is the grade for the 2020 Leaving Certificate (Calculated Grades).  </p>  <p>  Some students experienced mark changes from the school estimates but no changes to the grades based on the school estimates; while others will have experienced changes to the marks leading to a change in the grade that would have been awarded based on the school estimates in one or more of their subjects.  </p>  <p>  In terms of the grades awarded, 83% (almost 340,000) of all Leaving Certificate subject grades are either the same or higher than the school estimates while 17% (under 70,000) grades are lower.  </p>  <p>  Every effort has been made to make the system as fair as possible for as many students as possible. The statistical model used was blind to demographic characteristics, either at the level of the student or the school and the standardisation process has been applied uniformly across all schools. This means anyone using the certificate to make a judgement between two people who hold this certificate, either now or in the future, can place equal value on the same grade in the same subject, without regard to where they went to school. </p>  <p>  We appreciate that some students will be disappointed at the results they have achieved. This is the case every year when the Leaving Certificate results are published.</p>  <p>  Students, at an individual level, had access to an appeals process for calculated grade system the closing date for which has now passed.  The appeals system is, by design, restricted to looking for technical errors in the data provided on behalf of students and in the processing of that data.  The nature of this appeal process has been part of the system of Calculated Grades from the outset.  The appeal process will involve a technical appeal focused on looking for errors in the transmission of the data through the process.  An example of this would be whether any mistake has been made in entering the information to any of the systems used in the process.  </p>  <p>  It was fundamental to the adoption of a system of Calculated Grades that the professional judgement of the school (teachers and principals) would be outside the scope of the appeals process.  </p>  <p>  The integrity, validity and reliability of the process of national standardisation was overseen by the National Standardisation Group whose role was to oversee the application of the statistical model to the school data.  Any appeals process that would allow an individual student level appeal to reopen the application of the statistical process to the school sourced data would fundamentally undermine fairness and equity in the system of calculated grades which relies on the uniform application of the statistical model.  </p>  <p>  Students dissatisfied with the outcome of the appeals process  can invoke a separate process to have their appeal reviewed by independent Appeals Scrutineers. These Scrutineers are independent of the Department.</p>  <p>  Students who consider that their appeal has not been processed correctly can make a complaint to the Ombudsman or, in the case of students under 18 years of age, the Ombudsman for Children.  </p>  <p>  Students dissatisfied with their results will have the opportunity to sit written Leaving Certificate examinations in November (subject to public health advice).  Those who sit the examinations will be credited with the higher subject grade achieved between the Calculated Grade and the written exam.</p></reply>

The process of national standardisation was applied to the school information in order to ensure comparability between the standards applied by individual schools and the national standard.  We know from research that teachers are very good at making judgements about their students in the local context of the school.  Schools approached this task in a very professional manner, in line with detailed guidelines about the process, but inevitably some schools were overly harsh in their estimations while others were overly generous.  This is to be expected given that there is no national standard on which to base an estimated mark.  But to be fair to the class of 2020, the teacher judgements made at the level of the school had to be adjusted so that a common national standard was applied.  It was inherent to the system of calculated grades that school estimates would be subject to adjustment through this standardisation process.  </p>  <p>  These adjustments resulted in the school estimates staying the same or being revised upwards or downwards.  The standardisation process operated on the premise that the school estimates should only be adjusted through the standardisation process where there was credible statistical evidence to justify changing them.  </p>  <p>  This standardising process happens every year and would have happened in 2020 had the Leaving Certificate examinations been run as normal.  The standardisation process applied across all subject and levels.  The degree to which mark changes occurred related to the degree of over or underestimation in the school estimates for each subject and each level.  This means that some students experienced mark changes from the school estimates but no changes to the grades based on the school estimates; while others will have experienced changes from the teacher estimates leading to grade changes in one or more of their subjects.  </p>  <p>  Following standardisation, the estimated percentage mark was converted to a calculated mark and subsequently, a calculated grade which was provided to students on 7 September. It is only at this point that students were awarded a grade.  </p>  <p>  Therefore, it is not accurate to state that student(s) were downgraded, or upgraded, through the standardisation process.  Rather the grade that was awarded following the standardisation process is the grade for the 2020 Leaving Certificate (Calculated Grades).  </p>  <p>  The overall data on school estimated marks showed that there was a very significant rise in estimated grades against what would normally be achieved nationally.  This level of grade increase based on the school estimates would have been unrealistic.  For example, based on the school data there would have been 13.8% H1 grades this year when in a normal year there is 5.8%.  Even with the standardisation process the rate of H1s this year is over 9%.    </p>  <p>  In terms of the grades awarded on 7th September 2020, 83% (almost 340,000) of all Leaving Certificate subject grades were either the same or higher than the school estimates while 17% (under 70,000) grades were lower. </p>  <p>  In the absence of the Leaving Certificate examinations in 2020 every effort has been made to make the system as fair as possible for as many students a possible.  The statistical model used was blind to demographic characteristics either at the level of the student or the school.  The standardisation process means that the same standard has been applied uniformly across all schools.  This means anyone using the certificate to make a judgement between two people who hold this certificate, either now or in the future, can place equal value on the same grade in the same subject, without regard to where they went to school, as they would in a normal year.</p>  <p>  Individual Junior Cycle results were not used to determine any individual's Calculated Grades.  Rather, the Calculated Grades process took account of the overall Junior Cycle performance of the Leaving Certificate class of 2020 in each school and used this data to help in predicting the likely range of Leaving Certificate performance of that group using related information about the relationship between performance at Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate based on national data over time. </p>  <p>  The fact that the vast majority of 2020 Leaving Certificate students would have sat the Junior Cycle examinations provides a good means of predicting the pattern of performance of these students at an aggregate level. The process was not applied at an individual student level.  The Junior Cycle data for 2020 Leaving Certificate students who had sat their examinations in another school were carried in to the school at which they were registered to sit the Leaving Certificate.  </p>  <p>  While some students will be disappointed at the results they have achieved, this is the case every year when the Leaving Certificate results are published.  It may be more difficult for students to understand when they see the estimated mark from the school. </p></reply>

The purpose of this process is to allow as many students as possible to progress to employment, further education and training, or higher education in a way that is fair and equitable to all Leaving Certificate students.</p>  <p>  Schools provided an estimated percentage mark and a rank order for each student's subjects.  The process of national standardisation was applied to the school information in order to ensure comparability between the standards applied by individual schools and the national standard.

The appeals system is, by design, restricted to looking for technical errors in the data provided on behalf of students and in the processing of that data.  The nature of this appeal process has been part of the system of Calculated Grades from the outset.  The appeal process will involve a technical appeal focused on looking for errors in the transmission of the data through the process.  An example of this would be whether any mistake has been made in entering the information to any of the systems used in the process.  </p>  <p>  It was fundamental to the adoption of a system of Calculated Grades that the professional judgement of the school (teachers and principals) would be outside the scope of the appeals process.  </p>  <p>  The integrity, validity and reliability of the process of national standardisation was overseen by the National Standardisation Group whose role was to oversee the application of the statistical model to the school data.  Any appeals process that would allow an individual student level appeal to reopen the application of the statistical process to the school sourced data would fundamentally undermine fairness and equity in the system of calculated grades which relies on the uniform application of the statistical model.  </p>  <p>  Students dissatisfied with the outcome of the appeals process  can invoke a separate process to have their appeal reviewed by independent Appeals Scrutineers.  These Scrutineers are independent of the Department.</p>  <p>  Students who consider that their appeal has not been processed correctly can make a complaint to the Ombudsman or, in the case of students under 18 years of age, the Ombudsman for Children.  </p>  <p>  Students dissatisfied with their results will have the opportunity to sit written Leaving Certificate examinations in November (subject to public health advice).

The Assessment Arrangements for Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate Examinations 2021 are available at the following link: </p><p>. </p><p>As schools have significant autonomy in determining how to sequence and pace learning for students in their schools, no centrally prescribed adjustment of the curriculum and courses of study have been made for students taking the certificate examinations in 2021.  Consequently, the most appropriate way to reflect and take account of the challenges for students that have occurred in 2019/20, and may occur in 2020/21, was to incorporate adjustments to the certificate examinations in 2021. </p><p>These adjustments have been arrived at through discussions between my Department, the State Examinations Commission (SEC) and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) and key stakeholders.  The key stakeholders that were consulted in relation to the document included unions representing teachers, and school management bodies. </p><p>As part of The Roadmap for the Full Return to School the Department has also issued Guidance for Practical Subjects in Post-Primary Schools and Centres for Education.  This document provides guidance in relation to subjects that involve using equipment in order to support the safe implementation of the practical aspects of those subjects and includes information in relation to Leaving Certificate Agricultural Science.  This advice aligns with the public health advice provided by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) for the safe reopening of schools and educational facilities.  This document, and further details of the response plan for the safe reopening of post primary schools, are available here: </p><p>. </p><p>On 16  September, the SEC also published an information note clarifying the level of flexibility available to students in completing their coursework for Leaving Certificate Agricultural Science for the 2021 examinations.  This document is available at the following link: </p><p>.</p><p>The SEC consulted with my Department and the NCCA on the development of this document.  This information note was drawn up following consideration of the concerns of the Irish Agricultural Science Teachers Association which had been sent to the SEC, NCCA and Department.  This additional flexibility for the 2021 cohort allows all candidates to meaningfully complete their examination coursework in line with the expectations of the Brief and the Guidelines in these exceptional circumstances due to Covid-19.

All children who are eligible for school transport and who completed the application and payment process on time have been accommodated on transport services for the 2020/2021 school year where such services are in operation.</p>  <p>  Children who are not eligible for school transport may apply for transport on a concessionary basis and are facilitated where spare seats exist after eligible children have been accommodated.  Where the number of ineligible children exceeds the number of spare seats available Bus &Eacute;ireann allocates tickets using an agreed selection process.</p>  <p>  Based on the public health advice published in early July, my Department has been planning for School Transport Scheme services for the 2020/2021 school year to fully operate, but with additional measures and hygiene requirements in place.  The Department has been engaging intensively with Bus &Eacute;ireann in regard to the logistics for the safe operation of School Transport Scheme services for the 2020/2021 school year.  Updated health advice was received from NPHET on the 18th August, which impacts on the operation of post-primary school transport services.  This advice stated that for secondary school students on school transport, strict distancing should be ensured in line with that on public transport along with the wearing of face coverings. </p>  <p>  My Department is engaging with Bus &Eacute;ireann in respect of these plans, to implement measures so that any services that can operate from the start of the school year at 50% capacity will do so and over the coming period all other post-primary transport services will be re-organised and additional services will be provided as required to allow for physical distancing.  In addition, Bus &Eacute;ireann recently invited applications from operators who wish to be considered for the provision of additional post-primary services that may be required.</p>  <p>  Applications/payments for primary seats continue to be considered and tickets may be allocated on existing services where capacity exists.  Applications/payments for post-primary seats completed or made after the closing date for payment of 4th August 2020 will be only considered when 50% capacity, required by new Covid-19 public health guidelines, is achieved on each route.  The timeframe for this will vary from route to route and may take a number of weeks to complete. </p>  <p>  In the event of not securing a ticket where no capacity exists, or on cancellation, a full refund will be issued.</p></reply>

On 21 August, I announced a series of changes that would be made to assessment arrangements for both Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate examinations for 2021. This announcement was accompanied by a published document detailing these changes, <i>Assessment Arrangements for Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate Examinations 2021, </i>and forms part of the Roadmap for the Full Return to School.</p><p>These arrangements are designed to take account of the disrupted learning experienced by students during the 2019/20 school year and to factor in for some further possible loss of learning time in the 2020/21 school year as a contingency measure. As the loss of learning through school closures will have affected students&rsquo; engagement with their course of study in different ways, the adjustments put in place will play to students&rsquo; strengths by leaving intact the familiar overall structure of the examinations, while incorporating additional choice. The adjustments were arrived at through discussions between my Department, the State Examinations Commission (SEC) and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) and key stakeholders.  </p><p>These changes to the national assessment arrangements have been made with due regard for the principles of equity, fairness and integrity, as these principles apply to assessment and examinations and refer to student to-student, subject-to-subject, and year-to-year comparisons over time. The changes provide reassurance to students, their parents/guardians, teachers and schools.</p><p>The State Examinations Commission (SEC), which has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations, intends to operate the 2021 state examinations as normally as possible, with appropriate contingency built in, in line with prevailing public health advice. It is not intended that there would be any change to the length of the written examinations. For subjects where the SEC issues project briefs during the 2020/21 school year, the intention is to issue these at least four weeks earlier than normal. For subjects with course work completion dates typically late in the school year, schools will be asked to submit this coursework two weeks earlier than normal as a contingency measure. In this context teachers are being encouraged to plan and undertake these projects as early as possible in the programme of study. </p><p>Other documents published by my Department to support the return to school include <i>Guidance for Practical Subjects in Post-Primary Schools and Centres for Education </i>and <i>Returning to school: Guidance on learning and school programmes for post primary school leaders and teachers. </i>These documents provide guidance for teachers and schools that is specific to each practical subject area, so that students can be facilitated to actively engage with their learning.<i></i>All documentation published is available on www.gov.ie/backtoschool. </p><p>The www.gov.ie/backtoschool site also contains information on well-being supports for Leaving Certificate students.  This includes a series of supports on managing well-being, coping with uncertainty and managing stress and anxiety, developed by the National Educational Psychological Service, to support students. The webpage has links to more individualised support for students to access, should these be needed. My Department worked with the Department of Health and the HSE to ensure the most appropriate services and resources are clearly signposted for students.  </p><p>Promoting the wellbeing of school communities has been a fundamental element of my Department&rsquo;s overall plan to support a successful return to school as we continue to manage the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. We know that most students have been happy and relieved to get back to school, reconnect and prepare to re-engage with learning.  My Department is providing for approximately 120 extra posts for guidance to support student wellbeing, recognising the particular importance for this support in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic challenges.</p></reply>

This Report was developed on foot of extensive consultation which was conducted between June 2018 and March 2019.</p>  <p>  The NCCA report makes a number of recommendations. This includes primarily the development of a single integrated curriculum for RSE and Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) in schools. Work on updating or developing new specifications for SPHE/RSE will commence in the NCCA in 2021, beginning with a focus on Junior Cycle. This work will include engagement with all the key education stakeholders as well as a further process of public consultation before any new curriculum specifications are finalised.  </p>  <p>  The NCCA has established two development groups, one for primary and one for post-primary, to oversee the work in this area and support the development of guidance material for schools. These groups were unable to commence their work over recent months due to the COVID-19 restrictions on public gatherings. However, meetings of these groups will convene from October and this will allow them to review significant work that has been progressed. </p>  <p>  The NCCA is currently developing interim guidance for SPHE and RSE across primary and post-primary levels. These support materials will be made available in the form of an online toolkit. They will provide guidance on how the current curriculum can be approached in a more holistic way.

My Department does not have a role in making individual school determinations. Accordingly, the question has been referred to the NCSE for direct reply.</p><p>The Special Needs Assistant (SNA) scheme is designed to provide schools with additional adult support staff who can assist children with special educational needs who also have additional and significant care needs.  Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.</p><p>SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated.  </p><p>It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p><p>Schools were notified of the arrangements for the allocation of SNA support in respect of students in mainstream classes for the current school year.  The arrangements include the following provisions: </p><p>- 2019/20 mainstream class SNA allocations were frozen, from the date of issue of Circular 0030/2020, and have automatically rolled over into the current school year. This means that no school will receive an allocation less than that which they have on the date of issue of this Circular and existing SNAs currently in standard SNA posts were allowed to continue in these posts for the current school year in the normal way.  </p><p>- A diagnosis of a disability, or a psychological or other professional report, is not be necessary for this process.</p><p>- The role of the SNA to support the care needs of students in mainstream classes, as set out in Circular 0030/2014, remains unchanged. </p><p>It is expected that schools will review and reprioritise the deployment of SNAs within mainstream settings and allocate resources to ensure those with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support. Providing access to SNA support continues to be based on primary care needs as outlined in DES Circular 0030/2014.</p><p>Schools may apply to the NCSE for additionality where they can demonstrate that the current allocation does not meet additional care needs within the mainstream classes in the school. Applications for additionality arising from significant new or emerging additional care needs, which cannot be catered within existing allocations, are dealt with by way of the exceptional review process.  </p><p>The exceptional review process for mainstream allocations is available to schools throughout the current school year. </p><p>Detailed information on the NCSE exceptional review process is published on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie. </p><p>A school can appeal the outcome of an exceptional review and details of how to do this are here </p></reply>

The purpose of this process is to allow as many students as possible to progress to employment, further education and training, or higher education in a way that is fair and equitable to all Leaving Certificate students.</p><p>Schools provided an estimated percentage mark and a rank order (the student's place in the class group) for each student&rsquo;s subjects.  We know from research that teachers are very good at making judgements about their students in the local context of the school.  </p><p>The process of national standardisation was applied to the school information in order to ensure comparability between the standards applied by individual schools and the national standard.  It is important to note that, unlike in other jurisdictions, the starting point for the standardisation process was the estimated percentage marks provided by the school.  </p><p>The adjustments that occurred through standardisation resulted in the school estimates staying the same or being revised upwards or downwards. While the estimated marks have been subject to a process of adjustment to ensure fairness and comparability across schools, the national standardisation process operated on the premise that the school estimates should only be adjusted through the standardisation process where there was credible statistical evidence to justify changing them.  </p><p>Following the standardisation process, the estimated percentage mark was converted to a calculated mark and subsequently, a calculated grade which was provided to students on 7<sup></sup>September. It is only at this point that students were awarded a grade therefore, it is not accurate to state that student(s) were downgraded, or upgraded, through the standardisation process.  Rather the grade that was awarded following the standardisation process is the grade for the 2020 Leaving Certificate Calculated Grades.  </p><p>The degree to which mark changes occurred related to the degree of over or underestimation in the school estimates for each subject and each level.  This means that some students experienced mark changes from the school estimates but no changes to the grades based on the school estimates; while others will have experienced changes to the marks leading to a change in the grade that would have been awarded based on the school estimates in one or more of their subjects.  </p><p>In terms of the grades awarded, 83% (almost 340,000) of all Leaving Certificate subject grades are either the same or higher than the school estimates while 17% (under 70,000) grades are lower.More detailed statistics are available on mydepartment&rsquo;s website </p><p>Of the students due to take examinations in the Leaving Certificate (including the Leaving Certificate Vocational) programme, the data requested on the number of students whose grades were different to those that would have been awarded based on the school estimates are set out in the following tables.  It should be noted that some students had grades which were higher than the school estimates in some subjects and lower in others.  </p><p>Number of grades which were lower than the school estimates by student  <table>    <tr>       <th>No of grades </th>       <th>No of students</th>       <th>Percent</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>0</td>       <td>19,596</td>       <td>34.0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>1</td>       <td>18,584</td>       <td>32.3</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2</td>       <td>11,663</td>       <td>20.2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>3</td>       <td>5,288</td>       <td>9.2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>4</td>       <td>1,885</td>       <td>3.3</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>5</td>       <td>488</td>       <td>0.8</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>6</td>       <td>83</td>       <td>0.1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>7+</td>       <td>11</td>       <td>0.0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total</td>       <td>57598</td>       <td>100.0</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Number of grades which were higher than the school estimates by student  <table>    <tr>       <th>No. of grades </th>       <th>No. of Students</th>       <th>Percent</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>0</td>       <td>44572</td>       <td>77.4</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>1</td>       <td>10842</td>       <td>18.8</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2</td>       <td>1843</td>       <td>3.2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>3</td>       <td>297</td>       <td>0.5</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>4</td>       <td>38</td>       <td>0.1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>5</td>       <td>6</td>       <td>0.0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total</td>       <td>57598</td>       <td>100.0</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-09-29a.1217.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020092900086#WRW03900"><p>The decision to adopt a model of Calculated Grades by my Department was a direct result of COVID-19, which prevented the State from running the conventional Leaving Certificate Examinations.</p>  <p>  The design of the Calculated Grades model was informed by advice from a Technical Working Group comprising experts drawn from the State Examinations Commission, the Inspectorate of the Department of Education and Skills, the Educational Research Centre and international external expertise. </p>  <p>  Schools provided an estimated percentage mark and a rank order for each student&rsquo;s subjects.  The process of national standardisation was applied to the school information in order to ensure comparability between the standards applied by individual schools and the national standard. We know from research that teachers are very good at making judgements about their students in the local context of the school.  Schools approached this task in a very professional manner, in line with detailed guidelines about the process, but inevitably some schools were overly harsh in their estimations while others were overly generous. This is to be expected given that there is no national standard on which to base an estimated mark.  But to be fair to the class of 2020, the teacher judgements made at the level of the school had to be adjusted so that a common national standard was applied.   It was inherent to the system of calculated grades that school estimates would be subject to adjustment through this standardisations process.  </p>  <p>  These adjustments resulted in the school estimates staying the same or being revised upwards or downwards. The standardisation process operated on the premise that the school estimates should only be adjusted through the standardisation process where there was credible statistical evidence to justify changing them.  </p>  <p>  This standardising process happens every year and would have happened in 2020 had the Leaving Certificate examinations been run as normal.   The standardisation process applied across all subject and levels.  The degree to which mark changes occurred related to the degree of over or underestimation in the school estimates for each subject and each level.  This means that some students experienced changes from the school estimates but no changes to the grades based on the school estimates; while others will have experienced marks changes from the teacher estimates leading to grade changes in one or more of their subjects.  </p>  <p>  Following standardisation, the estimated percentage mark was converted to a calculated mark and subsequently, a calculated grade which was provided to students on 7 September. It is only at this point that students were awarded a grade.  </p>  <p>  Therefore, it is not accurate to state that student(s) were downgraded, or upgraded, through the standardisation process.  Rather the grade that was awarded following the standardisation process is the grade for the 2020 Leaving Certificate (Calculated Grades).  </p>  <p>  The overall data on school estimated marks showed that there was a very significant rise in estimated grades against what would normally be achieved nationally. This level of grade increase based on the school estimates would have been unrealistic. For example, based on the school data there would have been 13.8% H1 grades this year when in a normal year there is 5.8%. Even with the standardisation process the rate of H1s this year is over 9%.    </p>  <p>  In terms of the grades awarded on 7th September 2020, 83% (almost 340,000) of all Leaving Certificate subject grades were either the same or higher than the school estimates while 17% (under 70,000) grades were lower. </p>  <p>  In the absence of the Leaving Certificate examinations in 2020 every effort has been made to make the system as fair as possible for as many students a possible. The statistical model used was blind to demographic characteristics either at the level of the student or the school.   The standardisation process means that the same standard has been applied uniformly across all schools.  This means anyone using the certificate to make a judgement between two people who hold this certificate, either now or in the future, can place equal value on the same grade in the same subject, without regard to where they went to school, as they would in a normal year.</p>  <p>  Individual Junior Cycle results were not used to determine any individual&rsquo;s Calculated Grades. Rather, the Calculated Grades process took account of the overall Junior Cycle performance of the Leaving Certificate class of 2020 in each school and used this data to help in predicting the likely range of Leaving Certificate performance of that group using related information about the relationship between performance at Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate based on national data over time. </p>  <p>  The fact that the vast majority of 2020 Leaving Certificate students would have sat the Junior Cycle examinations provides a good means of predicting the pattern of performance of these students at an aggregate level. The process was not applied at an individual student level.  The Junior Cycle data for 2020 Leaving Certificate students who had sat their examinations in another school were carried in to the school at which they were registered to sit the Leaving Certificate.  </p>  <p>  While some students will be disappointed at the results they have achieved, this is the case every year when the Leaving Certificate results are published. It may be more difficult for students to understand when they see the estimated mark from the school. </p></reply>

Parents were asked to inform the Department by Friday the 4th   of September if they wished to avail of this option.  Officials in School Transport Section are currently liaising with Bus &Eacute;ireann and with the families who have contacted the Department to enquire about refunds and grants in order to clarify certain queries raised by families and to inform and advise parents of the next steps in the process.  Pending clarification on certain queries which may impact the final number of families that may be eligible for a grant, latest figures show that refunds have been requested on tickets for 625 children of which 421 children are eligible for a grant.   </p>  <p>  In addition, parents of post-primary children who are eligible for transport under the terms of the Department&rsquo;s Special Needs Transport Scheme were given the option to avail of a grant if they decided not to use transport for the 2020/21 school year. Parents were asked to inform the Department by Friday the 18th   of September if they wished to avail of this option. Officials in School Transport Section are currently reviewing the emails received from families and details on the number of children who wish to avail of a grant will be available shortly.</p>  <p>  In light of this, full and final information by county is not yet available.</p></reply>

Funding for segregated Traveller provision has been incorporated into overall school and other funding streams in order to provide supports for Traveller pupils in mainstream schools. Such supports include:</p>  <p>  - Investment of some &euro;125 million in my Department's DEIS Programme for educational inclusion providing for smaller class sizes and other supports including additional teaching posts, Home School Community Liaison Coordinators, DEIS grants, enhanced book grants, curriculum supports, priority access to Continuing Professional Development and the School Excellence Fund for DEIS.  Traveller pupils are included for the purposes of determining the level of mainstream teaching staff in the relevant DEIS schools.</p>  <p>  - A new model for allocating Special Education Teachers introduced for mainstream schools  which provides a single allocation for special educational supports to teaching needs for schools, based on each school&rsquo;s educational profile. The model establishes a school&rsquo;s educational profile, which includes traveller children, enrolled in a school under the following strands: </p>  <p>  - The number of students with complex special educational needs</p>  <p>  - The social context of school which includes gender, primary school location and educational disadvantage. For primary schools, the social context survey asked schools to the number of pupils from a Traveller family as one component of the social context survey. For post primary schools, social context was based on the number of pupils who had exam fee exemptions, including Traveller pupils.</p>  <p>  - Percentages of students performing below a certain threshold on standardised test results. This includes schools with pupils from the Traveller and Roma community who may be attaining lower standardised test scores. The allocation is based on the learning need evidenced by the test score result as opposed to by the cultural identifier in accordance with mainstream policy.</p>  <p>  My Department currently spends approximately &euro;1.9 billion or almost 20% of its total educational budget annually on making additional provision for children with special educational needs. This represents an increase of over 50% in total expenditure since 2011, at which point &euro;1.247 billion per annum was provided.   Enhanced pupil capitation is also paid for Traveller pupils.</p>  <p>  My Department is committed to improving educational outcomes for Traveller and Roma learners at all levels, through the implementation of the education actions of NTRIS. Responding to specific actions in the NTRIS and the DEIS Plan, a Two Year Pilot Programme to target attendance, participation and retention/school completion has been established in four specific Traveller and Roma Communities. Partners in the project include Tusla Education Support Services (TESS), Department of Education and Skills, Department of Children, Disability, Equality and Integration and Traveller and Roma representatives. Each pilot area is being provided with  an additional Educational Welfare Officer (EWO) and  Home School Liaison Coordinator (HSCL) and two additional Traveller/Roma Education Workers. It is intended that the pilot will inform future policy in the area of Traveller and Roma education.</p></reply>

My Department does not have a role in making individual school determinations. Accordingly, the question has been referred to the NCSE for direct reply.</p><p>The Special Needs Assistant (SNA) scheme is designed to provide schools with additional adult support staff who can assist children with special educational needs who also have additional and significant care needs.  Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.</p><p>SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated.  </p><p>It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p><p>Schools were notified of the arrangements for the allocation of SNA support in respect of students in mainstream classes for the current school year.  The arrangements include the following provisions: </p><p>- 2019/20 mainstream class SNA allocations were frozen, from the date of issue of Circular 0030/2020, and have automatically rolled over into the current school year. This means that no school will receive an allocation less than that which they have on the date of issue of this Circular and existing SNAs currently in standard SNA posts were allowed to continue in these posts for the current school  year in the normal way.  </p><p>- A diagnosis of a disability, or a psychological or other professional report, is not be necessary for this process.  </p><p>- The role of the SNA to support the care needs of students in mainstream classes, as set out in Circular 0030/2014, remains unchanged.  </p><p>It is expected that schools will review and reprioritise the deployment of SNAs within mainstream settings and allocate resources to ensure those with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support. Providing access to SNA support continues to be based on primary care needs as outlined in DES Circular 0030/2014.</p><p>Schools may apply to the NCSE for additionality where they can demonstrate that the current allocation does not meet additional care needs within the mainstream classes in the school. Applications for additionality arising from significant new or emerging additional care needs, which cannot be catered within existing allocations, are dealt with by way of the exceptional review process.  </p><p>In relation to CBS Secondary School, Kilkenny, the NCSE has stated that an original SNA Exceptional Review application was received and the SENO had arranged to visit the school to finalise the review on 17th September. The school made the decision to withdraw that application on 10<sup>th</sup>September so the school visit did not go proceed.</p><p>A new application for an exceptional review has since been received by the NCSE from CBS Secondary, Kilkenny, this application is currently assigned to a SENO and is under review.</p><p>The exceptional review process for mainstream allocations is available to schools throughout the current school year. </p><p>Detailed information on the NCSE exceptional review process is published on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie. </p><p>A school can appeal the outcome of an exceptional review and details of how to do this are here </p></reply>

The safety and wellbeing of staff, students and the whole school community has been of paramount importance in the Government&rsquo;s planning for school reopening. </p>  <p>  I would like to acknowledge the enormous hard work that has been undertaken by teachers and staff at a local school level, and stakeholders including management bodies and unions to ensure that we could reopen our schools safely.  </p>  <p>  My Department has engaged extensively with stakeholders including ASTI in developing the plans for reopening, including regular formal meetings as well as informal contacts. This consultation is continuing following the re-opening. </p>  <p>  A Public Health Specialist from the HSE attended stakeholder meetings at the beginning of the year to describe the public health approach for stakeholders and to answer questions and address any concerns raised. Webinars have been developed by the HSE specifically to address issues raised by schools around the approach taken when cases are confirmed in the school community and will be circulated as widely as possible. </p>  <p>  The views of stakeholders including ASTI have been taken into consideration at every stage of the process, including their emphasis on a Public Health led approach to planning for school reopening. </p>  <p>  Very significant funding of over &euro;375 million has been allocated to schools to facilitate re-opening. This enables schools to put in place enhanced cleaning and hygiene arrangements, modify buildings and rooms to facilitate physical distancing, hire extra and replacement teachers and purchase PPE through a procurement framework.   </p>  <p>  My Department also has continuing engagement with the Public Health Authorities on a weekly basis so that schools can remain open safely and is working with stakeholders including ASTI in this respect also.   </p>  <p>  Appropriate information and guidance for school leaders has been provided by both Public Health in the HSE and my Department. Detailed information on the public health approach when there has been confirmed cases or a potential outbreak in the school has been published and issued to all schools.  To date, where confirmed cases have arisen, schools have co-operated with Public Health to minimise any further risk to the school community.  </p>  <p>  In terms of testing, a priority pathway for testing of close contacts from a school setting has been implemented by the HSE, in consultation with my Department. The Public Health Risk Assessment includes identifying any close contacts of the positive case. Immediately following the Public Health Risk Assessment, the Principal is advised of any actions, including requesting parents to collect children (or advising staff to go home), restrict their movements and await a test appointment.  Covid 19 test appointments are issued as a priority for school based close contacts through a specific schools referral process within the HSE. At the point of testing, swabs for the school group are processed as a priority.  </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to engage with all education partners, including ASTI, in the coming months so that we can address any remaining concerns and ensure that schools stay open.</p></reply>

This recognises that some aspects of casework will require the psychologist to work in the school, while other aspects of the work may be done remotely in order to minimise risk and maximise safety.</p></reply>

F&Aacute;S was not a party to the LRC case.</p>  <p>  In April 2017, the issue of CE Supervisor pension provision was considered by a Community Sector High Level Group chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER).  A number of Departments, including my own Department, were represented on this group, as were the unions and Pobal. </p>  <p>  A detailed scoping exercise was carried out with input from the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service (IGEES) on the potential costs of providing Exchequer support for the establishment of such a pension scheme for employees across the Community and Voluntary sector in Ireland.  This exercise estimated a potential cost to the State of between &euro;188 million and &euro;347 million per annum depending on the numbers involved.  This excluded any provision for an immediate ex-gratia lump sum payment of pension as sought, which could entail a further Exchequer cost of up to &euro;318 million. </p>  <p>  In its findings, the High-level Group stated that while CE supervisors and assistant supervisors represented only a very small part of the wider community and voluntary sector, any explicit provision of State funding for such a scheme in respect of CE Supervisors would inevitably give rise to claims for similar schemes and funding provision on the part of the many thousands of workers in the broader sector.  DPER stated that it had to have regard to the full potential Exchequer exposure associated with setting such a precedent.</p>  <p>  At this point, I wish to acknowledge the valuable and dedicated service that CE supervisors provide in running CE schemes all over the country.  We simply could not sustain a lot of our local community services without their work.  CE provides a valuable training and development opportunity to the long-term unemployed and to those often furthest removed from the labour market.</p>  <p>  The current position is that officials from my Department, DPER and the Unions are in ongoing discussions on the matter and I would therefore ask the Deputies to respect the confidentiality of the process and to allow those talks to continue free from speculation that may not assist the process at the present time.</p>  <p>  As the Deputies are aware, the funding of any potential pension provision for CE supervisors will be a matter for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and will need to be considered in the wider economic context in which any such scheme will need to operate.</p></reply>

I have secured Government approval to extend the closing date for new applications for the pandemic unemployment scheme to the end of this year. This provides security to anyone who loses their employment over the coming months, particularly in sectors of continued uncertainty.</p>  <p>  Government has  decided that from 17 September the Pandemic Unemployment Payment will be paid at three rates linked to a person's pre-covid employment earnings.  Individuals whose prior earnings were &euro;300 or over per week receive a payment of &euro;300 per week.  A rate of &euro;250 applies to those who previously earned between &euro;200 and &euro;300 per week; and the rate of &euro;203 remains unchanged for those who had prior earnings of less than &euro;200 per week.</p>  <p>  For self-employed people there is some flexibility to take up occasional or intermittent work without it affecting their pandemic unemployment payment. The once off or occasional work should be infrequent and must show a clear divergence from previous work patterns. Where the work become regular or highly paid then the individual should close their payment as they would not satisfy the eligibility conditions for the scheme.</p>  <p>  Where a self- employed person is engaged in regular employment they may be able to apply for a jobseekers payment, depending on their circumstances, which also provides increased allowances for adult and child dependents.  Under the jobseekers schemes a person may take up employment but they must be fully unemployed for 4 in 7 consecutive days. </p>  <p>  A self-employed individual may also be able to avail of my Department&rsquo;s enterprise support grant that provides support of up to &euro;1,000 with business re-start costs where they transition from the pandemic unemployment payment. To date approximately  2,750 people have benefited from this grant. Full details of the funding and the application process are available on www.gov.ie</p>  <p>  Any person who is experiencing financial hardship may access assistance under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme including Exceptional and Urgent Needs Payments.  Information on the supports available under this scheme is available at www.gov.ie</p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the matter at this time. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-09-29a.1346.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020092900088#WRY05900"><p>The Citizens Information Board (CIB) is the statutory body responsible for supporting the provision of information, advice (including money and budgeting advice) and advocacy services on a wide range of public and social services. CIB delivers on this remit through its provision of some services directly to the public and through a network of service delivery companies.</p>  <p>  In February 2017, following lengthy and extensive analysis of options and a detailed consultation period with all stakeholders,  CIB made the decision to restructure the governance arrangements of the existing network of 42 Citizens Information Services (CIS&rsquo;s) and 51 Money Advice and Budgeting Services (MABS) into 16 regional companies comprising 8 Regional CIS companies and 8 Regional MABS companies. </p>  <p>  As part of the restructuring process, new boards of directors were appointed. All staff, assets and liabilities of the 93 local companies transferred to the 16 new regional companies. The restructuring process was completed in October 2018 and the 16 new companies have been operating effectively since then. There have been no job losses, no closure of service delivery points and no diminution in services provided to clients. </p>  <p>  The aim of the restructuring was to enhance the service for users by improving the governance arrangements for CIB&rsquo;s funded services and to unlock the benefits of a more modern and streamlined citizen-focused service delivery model.</p>  <p>  New service - level agreements are in place for all the new companies, in line with good governance requirements. It has also been possible to gain efficiencies in the provision of support services for both CIS and MABS companies with a number of shared services now in place, including payroll services, legal and financial advice on pensions, and a single insurance scheme. </p>  <p>  At the service delivery level, the regional companies now have more flexibility in allocating staff resources to areas of need, and specialist skills are more easily shared. Administrative resources freed up from previous work associated with supporting 93 local companies are now focused directly on clients&rsquo; requirements. In MABS, more regular case reviews are being undertaken and there is an increased focus on quality assurance and on achieving improved outcomes for clients.</p>  <p>  CIB continues to support the regional companies and works with them as they respond  in an efficient, effective and flexible manner to the needs of clients. This is evident in the response by the regional services during the Covid-9 pandemic when both the CIS and MABS regional networks were able to respond quickly and efficiently to share resources, and develop new and innovative ways to serve clients including a new call back service, instant messaging service and increased use of social media to meet their clients' information needs.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy </p></reply>

In total Government has spent over &euro;3.5 bn on PUP payments.</p>  <p>  From 17 September the PUP is being paid at three rates linked to a person's pre-covid employment earnings.  Individuals whose prior earnings were &euro;300 or over per week will receive a payment of &euro;300 per week.  A rate of &euro;250 will apply to those who previously earned between &euro;200 and &euro;300 per week; and the rate of &euro;203 remains unchanged for those who had prior earnings of less than &euro;200 per week.</p>  <p>  The changes to the payment rate means that Government is in a position to extend the scheme until April next and make it more sustainable by linking it to previous earnings. The new rates remain higher than the general weekly personal social welfare payments for people of working age, payable at &euro;203.</p>  <p>  In the interest of equality and fairness it is important that the pandemic unemployment payment rate changes apply to all scheme recipients as it would not be appropriate to make exceptions for those who had previously worked in a particular sector or location, while applying the changes to other recipients who are facing similar financial challenges.</p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the position for the Deputies.</p></reply>

The projected expenditure on Carer&rsquo;s Allowance in 2020 is approximately &euro;919 million.  Combined spending on all these payments to carers in 2020 is expected to exceed &euro;1.3 billion.</p>  <p>  Carer's Allowance is a means tested payment made to people whose income falls below certain limits, and who are looking after certain people in need of full-time care and attention.</p>  <p>  This allowance is part of the system of social assistance supports that provide payments based on an income need.  The means test plays a critical role in determining whether or not an income need arises as a consequence of a particular contingency &ndash; such as disability, unemployment or caring.  This ensures that the recipient has a verifiable income need and that resources are targeted to those who need them most.</p>  <p>  Current disregards for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance are &euro;332.50 per week for a single person and &euro;665 per week for a couple, making the means test for carers the least onerous within the social protection system.</p>  <p>  A couple earning a joint annual income of up to &euro;37,500 (net of PRSI and other allowable deductions) can qualify for maximum payment and, given the tapered withdrawal approach, retain a payment of just under half-rate while earning &euro;49,750.  A single person may retain a full-rate payment while having an annual income of just under &euro;19,000, and retain a payment of just under half-rate while having an annual income of &euro;25,400.</p>  <p>  The Department has made an estimate of the cost of increasing the weekly income disregards for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance to &euro;450 for a single person and to &euro;900 for a couple using the ESRI SWITCH model.  This analysis suggests that it would cost in the region of an additional &euro;73 million per annum with net expenditure estimated in the order of &euro;55 million per annum.</p>  <p>  Changes to schemes are considered in an overall budgetary and policy context and from an evidence based perspective.  Some 92% of the current recipients of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance have no means or means of less than &euro;7.60 per week and would not benefit by an increase in the disregard.</p>  <p>  My Department also offers other, non-means-tested supports to carers.  The Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant is not mean-tested and is available to all carers who meet the eligibility criteria.  The payment is not dependent on a person receiving a weekly carer&rsquo;s payment.  This non-taxable grant of &euro;1,700  is payable annually in June.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that I am very much aware of the key role that family carers play in our society and I will continue to keep the range of supports available to carers under review; however, any changes to scheme criteria would have implications for overall spending and would need to be addressed in an overall budgetary context.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This Government acknowledges the important role that carers play and is fully committed to supporting them in that role. Officials in my Department will be examining the policy options for reforming the state pension system both in this area, and more generally in relation to considerations around a Total Contributions Approach.</p>  <p>  The public policy and social issues in relation to funding a sustainable and adequate State pension system are complex.  That is why the Programme for Government also commits to the establishment of a Commission on Pensions to examine a range of issues including contributions, calculation methods, sustainability, eligibility and intergenerational fairness.  The Terms of Reference for the Commission on Pensions are currently being developed and options for its membership are being considered.  I will bring proposals in that regard to Government as soon as possible.  Once it has concluded its deliberations, the Commission will report to Government by June of next year. </p>  <p>  In the meantime, the current situation is that through the award of credited contributions, normally known as credits, the social insurance system gives significant recognition to time spent caring in terms of qualifying for the State Pension (Contributory).  Credits protect social insurance entitlements by bridging gaps in an employee&rsquo;s social insurance record, where they are not in a position to pay PRSI, such as during periods spent caring.  In combination with paid PRSI contributions, credits assist employees in qualifying for short-term schemes and enhance the level of benefit for long-term schemes.  Credits are awarded to recipients of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance (and Carer&rsquo;s Benefit) where they have an underlying entitlement to credits.  Recipients of these payments qualify for credits where they have at least one paid contribution in the previous two years or have had credited contributions in that period.  Credits are also awarded to workers who take unpaid Carer&rsquo;s Leave from work.</p>  <p>  In addition, all carers, including those who do not qualify for a payment or for credits, may qualify for the Homemaker scheme.  The scheme, which was introduced in and from 1994, is designed to help homemakers and carers qualify for State Pension (Contributory).  Years spent caring on a full-time basis are disregarded when calculating the State Pension (Contributory) rate of payment when the rate of pension is calculating using the Yearly Average method.</p>  <p>  When the Interim Total Contributions Approach (also known as T12) was introduced in 2018, it included provision for the HomeCaring Periods Scheme which fundamentally changed the entitlement of many who spent time out of the workforce caring for others.  It, for the first time, acknowledged home caring periods prior to 1994 and provides for up to 20 years of home caring periods to be considered.  Those who have a 40 year record of paid and credited social insurance contributions, subject to a maximum of 20 years of credits / homecaring periods, qualify for a maximum contributory pension where they satisfy the other qualifying conditions for the scheme. Arising from this initiative, the Department reviewed over 94,000 cases resulting in over 38,000 receiving an increased pension payment.</p>  <p>  Since April 2019 all new State (Contributory) Pension applications are assessed under all possible rate calculation methods, including the Yearly Average and Interim Total Contributions Approach, with the most beneficial rate paid to the pensioner.</p>  <p>  It should be noted if a person does not satisfy those conditions, they may qualify for the means-tested State Pension (Non-Contributory), the maximum rate of which is over 95% that of the maximum rate of the State Pension (Contributory).  Alternatively, if their spouse is a State pensioner and they have significant household means, their most beneficial payment may be an Increase for a Qualified Adult, based on their personal means, and amounting to up to 90% of a full contributory pension.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

When such a redundancy payment is made from the Fund, a debt is raised against the employer.  The Department will engage with employers on a case by case basis to recover the debt on a mutually-agreed, phased basis, repaying by instalment, as appropriate.</p></reply>

This includes any supports, including financial supports, that are required by either the foster parents or the foster children that specifically relate to fostering.</p><p>Under the current social welfare legislation, in order to qualify for payment of One-Parent Family Payment (OFP) an applicant must be a qualified parent of at least one relevant child who is ordinarily resident in the State, is not detained in a children detention school, and has not attained the relevant age. The relevant age is currently 7 years of age.Additional scheme conditions also apply.</p><p>A qualified parent is:</p><p>(a) a widow, </p><p>(b) a widower, </p><p>(c) a separated spouse, </p><p>(d) an unmarried person, </p><p>(e) a person whose spouse or civil partner has been committed in custody to a prison or place of detention for not less than 6 months, or </p><p>(f) a surviving civil partner,</p><p>(g) a civil partner who is not living with the other civil partner of the civil partnership, or</p><p>(h) a person who is not a party to a civil partnership  </p><p>who is the parent, step-parent, adoptive parent, or legal guardian of at least one relevant child, who normally resides with that person.Additional qualifying conditions also apply.  </p><p>To be a qualified parent the applicant must therefore be legally defined as either the parent or guardian of the relevant child.  A foster parent is not the legal parent or guardian of the foster child and as such is not a qualified parent and cannot qualify for OFP with the foster child as the relevant child.</p><p>Lone foster parents are treated in the same manner as all lone parents in terms of the social welfare income support payments that are available to them from this Department &ndash; assuring, in the process, equal treatment for all lone parents. All lone parents must satisfy the conditionality requirements of the OFP scheme. </p><p>While there are no specific provisions for foster children in the legislation relating the OFP scheme, provision is effectively made for foster children on the basis of the legislation covering the payment of increases for qualified children (IQCs). This legislation provides that, where the relevant conditions are met, all qualified children &ndash; including foster children &ndash; will be paid as a child dependent on these schemes. On that basis, foster children are treated in the same manner as the recipient&rsquo;s own children, once the recipient has an underlying entitlement to the scheme.  For example, if a foster parent has children of his/her own one of whom is under 7 years of age, and meets the other conditions of the OFP scheme, s/he can qualify for OFP and will be paid an IQC for his/her own children and the foster child.</p><p>In addition foster care allowances from Tusla are not taken into account in the means test for social welfare payments.  Where a child has been placed in foster care by Tusla and the child has been in the continuous care of the foster parent(s) for 6 months, Child Benefit may then transfer to the foster parent(s).</p><p>I do not have plans to include a foster parent in the definition of a qualified parent for the purposes of determining eligibility for one-parent family payment (OFP).</p></reply>

It found that the Pandemic Unemployment Payment and Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme significantly softened the financial impact of Covid-19 on families and household income. Families in the lower 40% of the income distribution were better insulated from income losses due to a combination of the pre-existing tax-benefit system, the pandemic policy measures and the fact that such families were less likely to contain someone in employment.  Additional Budget Perspective 2021 papers focused on the implications of Covid-19 for minimum wage employment; and the effect of the pandemic on consumption and indirect tax.</p>  <p>  With regard to the benefits of social protection payments, we know that social transfers in Ireland are highly effective in alleviating poverty. This is most evident when considering the At Risk of Poverty rate (the percentage of the population with incomes below 60% of the median income), produced by the CSO from the annual Survey on Income and Living Conditions.  The most recently available data is for 2018 and shows that social transfers reduced the national at risk of poverty rate by over half from 30.2% (before social transfers) to 14%. </p>  <p>  My Department undertakes social impact assessments of the main welfare and direct tax budgetary policies, before and after the Budget each year.  The Social Impact Assessment (SIA) is an evidence-based methodology which estimates the likely distributive effects of policies on household incomes, families and poverty.  The analysis is generated through the ESRI&rsquo;s tax/benefit micro-simulation model, SWITCH, which has recently been upgraded and will allow some analysis of the impact of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment and the Temporary Wage Subsidy.</p>  <p>  With regard to specific socio-economic research, my Department has funded a poverty and social inclusion research programme since 1987.  Research topics are selected to reflect current national and EU policy priorities and this research informs policy implementation and the development of new policies within the Department.  The contract for a new poverty and social inclusion research programme has been awarded to the ESRI.  It is expected the resulting research will include analysis of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the most vulnerable in Irish society, as well as inform the implementation of the Roadmap for Social Inclusion 2020 &ndash; 2025.  In addition, my Department monitors independent research on areas of interest and commissions research where required. </p>  <p>  I hope that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

In order to ensure that the scheme was simple and accessible for the unprecedented number of applicants, a flat payment rate was introduced. This rate was the equivalent of the rate for a two-person household. </p>  <p>  From 26 June 2020, the Pandemic Unemployment Payment moved to 2 rates of payment, and a 3 rate structure is in place since 17 September. These changes more closely link the rate of payment to the amount that individuals previously earned and make the scheme more targeted and fair. In determining the rate payable, the objective was to ensure that recent earnings were taken into account. </p>  <p>  For employees, the greater of their gross weekly earnings in either 2019 or January to February 2020 was used to determine the rate of Pandemic Unemployment Payment.  The period January to February 2020 was chosen as this represented the period immediately before the majority of individuals lost their employment due to the Covid-19 Pandemic and was representative of average earnings. It is not intended to extend the period where 2020 earnings are assessed beyond that period, as this would require significant IT development work, potentially compromising the delivery of other essential work. </p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

These applications were processed as quickly as possible, with almost 59,000 people paid in the first week of the scheme, 283,000 people paid in the following week, and over 507,000 people in the third week of the scheme. </p>  <p>  My Department is keenly aware that many people are due some arrears and that every case will be different. In order to address an issue of this scale, the Department is currently developing an automated process, which will examine each case and look at their overall entitlement to payment and match this against their payment history. The work involved is complex as the Pandemic Unemployment Payment system itself evolved from a manual applications system to one where applications were submitted online and paid over two different payment platforms (one from March to July and the second from July to date).</p>  <p>  Given the complexity attached to the project, it will take some time yet to complete the necessary development work to review all cases and to determine to what extent, if any, arrears are due to individuals. I can assure the Deputy that this is a priority for the Department and it is hoped to make payments before end of the year . It is intended that awarded and closed cases will be identified for arrears payments at the same time. </p>  <p>  I hope that this clarifies matters for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The underlying rationale for the proposal is to bring greater coherence to the social insurance system from a contribution/benefits perspective as well as to better balance the contribution base across employment types.</p>  <p>  A commitment in the Programme for Government is to give consideration to increasing all classes of PRSI over time to replenish the Social Insurance Fund to help pay for measures and changes to be agreed including to the State pension system, improvements in short-term sick pay benefits, parental leave benefits, pay-related jobseeker's benefit and treatment benefits.  It is expected that the proposal in the Department's paper will inform that consideration.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The lack of consistency of care caused by high staff turnover impacts directly on quality, while low wages are a constraint on plans to upskill and professionalise the workforce.  I have met with employee and employer representatives on a number of occasions and have listened to their concerns.  I will consider any proposals which seek to resolve the difficulties faced by the sector, including the proposals for Budget 2021 shared with me by the Deputies.</p>  <p>  However, there are significant challenges associated with implementing the proposals put forward in the SIPTU Big Start Campaign, including the current economic context in which Budget 2021 is being prepared.  In particular, as the State is not the employer, my Department does not pay the wages of staff working in early learning and care settings, and cannot set wage levels or determine working conditions for these staff. </p>  <p>  I am, however, doing all that is in my power to improve wages and working conditions in the sector in the context of the wide range of policy ambitions of Government and likely budget constraints from 2021 onwards.</p>  <p>  Overall, Budget 2020 saw a 9% increase in investment in early learning and care and school age childcare.  Additional investment of &euro;63.6m brought spending to &euro;638m in 2020, a 141% increase in investment over five budgets.  This increase has included specific measures to assist employers to improve the pay and conditions of their staff whilst also addressing administrative demands, such as: a 7% increase in ECCE capitation in 2018; higher capitation payments for graduates and Inclusion Coordinators; support for school-age childcare which will make it easier to offer full-time, full-year employment contracts; and a pilot measure to fund participation in CPD.</p>  <p>  Nevertheless, whilst this welcome level of investment needs to continue if we are to offer services that are of high quality, affordable and accessible, increased investment by itself will not ensure that staff wages and conditions will improve.</p>  <p>  Work continues to progress the Workforce Development Plan, which will set out plans to raise the profile of careers in the sector, establishing role profiles, career pathways, qualifications requirements, and associated policy mechanisms along with leadership development opportunities and working towards a more gender-balanced and diverse workforce.</p>  <p>  I launched an extensive consultation with the sector on the Workforce Development Plan on 19 August.  The consultation process includes a call for submissions/survey which is available to anyone who wishes to provide feedback.  On 22 September, I addressed an online information webinar on the consultation process, which was very well attended.  This event provided an update to the sector on the consultation process and how those working in the sector can take part.</p>  <p>  Delivering on a further commitment in First 5, an expert group has been appointed to examine the current model of funding for early learning and care and school-age childcare and its effectiveness in delivering quality, affordable, sustainable and inclusive services.  The Expert Group is independently chaired and includes national and international experts in early learning and care systems, funding and quality, economics, and policy experts from a number of Government Departments.  A public consultation process on the development of a new funding model is taking place in parallel to the public consultation on the Workforce Development Plan.</p></reply>

Ireland has committed to bringing four children from Moria in the coming weeks. </p><p>The state&rsquo;s capacity to bring unaccompanied children to Ireland is determined by the available care placements, and the commitments the state has made to unaccompanied children who are already here.</p><p>Due to the level of need among refugees since the destruction of the Moria camp, I am seeking to expand Ireland&rsquo;s capacity to care for unaccompanied children.  My Department and Tusla officials are examining the immediate requirements to fulfil Ireland&rsquo;s existing commitments, including expansion of care placements and working with Department of Justice officials to identify unaccompanied children who wish to come to Ireland.  </p><p>Ireland provides care for two groups of unaccompanied children - children who arrive as part of refugee relocation programmes, and children who arrive without parents or guardians to ports of entry and seek asylum.  All children who are unaccompanied are received into care under the Child Care Act 1991. </p><p>Both categories of child are sometimes referred to as unaccompanied minors or UAMs and are cared for by the same Tusla specialist team called the Separated Children Seeking Asylum Team.  The young people are, in the main, young boys aged between 15 and 17 years on arrival. </p><p><b><i>Separated Children Seeking Asylum (SCSA)</i></b><i>.</i></p><p>This is the largest cohort of unaccompanied children who come into Tusla care when they present to the immigration authorities at our sea and air ports.  The service provided to these children is demand-led, and accurately estimating future demand is challenging, particularly as the effects of Brexit are yet to be seen.  The children are received into care at are placed in residential and foster care.</p><p><b></b>Tusla's Separated Children Seeking Asylum team received 167 referrals in 2019.  These referrals include children who arrive unaccompanied at a port of entry but who have an adult relative or friend who lives in Ireland and is willing to care for them.  The SCSA team carries out preliminary enquiries to ensure that the person has a genuine relationship with the child, and does agree to care for them before placing the child in their care. </p><p>The children who do not have adult relatives or guardians are received into care, and there were 46 of these children in 2019. </p><p><b><i>Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP)</i></b></p><p>The Irish Refugee Protection Programme is administered by the Department of Justice and Equality.  Since 2017, Tusla has participated in the European Union Relief Projects (EURP) which include IRPP, Calais Special Project (CSP), Malta Relief, Greece Relief.

Between 2016 and 2020 the annual current youth funding available to my Department increased from &euro;51.9m to &euro;61.79m.  This additional funding is being used for programmes that target disadvantaged young people and to assist national youth organisations in their work to support local voluntary youth services. </p><p>In addition, in 2020, my Department launched the most significant reform of youth services ever undertaken with the launch of <i>UBU Your Space Your Place</i>.  This will provide an opportunity to identify need and to focus funding on young people most in need of intervention. </p><p>I recognise the value of youth work from both a social and an economic viewpoint, so strengthening our investment in youth work makes sense.  In this regard, I am committed to increasing the budget for youth service funding should available resources allow.</p></reply>

Following careful examination, the Board was not satisfied that fair procedures had been applied before the report was finalised and submitted.  In light of the legal risks associated with publication, the Board, with great reluctance, decided not to publish the report.  The Board considered it necessary to strike the balance between the public interest in publishing the report and avoiding the substantial legal risks associated with such publication.  The Board published the recommendations of the review in full, together with a detailed Board response to each recommendation.</p>  <p>  The then Minister also sought the advice of the Attorney General, who advised that publication of the report was fraught with legal risk.  Following detailed consideration of the complex matters involved, she concluded that it was not appropriate to publish the full report. This remains the position.</p></reply>

In response to such situations, a number of policy and legislative improvements have been made to child protection standards over recent years. In particular, the Children First Act 2015, which was fully commenced in 2017, provides for a number of key child protection measures, including improving child protection arrangements in organisations providing services to children.</p>  <p>  The Act places an obligation on these organisations to keep children safe from harm, to carry out a risk assessment and to develop a Child Safeguarding Statement (CSS) that outlines the policies and procedures that are in place to manage any risks identified. The Act also provides for Tusla to establish and maintain a register of non-compliance for organisations who fail to provide a copy of the CSS to Tusla when requested to do so. Tusla has established a Child Safeguarding Statement Compliance Unit (CSSCU) to support implementation of these provisions of the Act. The register of non-compliance is available on the Tusla website www.tusla.ie.</p>  <p>  Tusla has advised the Department that its Child Safeguarding Statement Compliance Unit engaged with St John's ambulance in 2019 and it was deemed to have a compliant safeguarding statement. </p>  <p>  While nothing can undo abuse people have experienced in the past, I hope that this provides some assurance that there are strong measures in place to protect other young people now and in the future.</p>  <p>  I'm sure you can appreciate that I cannot comment on matters before the courts, which is the case in this situation.  I must also advise that the remit of my Department does not extend into the governance of this charitable organisation.</p></reply>

The Commission is due to submit its final report to me next month and its remit includes investigating the entry and exit pathways for mothers and their children through certain Mother and Baby Homes. As Minister, I cannot pre-empt the findings of the Commission and I do not intend to make any public statement on historic adoption issues in advance of the final report. </p>  <p>  In terms of illegal birth registrations, the Commission's second interim report recognised that these individuals have a need to establish their identity, but also acknowledged that the false registration of births is a very difficult issue to investigate because of a lack of accurate records. The Deputy will be aware that in the case of St Patrick&rsquo;s Guild, detailed records were kept and 151 cases of illegal birth registrations were identified by Tusla.  The process of contacting and then supporting those affected by the illegal birth registrations uncovered on those files is reaching completion, and is being handled very carefully, on a case by case basis, and at the pace of the individual concerned.  Tusla social workers are supporting the individuals affected as they deal with the news of their illegal birth registration and have put in place a dedicated counselling service.  </p>  <p>  In relation to the issue of information and tracing in the context of adoption, the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill 2016 has lapsed and I am currently considering the complex matters involved before deciding on how best to legislate in this important area.</p>  <p>  I believe it is acknowledged by all parties that adoption in the past was often a secretive process, carried out sometimes without due regard to the rights and interests of those involved, and to the lifelong impact on those individuals. However, adoption today is a service for children, to provide a family to care for them when their parents are unable to do so, and where adoption is in their best interests. </p>  <p>  Today, the safeguards in the adoption acts ensure that the best interests of the child are the paramount consideration in all adoption cases, and in every step of the process. Modern day adoption legislation and practice also ensures that the rights of all involved are vindicated, including birth fathers, within the overarching framework of working for the best interests of the child involved. </p>  <p>  I expect to be in a position to comment in more detail on the issues raised by the Deputy, in the context of the Mother and Baby Homes Commission of Investigation's final report.</p></reply>

The Commission is tasked with providing a full account of what happened to vulnerable women and children in these institutions. </p>  <p>  I am acutely aware of the importance of this Commission's work and how much its final report is anticipated by former residents and their families. </p>  <p>  Notably, all of the specific concerns raised by the Deputy are central to the Commission's terms of reference. The Commission has the robust statutory powers, resources and expertise necessary to examine these matters in a way that has never been possible before. </p>  <p>  I absolutely share the desire of all interested parties to see the Commission conclude its work, and I look forward to receiving the final report at the end of October. However, in the interim, it is not appropriate to pre-empt the findings and conclusions of the Commission on these deeply personal and sensitive matters. To do so could potentially compromise the outcome of this important work. </p>  <p>  As members of an Oireachtas which called for the establishment of this Commission, we owe it to all those who have so courageously shared their experiences with the Commission, to carefully and calmly examine its final report before responding. Our duty to the women and children who passed through these institutions, and to their families, is to ensure that their lived experiences are shared, acknowledged and understood.</p>  <p>  When the Commission delivers its final report next month, its conclusions on all matters regarding the treatment of former residents of Mother and Baby Homes, and related institutions, will be taken into careful consideration in determining the appropriate State response.</p></reply>

There is no official data on the extent of such shortages. However, officials in my Department have been actively monitoring the issue and have sought data and evidence-based proposals from sectoral representatives on the Covid Advisory Group on Reopening, which has been meeting regularly over recent months. The Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme is available to the early learning and childcare sector, with a full exemption to the turnover rule, to assist them with staffing costs.</p><p>I am committed to supporting providers in responding to current challenges. In designing responses, it is important that any measures considered are proportionate to the problem they seek to address and that wider impacts would be carefully considered. In that regard, it is important to stress that the minimum qualification requirement to work directly with children in an early learning care service (Level 5 on the National Framework of Qualifications) was introduced in 2016 in order to improve the quality of provision and to achieve better outcomes for children. (There is currently no minimum qualification requirement for staff working in school-age childcare.) To remove this minimum qualification requirement could be contrary to the best interests of children and the vision for the sector that is outlined in <i>First 5</i>, the whole-of-Government strategy to improve the lives of babies, young children and their families. Such a move could be a significant backwards step in efforts to improve quality outcomes for children and could only be considered if there were a very strong evidence base requiring a change. </p><p>Staffing and recruitment difficulties are being caused not by insufficient supply of qualified personnel, but by high levels of turnover and attrition. This is predominantly down to poor terms and conditions in the workforce, with for example, the average pay being &euro;12.55 per hour, and half of staff only being able to access part-time contracts. It is expected that poor terms and conditions will be addressed in the medium to long term via three plans currently being pursued by Government: a new funding model, a workforce development plan and additional investment. Short-term measures are more challenging to find and, as stated above, the Department continues to work intensively with sectoral representatives to examine what might be possible. One potential solution that has been proposed by the sector is being given active attention at the moment by the Department of Education and Skills and my Department.</p><p>With reference to the example suggested by the Deputy of allowing retired teachers to work in the sector, individuals who hold qualifications to teach in primary schools have previously been approved by my Department to work in early learning and care services, and my Department&rsquo;s list of recognised qualifications includes a number of teaching qualifications. In reality this is not likely to be a major source of staff due to the sectoral terms and conditions referred to above. The list of qualifications eligible to work in the sector can be found on my Department&rsquo;s website. Any individual who holds a qualification not on this list may apply to my Department for recognition of their qualifications.</p></reply>

In addition, it currently holds the originals of many of the relevant institutional records.  As such, the database will provide the agency with an organised, digital system for the records it already holds, supporting the  delivery of this important public service. </p>  <p>  Tusla already dedicates substantial resources and expertise to carrying out tracing functions, and it is considered the most appropriate statutory body to take immediate possession of the database, given the time restraints. In this way the proposed legislation is interfering with existing arrangements in the most minimal manner.</p>  <p>  By contrast, a transfer to any other body, such as the Adoption Authority of Ireland (AAI), would mean that two different statutory bodies would hold the same records, with Tusla holding the originals and the AAI holding the database and associated copies.  Such duplication would be inefficient, lead to confusion and is not the preferred approach at this time. </p>  <p>  The immediate and urgent policy intent in drafting a Records Bill is to ensure the Commission's database, and related records, are preserved and available to support current and future tracing services. It is my intention to separately legislate for an enhanced information and tracing service and further consideration will be given to the prescribed body which will carry out these functions in the development of that legislation.</p></reply>

While adoption today is a child focused service, aimed at providing a family for a child where their own parents are unable to care for them, in the past, the focus of adoption was often on the needs of adults. This includes both adoptive parents, who may have been stigmatised as unable to have children, and also unmarried parents, in particular unmarried mothers of so-called &ldquo;illegitimate&rdquo; children.</p><p>In the development of the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill 2016, my Department received submissions from multiple stakeholders, including natural or birth parents, adoptive parents, and adopted people.</p><p>My Department has also had engagement with social workers who have years of experience working with natural mothers. These social workers have conveyed to the Department the serious concerns which some natural mothers have about the potential release of their information. In particular, they have indicated that, at the time of the child&rsquo;s birth and placement for adoption, these birth mothers understood that their details would never be released. Some such birth mothers have spoken of how they were promised no contact would ever be made. It must be remembered that this happened in the context of secrecy around the adoption process in the past, and in a social climate where to be an unmarried mother was seen as shameful.</p><p>Many of these natural mothers were encouraged to keep the fact that they had placed a child for adoption secret, and have never told anyone, including their subsequent spouses and children. Consequently, the prospect of the release of their information makes them extremely fearful for the future of their relationships with their families, spouses, children, and wider community. It must also be remembered that many of these natural mothers are now at an advanced age, or are vulnerable for other reasons, including as survivors of incest and rape. </p><p>While there are many birth mothers who are happy to share their personal information with their children, it is clear this is not the case for all of them. </p><p>The advice received from the Attorney General in the development of the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill 2016 was clear: there must be some protection of birth parents' constitutional right to privacy reflected in the legislation. There are two rights at play - the right to identity and the right to privacy - and legislation must seek to harmonise these rights, as held by the Supreme Court in the <i>I.O&rsquo;T v B</i>decision. </p><p>I am continuing to consider how best to progress these complex issues, and I intend to bring forward legislative proposals in due course.</p></reply>

That decision by Government, and the subsequent establishment, under the law, of the Commission, had indelible consequences for the format of the investigation that was to be conducted, for the mode of engagement with the Commission by third parties who gave evidence, for the rights of those third parties, for the Commission&rsquo;s report, and for its records. </p>  <p>  The entire premise of the 2004 Act is that investigations are held in private. Where commissions are held entirely in private, their records constitute confidential evidence given in private. That confidentiality applies seamlessly to the evidence and records gathered by the inquiry, both during the life of a commission of investigation itself, and after its dissolution when records have been deposited with the Minister.</p>  <p>  The GDPR right to access personal data is expressly restricted by the Commissions of Investigations Act 2004. The 2004 Act provides for the means whereby the archive, and the confidentiality of that archive, are to be preserved. Any disclosure by a department of the records deposited with it is prohibited by law and would be an offence.</p>  <p>  Section 11(3) of the 2004 Act will continue to prohibit disclosure of evidence given or the contents of any document produced by a witness while giving evidence in private, except in very limited exceptions which would not be applicable in this instance. After a 30 year period has elapsed, decisions on access at that time and thereafter are governed by Section 8 of the National Archives Act. </p></reply>

Section 43(2) of the Act directs that, on submission of its final report, the Commission will stand dissolved, and, prior to its dissolution, it must deposit all records with the prescribed Minister. On the expiry of a 30 year period, such records are considered for transfer to the National Archives and access is regulated in accordance with the National Archives Act, 1986. </p>  <p>  The records of a Commission comprise all the evidence received by, and all documents created by or for, the commission in the course of its statutory inquiries. For the avoidance of any doubt, it is important to clarify that the Commission is not in possession of original departmental records and no original records will be sealed by these arrangements. State records remain in the possession of the relevant statutory body and appropriate access is regulated in accordance with relevant statute.</p>  <p>  Given the particular challenges and opportunities raised by the Mother and Baby Home Commission of Investigation in relation to the finalisation of its records, I sought Government approval for the urgent drafting of legislation to provide a bespoke solution to this issue. The proposed legislation provides certainty as to the immediate future of the specific database and associated records. The development of this database could be one of the most significant outcomes from the Commission&rsquo;s work. I am satisfied that the Houses of the Oireachtas has the power to legislate in these terms.  I am also mindful of the need to achieve this policy objective in a manner which does not undermine the current legal framework for current or future Commissions of Investigation.  </p>  <p>  It must be emphasised that unrestricted use or open public access to the information contained in the database is not being proposed.  Importantly, in bringing forward this Bill, it is not proposed that it would extend to providing a basis for any new entitlement or right for access by individuals to these records. Access to personal information held in these records will continue to be regulated by the Adoption Act 2010, GDPR and Data Protection Act and the Freedom of Information Act, having regard to the constitutional rights of third parties.  </p>  <p>  In advancing this bespoke legislation, I also wish to reiterate my commitment to advancing a comprehensive statutory basis for enhanced information and tracing services, while noting the complex constitutional issues which this involves and the absolute urgency of ensuring that the Commission&rsquo;s database can be safeguarded in the immediate term.</p>  <p>  I look forward to engaging with the Deputy on the development of the new statutory framework in the near future.</p></reply>

It is on this basis that the CAO system allocates places to applicants including those from different years. To ensure impartiality, the automatic CAO points systems have been created in a way that does not allow for different treatment to be applied to different sub-groups. </p>  <p>  In order to help mitigate the impact of the changes to the grading system I announced the creation of an additional 2,225 places on high-demand courses in Higher Education Institutions. These places were provided in order ensure that as many students as possible could be accommodated on a course of their choice, given the unprecedented circumstances they are facing. These additional places meant that as of Round Two 63,338 applicants have received a CAO offer, more than in any previous year.</p>  <p>  Nonetheless, there were fluctuations in CAO points this year, as there are every year. The changes in points depend not only on the grades received by applicants but also on the number of applicants, and the number of places available. As we are in the midst of a global pandemic and economic flux, there is more volatility than usual this year due to factors such as reduced opportunities in the economy, students seeking to defer or re-apply in subsequent years and uncertainty around students travelling internationally both to and from Ireland.</p>  <p>  I appreciate how difficult a time it has been for students and parents, but I would like to stress the range of options available both in further education and training and apprenticeships, but also in pathways in higher education.

This group is comprised of representatives of relevant Government Departments alongside the representative bodies of students, staff and English language education providers.</p>  <p>  This Working Group has recently been reconstituted with an expanded membership to support the sector to develop and refine more detailed reopening protocols specifically for English language education. The ELE protocols will be in line with wider public health guidelines and the Government&rsquo;s recently published Framework for Restrictive Measures. These protocols will be informed, where appropriate, by existing protocols for comparable educational settings.  </p>  <p>  Adherence to public health guidelines must be an absolute priority for this sector with an emphasis placed on the safety and welfare of their students. Where there is a concern as regards the safe management of an ELE classroom setting, this should be reported to the appropriate authorities.

The development of new apprenticeships is employer-led, with consortia comprising employer groups and educational providers coming together to identify a skills need and appropriate apprenticeship response in their sector.  The Apprenticeship Council examine any proposals arising in the context of identified skills needs.</p>  <p>  A proposal for a Bakery apprenticeship was initiated by the sector in 2015 and a proposed level 6 programme was part developed, however ultimately a decision not to proceed was made by the consortium and this was communicated to SOLAS in July 2019. There is currently no Bakery apprenticeship in development.  </p>  <p>  It is open to any industry that wishes to explore options for developing an apprenticeship to bring a proposal forward to the Apprenticeship Council. The SOLAS Guidance Document for Submitting an Initial Proposal for a New National Apprenticeship is attached. This document together with a Handbook on Developing a National Apprenticeship, which is available on www.apprenticeship.ie, provide an overview of the key features of new apprenticeships, including sectoral engagement and collaboration among enterprises and other stakeholders in the relevant industry.  </p></reply>

Workforce planning is a key tool in enabling my Department to forecast its current and future staffing needs (subject to the limits of the annual estimates process, the usual budgetary constraints and approvals by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform). The Workforce Plan aims to ensure a long-term, proactive and strategic plan by which my Department aims to have the right people, with the right levels of talent and skills, in each location and Division, doing the right thing at the right time.  </p>  <p>  My Department operates in a rapidly changing environment and its structure must facilitate the flexibility to deploy resources to priority work, as the need arises.  As business needs arise, staff are allocated to support organisational priorities within my Department.  Overall staffing levels within Divisions are continually monitored and staff transfer in and out of Divisions as the workload demands.  Where skills gaps have been are identified, the HR Division reviews these requests on a quarterly basis and approves staff assignments on the basis of business cases made by Divisions.  One such iteration of this process has just been completed, so no requests are currently on hand for consideration from within the Department.</p>  <p>  The question of staffing levels in the State Agencies under the aegis of my Department is an operational matter, generally delegated to the Agencies themselves and I will ask the Agencies to respond directly to the Deputy on this matter.  However, I am aware of one request for additional staff resources, related to Brexit.</p></reply>

Menus must meet the reasonable dietary and cultural needs of the different ethnic groups accommodated at the centre and the reasonable prescribed dietary needs of any resident.  Menus must include a vegetarian option and all food products provided must have a traceability system that complies with food safety requirements.  </p>  <p>  Residents may advise their accommodation centre manager of any dietary requirement that they have and this will be facilitated, where possible. Arrangements can also be made to cater for particular religious needs, for example, Muslim residents who are observing Ramadan.</p>  <p>  More than 65% of all residents now have access to independent living and cooking facilities.  The aim is to have all residents in commercial centres benefitting from independent living (cooking facilities and onsite food hall) by next year.</p>  <p>  For those accommodation centres which have already moved to the independent living model, residents are provided with ingredients and household items at no cost and cook for themselves and their families.  These centres must provide a wide range of products which are culturally appropriate and meet the dietary needs of residents. </p>  <p>  In relation to emergency accommodation, my Department has contracted with providers for bed and full board (three meals per day) on an emergency basis due to insufficient capacity within my Department&rsquo;s current accommodation portfolio.  My officials are working to ensure that residents in emergency accommodation are there for as short a period as possible before being re-accommodated in dedicated accommodation centres.  My officials work closely with staff and residents in emergency accommodation to address any issues that may arise.  </p>  <p>  Complaints by residents may arise from time to time in relation to dietary matters, which may be brought to the attention of the centre manager. If the resident is not satisfied with the outcome, they can make a complaint to the International Protection Accommodation Service (IPAS) of my Department, which will be investigated by my officials and action taken as appropriate. If the issue is still not resolved to the satisfaction of the resident, they can make a complaint to the Office of the Ombudsman or to the Ombudsman for Children, as appropriate, for their investigation. </p>  <p>  All accommodation centres are also subject to regular unannounced inspections by staff from my Department and an independent inspector (QTS). Part of the inspection process deals directly with the provision of food services. Meals are assessed during inspection for quality, cultural appropriateness and variety of menu options. Any issues identified are notified to the contractor to be addressed immediately.</p>  <p>  New National Standards for Accommodation Centres were published in August 2019, which will come into operation in January 2021. The Standards include commitments in relation to the provision of food, including access to a varied diet that respects cultural, religious, dietary, nutritional and medical requirements.  </p></reply>

Menus must meet the reasonable dietary and cultural needs of the different ethnic groups accommodated at the centre and the reasonable prescribed dietary needs of any resident.  Menus must include a vegetarian option and all food products provided must have a traceability system that complies with food safety requirements. </p>  <p>  Residents may advise their accommodation centre manager of any dietary requirement that they have and this will be facilitated, where possible. Arrangements can also be made to cater for particular religious needs, for example, Muslim residents who are observing Ramadan.</p>  <p>  In 2018, in line with a recommendation made in the McMahon Report, a nutritionist  was engaged to  carry out an audit of centres. The audit report formed part of my Department's ongoing work to ensure that nutritious food is provided to residents. The report also informed the preparations for the subsequent regional tender process for accommodation, which mandated independent living for all new centres procured through that  process.</p>  <p>  More than 65% of all residents now have access to independent living and cooking facilities.  The aim is to have all residents in commercial centres benefitting from independent living (cooking facilities and onsite food hall) by next year.</p>  <p>  For those accommodation centres which have already moved to the independent living model, residents are provided with ingredients and household items at no cost and cook for themselves and their families.  These centres must provide a wide range of products which are culturally appropriate and meet the dietary needs of residents. </p>  <p>  In relation to emergency accommodation, my Department has contracted with providers for bed and full board (three meals per day) on an emergency basis due to insufficient capacity within my Department&rsquo;s current accommodation portfolio.  My officials are working to ensure that residents in emergency accommodation are there for as short a period as possible before being re-accommodated in dedicated accommodation centres.  My officials work closely with staff and residents in emergency accommodation to address any issues that may arise.  </p>  <p>  Complaints by residents may arise from time to time in relation to dietary matters, which may be brought to the attention of the centre manager. If the resident is not satisfied with the outcome, he or she can make a complaint to the International Protection Accommodation Service (IPAS) of my Department, which will be investigated by my officials and action taken as appropriate. If the issue is still not resolved to the satisfaction of the resident, he or she can make a complaint to the Office of the Ombudsman or to the Ombudsman for Children, as appropriate, for their investigation. </p>  <p>  All accommodation centres are also subject to regular unannounced inspections by staff from my Department and an independent inspector (QTS). Part of the inspection process deals directly with the provision of food services. Meals are assessed during inspection for quality, cultural appropriateness and variety of menu options. Any issues identified are notified to the contractor to be addressed immediately.</p>  <p>  New National Standards for Accommodation Centres were published in August 2019, which will come into operation in January 2021. The Standards include commitments in relation to the provision of food, including access to a varied diet that respects cultural, religious, dietary, nutritional and medical requirements. </p></reply>

I expect to reach a decision in relation to this matter over the coming days. </p>  <p>  In a previous gesture of solidarity, Ireland committed to accepting up to 36 unaccompanied minors from Greece.  Eight of these young people arrived in Ireland in June and are now in the care of Tusla. </p>  <p>  More broadly, to date, more than 3,350 people have arrived in the State under the first phase of the Irish Refugee Protection Programme. Last December, a second phase was announced giving a commitment to welcome a further 2,900 refugees between this year and 2023 through a combination of resettlement and community sponsorship. </p></reply>

The period in which Parent&rsquo;s Leave can be taken would also be extended from one year to two years.  This, and related costs, are being considered as part of the Budget 2021 process. Parent's Benefit is paid at a rate of &euro;245 per week by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.</p>  <p>  This will be a matter for Minister O'Gorman following the transfer of this function to his Department.  </p></reply>

Our procedures are continually evolving including through service improvements due to the introduction of new technology and updated work practices.  </p><p>In general, the target is that it should take around 6 months for a standard application to be processed from the date it is received to the date a decision is made. However, for a broad range of reasons, some cases will take longer than others to process.  In some instances, completing the necessary checks, including security checks can take a considerable period of time with the result in some applications taking longer than the average timescale. Processing timescales can be impacted by incomplete applications having to be returned; further documentation being required from the applicant; where the payment of the required certificate fee is awaited; or if the applicant has not been engaging with the Immigration Service of my Department. In some instances,  the input of several government agencies, both within and outside the jurisdiction is needed and the request and receipt of information from these sources can result in delays in processing some applications. Issues can also arise at the final stage of the naturalisation process, for example, where additional information comes to light which is required to be considered before a final decision is taken.  </p><p>Furthermore, the Deputy may be aware of a challenge taken in the High Court last year by an applicant who was refused a certificate of naturalisation due to his absences from the State during the last year continuous prior to the date of his application. The outcome of this ruling &ndash; which was subsequently successfully appealed to the Court of Appeal &ndash; resulted in significant delays to the processing of naturalisation applications last year.  </p><p>The number of applications for citizenship received and certificates of naturalisation issued in each of the past three years is set out in the table below.   <table>    <tr>       <th>Applications Received </th>       <th>Certificates Issued </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017 -- 11,777 </td>       <td>8,192 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018 -- 12,867 </td>       <td>8,221 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019 -- 12,275 </td>       <td>5,792 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th>Age </th>       <th>No. of Applications On Hand </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Less than 1 Year </td>       <td>8,555 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>12 to less than 18 months </td>       <td>4,412 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>18 to less than 24 months </td>       <td>2,888 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>24 months + </td>       <td>4,936 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Of the applications over 24 months old well over 80% of these were received in the preceding 24 months.  Older cases are complex in nature, maybe subject to judicial review and/or continue to be active for the range of reasons outlined above. </p><p>The figures for cases on hands also include a cohort of cases where a decision has been made and the applicant notified of same, but where the applicant has yet to swear their oath of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State, as required under the Act, and be granted their certificate of naturalisation at a citizenship ceremony arranged for the purpose.</p><p>The COVID-19 restrictions have also resulted in further significant challenges to the delivery of normal services including the disruption of the citizenship ceremonies. </p><p>The pilot online Citizenship ceremony that took place in early July gave rise to considerable learnings. A review of the pilot is in the final stages. A critical aspect of the review concerns the ability to provide a scalable solution, which satisfies the legislative requirements as laid down under the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 as amended. Any new model will need to be able to meet the requirements of applicants and my Department for an as yet indeterminate period of time.  I expect to be in a position to bring clarity to the situation shortly. </p><p>An overall review of citizenship application processing has been completed by my Department to ensure that the caseload on hand is dealt with as quickly as possible taking into account COVID and other restrictions. </p></reply>

The Act provides a modern statutory framework to support decision-making by adults with capacity difficulties. The 2015 Act was signed into law on 30 December 2015 but has not yet been fully commenced. The Act provides for the establishment of new administrative processes and support measures, including the setting up of the Decision Support Service (DSS) within the Mental Health Commission (a body under the Department of Health). </p>  <p>  A number of provisions of the 2015 Act were commenced in October 2016 in order to progress the setting up of the Decision Support Service and enable the recruitment of the Director of the DSS. Ms &Aacute;ine Flynn was appointed Director of the DSS on 2 October 2017. The commencement of Part 8 of the Act, which provides a legislative framework for advance healthcare directives, is a matter for the Minister for Health. </p>  <p>  The implementation of the 2015 Act requires that the DSS is fully operational and in a position to offer services including the new decision-making support options. A high-level Steering Group comprising senior officials from my Department, the Department of Health, the Mental Health Commission, the Courts Service and the HSE, together with the Director of the DSS, is overseeing the establishment and commissioning of the DSS and this work is ongoing. The DSS, led by its Director, is working on putting in place the necessary infrastructure to support the full commencement of the Act. The infrastructure required includes, amongst many other elements, ICT capability for the DSS. These preparations are being implemented under the oversight of the Steering Group and will allow for commencement orders for the main operative provisions of the 2015 Act to be made when the necessary preparations have been completed. This will enable the DSS to roll out the new decision-making support options. </p>  <p>  My Department has sought and received funding, through the Estimates process, over the last three years to assist the DSS in delivering on its mandate. Further funding will be necessary through the Estimates process in 2020 and 2021. In the interim, and subject to the funding allocation, my Department, in conjunction with the DSS, the Mental Health Commission and other stakeholders have agreed to an implementation plan which anticipates commencement of DSS services in mid-2022. There are also critical dependencies for the DSS on other organisations, including, for example, the Courts Service, the HSE and the Department of Health amongst others, which need to be delivered in order to achieve this timeline. The Steering Group has been meeting regularly to ensure a coordinated approach to the implementation of this project.</p>  <p>  As this is a function that is due to transfer, it will of course be a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, to bring this matter forward. </p></reply>

Periods of unlawful residence, periods of residence which were for the sole purpose of having an application for refugee status determined or periods of residence where permission was granted for the purposes of study are excluded from the reckonable residence. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to create new pathways for long-term undocumented people and their dependents meeting specified criteria to regularise their status within 18 months of the formation of the Government, bearing in mind European Union and Common Travel Area commitments. Ireland along with other Member States of the EU, has committed, under the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum (2008), to a case-by-case approach as opposed to mass regularisation.  However, the Government recognises that some of our own citizens face similar challenges abroad and is sympathetic to the situation of people who find themselves in an undocumented position through no fault of their own. </p>  <p>  A policy paper on the matter is being drafted by my Department at the present time, which will include an assessment of international best practices. Previous regularisation schemes, such as the 2018 Student Scheme and earlier such schemes, will also be considered in any future policy. </p></reply>

This applies to permissions that are due to expire between 20 September 2020 and 20 January 2021 and to the same 3 primary categories of persons as before: <ol type="1"><li>Those who are renewing their permission</li>;<li>Those awaiting a first registration; and </li><li>Those in the country on a short stay visa who are unable to return home due to uncertainties caused by the coronavirus pandemic.  </li></ol>This provides certainty to anyone who already holds a valid permission that their legal status in this country is maintained until 20 January 2021. Renewal is on the same basis as the existing permission and the same conditions will continue to apply. </p><p>A person who is in a long-term relationship with an Irish citizen may be eligible to apply for De Facto Partnership permission to remain in the State. In order to apply for De Facto Partnership immigration permission, a non EEA national (the Applicant) who wishes to remain the State and is in a relationship with an Irish National or an Irish Resident (the Sponsor) must be in a position to provide documentary evidence of a durable relationship, akin to marriage, with evidence of cohabitation of at least two years on the date of application. </p><p>De Facto Partnership applications are normally only accepted from individuals who have a valid permission to be in the State and are present in the State at the time of applying. However, due to the exceptional circumstances arising from COVID-19, the Immigration Service of my Department is accepting applications from non-EEA nationals who are De Facto partners of Irish citizens and are currently here on a visitor&rsquo;s permission. All applications for residence that have a De Facto element are subject to a significant degree of verification to establish the nature of the relationship.</p><p>As a temporary measure, applications can be submitted to Unit 5 Domestic Residence and Permissions Division, Immigration Service Delivery, PO Box 12595, Dublin 2 or via email to INISdefacto@justice.ie. The application form for De Facto Partner is available on the Immigration Service website for download and completion at: www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/De%20Facto%20Relationships. </p><p>Applicants must remain in the State for the duration of their application. There is no fee for De Facto Partnership applications. The Immigration Service may grant temporary residence permission (Stamp 3) while a De Facto partner application is under consideration.</p><p>It is open to an applicant to apply under Section 16(a) of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, where the applicant is of Irish descent or has Irish association. Under the legislation, a person is of Irish association if they are related by blood, affinity or adoption to, or is the civil partner of, a person (living or deceased) who is/was an Irish citizen or entitled to be an Irish citizen. A civil partner of such a person may also qualify.  </p><p>In such cases, the conditions for naturalisation set out under Section 15 of the Act, including residency may be waived on a discretionary basis. The onus is on the applicant to provide evidence of Irish descent or Irish association. </p><p>The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is governed by the provisions of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended.  All applications for a certificate of naturalisation are processed and assessed individually in accordance with the provisions of the Act.</p></reply>

In addition, the Programme for Government further commits to developing a new Youth Justice Strategy, which I intend to bring to Government later this year for approval.  This will provide an additional framework to support collaborative working by agencies and community partners to address a wide range of issues connected with youth offending, including in relation to the misuse of vehicles. </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that my Department, alongside An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Department of Transport, is acutely aware of the severe difficulties and dangers the misuse of quadbikes, scramblers and similar vehicles can cause in the communities it impacts.</p>  <p>  Targeted enforcement measures have been introduced in a number of areas where quad bikes and scramblers were causing difficulties. For example, Garda&iacute; in areas such as Finglas have had success in reducing the number of issues with scramblers through targeted enforcement, while youth community engagement groups in Limerick have had successes diverting young people away from using these vehicles in a dangerous manner in public places, and towards properly organised motocross events. </p>  <p>  A cross-agency group was established to examine this issue. The group initially included the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, as well as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Road Safety Authority, the Revenue Commissioners and representatives of local authorities.  It was subsequently agreed to meet in subgroup format involving the primary stakeholders, namely Department of Justice and Equality, Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and the Office of the Attorney General.  </p>  <p>  The subgroup most recently met this week to review the overall position. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na highlighted at the meeting their continuing enforcement actions in affected areas, including through the seizure of vehicles.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-09-29a.1935.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1502" speakername="Helen McEntee" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020092900099#WRKK04200"><p>Regulation of the processing of personal data for advertising, marketing and profiling purposes takes place under the &ldquo;legitimate interests&rdquo; ground in Article 6.1(f) of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). </p>  <p>  The European Court of Justice has already addressed the issue of whether national law could impose additional conditions on processing carried on under the corresponding provision of the 1995 Data Protection Directive in Joined Cases C-468/10 and C-469/10. In its ruling, the Court underlined the importance of free movement of personal data under the 1995 Directive and concluded that Member States were not permitted to impose additional conditions that would have the effect of amending the scope of any of the grounds in Article 7 of the Directive. Those grounds are now set out in Article 6.1 of the GDPR. </p>  <p>  The Office of the Attorney General has previously advised my Department that prohibiting or providing for an offence for any company or corporate body to process the personal data of a child for the purposes of advertising, direct marketing or profiling, appears to go beyond the margin of discretion afforded to member states in giving further effect to the GDPR and would conflict with Article 6(1)(f), read in conjunction with Recital (47).  Put simply, it is not an option for a member state to unilaterally prohibit a category of processing activities which might otherwise be lawful under Article 6.1(f). Any measure such as the one proposed by the Deputy would give rise to a substantial risk of infringement proceedings against the State pursuant to Article 258 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and would expose the State to sanctions.</p>  <p>  The European Commission have confirmed that processing of personal data for direct marketing purposes may be regarded as carried out for a legitimate interest and that Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR does not exclude processing for such purposes in relation to a child, but stresses the importance of balancing the legitimate interest of the controller with the interests and fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child. The reference to a child in Article 6(1)(f) and recital (47) underlines that such assessments must be performed with particular care where personal data of a child is processed. The Commission has pointed out that the processing of personal data of a child for the purposes of direct marketing is therefore not as such unlawful. They have also indicated that subject to Article 22 (automated decision-making), processing of personal data of a child for the purposes of profiling is not generally prohibited, albeit the processing must take into account that children merit specific protection as clarified in recital (38).  </p>  <p>  In addition to the above, in June of this year, the European Commission published its first evaluation and review of the GDPR pursuant to Article 97 GDPR.  In its report, the Commission did not recommend any substantive amendments to the Regulation, but did commit to providing tools to clarify / support the application of data protection rules to children.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Commission recommended that the European Data Protection Board adopt guidelines which are practical, easily understandable, and which provide clear answers and avoid ambiguities on issues related to the application of the GDPR, particularly in relation to the processing of children&rsquo;s data.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that the GDPR is an EU wide instrument agreed by all the member states of the European Union and one State cannot unilaterally change it, nor can we deviate from its provisions.</p></reply>

The pilot will establish a Community Safety Partnership, which will serve to prioritise issues identified by the community as safety concerns and develop proper strategic partnership approaches to a range of local issues, integrating service providers in order to holistically address community concerns. </p>  <p>  Agencies and service providers across a range of areas will work with community representatives and Garda&iacute; on community solutions to complex safety problems. Community representation will be reinforced and a partnership approach will be fostered and supported. It will also aim to increase community confidence in service providers and identify elements to improve the delivery of a national programme on community safety.</p>  <p>  In addition, A Policing Service for our Future - the Government&rsquo;s plan to implement the Report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland - envisages a review of the Joint Policing Committee structure in the context of reimagining the approach to engagement with local communities on policing issues. The objective is for community representatives to be centrally involved in a partnership approach to community safety. In the meantime, the Joint Policing Committees provided for under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 continue to operate, including in Dublin.</p></reply>

My Department, in conjunction with the HSE, is examining the issue of the provision of PPE across all parts of the health service, including health service contractors. </p>  <p>  The Dental Treatment Services Scheme (DTSS) provides dental care free of charge to medical card holders aged 16 and over. These services are provided by over 1,400  independent dental practitioners who have a contract with the HSE. I understand that since the beginning of March 149 dentists have withdrawn from the DTSS and that 36 new applications are being processed.  I expect due process to be followed in respect of any withdrawal from the terms of a DTSS contract, in particular regarding an appropriate period of notice. I also expect dentists to continue to honour their ethical and contractual obligations to patients during the notice withdrawal period, to either provide a service or to ensure that patients are referred to another dentist who will provide a service. The HSE will assist medical card holders in accessing such treatment, if required. </p>  <p>  The DTSS will need to be revised in order to align it with modern evidence on oral health needs and provision of dental services. My Department is committed to reviewing the provision of dental care for those eligible for public services and will engage with representatives of the dental profession in this regard. </p>  <p>  I am aware of the delays in accessing some services provided by the HSE, caused in part by the necessary concentration of resources at managing the current COVID-19 pandemic.  However, I understand that the HSE expect most services to return to normal in due course.</p></reply>

However, it is necessary to reduce footfall in order to protect women, babies, staff and our maternity service as a whole. </p>  <p>  Maternity hospitals have performed well during the pandemic and have continued to keep women, babies and staff safe.  The fact that there have been no Covid maternal deaths in this country, and that we have a had a low incidence in pregnant women, suggests that the current approach is working.</p>  <p>  However, we must remain vigilant as services resume and higher numbers of people attend hospitals. Maternity hospitals rely on very specialised personnel; should an outbreak of COVID-19 occur in a maternity hospital, the ability to provide safe, quality care would be severely impacted.  It should be remembered that maternity hospitals care for fragile infants at the extremes of prematurity.</p>  <p>  All maternity hospitals are challenged by the pandemic, but those challenges vary considerably.  Decisions on any restrictions are therefore made, implemented and reviewed at hospital level.</p>  <p>  Decisions to restrict visitors in our maternity hospitals have not been taken lightly.  Management and staff are acutely aware of the very important support provided by partners at the time of birth.  I have been assured that maternity hospitals wish to facilitate this support as far as possible.   In that context, I can assure the Deputy that any restrictions currently in place have been minimised as much as possible and will be subject to ongoing review. </p>  <p>  I note that restrictions have eased somewhat in certain hospitals in recent weeks and I hope this will continue.  However, the recent rise in the numbers of people infected with the virus, including healthcare workers, is very worrying and may impact on the pace of the easing of restrictions.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that the National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme has developed a guidance document on restrictions in maternity hospitals/units and this issued to all maternity services last week. The paper seeks to ensure a consistent national approach to visitor restrictions, as far as is practicable and having due regard to local circumstances.   Each maternity service/network has been requested to review visiting arrangements on a weekly basis, in the context of the issues and factors identified in the paper.</p></reply>

This Framework sets out Ireland's approach to managing and living with COVID-19 in a range of areas over the next 6 - 9 months.</p>  <p>  The Plan sets out five levels of response, each with a number of measures designed to help us all lower COVID-19 transmission and setting out what is permitted at that moment in time. It aims to allow society and businesses to be able to operate as normally as possible, while continuing to suppress the virus. The Plan is framed to account for periods during which there is a low incidence of the disease, with isolated clusters and low community transmission, through to situations where there is a high or rapidly increasing incidence, widespread community transmission and the pandemic is escalating rapidly in Ireland and globally. It recognises the need for society and business to be allowed to continue as normally as possible and is designed so that either national or county level restrictions can be applied.</p>  <p>  Each level outlines what is permitted for social or family gatherings, organised indoor and outdoor gatherings, work and public transport, bars, hotels and restaurants, exercise activities and religious services.</p>  <p>  As I am sure the Deputies can appreciate, COVID-19 spreads when individuals and groups come into close contact with one another, enabling the virus to move from one person to another. COVID-19 is infectious in a person with no symptoms, or for the period of time before they develop symptoms. For this reason, we are all asked to be extra careful when socialising and working with others. For now, we must act like we have the virus to protect those around us from infection.</p>  <p>  The number of people allowed to gather in different scenarios in the Government Framework are based on a review of international practice and the judgment of public health experts. It seeks to balance the risks of different types of gatherings against the desire to allow normal activities to proceed in so far as possible.</p>  <p>  It is advised to socialise safely and within the capacity limits. These various limits in the Levels are all designed to reduce the number of households mixing with each other and cut down the virus&rsquo;s chances of spreading into more homes. </p>  <p>  The Deputies should note that the numbers should not be considered a target - they are the maximum recommended number. It&rsquo;s always safer to meet less people, less often, for less time. If we do this, we have a better chance of keeping to the lower Levels in the Framework, and continuing to keep businesses, schools, and healthcare services open, while also protecting the most vulnerable. </p>  <p>  Further information on the public health measures currently in place under the different Levels can be found at  www.gov.ie/en/campaigns/resilience-recovery-2020-2021-plan-for-living-with-covid-19/.</p></reply>

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) in accordance with the advice of the World Health Organisation. </p>  <p>  The resumption of services from June onwards has allowed for increased activity, with the HSE utilising innovative methods including telemedicine to facilitate patient appointments. Patient safety remains at the forefront of service resumption. To ensure services are re-introduced in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols which has resulted in reduced capacity and activity </p>  <p>  The HSE continues to optimise productivity through alternative work practices such the use of alternative settings including private hospitals, community facilities and alternative outpatient settings.</p>  <p>  The National Treatment Purchase Fund has also recommenced arranging treatment in both private and public hospitals for clinically suitable patients who have been waiting for long periods on public hospital waiting lists.</p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy is a standardised approach used by the HSE to manage scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures.  It sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists and was developed in 2014 to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. </p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

As issues around the resumption of disability day services are COVID specific, funding was sought from the National Action Plan on COVID-19.</p><p>Of this &euro;10 million, &euro;7.5 million will increase disability day services by one day a week for over 14,000 adults. &euro;2.5 million will provide 210 intensive support packages to enable children and young adults to remain at home and in their communities. </p><p>The additional funding will further support the resumption of day services, which began to gradually resume throughout August and September. However, it should be noted that capacity in day service locations will be reduced, in line with public health guidance. The HSE and service providers will keep this measure under review and as public health guidance evolves, capacity to provide supports will adapt accordingly. Both the HSE and service providers are committed to maximising the support that can be provided within these restrictions.  </p><p>I want to acknowledge the many challenges experienced by individuals and their families over this difficult time. Families across the country have had their routines upended due to the impact of COVID-19 and I hope that this will be the first step towards returning to some sense of normalcy.</p><p>The Guidance to support the Framework for Resumption of Adult Disability Day Services is available on the New Directions website: <i>www.hse.ie/newdirections</i>. The HSE have also issued monthly communications updates for service users and their families, and the latest update, a video message from the Head of Strategy and Planning HSE Disability Services, is available at the above link.  </p><p>An information portal that contains the dates on which the 966 disability day service locations reopened around the country is available. This information can be accessed at <i>www.hse.ie/newdirections</i></p><p>As the Deputy's question also pertains to a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to reply to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

It aims to allow society and businesses to be able to operate as normally as possible, while continuing to suppress the virus. The plan is framed to account for periods during which there is a low incidence of the disease, with isolated clusters and low community transmission, through to situations where there is a high or rapidly increasing incidence, widespread community transmission and the pandemic is escalating rapidly in Ireland and globally. It recognises the need for society and business to be allowed to continue as normally as possible and is designed so that either national or county level restrictions can be applied.</p>  <p>  Each level outlines what is permitted for social or family gatherings, work and public transport, bars, hotels and restaurants, exercise activities and religious services. Any measure included at any level in this plan is underpinned by expert advice and recommendations from the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET).</p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that under Level 2, those aged over 70 years and the medically vulnerable are advised to exercise judgement regarding the extent to which they engage with others and in activities outside home.</p>  <p>  The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) has published Guidance on cocooning to protect people over 70 years and those extremely medically vulnerable from COVID-19 which is available at: www.hpsc.ie/a-z/respiratory/coronavirus/novelcoronavirus/guidance/vulnerablegroupsguidance/COVID-19%20Guidance%20for%20extremely%20medically%20vulnerable%20groups.pdf. </p></reply>

The new regulations came into effect on 1 July 2014.   </p>  <p>  The 2013 Regulations retained the requirement for the person in charge to be a nurse with a minimum of three years&rsquo; experience in the area of nursing of older persons within the previous six years and that in certain circumstances the person in charge can be a registered doctor.  The 2013 regulations also provided that from 1 July 2017 any registered nurse appointed to the role of person in charge of a designated centre for older people also needs at least three years&rsquo; experience in a management capacity in the health and social care area and a post-registration management qualification in health or a related field.  </p>  <p>  Under the Regulations the registered provider is required to ensure that the number and skill mix of staff is appropriate having regard to the needs of the residents, assessed in accordance with Regulation 5, and the size and layout of the designated centre concerned. The person in charge is required to ensure that there be at least one registered nurse on duty at all times, except in circumstances where the Chief Inspector is satisfied that no resident of the designated centre concerned has been assessed as requiring full time nursing care.</p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2007 the Health Information and Quality Authority sets standards on quality and safety.  The National Standards set out what is expected in terms of the service provided to residents, with a focus on continuous development of safe and effective care.  Since the publication of the first National Quality Standards for Residential Care Settings for Older People in Ireland in 2009, the Authority has devised a framework for developing standards which was developed following a review of international and national evidence, engagement with international and national experts and applying the Authority&rsquo;s knowledge and experience of the Irish health and social care context.  Delivering improvements within quality themes depends on services having capability and capacity in four key areas, one of which is in relation to a Responsive Workforce &ndash; planning, recruiting, managing and organising staff with  the necessary numbers, skills and competencies to respond to the needs and preferences of people in residential services.  The Standards are outcome-based. The standard statement describes the high-level outcome required to deliver quality residential services and residential respite services for people.  Under each standard statement there are a list of features which give some examples of what the residential service may consider in order to meet the standard and achieve the required outcome.   </p>  <p>  The Standards provide that safe and effective recruitment practices are in place to recruit staff,  staff have the required competencies to manage and deliver person-centred, effective and safe services to all residents, staff are supported and supervised to carry out their duties to protect and promote the care and welfare of all residents and that training is provided to staff to improve outcomes for all residents.</p></reply>

To advance this, the Government is committed to establishing a new statutory scheme for the financing and regulation of home-support services, which the Department of Health is currently developing.</p>  <p>  It is intended that the new scheme will provide equitable and transparent access to high-quality services based on a person&rsquo;s assessed care-needs, and that it will operate consistently across the country. It will build on the HSE&rsquo;s continual enhancement of existing service-provision and on emerging good practice across the current system of health and social care delivery as well as supporting family and unpaid carers.</p>  <p>  The national roll-out of interRAI as the single assessment tool (incorporating the assessment of carers&rsquo; needs) will be integral to the new scheme, underpinning the provision of one streamlined process for responding to the evolving care-needs of the individual, from entry-level home-support through to intensive care in a residential setting. The system of regulation will ensure public confidence in the services provided as well as safeguarding service-users.</p>  <p>  As reflected by the National Carers' Strategy, the needs of family carers encompass a wide range of areas and involve a number of Government departments. In relation to my own role as Minister of State with responsibility for Mental Health and Older People, I am committed to listening to family carers and their representative organisations and working with my Government colleagues to ensure that we are providing the most appropriate supports to help sustain carers in their caring role.  I held a roundtable with family carers on 15 September to hear about their experience as carers and how we can best support them in their caring role, in particular, given the challenges associated with the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that under the existing National Carers' Strategy, a range of measures have been introduced or extended by the Department of Health to support family carers in recent years. Since September 2018, free GP visit cards have been extended to persons in receipt of the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance. The Programme for Government commits to further extending this service to recipients of the Carer's Support Grant. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Winter Plan will provide a very substantial increase in the number of home care hours available. The new &ldquo;Home First&rdquo; approach, emphasises reablement and providing extensive home support packages for those with more complex needs, including people with dementia, who are also being supported through the recruitment of 10 additional dementia advisors.</p></reply>

This plan will have regard to making the most efficient use of available transport resources.&rdquo;  </p>  <p>  Other transport supports available to persons with disabilities in the State include the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers scheme, operated by the Revenue Commissioners; the Free Travel Scheme operated by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection; and CL&Aacute;R funding, approved by the then Minister for Rural and Community Development, to voluntary organisations providing transport for people with significant mobility issues.</p></reply>

It provides clear guidance to employers and to workers on the measures that must be taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the workplace. Specific sectors may need to introduce additional safeguards, but this document sets out the standard set of measures to provide protection against the threat of COVID-19. </p><p>If the Deputy would like further details regarding the discussions at NPHET on the subject of meat processing plants and the food processing industry, and the recommendations and actions arising therefrom, the minutes of the NPHET meetings are publicly available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link &ndash; </p><p><i>www.gov.ie/en/collection/691330-national-public-health-emergency-team-covid-19-coronavirus/</i>. <table>    <tr>       <th>Date </th>       <th>Recommendation communicated by NPHET to Minister for Health </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>4/8/2020 </td>       <td>The NPHET recommended a series of targeted actions and supports at known areas of infection risk, including vulnerable groups and high-risk workplace environments, to immediately contain current outbreaks and to put in place sustainable measures to mitigate the risk of further outbreaks. <br /><br />Details of the recommended actions and supports can be found in the appendix to the letter of 4th August from the Acting Chief Medical Officer (ACMO) to Minister Donnelly, available at the following link - www.gov.ie/en/collection/ba4aa0-letters-from-the-cmo-to-the-minister-for-health/#august. </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>7/8/2020 </td>       <td>The NPHET emphasised the importance of proactive testing in high risk population groups and high risk workplace settings and noted that the serial programme of testing in nursing homes will recommence next week and that the HSE&rsquo;s newly established National Oversight Group for the food processing industry is considering the most appropriate and proactive approach to surveillance and testing within than industry. <br /><br /> <br /><br />The NPHET reiterated its concerns in relation to the vulnerability of high-risk populations and high-risk workplaces and reiterated the urgency with which is recommendations of the 4th August should be implemented.</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>17/8/2020 </td>       <td>Public health teams should adopt a rapid, robust and comprehensive public health response to cases in high risk settings such as food processing and construction sectors in particular and should apply a very low threshold for mass testing of employees in such settings once an initial case is identified (subject to public health risk assessment).<br /><br /> <br /><br />In line with the recommendations of the National Outbreak Control Team (NOCT), the establishment by the HSE of a National Standing Oversight Committee on COVID-19 for food processing plants to maintain an ongoing review of the impact of COVID-19 on this industry, to be available to update guidelines and to oversee the establishment of a follow-up NOCT in the event of any resurgence of outbreaks. <br /><br /> <br /><br />The NPHET agreed the interim recommendations of the  &ldquo;Investigation into a Series of Outbreaks of COVID-19 in Meat Processing Plants in Ireland&rdquo; and further recommended that the HSE&rsquo;s newly established National Standing Oversight Committee for such facilities considers, as an immediate action, the development of the most appropriate and proactive approach to surveillance and testing within the food processing industry.</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

I would also wish to underline the acute awareness of the Government of the important role which sporting activities play in communities across Ireland, and the severe impact which the restrictions that we have been living under for much of this year have had, in particular on younger people.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware, the Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with COVID-19 was published by the Government on 15 September. This Framework sets out Ireland's approach to managing and living with COVID-19 in a range of areas over the next 6 - 9 months. The Plan provides for five levels of response, each with a number of measures designed to help us all lower COVID-19 transmission and setting out what is permitted at that moment in time. </p><p>Each of the levels contains a &ldquo;basket&rdquo; of measures which are intended, collectively, to contribute to lowering the risk of transmission of the virus in relation to the anticipated degree of risk at a given time. The set of measures, individually, do not comprise a list of activities or places which are equally safe. Instead, they are &ldquo;baskets&rdquo; of measures which:</p><p>-  Are informed by public health understanding of the disease </p><p>-  Recognise that we can and must prioritise some activities over others </p><p>During this pandemic, the application of the public health advice measures to suppress the disease transmission is intended to minimise the risks to public health while attempting to strike an appropriate balance in:</p><p>-  prioritising some activities over others, including health and social care services, education and other essential needs. </p><p>-  protecting work and economic activity, and other key societal interests such as sports and important family gatherings, thereby allowing as much of society and business to continue as &ldquo;normally&rdquo; as possible while continuing to make every effort to suppress the virus.  </p><p>To inform national efforts in response to COVID-19, the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) has undertaken a significant body of work and developed evidence summaries to answer specific research questions posed by the NPHET. The HIQA evidence summary for the Spread of Covid-19 by children was published on 21 August last and is available on its website at <i>www.hiqa.ie/sites/default/files/2020-08/Evidence-Summary-for-spread-of-Covid-19-by-children-.pdf</i>. This document also provides some evidence demonstrating where the spread of Covid-19 has been linked to children's sporting activities. </p><p>The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) has published guidance to assist with the return to sports activities for children and adolescents which is available at <i>www.hpsc.ie/a-z/respiratory/coronavirus/novelcoronavirus/guidance/sportandrecreation/</i>. These recommendations outline both the necessary measures which should be taken prior to the return of children to organised sports, as well as the more general ongoing measures which need to be taken to continue to reduce the risk posed by COVID-19. These measures are aimed at minimising the risk of COVID-19 to children while enabling a returning to sports activities.</p><p>In general, COVID-19 spreads when individuals and groups come into close contact with one another, enabling the virus to move from one person to another. It is thereby considered prudent to regard team sports as carrying a higher risk of virus transmission occurring, as opposed to sports which involve less close contact among individuals and where a distance of 2 metres between participants can be maintained. </p><p>The number of people allowed to gather in different scenarios in the Government Framework are based on a review of international practice and the judgment of public health experts. It seeks to balance the risks of different types of gatherings against the desire to allow normal activities to proceed in so far as possible.</p><p>The Deputy should note that the numbers should not be considered a target - they are the maximum recommended number. It&rsquo;s always safer to meet less people, less often, for less time. If we do this, we have a better chance of keeping to the lower Levels in the Framework, and continuing to keep businesses, schools, and healthcare services open, while also protecting the most vulnerable. </p><p>Further information on the public health measures currently in place under the different Levels can be found at <i></i>.</p></reply>

A report on the overall findings of the study was published by the HPSC on its website on 21 August.  It is called &ldquo;Preliminary report of the results of the Study to Investigate COVID-19 Infection in People Living in Ireland (SCOPI): A national seroprevalence study, June-July 2020&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  Amongst its findings at that time, it stated that :</p>  <p>  &ldquo;&hellip;we estimate that 59,500 people in Ireland aged between 12 and 69 years of age have been infected with SARS-CoV-2. This is 3.0 times higher than the number of confirmed cases aged 12-69 years notified in Ireland&ldquo;.</p>  <p>  It went on to state that the vast majority of people living in Ireland are unlikely to have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 by the time of the study, and are therefore still susceptible to infection. This highlights the continued importance of public health measures, including physical distancing, respiratory etiquette, hand hygiene and the use of face coverings, until a vaccine for COVID-19 is universally available.</p>  <p>  There are no immediate plans for a further such study, although NPHET will keep the matter under review.</p></reply>

As of 22 September, there have been 12,165 tests carried out in Cycle 3 with 30 cases detected. This represents a positivity rate of 0.25%.</p>  <p>  A further schedule has been developed for serial testing of staff in Residential Care Facilities for older persons.  This is a 2 week cycle with swabbing over 7 days.  The majority of RCFs have identified staff who are now swabbing their peers in the RCF. This training has been facilitated by HSE.   </p>  <p>  In relation to delays in County Meath, the only instance identified by the HSE, relates to Heatherfield Nursing Home, Dunshaughlin, which has not yet identified staff to carry out swabbing and as a result required support of National Ambulance Service (NAS) to carry out swabbing.  The NAS did not have capacity to carry out swabbing on the original scheduled date Saturday 19 September, so it was scheduled for Monday 21 September, and had to then be rescheduled to Thursday 24 September.</p></reply>

The restructuring of services, social distancing measures and self-isolation can be particularly difficult for those who are trying to remain drug or alcohol free and for those who are in recovery. </p>  <p>  The Government plan for living with Covid-19 details how non-Covid health and social care services will be resumed, especially during the challenging winter months. This includes planning for the safe resumption of drug and alcohol services, including community-based services, residential programmes and recovery support groups. </p>  <p> As you are aware Dublin moved to level 3 from midnight on 19 September for a period of three weeks. Under the Plan no organised indoor gatherings can take place while level 3 restrictions are in place. This level 3 restriction applies to all indoor meetings. However, organised outdoor gatherings of up to 15 people are still permitted. </p>  <p>  It is important that addiction services take place in a safe environment to safeguard the health of service users and reduce the risk of transmission of COVID-19 when level 3 restrictions are in place.  </p>  <p>  I recently met with representatives of drug and alcohol task forces to discuss the restoration of drug and alcohol services. Officials from my Department have also engaged with Alcoholics Anonymous on the provision of guidance for their local group meetings. </p>  <p>  I believe drug and alcohol services provide essential supports for people with addiction issues. The Minister for Health, Stephen Donnelly, TD and I are committed to the restoration of addiction treatment services, as quickly as possible.  </p></reply>

In addition, vaccination for 2 - 12 year olds is being introduced this year in the context of the COVID pandemic; this will be kept under review for future years. </p>  <p>  The expanded programme will ensure that those most vulnerable to the effects of influenza will have access to vaccination without charges. By providing vaccination to those most at-risk, and those most likely to require hospitalisation if they contract influenza, it is anticipated that the programme will see a reduction in the number of influenza-related hospital admissions, as well as a reduction in the overall spread of influenza in the community. </p>  <p>  The vaccination campaign will be accompanied by a comprehensive communications campaign to encourage the greatest possible take-up.</p></reply>

While I have no role in relation to such matters, I would expect clinicians to consider the importance of patients having access to a GP service close to home when deciding whether or not to accept private patients. </p>  <p>  The Government is aware of the workforce issues currently facing general practice, including the increased demand for GP services, and is committed to the continued development of GP capacity to ensure that patients across the country have access to GP services. A range of measures have been implemented in recent years to improve recruitment and retention in general practice, including the recent GP Agreement which will increase Government investment in general practice by approximately 40% (or &euro;210 million) over a 4 year period, and the ongoing expansion in the number of training places on GP training programmes. These new measures will help make general practice a more attractive career option for doctors and will increase the number of GPs across the country, to the benefit of both GPs and patients.</p></reply>

An additional 16 places were provided in medicine.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government Our Shared Future commits to establishing a Workforce Planning Expert Unit to work with the education sectors, regulators, and professional bodies to improve the availability of health professionals and reform their training to support integrated care across the entire health service. This is particularly relevant in the context of the COVID 19 pandemic. </p>  <p>  A new Strategic Workforce Planning Unit has recently been established within the Department of Health.  The initial work of the Unit will focus on measures to address staffing shortages in critical healthcare areas and looking at the impact the COVID 19 pandemic is having on staffing resources across the entire health system. Effective short, medium, and long-term workforce planning will be vital to ensure that the introduction of new models of care envisaged in Sl&aacute;intecare are planned and managed effectively from a health workforce perspective.</p></reply>

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) in accordance with the advice of the World Health Organisation. </p>  <p>  The resumption of services from June onwards has allowed for increased activity, with the HSE utilising innovative methods including telemedicine to facilitate patient appointments. Patient safety remains at the forefront of service resumption. To ensure services are re-introduced in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols which has resulted in reduced capacity and activity </p>  <p>  The HSE continues to optimise productivity through alternative work practices such the use of alternative settings including private hospitals, community facilities and alternative outpatient settings.</p>  <p>  The National Treatment Purchase Fund has also recommenced arranging treatment in both private and public hospitals for clinically suitable patients who have been waiting for long periods on public hospital waiting lists.</p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy is a standardised approach used by the HSE to manage scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures.  It sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists and was developed in 2014 to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. </p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

Subject to planning permission, the commercial terms for the sale were agreed with the officials of Dublin City Council and approved by the HSE.</p>  <p>  The planning permission was appealed to An Bord Plean&aacute;la where an inspector upheld the Dublin City Council decision. However, in February 2015, An Bord Plean&aacute;la took the unexpected decision not to grant planning permission for the Finglas primary care centre due to the loss of informal open space.</p>  <p>  Following this refusal, HSE Estates in conjunction with local Primary Care Services Teams identified an alternative site for a new Primary Care Centre in Finglas and initiated discussions with Dublin City Council in relation to purchasing this site on terms agreeable to both parties.  </p>  <p>  Feasibility studies on the site are still progressing.  The HSE will be tendering for the services of a Design Team to progress the proposed project to completion in the near future, subject to agreeable conclusion to the site purchase.</p></reply>

Delays in accessing diagnostic testing imposes an increased burden on GPs who must continue to care for patients awaiting diagnosis rather than treating confirmed health issues.</p>  <p>  Recognising these issues, additional access to diagnostics for GPs will be provided as part of the &euro;600 million in funding for the recently published HSE Winter Plan for 2020/2021. This measure will improve timely direct access as a priority to MRI scans and other diagnostic tests for GP&rsquo;s and Community Specialist Teams for the upcoming winter period and beyond, enabling integrated care delivery in the community and decreasing the numbers attending EDs. Under the Winter Plan, an additional 33,950 diagnostics are proposed in Q4 2020 and an additional 45,267 diagnostics up to April 2021. </p></reply>

For the initial deliveries, the quantities of influenza vaccine delivered to sites are the same as previous years. The quantities of vaccine available to order by sites will be increased in line with the amounts received into the country. All shipments, totalling 1.35 million individual doses, are expected to be delivered before the end of October.  The HSE is in daily contact with the manufacturer in relation to the delivery of the vaccines. Delivery of the nasal vaccine used to be used for children is not affected.</p>  <p>  The HSE is satisfied that he number of doses procured is sufficient to vaccinate all in the at-risk groups. The start date of the vaccination programme will be late September or early October, the same as in previous years.  The vaccination programme for children is expected to commence from mid-October.</p>  <p>  The vaccination campaign will be accompanied by a comprehensive communications campaign to encourage the greatest possible take-up.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.</p>  <p>  The proposed policy change to the NHSS, to cap contributions based on farm and business assets at 3 years where a family successor commits to working the productive asset, has been approved by Government. The Department developed draft Heads of Bill while considering a number of complex ancillary policy and operational matters which may need to be addressed in the proposed legislation.</p>  <p>  The stated policy objective of the general scheme of the Bill is to introduce further safeguards in the NHSS to further protect the viability and sustainability of family farms and businesses that will be passed down to the next generation of the family to continue to work them as productive assets to provide for them their livelihood.</p>  <p>   The amendment of the scheme will bring certainty to the duration for which a contribution to the cost of care under NHSS will be levied against family farms and businesses. This in turn will support the viability of farms and businesses by increasing the likelihood of access to financing &amp;amp; promoting investment, which will encourage orderly succession planning with family members, encourage young farmers to remain farming and potentially encourage family members that had changed occupation or emigrated to return to the family farm.</p>  <p>   The General Scheme of Bill for the Amendment to the NHSS was approved by Government on 11 June 2019 and subsequently published. The changes to the Scheme will come into effect as soon as the legislative process is successfully complete. The General Scheme was sent to the relevant Joint Committee and the Department participated in pre-legislative scrutiny on 13 November 2019.  Engagement with the Office of the Attorney General began in early 2020 to progress the legislative development process.</p>  <p>  This piece of legislation is a priority for the Minister and will be progressed as soon as possible, to support Farm Families and Businesses . </p>  <p>  Further progress on the development of the Bill has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic with focus entirely on responding to the challenges presented by COVID-19. The response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been and continues to be a national and public health priority.</p></reply>

Given the volumes required, these operate as batch tests and hence take a number of hours depending on the platform and the volume being processed.</p>  <p>  The HSE uses rapid tests in key clinical settings, such as in our hospitals for emergency and surgical care.  These are rapid PCR tests which give results in short timeframes, for example less than an hour. As part of the HSE&rsquo;s testing and tracing plan, it is trying to increase the number of these available as there is significant international demand and supply challenges. These tests only work in very small numbers so are not appropriate for large scale community testing.</p>  <p>  Many of the rapid non-PCR Covid tests reported in the media, which purport to offer a test result in minutes (for example antigen tests) lack the sensitivity and specificity required for healthcare.  However, this issue continues to be monitored by WHO, ECDC, HIQA, and the HSE Laboratory taskforce.</p>  <p>  The HSE believes that antigen and other types of testing, such as saliva testing, may well have a role in testing of asymptomatic people. It is constantly monitoring the sensitivity of these tests to ensure that where deployed they will be of appropriate quality and sensitivity. Again, this will not replace the requirement for large scale PCR testing which remains the gold standard for community testing.</p></reply>

Maternity hospitals rely on very specialised personnel; should an outbreak of COVID-19 occur in a maternity hospital, the ability to provide safe, quality care would be severely impacted.  It should be remembered that maternity hospitals care for fragile infants at the extremes of prematurity.</p>  <p>  All maternity hospitals are challenged by the pandemic, but those challenges vary considerably.  Decisions on any restrictions are therefore made, implemented and reviewed at hospital level.</p>  <p>  Decisions to restrict visitors in our maternity hospitals have not been taken lightly.  Management and staff are acutely aware of the very important support provided by partners at the time of birth.  I have been assured that maternity hospitals wish to facilitate this support as far as possible.   In that context, I can assure the Deputy that any restrictions currently in place have been minimised as much as possible and will be subject to ongoing review. </p>  <p>  I note that restrictions have eased somewhat in certain hospitals in recent weeks and I hope this will continue.  However, the recent rise in the numbers of people infected with the virus, including healthcare workers, is very worrying and may impact on the pace of the easing of restrictions.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that the National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme has developed a guidance document on restrictions in maternity hospitals/units and this issued to all maternity services last week. The paper seeks to ensure a consistent national approach to visitor restrictions, as far as is practicable and having due regard to local circumstances.   Each maternity service/network has been requested to review visiting arrangements on a weekly basis, in the context of the issues and factors identified in the paper.</p></reply>

The report was informed by the available national and international evidence and the personal experiences of women who have suffered complications following mesh surgery.  </p>  <p>  In July 2018, in advance of publication of the full report, the CMO requested the HSE to pause all mesh procedures where clinically safe to do so. This pause was instigated pending implementation of initial recommendations regarding (i) professional training requirements, (ii) patient information and consent and (iii) the development and maintenance of a national data set for all mesh procedures carried out in HSE funded hospitals.  </p>  <p>  The CMO report was published in November 2018. Four of the 19 recommendations relate to data gathering to support the development of information resources to permit long-term research and audit of practice, ensuring the reporting of mesh related complications, and ensuring timely, appropriate arrangements for the management of women with complications.</p>  <p>  The HSE published a detailed Implementation Plan for the recommendations in the report in April 2019.  The National Women and Infants Health Programme is leading on this work.</p>  <p>  The pathways for women experiencing mesh complications, established by the HSE, have been in place for over a year.  All appointments offered to women through these pathways have been to the public system.  I would strongly encourage all women affected by mesh to engage with the relevant HSE contact points provided, to ensure that their service needs can be identified and provided for. </p>  <p>  The Treatment Abroad Scheme (TAS) is not available for patients wishing to have mesh related surgery for Stress Urinary Incontinence(SUI) or Pelvic Organ Prolapse(POP) as there is currently a pause on mesh surgeries for these specific ailments.  The TAS scheme is not available for mesh removal, full or partial, as the treatment is available publicly in Irish hospitals.  </p>  <p>  I wish to advise that Translabial Scanning has been made available on an interim basis under the TAS until the two scanners which have been purchased by the HSE are operational in the two Mesh Complications Centres.  As Translabial scanning is a diagnostic tool and not a "treatment" it does not normally qualify for this scheme. However, having listened to the requests from women for this specific type of scanning to be made available this interim measure was taken.</p></reply>

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) in accordance with the advice of the World Health Organisation. </p>  <p>  The resumption of services from June onwards has allowed for increased activity, with the HSE utilising innovative methods including telemedicine to facilitate patient appointments. Patient safety remains at the forefront of service resumption. To ensure services are re-introduced in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols which has resulted in reduced capacity and activity </p>  <p>  The HSE continues to optimise productivity through alternative work practices such the use of alternative settings including private hospitals, community facilities and alternative outpatient settings.</p>  <p>  The National Treatment Purchase Fund has also recommenced arranging treatment in both private and public hospitals for clinically suitable patients who have been waiting for long periods on public hospital waiting lists.</p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy is a standardised approach used by the HSE to manage scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures.  It sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists and was developed in 2014 to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. </p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) in accordance with the advice of the World Health Organisation. </p>  <p>  The resumption of services from June onwards has allowed for increased activity, with the HSE utilising innovative methods including telemedicine to facilitate patient appointments. Patient safety remains at the forefront of service resumption. To ensure services are re-introduced in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols which has resulted in reduced capacity and activity </p>  <p>  The HSE continues to optimise productivity through alternative work practices such the use of alternative settings including private hospitals, community facilities and alternative outpatient settings.</p>  <p>  The National Treatment Purchase Fund has also recommenced arranging treatment in both private and public hospitals for clinically suitable patients who have been waiting for long periods on public hospital waiting lists.</p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy is a standardised approach used by the HSE to manage scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures.  It sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists and was developed in 2014 to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. </p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

Following extensive public consultation, and in partnership with CHO 8 and the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group, a site has been identified in the grounds of the Midlands Regional Hospital Tullamore and initial drawings for the unit have been drafted. My Department is continuing to engage with the HSE and local hospice groups to work towards this objective.</p>  <p>  As has been the case with other hospices around the country, capital funding for the construction or refurbishment of hospice buildings has traditionally been provided by local hospice groups, with operational funding provided by the HSE. Based on similarly sized hospices that have recently been built, the capital cost of a new 15-bed hospice would be in the region of &euro;9 million., while the annual revenue cost of the service would be about &euro;3.8 million.</p>  <p>  The Midlands is fortunate to have a well-developed palliative care service in the community and, whereas the ultimate aim is to care for people appropriately at home for as long as possible, the provision of specialist palliative care inpatient beds will facilitate hospital avoidance and support families in end of life care for their loved ones. It is envisaged that the new inpatient unit, when established, will act as the hub for specialist palliative care services in the Midlands and will be able to provide additional support for residential /community services, including the region&rsquo;s network of palliative care support beds.</p></reply>

The Act does not provide for automatic eligibility based on having a particular disease or illness. </p>  <p>  The issue of granting medical cards based on having a particular disease or illness was previously examined in 2014 by the HSE Expert Panel on Medical Need and Medical Card Eligibility. The Group concluded that it was not feasible, desirable, nor ethically justifiable to list medical conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility.  In following the Expert Group&rsquo;s advice, a person&rsquo;s means remains the main qualifier for a medical card.</p>  <p>  However, the HSE does have a compassionate system in place for the provision of medical cards when it is informed that a patient is receiving end of life treatment &ndash; that is when patients&rsquo; unfortunately have a prognosis of less than 12 months. These applications do not require a means assessment nor are they reassessed.  </p>  <p>  Individuals may also qualify for a medical card through the means assessment process. Where such individuals might be in excess of the income guidelines every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the Health Act 1970, to support applicants in applying to take full account of the difficult circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness.  In such circumstances the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, since 2015 medical cards are awarded without the need of a financial assessment to all children under 18 years of age with a diagnosis of cancer. </p>  <p>  It should also be noted that the HSE Clinical Advisory Group (CAG) was established in December 2019 to review eligibility for medical cards in cases of terminal illness. The work of the CAG group has concluded and a Report was submitted recently to my Department and is currently under active consideration.</p></reply>

In the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, my Department is participating in the HSE-chaired National Standing Committee on high risk settings, which meets on an ongoing basis to review existing protocols and compliance measures, and to identify any additional control measures required. My Department is also supporting the HSE and the Health and Safety Authority in monitoring the effective implementation of all relevant Covid-19 guidance in DAFM-approved food plants. </p>  <p>  The Government decided in August that the HSE should implement a programme of serial testing of workers in food plants and other large businesses.  This programme is on-going.

In this regard, the recently-published Brexit Readiness Action Plan confirms that further measures to support affected sectors will be considered over the coming months. I also welcome the Multi-Annual Financial Framework agreement reached in July by EU Heads of State and Government, which includes a &euro;5 Billion Brexit Adjustment Reserve for those Member States and sectors most affected by Brexit. We will work to ensure that the agri-food sector gets an adequate allocation from that funding.</p></reply>

Financial support is available to assist growers and businesses through grant aid for capital investments in specialised plant and equipment including renewable energy, as well as technology adoption specific to commercial horticulture production. </p>  <p>  It is expected that the full budget allocation to the scheme of &euro;6 million for 2020 will be drawn down by the end of the year.  This Scheme is 100% funded by the Irish Government.</p>  <p>  In addition, my Department administers the EU Producer Organisation Scheme for Fruit and Vegetables which allows growers jointly market their production in order to strengthen the position of producers in the marketplace. Members of a Producer Organisation may also qualify for co-funding for agreed measures such as Environmental action, marketing, Production Quality, Research and Crisis prevention &amp;amp; management including mutual funds.</p></reply>

This year, the &euro;50 Beef Finisher Payment measure (BFP) will support beef finishing farmers who suffered market disturbance between 1 February and 12 June arising from the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  This is in addition to the core support for the beef sector the Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP), a &euro;300 million programme for improvement of the genetic merit of the national herd over the current Rural Development Programme.  </p>  <p>  The work of the Beef Taskforce which was established last year as a platform for strategic engagement across sector stakeholders, as well as to monitor the implementation of the actions under the beef sector agreement,  is important in driving the evolution of the sector through this period of change.   Constructive and meaningful engagement across this group is essential to developing the sector in a sustainable way which adds value at all stages of the supply chain. </p>  <p>  In addtion, my Department's focus on the development and enhancement of market access to third countries has intensified since the initial Brexit vote.</p></reply>

There are no requirements whatsoever resulting from the recent TB letters.  The objective of TB Herd Test History Statements and Reports that issued recently to all cattle herd owners is to help them to reduce the risk of Bovine TB in their herds and provide sufficient information to enable farmers to make the decisions appropriate to their situation.  </p>  <p>  While bovine TB disease is low relative to historical levels, TB herd incidence and reactor numbers have been gradually increasing since 2016.

There are no requirements whatsoever resulting from the recent TB letters.  The objective of TB Herd Test History Statements and Reports that issued recently to all cattle herd owners is to help them to reduce the risk of Bovine TB in their herds and provide sufficient information to enable farmers to make the decisions appropriate to their situation.  </p>  <p>  While bovine TB disease is low relative to historical levels, TB herd incidence and reactor numbers have been gradually increasing since 2016. The pace of deterioration has accelerated in 2020. Herd incidence at 4.2% is now at its highest level since 2012 while reactor numbers at 21,000 are back at 2009 rates. </p>  <p>  Monaghan has witnessed firsthand the impact of rising TB levels and its effect on farmers and farming families. As of 22 September 2020, the 12 month rolling Herd incidence for Monaghan was 7.01%.  The Regional Veterinary Office has implemented a High Impact bTB Control Plan and has worked endlessly to reduce levels of TB in Monaghan.</p>  <p>It is imperative that all stakeholders work together in reducing TB rates to support and protect farm families. The Bovine Tb stakeholder Forum, which was tasked with proposing policies to help achieve Tb eradication by 2030, will be reconvening on 1st   October 2020 and I look forward to ongoing positive engagement from all participants.</p></reply>

The responses received were presented to the National Advisory Group on Volunteering which is representative of all stakeholders and is chaired by the Minister of State.  This group has met on four occasions to date and has provided a comprehensive input into the development of the strategy.  In addition, officials from the Department attended a youth consultation event organised by For&oacute;ige to seek the input and engagement of young people into the development of the strategy. </p>  <p>  Following the input of the Advisory Group, a public consultation process on the draft Strategy ran from 20th December 2019 to 31st January 2020.  My Department received over 90 responses and was due to meet the National Advisory Group last March to discuss these responses.  However, due to the events around COVID-19, it was not possible to meet with the group at that time.</p>  <p>  A revised draft of the strategy, taking into account the responses from this second public consultation, as well as learnings from the COVID-19 experience, have now been issued to the National Advisory Group for consideration.  The Advisory Group is due to meet this week with the intention of agreeing a final draft.</p>  <p>  Once finalized and agreed with the Minister, it is proposed to present the five year Strategy on Volunteering to Government for approval.</p></reply>
