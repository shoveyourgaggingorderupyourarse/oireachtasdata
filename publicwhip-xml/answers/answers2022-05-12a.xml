Nevertheless, 76 applications to join the RDF were received in 2021. 41 additional new members were inducted during 2021, accounting for a 54% success rate.</p>  <p>  I am advised by the military authorities that a more streamlined process is in place with regard to the recruitment and induction process for the RDF. To date in 2022, following the launch of an RDF competition, 832 applications have been received and are under consideration by the Military Authorities. In line with the focus on the recovery phase of the COVID-19 response, induction training can now be facilitated. 23 additional new members have been inducted into the AR so far this year, with further induction training planned to commence shortly.</p>  <p>  While the Government remains committed to restoring the strength of the RDF, given the competing recruitment demands at present, Permanent Defence Force (PDF) recruitment is and should remain a priority.

The White Paper on Defence is quite clear that there is a continued requirement to retain and develop the Reserve and that requirement will be addressed. </p><p>The Reserve Defence Force (RDF) is comprised of the First Line Reserve, the Army Reserve (AR) and the Naval Service Reserve (NSR).  The White Paper on Defence is clear that there is a continued requirement to retain and develop the RDF and confirms that its primary role is to augment the Permanent Defence Force (PDF) in crisis situations.</p><p>The strength of the Reserve Defence Force, as of 31 March 2022, is set out below: <table>    <tr>       <th>Service </th>       <th>Total Effective Personnel</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Army Reserve</td>       <td>1380</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Naval Reserve</td>       <td>114</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>First Line Reserve</td>       <td>271</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>While the commitment to restoring the strength of the RDF is not in doubt, the same personnel and resources are utilised for both PDF and RDF recruitment.

Nevertheless, 41 additional new members were inducted during 2021. In addition, a RDF recruitment drive was launched earlier this year and there have been 23 inductions to date in 2022.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the Report of the Commission on the Defence Forces, published last January, contains many detailed recommendations, including on the future structure and role of the RDF. </p><p>There is a process underway to consider these recommendations in consultation with Ministerial colleagues and stakeholders.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-05-12a.13.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022051200063#WRA01200"><p>Expenditure on the Defence Forces is managed through Vote 36 - Defence, with all operational outputs delivered from a single set of forces encompassing the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service. Vote 36 - Defence provides funding for the pay and allowances of members of the Defence Forces, civilian employees and Departmental staff, ongoing Defence Forces operational and standing costs, the acquisition of military equipment along with the development of Defence Forces built infrastructure. It also provides funding for Civil Defence and the Irish Red Cross Society. Separately, Vote 35 provides for expenditure on Military Pensions. </p>  <p>  On an annual basis, the Defence Group budget is determined within the overarching budgetary framework and approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, having regard to the level of resources available and defence policy requirements. Capital funding allocations are also framed by the multi-annual National Development Plan. </p>  <p>  International comparison of military expenditure are made difficult by the lack of publicly available data, and by the breadth of difference between nations in their international security and defence policies. In addition, there is no EU requirement for Ireland to achieve any specific percentage of GDP target in relation to Defence expenditure. It should also be noted that the Central Statistics Office (CSO), in introducing Modified Gross National Income (GNI*), have recognised that the figures for Ireland&rsquo;s GDP are significantly impacted by the effects of globalisation.</p>  <p>  As such, the international perspective is best used for context rather than comparison between militaries. </p>  <p>  Against that background and using the latest data published by the European Defence Agency, details on defence spending as a % of national income across EU Member States in 2020 indicates the level of Irish expenditure on defence, at 0.5% of GNI*, is lower than other neutral1 EU states such as Austria, Sweden, Finland, Malta, and Cyprus.  </p>  <p>  However, it is worth noting that within the resources allocated to Defence, the Defence Forces make a significant contribution to domestic security, provide a broad range of supports to the civil authorities, undertake roles such as Emergency Aeromedical Support (EAS) and fishery protection and are widely respected for their contribution to international peace and security. Ireland provides a level of support to the UN that, relative to the size of our Defence Forces, exceeds that of many countries. For this, we can be justifiably proud.</p>  <p>  I fully acknowledge there is an ongoing requirement to consider whether the capabilities we maintain are appropriate, having regard to the security environment, the roles that we wish the Defence Forces to undertake, and likely risks. That is precisely why I established the Commission on the Defence Forces. The Commission&rsquo;s report contains many detailed recommendations and there is a process underway to consider these. This necessarily requires widespread consultations. The intent is to revert to Government with a proposed response and a high-level action plan in advance of the summer recess. As the Deputy will appreciate, it would be inappropriate for me at this time to pre-empt an ongoing deliberative process.</p>  <p> 1  defined as EU Non-NATO MS.</p></reply>

The Department of Defence has provided approximately 10 tonnes or 5,000 units of ready-to-eat meals and 200 units of body armour, which have been shipped from Defence Forces stocks to Ukraine.</p>  <p>  Following a request from the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth Affairs, lands at Gormanston, Co. Meath have been made available for emergency accommodation and a reception centre, The facility is now ready for operation with an initial capacity of 320 with 24 hours notice. Ballymullen Barracks, Tralee, has also now been made available to Kerry County Council at their request to accommodate Ukrainian nationals.</p>  <p>  My Department is also engaging with OPW and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth Affairs regarding the possibility of using Ratra House in the Phoenix Park to accommodate Ukrainian nationals</p>  <p>  The Defence Forces have provided logistical support to the Department of Children, Equality Disability, Integration and Youth Affairs, and to the Irish Red Cross in progressing the pledges of accommodation received. </p>  <p>  From the middle of March, Civil Defence units across the country have been involved in supporting Ukrainians seeking protection in Ireland.  This has included setting up and operating temporary rest centres in 21 local authority areas around the country.  They have also transported Ukrainians to and from their accommodation and to meetings for school registration and medical appointments etc.</p>  <p>My Department will continue to engage across Government through the Senior Officials Group on the Ukrainian humanitarian crisis, and the Humanitarian Crisis Housing Task Force in relation to any further requests for accommodation or other supports, that are required from the Defence Organisation.   </p></reply>

A wide range of medical services are provided to members of the Permanent Defence Force including an annual medical examination, sick parades, GP services, prescription services, laboratory services, physiotherapy, chiropody, radiology, ophthalmic examinations, in-patient and outpatient public hospital charges and routine dental treatment.</p>  <p>  In addition, Commissioned Officers and members of the Army Nursing Service may also avail of private consultant appointments and diagnostic tests, and private/semi-private hospital treatment dependent on rank. The Programme for Government contains a commitment to "ensure that all enlisted members of the Defence Forces have the same access to health care as officers currently do". A Working Group has been established with a view to bringing forward proposals on this matter.</p>  <p>  In the case of Defence Forces personnel assigned to longer term overseas administrative posts, these personnel, and any accompanying dependents are provided with global comprehensive medical insurance for which a formal arrangement is in place with a health insurance provider. This involves the organisation paying the difference between a basic minimum payment and the cost of the global plan.  </p>  <p>  The provision of this range of benefits is unique in the public and indeed the private sectors, and they are exempt from benefit-in-kind taxation.</p>  <p>  A range of medical and non-medical mental health supports are also provided to Defence Forces personnel. This includes in-house access to clinical psychology and psychiatry services, provided by two full-time clinical psychologists and one full-time consultant psychiatrist. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Defence Forces Personnel Support Service provides a welfare, information, psycho-social support and referral service, that is professional, responsive and confidential, to serving members of the Defence Forces and their families.</p>  <p>  The Mental Health and Well-being Strategy for the Defence Forces, which was launched by me in December 2020, recognises the unique nature of the experience of military life in Ireland. The aim of the strategy is to provide a coordinated and effective mental health and support system for the personnel of the Defence Forces through the adoption of a series of measures between 2020 and 2023.</p>  <p>  As additional support, the Department of Defence has arranged the provision of a confidential counselling, referral and support service, on a wide range of personal and work related issues, for serving members of the Defence Forces, civilian employees and Civil Defence members. A Freephone confidential helpline is available on a 24/7 basis 365 days a year and is staffed by fully-trained and experienced counsellors. </p>  <p>  The Chaplaincy Service also provides confidential, comprehensive pastoral support and spiritual care to personnel at home and overseas.</p>  <p>  While I am satisfied that the measures taken to ensure the health and well-being of Defence Forces personnel are comprehensive, I can assure the Deputy that they are kept under constant review.</p></reply>

These include a number of projects undertaken to bolster the attractiveness of a career in the Defence Forces. </p>  <p>  The recent Report of the Commission on Defence Forces makes a range of recommendations in this area, which will all be considered. The Report proposes significant changes, including the level of Defence provision in Ireland and recommendations in relation to capacity components required to achieve that provision.  This includes, inter alia, consideration of morale, recruitment and retention matters.  Following relevant consultation, I will revert to Government with a proposed response to the Commission's recommendations and a high-level action plan which will set out proposed timelines and oversight arrangements for its implementation. </p>  <p>  In the interim, my focus remains on retaining/restoring all branches of the Defence Forces at their full capacity and significant work has been undertaken to date, and such work continues, but it will take time to see the full effect of the measures introduced.</p>  <p>  Specifically in terms of pay scales, the Deputy is aware that the Defence Forces are paid increases in pay and allowances, in line with Public Service pay agreements.</p>  <p>  The current public service pay agreement, &lsquo;Building Momentum &ndash; A New Public Service Agreement 2021 &ndash; 2022&rsquo; provides for increases in pay and allowances to all public servants, including members of the Defence Forces.</p>  <p>  In addition to general round pay increases, arising out of ongoing national pay agreements, members of the Permanent Defence Force have also benefitted from the implementation of increases in Defence Force&rsquo;s allowances, as recommended by the Public Service Pay Commission in 2019. </p>  <p>  Based on the 2021 Q4 Preliminary Estimates of the CSO&rsquo;s Average weekly earnings by the public sector sub-sector, it is also worth noting that weekly earnings in the Defence sector compare very well to counterparts elsewhere in the public sector. Defence personnel's weekly earnings, over the period Q4 2016 - Q4 2021, have risen by 25%. This places them squarely in mid-table &ndash; earning more on a weekly basis than their counterparts in the Health, Regional Bodies and Civil Service sub-sectors. </p>  <p>  I, as Minister for Defence, remain committed to returning to, and maintaining, the agreed establishment figure for the Defence Force. </p></reply>

In addition to Mali, the Sahel region also comprises Burkina Faso, Chad, Mauritania and Niger. </p>  <p>  The Government has approved the continued deployment of up to 14 Defence Forces personnel  to participate in MINUSMA, the United Nations authorised operation in Mali, up until 30 September 2022, when our commitment concludes.  Currently, there are 2 officers deployed in MINUSMA Force Headquarters in Bamako and an additional 12 personnel, including members of the Army Ranger Wing, deployed with the German Armed Forces at Camp Castor in GAO, Mali. All deployed personnel are embedded with a larger German company and are carrying out assigned tasks in accordance with the mission mandate. </p>  <p>  In addition, twenty (20) members of the Permanent Defence Force are deployed with the EU mission to train the Malian Armed Forces in Mali, known as EUTM Mali.  EUTM Mali complements other EU projects and activities carried out in the context of the EU Strategy for Security and Development in the Sahel.</p>  <p>  The Government is deeply concerned about the security situation in Mali, which is kept under constant review by the Defence Forces, particularly in relation to the safety and security of Irish personnel and by reference to the prevailing threat assessment.</p>  <p>  Recent months have seen a very serious deterioration in the security and human rights situations in the Centre of Mali.  There have been a number of incidents in recent weeks where it has been reported that civilians have been killed following operations by Malian armed forces, reportedly operating alongside Wagner Group personnel.</p>  <p>  The Malian authorities continue to officially deny the presence of the Wagner Group in the country, despite reports that up to 1,000 personnel associated with the Russian backed mercenary group have been deployed to the country and are engaged in joint operations with the Malian armed forces, with an operational focus in the centre of the country.</p>  <p>  The Department of Defence reviews the deployment of Defence Forces Personnel overseas on an ongoing basis. Ireland receives requests, from time to time, in relation to participation in various missions and these are considered on a case-by-case basis.</p></reply>

As the Deputy is aware, the current public service pay agreement, &lsquo;Building Momentum &ndash; A New Public Service Agreement 2021 &ndash; 2022&rsquo;, provides for increases in pay and allowances to all public servants, including members of the Defence Forces. A general round increase in annualised basic salary of 1% or &euro;500, whichever was the greater, came into effect on 1st October 2021. In addition, fixed periodic pensionable allowances, as well as allowances in the nature of pay, were also increased by 1% on this date.</p>  <p>  The current pay agreement also provides for further increases in 2022, namely:</p>  <p>  - The equivalent of a 1% increase in annualised basic salaries to be used as a Sectoral Bargaining Fund, in accordance with Chapter 2 of the Agreement, on 1st February 2022 last. </p>  <p>  - A general round increase in annualised basic salaries for all public servants of 1% or &euro;500, whichever is greater, on 1st October 2022. Fixed periodic pensionable allowances and allowances in the nature of pay will also be increased by 1% on this date.    </p>  <p>  In addition to general round pay increases arising out of ongoing national pay agreements, members of the Permanent Defence Force have also benefitted from the implementation of increases in Defence Force&rsquo;s allowances, as recommended by the Public Service Pay Commission in 2019. </p>  <p>  The Commission on the Defence Forces was established on foot of a commitment in the Programme for Government, and I, as Minister for Defence, welcomed the publication of the report of the Commission on 9th February last.  The Commission has undertaken a significant body of work, encompassing wide-ranging terms of reference, including an examination of the evolution of all remuneration systems and structures currently in place in the Defence Forces.  </p>  <p>  Given the significant recommendations contained in the Report, detailed consideration of these recommendations is required.  This involves significant inter-departmental consultation, and I and my officials are currently engaging with key stakeholders to ascertain their views. Following this engagement, I intend to return to Government with a proposed response to the Commission&rsquo;s recommendations and a high-level action plan. </p>  <p>  The Defence Forces Representative Associations, namely PDFORRA and RACO, will be consulted on all matters that fall within the scope of representation relating to the implementation of any approved plan.</p></reply>

As of 30 April 2022, 110 personnel have been inducted. At that same date, 34 recruits had discharged from the Defence Forces in 2022.  </p>  <p>  In response to the deputy on psychometric testing, this testing forms part of the recruitment and candidate assessment process for General Service recruits, Air Corps Apprentices and Cadets. The military authorities have advised that, in 2021, there was 41% test failure rate associated with psychometric tests for Cadets and 60% for other recruitment. Two companies are involved in providing and administering these psychometric tests: Mindmill in respect of General Service Recruits and Cadets; and AON in respect of Air Corps Apprentices. The types of psychometric tests utilised include verbal, analytical, and abstract reasoning. </p>  <p>  In relation to retention, in addition to pay increases arising from the Public Service Pay Commission report and from public sector pay agreements, a number of other initiatives have been introduced. For example, the service commitment schemes in the Air Corps and Naval Service, and the sea-going naval personnel tax credit of &euro;1,500 which has been extended into 2022. </p>  <p>  I have also secured agreement to allow for an extension in service limits for Privates and Corporals, who were recruited since 1 January 1994, to remain in service up to 50 years of age, subject to them meeting certain criteria including medical and fitness standards. Currently, Sergeants recruited to the Permanent Defence Force post-1994 may remain in service up to age 50 and it has been agreed that there shall be arrangements to facilitate the extension of these service limits.   </p>  <p>  As the deputies will be aware, the report of the Commission on the Defence Forces has made it clear that the level of ambition for the Defence Forces must be elevated beyond that at which it is operating at the moment. I have made it clear that I am actively seeking to build the strength of the PDF 11,500 in line with level of ambition 2. I intend therefore, before the summer recess, to revert to Government with a proposed response to the Commission&rsquo;s recommendations and a high-level action plan. </p></reply>

Both the White Paper and the White Paper Update were based on security environment assessments carried out by interdepartmental groups.  These threat assessments indicated a low probability of a conventional military attack on the state, and also point to the fact that security challenges are such that no single country can deal with these alone. The White Paper outlines the importance of the UN and EU in collective security and commits Ireland to fully supporting UN mandated peace support operations.</p>  <p>  Equipment priorities for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service are considered in the context of the lifetime of the White Paper on Defence as part of the capability development and Equipment Development Planning (EDP) process.  The Equipment Development Plan (EDP) published in June 2020 provides a comprehensive list of planned equipment projects, this rolling five year plan is iterative and will encompass new equipment projects as it develops.  </p>  <p>  The White Paper on Defence 2015 sets out an ambitious programme of capital investment including the mid-life refit and upgrade of the P50 class of vessels, and the replacement of the flagship L&Eacute; Eithne with a multi-role vessel (MRV),  the replacement of the Cessnas and Casa 235 fleets and the midlife upgrade of the Army's fleet of 80 Mowag Piranha III armoured personnel carrier vehicles.</p>  <p>  The Cessnas have now been replaced by three Pilatus PC-12 aircraft in the Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance (ISTAR) role providing a substantially increased capability with their state of the art surveillance technology.  Two C295 Maritime Patrol Aircraft to replace the two Casa 235s are due to be delivered in 2023.  As well as the upgrade to the Armoured personnel carriers 30 Armoured Utility Vehicles and 220 softskin vehicles are due for delivery in 2022.   </p>  <p>  The report of the Commission on the Defence Forces was published in February 2022. It is a substantial report running to over 180 pages and 69 main recommendations many of which have sub recommendations.  It recommends significant changes for the Defence Forces and Defence provision in Ireland. It covers high level Defence Forces structures, defence capabilities, organisation, culture and human resources, the Reserve Defence Force and funding.</p>  <p>  The Commission's report is being fully considered in the context of the current security environment, in consultation with Ministerial colleagues and other stakeholders.   The intent is to revert to Government with a proposed response and a high-level action plan in advance of the summer recess.</p>  <p>  The report of the Commission on the Defence Forces and the current events in Ukraine are prompting an open debate and consideration of our defence requirements.  I fully accept there is an ongoing requirement to consider whether the capabilities we maintain are appropriate, having regard to the security environment, the roles that we wish the Defence Forces to undertake, and likely risks. </p></reply>

The Official Side comprises of members of the Department of Defence (Civil and Military) and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. The entire body is known as 'Council'. </p>  <p>  At present I am aware that there is a claim before Council in respect of an outstanding adjudication pertaining to the Army Ranger Wing Allowance. As per the agreed Terms of Reference of the C&amp;A Scheme, matters in this space are confidential to parties involved. As such, no further information can be given to the Deputy at this time. There is also litigation ongoing in respect of a number of outstanding adjudication matters.

Chapter 2 of the Agreement provides for the equivalent of a 1% increase in annualised basic salaries to be used as a Sectoral Bargaining Fund. The purpose of this fund is to deal with outstanding adjudications, commitments, recommendations, awards and claims within the terms of the fund, and within the exchequer funding limit in place. All public servants covered by the agreement are encompassed by this process. </p></reply>

In February, March and again in April of 2022, the Council of the European Union adopted assistance measures under the European Peace Facility (EPF). To date, a &euro;1.5 billion package has been approved that will allow the EU to support the Ukrainian Armed Forces in defending the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the country, and to protect the civilian population against the ongoing Russian military aggression.</p>  <p>  In line with the commitment laid out in the 2020 Programme for Government and the provisions of the memorandum on the European Peace Facility (EPF), approved by the Irish government in March 2021, Ireland&rsquo;s financial contribution supporting the Ukrainian Armed Forces via the EPF is directed towards providing non-lethal support such as food, medicine and personal protection equipment which have been specifically requested by the government of Ukraine. This equipment could include such items as body armour and helmets. A similar approach is followed by both Austria and Malta. </p>  <p>  Ireland is providing its full contribution to the EPF assistance measures, Ireland&rsquo;s contribution currently stands at &euro;33m. It is expected that a further tranche of funding for Ukraine via the EPF will be proposed in the coming days, potentially taking the total support provided by the EU to &euro;2 billion. If this proposal is approved, Ireland's share will stand at approximately &euro;44m.</p>  <p>  Following a direct request from Ukraine, the Defence Forces has provided approximately 10 tonnes or 5,000 units of ready-to-eat meals and 200 units of body armour which have been shipped from Defence Forces stocks to the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The contribution of the ready-to-eat meals and body armour is a specific element of the Government&rsquo;s contribution through the European Peace Facility and is in addition to the further &euro;20 million provided in humanitarian assistance to the UN and the Red Cross which is already being disbursed through UN and NGO partners in Ukraine and in neighbouring countries. </p>  <p>  It also includes a dedicated Ukraine civil society fund of &euro;2 million specifically to support NGOs responding to the crisis. </p>  <p>  In addition, Ireland is also providing a further &euro;3 million to the to the International Criminal Court (ICC) to assist with regard to all situations before the court.</p></reply>

LOA 1 is essentially proceeding as we are at present and trying to move back to a full establishment figure of 9,500. The Commission has concluded that this would leave the Defence Forces unable to mount a credible defence of the State. LOA 2 would address specific priority gaps to improve on-island and overseas capabilities. LOA 3, would bring Ireland in line with other small neutral European countries in terms of spend. I am on the record as saying that LOA 2 is the minimum that we should aim for. This level of ambition will require an additional 2000 personnel beyond the establishment figure of 9,500 and an increase in the defence budget of some 50%.   The Defence Forces are responsible for recruitment and I have requested them to examine their recruitment practices and structures to facilitate this increase in numbers.</p>  <p>  This Commission report also includes, inter alia, consideration of issues relating to culture, recruitment and retention, working hours, work-life balance, training, promotion, diversity and a host of other matters all of which will have an impact on job satisfaction and morale.  Following relevant consultation, I will revert to Government with a proposed response to the Commission's recommendations and a high-level action plan, which will set out proposed timelines and oversight arrangements for its implementation.</p>  <p>  In the interim, my focus remains on restoring all branches of the Defence Forces to the current agreed strength and in that context, there are a number of initiatives which are presently being implemented to counter ongoing staffing challenges.  Most of the 15 projects undertaken to facilitate the implementation of the Public Service Pay Commission (PSPC) Report on Recruitment and Retention have been completed or are now being progressed in other forums. There is ongoing general service and direct entry recruitment and some 110 personnel have been inducted to date in 2022. Retention measures include service commitment schemes in the Air Corps and Naval Service, and the sea-going naval personnel tax credit. Pay has improved as a result of increases arising from the PSPC report and from recent pay agreements. Agreement has also been reached on the extension of service limits for privates and corporals, with discussions ongoing relating to sergeants.   </p></reply>

From the 13th to the 17th September the men of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company endured almost continuous attack. At the end of the Siege, the men were taken into captivity until finally released on the 25th October 1961. </p>  <p>  The issue of awarding of Military Medals for Gallantry (MMG) and Distinguished Service Medals (DSMs) to a number of personnel who served in Jadotville in September 1961 has been considered on a number of occasions over the years and a range of actions have taken place to give due recognition to the courage and bravery of all the members of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, 35th Infantry Battalion who were stationed in Jadotville in 1961. The range of actions taken to date to recognise the bravery of the men stationed in Jadotville in 1961 include:</p>  <p>  - A presentation of scrolls to "A" Company in 2006.  </p>  <p>  - Portraits of Lt Col McNamee (35th Battalion Commander) and Comdt Quinlan (Company Commander &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company) were commissioned in 2006.  </p>  <p>  - In July of 2010 the 50th anniversary of the first deployment to the Congo was commemorated in a highly publicised and well attended event in Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel. A Congo photographic book was also produced for the occasion; a section of which was dedicated to the events at Jadotville in 1961.  </p>  <p>  - A nominal roll of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, printed in copper, was affixed to the monument in Costume Barracks and was unveiled as part of the 50th Anniversary of the Jadotville affair in September 2011.  </p>  <p>  - On the occasion of the 55th anniversary of the Siege of Jadotville, it was decided to issue a Unit Citation to honour the collective actions and bravery of the men of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company. This was the first time a Unit Citation was awarded within the Defence Forces. </p>  <p>  - On 13th June 2017, the Government decided, to award a medal known as &ldquo;An Bonn Jadotville&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Jadotville Medal&rdquo; to each member of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, 35th Infantry Battalion and to the family representatives of deceased members to give full and due recognition in honour of their courageous actions at the Siege of Jadotville.  This medal presentation ceremony took place in Custume Barracks, Athlone on 2nd December 2017.  It is from Custume Barracks that &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company assembled in advance of their fateful deployment to the Congo.  The &ldquo;An Bonn Jadotville&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Jadotville Medal&rdquo; has the word &ldquo;Jadotville&rdquo; depicted on the clasp of the medal and the medal ribbon represents a combination of an Irish tricolour and the United Nations Operation in Congo (ONUC) mission medal. The medal depicts a warrior of the ancient Fianna with sword and shield. To the left is a reproduction of the Irish overseas flash. Surrounding the central motif are the words &ldquo;Cosaint Chalma&rdquo; (Valiant Defence) and &ldquo;Misneach&rdquo; (Courage). The reverse contains a unique unit identification representing A Coy, 35 Cathlan Eireannach (Irish Battalion).  </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the actions that have been taken to date to recognise and honour the valiant actions and bravery of all of the men stationed at Jadotville sixty years ago, an Independent Review Group (IRG) was established to examine and report on matters relating to recommendations for military medals relating to events at Jadotville.  The Group reported in July 2021.   </p>  <p>  The report, which was published in full, is substantial and makes a number of recommendations in respect of the issue of award of medals, honouring the role of families and the support they provided to veterans and in respect of veterans affairs.  </p>  <p>  The deeply unsettling aftermath of Jadotville is detailed in the report as is the lack of personal welfare supports afforded to the men following events at Jadotville, their period in captivity and upon their return home. I have apologised to veterans and to their families on behalf of the State and the Government to the men of &lsquo;A&rsquo; Company, 35th Infantry Battalion and to their families for the lack of necessary supports or deserved recognition of their valiant service on their return from the Congo and for the many issues that arose as a result, some of which had tragic consequences.  I have also acknowledged that the lack of supports in place at that time is extremely regrettable.  There have been great steps in the intervening years to support Defence Forces personnel, their families and veterans through the work of the Defence Forces personnel support services.   </p>  <p>  A judicial review is under way at present regarding a recommendation of the IRG report relating to the convening of a Military Board to consider the award of medals. Given that the matter is now before the Courts, it would be inappropriate for me to comment further on the report at this time. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied, however, that the matter has been addressed comprehensively and there are no plans to commence a process of further engagement.</p></reply>

Thus, for 2022, the total gross allocation provided to the Defence Vote Group, as set out in Budget 2022, is &euro;1,107 million, comprising of &euro;836 million for Vote 36 (Defence) and &euro;271 million for Vote 35 (Army Pensions).</p><p>The 2022 allocation includes an allocation of over &euro;545 million for the pay and allowances of members of the Permanent Defence Force, civil servants and civilian employees.

The Department of Defence does not have discretion to award separate pay increases. The Defence Forces continue to have received pay increases in line with the Public Service pay agreements. </p><p>Capital funding allocations are also framed by the multi-annual National Development Plan. The White Paper on Defence, updated in 2019, highlighted the importance of capability development and the necessity for continued renewal, upgrade and acquisition of military equipment and infrastructure. To this end, the National Development Plan has allocated multi-annual funding of &euro;566 million to Defence out to 2025, with an allocation of &euro;141 million per annum provided for 2022 and 2023 and &euro;142 million per annum for 2024 and 2025.</p><p>In relation to the current staffing challenges in the Defence Forces, various recruitment and retention initiatives are being implemented, including</p><p>- An Ongoing General Service Recruitment Campaign;</p><p>- Direct Entry Officers competitions for Bridge Watch-keeping, Marine Engineering and Electrical Engineering roles;</p><p>- Direct Entry &lsquo;Other Ranks&rsquo; competitions for Engine Room Artificers, Hull Artificers, Electrical Artificers, Radio/Radar Technicians and Chefs. </p><p>- An Air Corps Aircraft Apprentice Technician competition;</p><p>- A Cadetship competition for all branches will commence shortly; </p><p>- An extension to the Air Corps Service Commitment Scheme;</p><p>- An extension of the Naval Service Tax Credit of &euro;1,500 into 2022;</p><p>- An ongoing scheme allowing for the re-commissioning of former Officers and the re-enlistment of former enlisted personnel of the Permanent Defence Force has also assisted in addressing particular skills gaps.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the report of the Commission on the Defence Forces was recently published.

The recent invasion of Ukraine shows the value of having such a strategic document.</p>  <p>  Following the presentation and consideration of several revisions of the text, a final draft was approved by Foreign and Defence Ministers at the Foreign Affairs Council on 21 March 2022 and endorsed by EU leaders at the European Council on 24-25 March.  </p>  <p>  Ireland engaged with and inputted fully into the work on the Compass, as reflected in our co-signature of non-papers during the dialogue phase covering broad areas of the Compass&rsquo;s work including Partnerships, Crisis Management, and Civilian CSDP. We also produced a paper on Force Generation, which presents a practical solution to the manpower issues faced by military CSDP missions. </p>  <p>  The Strategic Compass is a welcome means of setting out our shared strategic vision for CSDP and of enhancing the role of the EU in international peace and security. The Compass reflects the core values that underpin our approach to CSDP, including the commitment to effective multilateralism and the rules-based international order, notably through our partnership with the UN.   </p>  <p>  Most recently, an overview and proposed timelines of the Implementation of the Strategic Compass was shared with Member States. While discussions continue on the timelines proposed, it should be noted that decision-making power in relation the individual actions proposed in the Compass, remains a national competence. Nothing in the Compass prejudices the specific character of the security and defence policy of any Member State and this must remain the case through the implementation phase. </p></reply>

It is a substantial report running to over 180 pages and 69 main recommendations many of which have sub recommendations.  It recommends significant changes for the Defence Forces and Defence provision in Ireland. It covers high level Defence Forces structures, defence capabilities, organisation, culture and human resources, the Reserve Defence Force and funding.</p>  <p>  The Commission's report is being fully considered, in consultation with Ministerial colleagues and other stakeholders. The intent is to revert to Government with a proposed response and a high-level action plan in advance of the summer recess. As the Deputy will appreciate, it would be inappropriate for me at this time to pre-empt an ongoing deliberative process.</p>  <p>  Having said that, equipment priorities for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service are considered in the context of the lifetime of the White Paper on Defence as part of the capability development and Equipment Development Planning (EDP) process. The Equipment Development Plan (EDP) published in June 2020 provides a comprehensive list of planned equipment projects, this rolling five year plan is iterative and will encompass new equipment projects as it develops.  </p>  <p>  The ongoing ambitious programme of capital investment in the Naval Service includes the mid-life refit and upgrade of the P50 class of vessels, and the replacement of the flagship L&Eacute; Eithne with a multi-role vessel (MRV).   </p>  <p>  The White Paper, in addressing Air Corps capability, provided for the replacement of the Cessnas and Casa 235 fleets.  The Cessnas have now been replaced by three Pilatus PC-12 aircraft in the Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance (ISTAR) role providing a substantially increased capability with their state of the art surveillance technology. Two C295 Maritime Patrol Aircraft to replace the two Casa 235s are due to be delivered in 2023. These C295s are larger and more capable aircraft than those they replace and will enable the Air Corps to conduct maritime patrols and surveillance across Ireland's area of maritime interest, with enhanced capabilities.</p>  <p>  Equipment projects for the Army include the midlife upgrade of the Army's fleet of 80 Mowag Piranha III armoured personnel carrier vehicles, 30 Armoured Utility Vehicles and 220 softskin vehicles which are due for delivery in 2022.   </p>  <p>  The Department of Defence has received a capital allocation under the National Development Plan of &euro;566 million over the 2022-2025 timeframe. Within that capital allocation the Defence annual capital budget for 2022 is &euro;141 million. This will enable continued investment in defence equipment, including major platforms, and barracks infrastructure.   </p></reply>

I am fully committed to ensuring that every member has the right to be treated with dignity, equality and respect to carry out their duties in a safe workplace underpinned by a culture of zero-tolerance for any kind of bullying, discrimination, harassment or sexual abuse. </p>  <p>  The Independent Review Group established last January is examining the systems, policies and procedures for dealing with workplace issues relating to bullying, discrimination, harassment, sexual harassment and sexual misconduct, as well as workplace culture, in the Defence Forces. </p>  <p>  This Judge-led review is a necessary and critical first step to address the need for a safe work environment for serving members with zero-tolerance for such unacceptable behaviour. </p>  <p>  The Terms of Reference for the Review are wide-ranging and provide that Government may consider further work on receipt of the Independent Review findings.   </p>  <p>  There are 3 key aims of the Independent Review:</p>  <p>  - Firstly, to advise on whether the current legislative frameworks, policies, procedures and practices for addressing incidents of unacceptable behaviour in the workplace are effective; </p>  <p>  - Secondly, to independently assess whether the pervading culture in the workplace is fully aligned with the principles of dignity, equality, mutual respect, and duty of care for every member of the Defence Forces and;</p>  <p>  - Thirdly, to provide recommendations and guidance on measures and strategies required to underpin a workplace based on dignity, equality, mutual respect, and duty of care for every member of the Defence Forces.    </p>  <p>  A number of reforms have been implemented over the last twenty years since the 2002 publication of the External Advisory Group on the Defence Forces and the three subsequent reports from the Independent Monitoring Group (IMG), for addressing allegations of inappropriate behaviour, including harassment, sexual harassment and bullying, which are contained in policy documents and in regulation. </p>  <p>  The Defence Forces Diversity and Inclusion Strategy Statement and Action Plan aims to ensure that a transparent culture exists, that encourages personnel to report inappropriate behaviour, discrimination, bullying, harassment and sexual harassment. </p>  <p>  Despite the reforms that have taken place, current and former members of the Defence Forces have been clear that the culture that is pervading, and the application of those policies, systems and procedures for dealing with unacceptable behaviour have not, and are not serving all Defence Forces personnel well and that while there has been progress in recent years, more needs to be done. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, I have set out an ambitious timetable for the Group. An interim report is due within the next 3 months with a final report within 12 months of the establishment of the Group. I will be bringing this final Report to Government and thereafter it will be published. </p>  <p>  As I mentioned earlier, I had a very fruitful meeting with Ms. Justice Bronagh O&rsquo;Hanlon and the other members of the Group, Ms. Jane Williams and Mr. Mark Connaughton, on 25 April last where they updated me on progress. I very much look forward to their interim report in the coming months.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy will recall that on foot of my engagement with both serving and former Defence Forces personnel last year, I immediately put in place a number of interim supports including the appointment of the Confidential Contact Person with Raiseaconcern, to support serving and former members in the safe reporting of allegations of wrongdoing in the workplace.  </p>  <p>  Raiseaconcern have recently provided me with a report on the work of the Confidential Contact Person. The Report is completely anonymised and as agreed I have submitted a copy to the members of the Independent Review Group and it is expected that it will be a valuable input  into their ongoing deliberations.</p></reply>

Within that capital allocation, the defence annual capital budget for 2022 is &euro;141 million. This level of capital funding will allow the Defence Organisation to undertake a programme of sustained equipment replacement and infrastructural development across the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service as identified and prioritised in the Defence White Paper and builds on the significant investment programme over recent years.</p>  <p>  The Equipment Development Plan (EDP) published in June 2020 was completed following extensive joint civil-military work. It provides a comprehensive list of planned equipment projects which will be progressed over five years. This plan builds on the intentions set out in the White Paper in relation to equipment acquisition, modernisation and upgrade and has been developed to ensure that our Defence Forces have the major equipment platforms, ancillary equipment and force protection equipment to carry out their important roles both at home and overseas. </p>  <p>  The Equipment Planning process recognises the need to maintain and upgrade military capabilities having regard to emerging operational requirements and changes in technology and this is an ongoing process. </p>  <p>  Modern secure communications are essential for the Defence Forces and in that regard Defence Force personnel are suitably equipped in a variety of roles with required communications and global positioning systems (GPS) equipment. GPS systems are used to aid navigation and as a force protection measure. They are integrated on board vehicles, vessels and aircraft control systems and embedded in communications systems used by Defence Force personnel in order to achieve a Joint Common Operating Picture. </p>  <p>  I am advised by the Military Authorities that the Defence Forces operate many different types of radar systems. Existing capabilities available to the Army include radar systems such as the Giraffe Mk4 short-range air defence system and the Foxtrack X-Band ground surveillance radar. The Air Corps use surface search radar on the CASA 235 maritime patrol aircraft and all aircraft are fitted with a transponder and the automatic identification system (AIS) for identification and tracking. The Naval Service use maritime surface search radar and the Recognised Maritime Picture (RMP) systems for surveillance and tracking. </p>  <p>  It remains Government policy, as per the 2015 White Paper on Defence, that should additional funding, beyond that provided for in existing plans becomes available, the development of a radar surveillance capability for the Air Corps, will be considered.</p>  <p>  The Naval Service Vessel Renewal and Replacement Programme is ongoing, this programme includes radar and other equipment upgrades along with the replacement of Naval Service Reserve motor launches. The programme of works for the midlife refit and upgrade of L&Eacute; R&oacute;is&iacute;n has been completed, while works are ongoing on L&Eacute; Niamh. Marine Advisors have been appointed to support the procurement of multi-role vessel to replace the flagship, L&Eacute; Eithne, with work underway that will inform a public tender competition in due course. Two Inshore Patrol Vessels have been purchased from the New Zealand Government to replace L&Eacute; Orla and L&Eacute; Ciara, it is expected these vessels will be transported to Ireland in 2023 following the completion of a programme of works.</p>  <p>  The Naval Service is equipped with a various surveillance equipment in order to undertake the roles assigned by Government, including certain capabilities that allow for underwater search and surveying, for example, an underwater remotely operated vehicle, ROV, and a magnetometer system. As part of the ongoing development of capabilities, further capabilities that will enhance the Naval Service&rsquo;s under-sea situational awareness, such as multibeam echo sounder systems, are also being developed.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Government established an independent Commission on the Defence Forces in December 2020. The work of the Commission encompasses the consideration of appropriate military equipment capabilities, structures and staffing, and their report will inform decisions regarding the future development of the Defence Forces. </p></reply>

The NCCA&rsquo;s review of senior cycle involved an extensive range of research, consultations and communications with a wide range of stakeholders.</p><p>The three tenets of Senior Cycle reform are to:</p><p>- Empower students to meet the challenges of the 21st century</p><p>- Enrich the student experience and build on what&rsquo;s strong in our current system</p><p>- Embed well-being and reduce student stress levels</p><p>Transition Year is a valuable programme for students that offers opportunities for life skills, personal, social and academic development and experience of adult and working life. I am also of the view that Transition Year should continue as a stand-alone programme taken in fourth year. </p><p>Transition Year has a unique and important value in the life of students. Currently over seventy per cent of students avail of Transition Year. </p><p>On 29 March I announced that Transition Year should be available to every student who wishes to participate in the programme. This will be achieved by working with schools to ensure that schools who are constrained in the numbers they can currently accommodate in Transition Year are supported to expand the provision. I will work with my officials and my colleagues in Government to ensure that where additional resources for schools are needed to facilitate this they are provided. </p><p>On 29 March I also announced that a revised Transition Year programme statement will be developed through working with schools.  This will be available from early 2024 and will help to ensure the delivery of a valuable Transition Year experience for students across all schools participating in the programme. This will include the provision of professional support to teachers and schools in terms of continuous professional development.</p></reply>

In the current school year over 121,400 children, including over 15,500 children with special educational needs, are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;289m in 2021.</p>  <p>  I know what a hugely important service school transport is for families and children.  As you are aware my Department commenced a review of the School Transport Scheme in February 2021. The review is being conducted with a view to examining the current scheme, its broader effectiveness and sustainability, and to ensure that it serves students and their families adequately. </p>  <p>  The review encompasses the School Transport Scheme for Children with Special Educational Needs and the Primary and Post-Primary School Transport Schemes in terms of how each element of the schemes currently operate, to include eligibility criteria, trends, costs and cost drivers, and overall effectiveness in meeting the objectives of the schemes.  </p>  <p>  The review will also examine the potential for integration of different strands of the scheme and a more co-ordinated approach with other Government Departments that also use transport services. The review will consider issues such as climate action, supporting rural development and promoting where possible initiatives that encourage walking and cycling to school. </p>  <p>  In June 2021, the Steering Group presented me with an initial interim report.  Following consideration of this report, I approved temporary alleviation measures which allowed for the provision of transport for post-primary students who were otherwise eligible for school transport but were attending their second nearest school and had applied and paid on time.  </p>  <p>  Wider considerations relating to operation of the scheme are now taking place in the second phase of the review.  The Technical Working Group has undertaken extensive consultation over the last number of months; including running a public survey for parents/guardians and students who use the service and those who do not use the service but who would like to.  The Group has also consulted with a broad array of stakeholders including schools, special education  interest groups, industry representatives and other Government Departments, </p>  <p>  The Steering Group will continue to report to me on an interim basis as the review progresses. </p>  <p>  While work on the review is being impacted somewhat by challenges including the pandemic and the impact on resources arising from the ongoing crisis in Ukraine, it is anticipated that the completion of the final phases of the review will be in the shortest timeframe possible.  I will then examine and consider the final recommendations once received from the steering group on the future operation of the Department&rsquo;s School Transport Scheme.</p></reply>

In line with last year, the total funding available to provide summer programmes this year is up to &euro;40 million. Building on the 2021 programme, all schools, both primary and post-primary, are encouraged to provide this valuable programme to their students. In 2021 nearly 38,000 children availed of the summer programme, an increase of 60% from the previous year.</p>  <p>  My Department held consultations with education stakeholders and advocacy groups, following this, steps were taken to encourage more schools to participate including the following: the provision of paid overseeing and preparation time for schools, a reduction in the administrative burden for schools, arrangements to pay staff sooner, greater guidance, an online payments portal for schools, and greater flexibility in the timing of the programme. </p>  <p>   The complexities of organising a summer programme in special school environments is recognised and further enhanced funding for special schools is being provided this year including increase capitation and preparation to support these schools. </p>  <p>  Concerns around availability of staff have been further addressed with the provision to recruit final year student teachers and student teachers registered with the Teaching Council under Route 5. To support and facilitate schools and principals with organising and running the programme, principals may delegate these functions to other members of staff through the Overseer role and preparation hours. Overseers, teachers and SNAs who work on the programme will be paid for this work based on what they are normally paid during the school year in addition to their normal salary.</p>  <p>  In 2021, 377 special schools and schools with special classes ran a programme, with in the region of 5,587 pupils attending. For context in 2011 there were 149 schools and 2,461 pupils attending the &lsquo;July provision&rsquo; programme. The number of special schools running a programme under the &lsquo;July provision&rsquo; scheme had fallen from 54 in 2011 to 34 in 2019. It is important to note that we have actually seen an increase in the number of special schools running a programme in both 2020 and 2021 with 39 special schools taking part in 2021. </p>  <p>   While the number of special schools and classes taking part has risen over the last 2 years we want to continue this growth in participation further. The Department will continue to work with all stakeholders to support parents in accessing summer provision and with schools to ensure that they have the resources and supports necessary to successfully run these programmes.</p></reply>

In addition, many schools have access to adjacent local facilities, including community halls, public parks, playing fields and swimming pools.</p>  <p>  My Department provides general purpose and PE halls with the construction of all new primary and post primary schools respectively. These facilities may also be provided where a major building or refurbishment project is being delivered for an existing school.  However, the majority of schools already have a GP room or PE hall, as appropriate, as indicated in their Annual School Returns.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, my Department continues to implement the capital programme under the National Development Plan.  Investment and expenditure on GP rooms and PE halls is an element of the overall expenditure and investment in the School Building Programme.  The main focus of resources over the last decade has been on provision of additional capacity to cater for increasing demographics, particularly at post-primary level and for special education needs provision.  </p>  <p>  However, under Project Ireland 2040 there will be an increasing focus on the upgrade and refurbishment of the existing school stock.  This will include a PE Hall build and modernisation programme to ensure that students in all post-primary schools have access to appropriate facilities to support PE provision, as committed to in the Programme for Government. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be aware of the very significant school building programme that is currently underway.  Overall, there are in excess of 1,300 school building projects at various stages of design, planning, and construction. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, at a national level, primary enrolments are projected to decrease significantly over the coming decade, from a peak in 2018.  While there will be local and regional variations, and the impact of Ukrainian arrivals will mitigate this reduction somewhat, there will be strategic opportunities to consider the overall accommodation needs of schools. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to work to ensure that capital investment in our schools is targeted in the most efficient and effective way to support schools in meeting the education needs of their students and communities. </p></reply>

In addition to teacher allocations based on pupil teacher ratios, an ex-quota allocation teaching posts is also allocated to Island schools, schools in single catchment areas, and schools who teach through the medium of Irish. In accordance with the published staffing arrangements, each school management authority is required to organise its subject options within the limit of its approved teacher allocation. </p>  <p>  A number of ETBs also receive posts on a historical basis which are described as small school posts.

This means that overall, 347 schools will benefit. As a result of this announcement from September 2022, this will increase the number of schools supported in the DEIS programme to 1,194 schools and over 240,000 students or nearly 1 in 4 students. Schools were identified for inclusion in the programme through the refined DEIS identification model which is an objective, statistics based model.  </p>  <p>  This model uses information from my Department's enrolment databases and the Pobal HP Deprivation index. The Pobal HP Deprivation index is used by numerous State agencies for the identification of disadvantage, in order to target resources towards communities most in need. The Index is a method of measuring the relative affluence or disadvantage of a particular geographical area using data returned from the most recent national census. </p>  <p>  The Department consulted with education partners, including school management bodies and teacher and principal representative bodies, during the refinement of the model. Drawing on the feedback from this consultation, the refined DEIS identification model builds on the objectivity and fairness of the 2017 version, but now captures a greater breadth of disadvantage and accounts for severity of disadvantage through the application of a weighted process. It also takes into consideration the significant educational disadvantage experienced by Travellers and Roma learners and of students residing in direct provision or state funded emergency homeless accommodation. Schools were not required to apply for inclusion in the DEIS programme and the model has been applied fairly and equally to all schools. </p>  <p>  My Department continues to be in regular communication with schools and is always available to engage with schools as issues arise. This includes where schools wish to contact my Department in relation to any aspect of the refined DEIS identification model in the context of their particular school circumstances. </p>  <p>  My Department is committed to ensuring that all schools are treated equally and fairly in the manner in which they have been identified for inclusion in the DEIS programme. Schools which were not satisfied with the outcome following the application of the DEIS identification model to their school enrolment data had the opportunity to have that outcome reviewed. Circular 0019/2022, outlining the details of the DEIS appeals process, was published on the 30th March 2022 by my Department and is available on the gov.ie website. All schools were notified of the appeals process. The deadline to submit an appeal was Friday 29th April 2022.</p>  <p>  Appeals were received from 197 schools out of 3832 mainstream primary and post primary schools in Ireland, indicating that just under 95% of schools were satisfied with the application of the model to their school enrolment data. </p>  <p>  All appeals received are now being processed and it is my intention that schools will be provided with the outcome promptly to allow schools time to plan for the 2022/23 school year. </p></reply>

The purpose of SIM is to build the capacity of participating schools so they can support the inclusion of all children particularly those with special educational needs (SEN).</p><p>My Department recognises that the current range of supports in schools i.e. teaching and care does not, on their own, meet the needs of some children with SEN. This is particularly the case for children with complex needs in the areas of speech and language, communication, sensory impairments, self-regulation and behaviour. Its purpose is to help students achieve better outcomes. </p><p>The Model comprises a number of key elements in respect of building school capacity including the following:</p><p>- Provision of in-school therapies (speech and language, occupational)</p><p>- Allocation of SNAs on a front-loaded basis</p><p>- Additional professional supports for the school including psychology, behavioural and professional development</p><p>- Training of SNAs</p><p>The initial pilot of the Model took place in 75 schools and 75 early learning centres located in the HSE CH07 area in the 2018/19 school year and this was positively evaluated.  The Model was then extended to facilitate further development and evaluation but this was disrupted by Covid-19 in March 2020 and the Pilot was then paused.  At this time, the HSE withdrew the speech and language and occupational therapists and redeployed them to Covid related work. It was then extended to the 2020/21 school year which was also interrupted by Covid.  </p><p>The Pilot has now recommenced in CHO7 and therapists are working within these schools and are providing ongoing support on a responsive basis to deliver therapy-based strategies and tools. Overall there is good engagement by the schools in CHO7. Where schools have provided feedback to the NCSE on the overall SIM project, they were positive about their experience and expectations of the supports. </p><p>Planning for an expansion is underway. My officials have consulted  with relevant Departments including Taoiseach, Health and DCEDIY. There are a number of challenges to expanding SIM to other areas at this time. The single greatest constraint is insufficient supply of SLTs and OTs to meet health and education needs. The recruitment of therapists is also a significant issue for the Department of Health and the HSE.</p><p>Some of the issues can be more easily addressed than others but the expansion requires further consideration and planning work to identify and deliver appropriate solutions.</p><p>My officials are continuing to work through proposals to mitigate the challenges. Once these are finalised, it is intended that a Memo will be brought to Government with the plans for expansion and the approach which, over time, would allow for SIM to be extended to all schools.</p><p>The SIM model provides a framework of teaching, care, training and therapeutic supports to facilitate the optimal inclusion of children with special educational needs in education. </p><p>I am therefore committed to its development. </p></reply>

Steps have been taken to afford schools as much flexibility as possible, and to encourage them to participate. These Include: the provision of paid overseeing and preparation time for schools, a reduction in the administrative burden for schools, arrangements to pay staff sooner, greater guidance, an online payments portal for schools, and greater flexibility in the timing of the programme. </p>  <p>  However, my Department also recognises that not all schools will be in a position to provide a school-based programme, so a home-based programme continues to be available for students with complex needs where the school-based programme is unavailable. It is important that the home-based programme provides support for the education and/or care needs of students with complex needs during the summer break period.</p>  <p>  Under the home-based programme grant funding is made available so that parents/legal guardians can engage the services of a teacher or an SNA to provide tuition or care support as appropriate in the child&rsquo;s home.  Schools are requested to provide parents with the contact details of a teacher/SNA where possible. </p>  <p>  The NCSE have compiled a non-exhaustive list of private home tutor services and online platforms who may advertise for tutors for the 2022 Summer Programme and published it on their website.</p>  <p>  The Irish Primary Principals Network has created a Summer Programme Noticeboard for teachers and SNAs to advertise their availability for the programme.  Additionally this year, parents can also post notices on the noticeboard to source suitable candidates.   </p>  <p>  The Department will continue to work with all stakeholders to support parents in accessing summer provision and with schools to ensure that they have the resources and supports necessary to successfully run these programmes.</p></reply>

The two main grants are the Capitation grant to cater for day to day running costs such as heating, lighting, cleaning, insurance, general up-keep etc. and the Ancillary/School Services Support Fund (SSSF) to cater for the cost of employing ancillary services staff.  Schools also receive a range of other grants including Book Grants, Programme grants etc., as well as capital funding and direct staffing supports.  Overall, schools received &euro;564 million in capitation funding in the last academic year.</p>  <p>  In addition, under the COVID-19 response plans, a range of supports are being made available to all recognised schools in the free education scheme. Overall &euro;948 million has been made available to schools. To date more than &euro;318 million of additional capitation funding, which includes &euro;159.6 million for the 2021/2022 school year, has been made available to primary and post primary schools to provide for Cleaning, PPE and hand hygiene, Enhanced Supervision and employment of an Aide.</p>  <p>  I understand the need for improved capitation funding and I am pleased that budget 2020 was able to provide for a further 2.5% increase in standard capitation funding for primary schools that applied from the start of the 2020/21 school year. This builds on the 5% increase in capitation announced in budget 2019.</p>  <p>  All schools have received the benefit of the capitation increases awarded to date. It is my intention to seek funding for further capitation increases in future budgets.</p>  <p>  Annual funding would need to be increased by an additional &euro;10 million approximately to restore the standard capitation rate for pupils in primary schools to &euro;200 based on current enrolments.  </p></reply>

Schools who were not satisfied with the outcome following the application of the DEIS identification model to their school enrolment data have been provided with the opportunity to make an appeal.  Circular 0019/2022 outlining the details of the DEIS appeals process, was published on the 30th March 2022 by my Department and is available at gov.ie website. All schools were notified of the appeals process. </p>  <p>  Schools who wished to make an appeal were afforded the opportunity to do so in line with the process outlined in the Circular.

HSE Primary Care Psychology Services and Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) provide a range of clinical support to children and young people with mental health needs.  However, the Department of Education also plays an important role in supporting the well-being and mental health of our young people.</p>  <p>  The Department&rsquo;s Well-being Policy and Framework for practice has given recognition to the importance of promoting well-being in education.  The approach set out in the Well-being Policy is a whole school and preventative approach which has multiple components that include providing children and young people with opportunities to build core social and emotional skills and competencies, experience supportive relationships within the school setting and be part of a school environment and culture that feels both physically and psychologically safe.</p>  <p>  It is important that all children and young people feel a sense of belonging and connectedness, that their voice is heard, and they feel supported. Schools are encouraged to use a reflective, school self-evaluation approach to identify and prioritise the needs of its own school community in relation to the promotion of well-being and mental health, and to respond to meeting those needs.  Embedded in the whole-school approach is the recognition that members of the school community may have different needs at different times and that a continuum of support in relation to well-being should be made available.</p>  <p>  A broad range of supports, resources and professional learning opportunities are being provided to support schools to promote and support well-being and resilience.  My Department's Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) commenced a national roll-out of CPD for all schools on the implementation of my Departments Well-being Policy in March, which will make initial training with follow-up support visits available for all schools in the country over the next three years.  My Department's National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) provides a comprehensive psychological service to all primary and post primary schools. NEPS is a school-based service which means that all its psychologists work in schools with children, young people, teachers and parents, and are involved with school-related work, every day.  The NEPS psychologist provides a range of services that may include supporting the well-being and inclusion of an individual pupil, through assessment and intervention.  NEPS supports approximately 8000 individual children annually through this type of work.  NEPS work also supports teachers in their work through providing professional learning opportunities, such as about trauma informed approaches, supporting autistic children, or delivering the Friends for Life programmes to help reduce anxiety.  NEPS supports an estimated 25,000 teachers annually in this way. </p>  <p>The Department &ndash; through NEPS, Student Support Teams, Guidance Counsellors and other services - will also continue to signpost schools and students to the HSE/HSE-funded e-mental health services. The Department has built strong links with the Department of Health and both Departments are exploring ways to improve supports for young people, including around increased awareness, promoting help-seeking behaviour and sign-posting to the wide range of available services.  We will continue to collectively explore ways of improving supports for children and young people.  </p></reply>

It was set up to improve the delivery of education services to persons with special educational needs arising from disabilities with particular emphasis on children.  Formally established under the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 (EPSEN Act), the NCSE now has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide. As the visiting teacher service forms a really important part of the NCSE support service for schools, the visiting teachers are now recruited, deployed and managed by the NCSE.</p>  <p>  The visiting teachers are qualified teachers with particular skills and knowledge of the development and education of children with varying degrees of hearing loss and/or visual impairment. They offer longitudinal support to children, their families and schools from the time of referral through to the end of post-primary education. They help children to develop tactile and sensory skills and give advice on self-help and other skills needed for independent living. They provide support in the development of pre-Braille skills, where necessary, and give instruction in mobility where appropriate.</p>  <p>  Each visiting teacher operates in a particular region and manages a caseload of students. The visiting teacher supports children/young people, parents, guardians, teachers and other professionals involved with the child. Each visiting teacher works in partnership with parents to advise, and offer guidance, in matters pertaining to the child&rsquo;s education and overall development. The frequency and nature of support takes into account a range of factors based on the individual&rsquo;s needs. </p>  <p>  Currently there are 43 visiting teacher posts, allocated across the 10 NCSE regional teams, supported by teams of professionals and agencies such as audiological scientists, ophthalmology services, speech and language therapists, low vision specialists, psychologists, early intervention teams and school staff.  </p></reply>

For the 2022/23 school year, the staffing schedule for primary schools has been improved by one point and schools will be provided with class teachers on the basis of 1 teacher for every 24 pupils which means that our primary schools will be staffed at the most favourable level ever seen in September.  1,750 additional posts in schools are being provided in the 2022/23 school year, including 1,330 teaching posts to cater for a reduction in pupil teacher ratio and additional teachers in special education. This builds on a similar one point reduction in Budget 2021, which supported the creation of 1065 posts. Budget 22 also provided lower staffing retention levels for all primary schools.  This has made it easier for small primary schools to retain a classroom teacher even where there has been a slight decline in enrolment numbers.</p>  <p>  The staffing process contains an appeals mechanism for schools to submit a staffing appeal under certain criteria, including a specific one aimed at small schools, to an independent Primary Staffing Appeals Board.  The Appeals Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.</p>  <p>  The school referred to by the Deputy has submitted a staffing appeal.  The appeal will be considered by the Appeals Board and the school will be informed of the outcome at the end of this month. </p></reply>

RSE is required at all levels in schools, from primary through to Senior Cycle. </p>  <p>  All schools are required to have an RSE policy that is developed in consultation with the school community, including school management, parents, teachers and students as appropriate. The school&rsquo;s programme for Relationship and Sexuality Education is developed and taught in the context of the school&rsquo;s RSE policy.  In addition, schools are required to teach all aspects of the RSE programme, including family planning, sexually transmitted infections and sexual orientation. It is important to note that the ethos of the school should never preclude learners from acquiring the knowledge about the issues. </p>  <p>  Access to Relationships and Sexuality Education, or RSE, is an important right for students. This is reflected in the Programme for Government, which states that this Government will develop inclusive and age appropriate curricula for RSE and Social, Personal and Health Education across primary and post-primary schools. The Department continues to advance work in this regard.</p>  <p>  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment was requested to conduct a review of RSE provision in Irish schools, focussing on a range of topics including healthy positive, sexual expression and relationships and LGBTQ+ matters. The NCCA published &ldquo;The Report on the Review of Relationships and Sexuality Education in primary and post-primary schools&rdquo; in December 2019.</p>  <p>  This report resulted in the NCCA establishing two development groups, one for primary and one for post-primary, to oversee the work of developing updated curriculum materials in this area and supporting the development of guidance material for schools. These groups have met frequently since their initial establishment.</p>  <p>  The immediate focus of the NCCA work has been on creating support materials for teachers as part of an Interim Guidance Toolkit. This Toolkit aims to support effective teaching and learning of SPHE/RSE and to deepen teachers' understanding and skills in addressing important and sensitive topics. </p>  <p>  The NCCA Toolkit is being expanded in 2022 to include further age and stage appropriate guidance for teachers on how to address these topics within the SPHE classroom. </p>  <p>  In tandem with this work, preparation for the broader redeveloping and updating of the SPHE curriculum has begun. Updated curricula will be developed for Primary, Junior Cycle and Senior Cycle.  </p>  <p>  A draft revised Junior Cycle specification is due to be agreed at NCCA Council in early Summer, with a public consultation to follow. The final revised specification is due to be completed by the end of 2022. </p>  <p>  Preparation to update the Senior Cycle SPHE/RSE specification has commenced and it is intended that a meeting of the Senior Cycle development group will be convened in the next week. This group will prepare a background paper and brief which will form the basis of their work of redeveloping the Senior Cycle SPHE/RSE specification. </p>  <p>  In redeveloping the SPHE curriculum, the NCCA will be making explicit the importance of fostering young people's self-awareness and self-esteem and building the foundational skills and dispositions needed for building caring and healthy relationships (including respectful communication, showing empathy, and appreciating difference). </p></reply>

The focus of the RACE scheme is on removing examination access barriers, while retaining the need to assess the same underlying skills and competencies, and to apply the same standards of achievement, as apply to all other students. </p>  <p>  For reasons of fairness and integrity, accommodations can only be provided in accordance with the published Framework of Principles and the requirements of the scheme to eligible students based on their level of need and the accommodation-specific eligibility criteria. </p>  <p>  For candidates with visual impairments, the SEC works very closely with the Visiting Teacher Service (VTS) of the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) whose role includes supporting visually impaired children and young people and their parents, guardians and teachers. In 2019, the most recent year for which complete data is available the SEC provided c.200 candidates with accommodations due to visual impairments. </p>  <p>  An extensive range of examination supports is available to support candidates with visual impairments. These include modified, enlarged and braille versions of papers; reading and writing accommodations involving assistive technology or personal support; drawing aids in certain subjects; and additional time at a rate of 10 minutes per hour subject to a 30 per examination paper limit. In the context of time in the examinations, it might be noted that additional time is available to candidates only in a very narrow range of circumstances one of which is to candidates with visual impairments. The SEC also provides Digital Coursework Booklets to candidates eligible to use word processors in a wide range of Leaving Certificate and Junior Cycle Subject subjects. This allows students of these subjects to complete their coursework in digital format for submission for marking. </p>  <p>  Under the RACE Scheme, the SEC is open to considering applications for use of non-standard assistive technologies (other than those named in the scheme). Such applications will be decided upon by the SEC having due consideration to a number of factors including the candidate&rsquo;s normal way of working; examinations integrity; the overhead of developing test instruments in alternative formats; and the principles and requirements of the RACE Scheme. </p>  <p>  The RACE scheme was comprehensively reviewed from the 2017 examinations and will be subject to further review in the context of reform at Senior Cycle. A priority in the next phase of review will be increasing use of Assistive Technology to enhance access and integrity and to further support independent learning. In this regard there will be extensive consultation and engagement with all of the relevant stakeholders.</p></reply>

Schools participating in my Department&rsquo;s DEIS Programme receive an enhanced rate of book grant. </p>  <p>  School book rental schemes have an important role to play in reducing the cost of school books for parents and guardians. In order to support the establishment of book rental schemes, my Department provided &euro;15.7 million seed capital in 2014, 2015 and 2016 to all primary schools.   </p>  <p>  From the information available to my Department currently, approximately 96% of all primary schools and 69% of all post-primary schools operate a book rental scheme. </p>  <p>  It is a matter for the Board of Management of each individual school to decide on its own policy in relation to the use of book grant funding in the school. Schools are expected to adopt a cost-conscious approach to the selection of books for use in their classes. The current arrangement relies on the local knowledge of the school in order to ensure a fair allocation of funds to those students most in need. </p>  <p>  Additional funding of &euro;1million was provided under Budget 2020 to provide free books in DEIS primary schools on a pilot basis. This funding was allocated to 102 DEIS primary schools for a new pilot programme for the 2020/21 school year.  This funding continued this for the 2021/22 school year. </p>  <p>  The aim of this pilot is to provide free school books for students in the schools involved, and to support these schools in eliminating the cost of school books for parents. It will continue to run for the 2021/22 school year and its effectiveness and impact will be monitored and evaluated before any decision is made as regards its possible extension or continuation. It is my intention to complete this process as soon as possible. Under Circular 46/2013, DEIS primary schools receive a book grant of &euro;21 per pupil.  This pilot provided an additional &euro;64 per pupil to increase the overall book grant rate to &euro;85 per pupil enrolled in the school. This is in line with the costings as set out in the 2019 Barnardos report on the Real Cost of School which states that &euro;85 is the average cost of school books at primary school. </p>  <p>  Funding of &euro;20 million is being made available in 2022 to enable schools (primary and post-primary) to purchase books, audio books and other media for the purposes of improving their existing literacy resource banks. This funding is additional to that already given for the school books rental scheme and book grants to all recognised primary and post-primary schools within the Free Education Scheme in order to alleviate the cost of school books for parents. </p>  <p>  The grant is to be paid to schools based on pupil numbers at the same rate for all schools, primary and post-primary. The Department with support from the Public Library Service will provide support to schools on how best to use the funding received. This will be in the form of a guidance note, webinars and support from local libraries.</p></reply>

In common with similar schemes which operate in other jurisdictions, the focus of the RACE scheme is on the need to remove examination access barriers, while retaining the need to assess the same underlying skills and competencies, and to apply the same standards of achievement, as apply to all other students. </p>  <p>  Under the existing provisions of the RACE Scheme, every possible effort is also made by the SEC to accommodate candidates who experience accidents, serious illness or other trauma either immediately before or during the examinations. </p>  <p>  There are arrangements that can be made between the SEC and the school in the best interests of an ill or injured candidate to enable the candidate to proceed with their examination on the scheduled date. For candidates who suffer from epilepsy, these arrangements might include supervised rest breaks during the examinations; access to a smaller special examination centre; and alterations to the start and end time of the examinations. </p>  <p>  It is acknowledged that students experience many forms of trauma and adversity, such as serious illness and bereavement, around the time of the Leaving Certificate examinations. The issues arising here are complex and must be balanced against the absolute need to maintain integrity and public confidence in the examinations system. </p>  <p>  Deferred examinations were held for the first time in 2019 for students who had experienced bereavement of a close family member. The SEC had commenced a comprehensive review of the broader issue of how best to support students experiencing other forms of trauma and adversity at examinations time which included consultation with stakeholders as well as research into practices in other jurisdictions. </p>  <p>  For the 2022 Leaving Certificate, I have announced that there will be a deferred sitting of the Leaving Certificate for students unable to sit one or more papers in the main sitting in June due to serious medical conditions or close family bereavement. It is intended that the deferred sitting will commence shortly after the conclusion of the main sitting.  </p>  <p>  Epilepsy Ireland was among the organisations which submitted a response to the SEC&rsquo;s consultation in early 2020 noting that this process was halted due to the pandemic. More recently, officials from the SEC met with Epilepsy Ireland on Friday the 29th April 2022 in relation to access to the deferred examinations series. </p>  <p>  Further details of the deferred sitting of the Leaving Certificate will be issued by the SEC in due course.   </p></reply>

Information from a range of sources, including Child Benefit data, school enrolment data and information on residential development activity is used for this purpose.  Additionally, Project Ireland 2040 population and housing targets inform my Department's projections of school place requirements.</p><p>Having considered the projected requirements in each school planning area, my Department then makes an assessment of the existing capacity within that particular area and its ability to meet any increased demand.  </p><p>Where data indicates that additional provision is required at primary or post primary level, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:</p><p>- Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,</p><p>- Extending the capacity of a school or schools,</p><p>- Provision of a new school or schools.</p><p>My Department's projections of post primary school place requirements in East Cork show some continued growth in enrolments in the short- to medium-term across most areas, with most growth anticipated in the Midleton_Carrigtwohill school planning area. </p><p>However, in response to projected future need and to enrolment pressures in the area, there has been significant capital investment by my Department at post primary schools in East Cork.  A new post primary school, Carrigtwohill Community College, was established in 2016.  A project to deliver a new, modern 1,000 pupil school building for that school is underway.  Additionally, an extension at St. Colman's Community College, Midleton has been recently completed and a number of other large school building projects are also in train, delivering expanded capacity at St. Aloysius' College in Carrigtwohill, Midleton CBS, St. Mary's High School in Midleton, Pobalscoil na Tr&iacute;on&oacute;ide in Youghal, Col&aacute;iste an Phiarsaigh in Glanmire, Col&aacute;iste Mhuire in Cobh and Carrignafoy Community College Cobh..</p><p>While my Department is aware of increasing pressures and demand for additional school places in East Cork, it is important to note that where enrolment pressures arise, it may not be as a result of lack of accommodation but may be driven by the following factors:</p><p>- Duplication of applications &ndash; pupils have applied for a place to a number of schools in the area</p><p>- School of choice &ndash; pupils can&rsquo;t get a place in their preferred school while there are places in other schools in the town/area</p><p>- Some towns/areas have single sex schools and while places are available in the school they are not available to all pupils</p><p>- External draw &ndash; pupils coming from outside the local area</p><p>My Department is working to establish the true extent of any capacity issues through ongoing discussions with the relevant school authorities. In that context, similar to the process adopted in advance of the current academic year, my Department is engaging with patron bodies, including patrons of schools in East Cork areas, to identify particular capacity requirements for the forthcoming years which may necessitate further action to that already in train including, where required, the provision of modular accommodation solutions. </p><p>As a result of ongoing discussions with patrons in the School Planning Area, St Colman&rsquo;s College, Midleton has recently offered places for an additional 1<sup>st</sup>year class group for the 2022/23 school year.</p><p>Additionally, my Department will continue to work to advance the planned and current projects in East Cork and to ensure sufficient places for both mainstream provision and for pupils with special education requirements both for the coming academic year and into the future.</p><p>Given medium- to long-term projected demographic trends, it is not currently anticipated that there will be a requirement for a further new post primary school in the area, nevertheless, my Department will continue to monitor the situation.</p></reply>

My Department is currently working collaboratively with a number of Departments and organisations to ensure a whole of Government approach to support education provision for arriving children with immediate education needs. </p>  <p>  Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, I and my Government colleagues have also received regular updates at Cabinet on supports for people arriving from Ukraine in order to ensure appropriate coordination and integration of each Department&rsquo;s response. It was agreed that a co-ordinated, whole-of-Government response will be essential. Particular emphasis was placed on the need for co-ordination across Government of policy, the implementation of actions and communications.</p>  <p>  In this regard, my Department is engaging closely with colleagues in the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. My Department is also working with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government in respect of the relationship between the location of the accommodation provided for people arriving from Ukraine and the identification of appropriate school capacity.</p>  <p>  Regional Education and Language Teams (REALT) have been established to help ensure good coordination and alignment of supports for Ukrainian children arriving in Ireland.  These Education and Language Teams are hosted by the 16 regional education and training boards (ETBs) and are staffed by existing regionally-based education support personnel working closely together to ensure good coordination and alignment of supports for Ukrainian children. My Department is liaising with the teams to ensure all necessary supports for the Ukrainian children are provided as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  The primary role of the REALT is to build on existing regional education support structures and the initial focus will be on assisting families in securing school places. REALT will also support schools in the area to meet the needs of these children as they emerge, to advise and support my Department in developing new capacity where required, and to co-ordinate the provision of education services to schools and families across their defined area.</p>  <p>  These teams will ensure that clear, accessible information flows are in place between schools, local education support services and national support structures in relation to people arriving from Ukraine.</p>  <p>  The regional teams will be hosted and administratively supported within the ETBs and will lead a network of other key agencies, including Tusla Education Support Service (TESS), NEPS regional personnel, NCSE regional personnel and Management body local nominees working together with local schools. </p>  <p>  Many resources for teaching, learning and inclusion of Ukrainian pupils have been published to date, including a central repository of information and CPD resources for school leaders and teachers to support cultural and linguistic diversity, which is available on the Scoilnet.ie website. </p>  <p>  These resources include those designed by the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) to help children suffering from trauma. NEPS psychologists are available on the ground to consult with schools and provide support as needed. </p>  <p>  Resources also include EAL, intercultural and relevant curriculum supports developed by the teacher education supports services including PDST, the NCCA and the ETB sector. A helpline for school principals is also in place. Schools that have enrolled students from Ukraine can apply for additional EAL support and hundreds of schools are already receiving this support. </p>  <p>  My Department is working to ensure that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) will be available to support schools that have children from Ukraine with additional or special educational needs. Local Special Education Needs Organisers (SENOs) will be available to support individual families in accessing education and related supports for their children with special education needs. In this regard the SENOs will link with other relevant state agencies including Education Welfare Services and the HSE.</p>  <p>  I recently announced that a summer 2022 education programme for pupils with complex special educational needs and those at greatest risk of educational disadvantage. All schools (primary and post-primary) will be encouraged to provide summer programmes including post-primary children with complex needs and children at risk of educational disadvantage. </p>  <p>  The Inclusion element of this programme also offers an opportunity for schools to address the needs of migrant students such as addressing English language skills and integration, including students who have recently arrived in Ireland from Ukraine.</p>  <p>Further information in relation to my Department&rsquo;s approach and the supports in place is available on the Department&rsquo;s website and is updated as appropriate.  www.gov.ie/en/organisation/department-of-education/  </p></reply>

The Department does not have a role in making individual school determinations.</p>  <p>  The Special Needs Assistant (SNA) scheme is designed to provide schools with additional adult support staff who can assist children with special educational needs who also have additional and significant care needs.  Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.</p>  <p>  SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. </p>  <p>  It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p>  <p>  Where circumstances change during the course of the 2021/22 school year that materially increase the level of care need in a school to the extent that the school can clearly demonstrate that it cannot be met within the existing SNA allocation, the school may apply to the NCSE for a review. Detailed information on the NCSE exceptional review process is published on the NCSE website ncse.ie/for-schools</p>  <p>  In relation to school in question the NCSE have confirmed that the schools current SNA allocation is 8.83 posts. There are 4.5 SNAs allocated to 2 ASD Special Classes and there are 4.33 SNA posts allocated to mainstream.</p>  <p>  The NCSE state the school applied for an SNA exceptional review in June of 2021 &ndash; this application was incomplete and the school as advised accordingly on 10th of June 2021. The school applied for another SNA exceptional review in June 2021. This application was reviewed by a SENO and deemed invalid an outcome letter was issued to the school and the ticket was closed on the 9th July 2021.</p>  <p>  The school submitted an appeal of the outcome of the Exceptional review, this was processed in line with NCSE procedure and the appeal was not upheld. </p>  <p>  The NCSE have confirmed that the school has submitted 5 requests for support in the past 2 years. Support calls/visits were completed for all of these with the exception of the most recent one which was submitted in April 2022 and currently has an Advisor assigned who will engage with the school in due course. </p>  <p>  The NCSE manages the exceptional review process and handles each case individually. Some review requests can be concluded as an office based exercise, whilst others require a school to be visited in order to observe the current deployment of SNA support in the school setting.</p>  <p>  The timeframe for concluding a review can vary depending on the school context or the nature of the information provided. </p>  <p>  Where a school is dissatisfied with how their exceptional review has been processed or is dissatisfied with the outcome of their exceptional review they can appeal. Applications for Appeal may be submitted through the NCSE Schools Portal: ncse.ie/school-support. </p>  <p>  All schools have the contact details of their local SENO, and the SENO is available to offer assistance and advice to the school. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</p>  <p>  I hope the above is of some assistance to you. </p></reply>

Assessment Officers under the remit of the HSE are charged with organising the Assessment of Need.  The Assessment Officer makes the determination as to whether or not a child or young person meets the definition of disability contained in the act and coordinates and completes the Assessment Report.</p>  <p>  Following a recent High Court ruling in October 2021 there is now a requirement on the education system to provide an assessment of Education Needs as part of the Assessment of Need Process. My Department is considering its implications.  The Department are working with the Department of Health, the NCSE and the HSE and taking legal advice. I expect to receive a proposal on the matter shortly.  </p>  <p>  Enabling children with special educational needs to receive an education is a priority for this Government. This year, my Department will spend in excess of &euro;2 Billion, or over 25% of the Department&rsquo;s budget on providing a wide range of schemes and supports for children with special educational needs. </p>  <p>  This includes additional teaching and care supports.

Budget 2022 provided an additional 620 new SET posts for allocation to primary and post primary schools in 2022/23.  This will bring the total number of SETs in the system to 14,385. </p>  <p>  The SET Model represented a significant shift in the way that students with SEN are supported in mainstream classes.  Previously, students needing additional teaching support required a diagnosis in order to access support which caused delays in providing the support and also imposed a burden on both schools and parents. The change in policy was welcomed by both schools and parents. The Model is based on the principle that those students with the greatest need receive the most support.  </p>  <p>  The model encourages schools to support students with SEN in mainstream classes alongside their peers.  In fact most students with SEN are enrolled these classes. This approach is also consistent with the EPSEN Act</p>  <p>  When the SET model was introduced it was designed to be updated on a regular basis so as to distribute the total available resources across the school system based on profiled need. Because the level of student need may change in a school over time, some schools will gain under this distribution, with these gains balanced by equivalent reductions in schools where the model indicates reduced need. Re-profiling is the means of ensuring that new or increasing need in schools is met by transfer/redistribution of teaching resources from other schools whose need has reduced as shown by the model.   </p>  <p>  Schools are front-loaded with resources, based on each school&rsquo;s profile. The allocations to schools include provision to support all pupils in the schools, including where a child receives a diagnosis after the allocation is received by a school, or where there are newly enrolling pupils to the school. </p>  <p>  Both the Department and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) are committed to ensuring that all schools are treated equally and fairly in the manner in which their school profiles have been calculated.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, a number of review processes have been put in place to support schools.</p>  <p>  A process is in place to address circumstances where the school profile significantly changed following the allocation process e.g. a developing school where the net enrolment numbers significantly increased.</p>  <p>  The criteria for qualification for mainstream school developing school posts are set out in the Primary and Post Primary School Staffing Schedule for the 2022/23 school year.</p>  <p>  Schools who qualify for additional mainstream developing school posts in accordance with these criteria also qualify for additional Special Education Teaching Allocations to take account of this developing status. </p>  <p>  It is also acknowledged that there are some circumstances, which may arise in schools, which fall outside the allocations for developing school status. </p>  <p>  These relate to exceptional or emergency circumstances which could not have been anticipated e.g. where the school profile changes very significantly, or where other exceptional circumstances have arisen in a school and which may require a review of schools capacity to provide additional teaching support for all pupils who need it in the school, or of their utilisation of their allocations.</p>  <p>  A process is available where schools can seek a review of their allocations by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), including the utilisation of their allocations, in circumstances where a school considers that very exceptional circumstances have arisen subsequent to the development of the profile. </p>  <p>  If a school wishes to make an exceptional needs review appeal they may do so at the following link: ncse.ie/for-schools</p></reply>

Two new subjects &ndash; Drama, Film and Theatre Studies; and Climate Action and Sustainable Development, will be ready for students in network schools starting fifth year in 2024;</p><p>- changing the final assessment procedure to significantly reduce reliance on final examinations and introduce teacher-based assessment components;</p><p>- as Leaving Certificate subjects are revised they will have an SEC externally-moderated, teacher-based form of assessment component, which will have a weighting of 40% of the total marks available</p><p>- Avoiding the rigid restrictions that exist at present between students studying for the Established Leaving Certificate (ELC), LCA and LCVP programmes</p><p>- the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment and SEC will jointly research and define, in consultation with education partners, how an SEC externally-moderated, teacher-based form of assessment could be possible within the mix of approaches used to assess each subject;</p><p>- the initial tranche of new and revised subjects will be available in September 2024, when students entering fifth year in network schools will study updated subject curricula, with updated assessment models in the optional subjects of Chemistry, Physics, Biology and Business;</p><p>- to ensure a positive impact on students as soon as possible, Leaving Certificate Established students entering Senior Cycle in September 2023 will sit Paper 1 in English and Irish at the end of fifth year;</p><p>- it is intended that into the future Oral examinations and the Music practical performance will take place during the first week of the Easter break of 6th year as was the case this year. The advice of the SEC on the implementation of these changes on a permanent basis, following an evaluation of the arrangements in 2022 by the SEC, will be duly considered in this regard; </p><p>- to enhance students&rsquo; options further, Leaving Certificate Applied (LCA) students will have improved access to Mathematics and Modern Foreign Languages from September 2022, broadening the options for LCA;</p><p>- a new qualification will be introduced at level one and two on the National Qualification framework to provide an appropriate level of assessment to some students with special educational needs, building on the equivalent programme at Junior Cycle level; and</p><p>- a revised Transition Year programme will be established, and greater access to Transition Year for all students will be encouraged.</p><p>My approach to Senior Cycle redevelopment is ambitious, optimistic and inclusive. Senior Cycle redevelopment will ensure that the diversity of students&rsquo; learning needs and strengths are addressed. The redevelopment of Senior Cycle will ensure that all learning pathways in school are accessible and equally valued. It will broaden the ways used to assess and accredit students&rsquo; achievement, to better reflect and encourage the learning we wish to promote. And finally, we must ensure that students and their well-being are at the forefront of everything we do.</p><p>The new approach will enable students to follow a broad curriculum, develop their interests and skills and participate in a final assessment process consistent with international best practice, which will support them in their next phase of life whether that&rsquo;s third level, further education and training, apprenticeships or the world of work.  </p></reply>

This is reflected in the Programme for Government, which states that this Government will develop inclusive and age appropriate curricula for RSE and Social, Personal and Health Education across primary and post-primary schools.</p>  <p>  Social, Personal and Health Education, or SPHE for short, is a mandatory curriculum subject in all primary schools and in post-primary Junior Cycle. RSE is required at all levels in schools, from primary through to Senior Cycle. </p>  <p>  All schools are required to have an RSE policy that is developed in consultation with the school community, including school management, parents, teachers and students as appropriate. The school&rsquo;s programme for Relationship and Sexuality Education is developed and taught in the context of the school&rsquo;s RSE policy.  In addition, schools are required to teach all aspects of the RSE programme, including family planning, sexually transmitted infections and sexual orientation. It is important to note that the ethos of the school should never preclude learners from acquiring the knowledge about the issues.</p>  <p>  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment was requested to conduct a review of RSE provision in Irish schools, focussing on a range of topics including healthy positive, sexual expression and relationships and LGBTQ+ matters. The NCCA published &ldquo;The Report on the Review of Relationships and Sexuality Education in primary and post-primary schools&rdquo; in December, 2019.</p>  <p>  This report resulted in the NCCA establishing two development groups, one for primary and one for post-primary, to oversee the work of developing an updated curriculum materials in this area and supporting the development of guidance material for schools. </p>  <p>  The immediate focus of the NCCA work has been on creating support materials for teachers as part of an Interim Guidance Toolkit. This Toolkit aims to support effective teaching and learning of SPHE/RSE and to deepen teachers' understanding and skills in addressing important and sensitive topics. </p>  <p>  The NCCA Toolkit is being expanded in 2022 to include further age and stage appropriate guidance for teachers on how to address these topics within the SPHE classroom. </p>  <p>  In tandem with this work, preparation for the broader redeveloping and updating of the SPHE curriculum has begun. Updated curricula will be developed for Primary, Junior Cycle and Senior Cycle.  </p>  <p>  A draft revised Junior Cycle specification is due to be agreed at NCCA Council in early Summer, with a public consultation to follow. The final revised specification is due to be completed by the end of 2022. </p>  <p>  Preparation to update the Senior Cycle SPHE/RSE specification has commenced and it is intended that a meeting of the Senior Cycle development group will be convened in the next week. This group will prepare a background paper and brief which will form the basis of their work of redeveloping the Senior Cycle SPHE/RSE specification. </p>  <p>  Following publication of the Primary Curriculum Framework, expected in early 2023, NCCA will establish a development group for the curricular area of Well-being. Learning pertaining to RSE in primary school will be addressed within the curricular area of Well-being and the subjects of Physical and Health Education and Social, Personal and Values Education. This development group will work on the development of a specification for the curricular area and corresponding subjects. This advice will be developed through research, deliberation, consultation, and engagement with networks.  </p>  <p>  In redeveloping the SPHE curriculum, the NCCA will be making explicit the importance of fostering young people's self-awareness and self-esteem and building the foundational skills and dispositions needed for building caring and healthy relationships (including respectful communication, showing empathy, and appreciating difference). </p>  <p>  My Department continues to work closely with the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment to best give effect to the commitment in the Programme for Government to develop inclusive and age-appropriate RSE and SPHE curricula across primary and post-primary levels, including an inclusive programme on LGBTI+ relationships and making appropriate legislative changes, if necessary. </p></reply>

This is in two respects: firstly in ensuring that there is sufficient provision for pupils with special education needs and secondly in designing school accommodation that meets the needs of all users - students and staff - and enhances the learning experience. </p>  <p>  In addition to the specific accommodation provision for students with special education needs, the principles of universal design are embedded in all of my Department's technical guidance for school building projects, for the benefit of all school building users.  The General Design Guidelines includes guidance on the principles of Universal Access as part of a whole school design approach. </p>  <p>  Further to this, updated technical guidance on Post Primary School Design, Specialist Accommodation for Pupils with Special Educational Needs and Sanitary Facilities were published 2021. A suite of such Technical Guidance Documents is published on my Department's website at www.gov.ie. Such guidance draws on feedback from school authorities and reviews of a sample of completed projects. These practical and helpful guides provide very clear guidelines and approaches to be taken by school authorities in re-purposing/refurbishing existing accommodation for special education needs provisions, as well the establishing new classrooms of varying sizes.</p>  <p>  Under Project Ireland 2040, the education sector will receive a total of approximately &euro;4.4 billion capital investment over the period 2021-2025. This significant investment allows us to move forward with certainty on our ambitious plans and deliver high quality building projects, with a real focus on sustainability, for school communities across Ireland.</p>  <p>  This investment will build on the good progress being made on adding capacity to cater for demographic changes and provision for children with special educational needs.  This investment will also facilitate an increased focus on the modernisation of existing school stock and help transition the school system for an era of net zero carbon by 2050.</p></reply>

In the current school year over 121,400 children, including over 15,500 children with special educational needs, are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;289m in 2021.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the Department's School Transport Scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, Government has announced a reduction in excise on fuel will result in a decrease in the cost of fuel.  The reduction of 20 cent per litre on petrol and 15 cent per litre on diesel will be in place until 31 August at an estimated cost of &euro;320m. This is a national measure aimed at easing the financial burden on contractors and families at this time. </p>  <p>  In saying this, the Department of Education is aware that a number of contractors have highlighted concerns about the ability to sustain school transport services to the end of the current school year given the recent increases in the cost of fuel. </p>  <p>  In this context, the Department of Education is considering in consultation with other relevant departments and Bus &Eacute;ireann the implications that increasing fuel costs may have on the provision of school transport services and is engaging with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on this matter.  The Department is also very aware of the potential impact of the current situation unfolding in Ukraine which is impacting fuel prices further.  </p></reply>

The overall site is circa 10 acres. My Department made a submission to the Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Draft Development Plan 2022-28 in April 2021 seeking to have the zoning on the school site changed from Objective F Open Space to Objective SNI purposes (Sustainable Neighbourhood Infrastructure) &lsquo;to protect, improve and encourage the provision of sustainable neighbourhood infrastructure&rsquo; which would have effectively removed the 60% open space requirement.  However, this was unsuccessful.</p>  <p>  The site will provide for a campus development of a new 1,000 pupil post-primary school and accommodation, including four classrooms, for children with special educational needs, and a new 16 classroom primary school and accommodation, including two classrooms, for children with special educational needs.  </p>  <p>  The project has been assigned to my Department&rsquo;s Design &amp;amp; Build delivery programme.

Information from a range of sources, including Child Benefit data, school enrolment data and information on residential development activity is used for this purpose. Additionally, Project Ireland 2040 population and housing targets inform my Department's projections of school place requirements.</p>  <p>  Having considered the projected requirements, my Department then makes an assessment of the existing school accommodation capacity within that particular area and its ability to meet any increased demand.  A national inventory of school capacity, which utilises information from schools&rsquo; annual returns, is maintained by my Department and is supplemented by data on enrolment trends at individual schools as well as other indicators of potential capacity.  My Department&rsquo;s GIS is a critical tool in assessing such data in support of strategic planning for school accommodation needs.  The GIS facilitates the geospatial analysis of capacity relative to school place demand and the customised reporting of data at local, regional and national levels.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, at primary level national enrolments peaked in 2018 and are projected to decline by over 120,000 by 2033, as outlined in my Department&rsquo;s statistical report of November 2021: &ldquo;Projections of full-time enrolment Primary and Second Level 2021-2040&rdquo;.  In that same report it can be seen that post primary enrolments are forecast to peak in 2024 and then decline thereafter to 2039, by circa 90,000 places.  Although these projections do not account for arriving Ukrainian students, it is clear that at a national level there will be increasing levels of capacity within our existing schools infrastructure.  While local and regional variations will, of course, be relevant, the use of such capacity - to meet the needs of Ukrainian children in the first instance - will be an important element in my Department&rsquo;s strategic planning for capital investment in our schools. In this regard, a capacity survey at post-primary level has indicated available capacity of the order of 18,000 to 20,000 school places.  There is also very good capacity at primary level given the downward trend in demographics and this will be analysed at an individual school and town/area level when a capacity survey of special schools and primary schools is undertaken at end May/early June 2022.   </p>  <p>  Where the geospatial assessment of demand and capacity in an area indicates that additional provision is required my Department considers the options of extending the capacity of a school or schools, or of providing a new school or schools.  The timing and duration of the accommodation need is also considered in determining the optimum accommodation solution &ndash; for example a short-term accommodation requirement does not require a long-term accommodation solution.</p>  <p>  Separately, where a school considers that it has a requirement for additional mainstream or special education needs accommodation it is open to the school authority to apply under my Department&rsquo;s Additional School Accommodation (ASA) scheme.  The assessment of such applications is also informed by a geospatial analysis of demand and capacity in the relevant area, and a consideration of the timing and duration of the need.  The level of capacity in an individual school or in neighbouring schools is relevant when decisions on enrolment are being made.  It is important that capacity across a town or area is fully utilised before additional accommodation is approved.   </p>  <p>  My Department continues to work to advance school building projects to ensure sufficient places for both mainstream provision and for pupils with special education requirements both for the coming academic year and into the future.  My Department has a large pipeline of projects for delivery under the school building programme to cater for current and future educational demands.  The pipeline of projects is kept under continual review to ensure alignment with Project Ireland 2040 objectives. Good progress continues to be made with the rollout of projects, and the current status of projects being delivered is listed in tabular format, on a county by county basis, on the Department&rsquo;s website at www.gov.ie and updated on a monthly basis to reflect their progress through the various stages of capital appraisal, site acquisition, design, tender and construction.</p></reply>

It sets out how the development of digital skills are supported in schools and builds on the key achievements under the previous strategy.  It aligns closely with the EU Digital Education Action Plan 2021-2027 and also takes into consideration the National Digital Strategy &lsquo;Harnessing Digital: The Digital Ireland Framework as well as other relevant policies and strategies. It is available here www.gov.ie/en/publication/69fb88-digital-strategy-for-schools/</p><p>The stated vision of the Digital Strategy is to empower schools to harness the opportunities of digital transformation to build digital competence and an effective digital education ecosystem so as to develop competent, critically engaged, active learners while supporting them to reach their potential and participate fully as global citizens in a digital world.</p><p>It is underpinned by an investment of &euro;200million, &euro;50million of which has already issued directly to schools.  A further &euro;13m is invested on an annual basis in the Schools Broadband Programme and a further &euro;50m was issued in grant funding in November 2021 as part of Ireland&rsquo;s National Recovery and Resilience Plan to address the digital divide. Through continued investment we will also ensure that all schools, regardless of location are provided with appropriate broadband connectivity. </p><p>The importance of the effective use of digital technologies in our school system is key to delivering the skills need for our current and future learners.  What is required, and what is incorporated in the stated vision of this strategy, is an education system that supports the development of competent, critically engaged and active learners.  This also requires the Department and its support services to continue to ensure that teachers and school leaders have access to the necessary supports and resources to facilitate this. </p><p>The strategy itself is set out under three pillars, which recognise how the various elements of our school system are involved and interlinked in supporting and progressing the use of digital technologies in our school system and how the Department can support this.  These are </p><p>- <b>Pillar 1:</b>Supporting the embedding of digital technologies in teaching, learning and assessment</p><p>- <b>Pillar 2:</b>Digital Technology Infrastructure</p><p>- <b>Pillar 3: </b>Looking to the future: policy, research and digital leadership</p><p>Each Pillar contains overarching objectives, which will be supported by a more detailed Implementation Plan.  The first Implementation Plan will run from 2022-2024.  Towards the end of this phase a midterm review will be carried out to inform the next Implementation Plan from 2025-2027.</p><p>It is intended to put in place appropriate oversight and measurement processes to ensure effective implementation of the strategy. This will include establishing relevant groups to provide oversight and inform ongoing implementation over the lifetime of the strategy including developments to avail of emerging technologies.  Delivering on the objectives of this strategy will involve ongoing collaboration across Government and with key stakeholders. Therefore it is planned to establish relevant consultative groups to facilitate engagement with education stakeholders and relevant industry representatives. </p><p>By combining the continued commitment shown by teachers and schools leaders with the effective use of digital technologies in their teaching practice, we can equip young people with the key digital skills they need for life. </p><p>The inclusion of digital learning skills as part of curriculum development will also support all learners to gain these skills as part of their education journey. </p><p>Substantial progress has been made across the curriculum with some examples including:</p><p>- All new and revised curricular specifications now include clear statements that focus on the development of digital learning skills. </p><p>- Introduction of the Primary Language Curriculum embeds digital literacy across its learning outcomes.</p><p>- Draft Primary Curriculum Framework (2020) outlines being a digital learner as one of seven key competencies intended to be embedded across all curriculum areas and subjects. It also proposes that digital technology would become part of the curriculum area of Mathematics, Science and Technology. </p><p>The Framework for Junior Cycle provides multiple opportunities for the development of digital skills. A set of twenty-four Statements of Learning are central to the student experience in junior cycle and schools must ensure that all statements of learning are offered to their junior cycle students. Statement 24 focuses explicitly on the development of digital skills setting out the expectation that the student uses technology and digital media tools to learn, communicate, work and think collaboratively and creatively in a responsible and ethical manner. The development of digital skills is further supported through the eight key skills of junior cycle. These key skills are embedded in the learning outcomes within each junior cycle subject and short course. Each key skill includes a number of elements with a digital element in each key skill.</p><p>Junior cycle students undertake a 400-hour programme of well-being as part of their junior cycle programme and this provides additional opportunity for the development of digital media literacy skills and digital citizenship skills through the short courses in CSPE and SPHE.  </p><p>In addition to this cross-curricular focus on digital skills, schools may choose to offer short courses which explicitly focus on the development of digital skills. NCCA have developed two such short courses in Coding and Digital Media Literacy and schools may also opt to develop their own short course.</p><p>At senior cycle the use of digital technology is an important aspect of many subjects.  The Leaving Certificate subject Computer Science is available nationally since September 2020. </p><p>Following my announcement on 29 March regarding a reimagined Senior Cycle where the student is at the centre of their Senior Cycle experience, I note the NCCA&rsquo;s intention to research the potential of technology to support greater diversity in approaches to assessment across Senior Cycle. This will allow for technology-enabled modes of assessment to be considered as part of the movement towards additional assessment components in each subject and the exploration of a school-based, externally moderated form of assessment of such components. Indeed, recent second assessment components developed by the SEC have been &lsquo;Designed for Digital&rsquo;. This exploration should of course have regard to the requirement for integration with the Digital Strategy for Schools.</p><p>Furthermore, work on the opportunities technology offers to support the availability of subject choice to students will be undertaken.</p></reply>

Significant progress has been made in these areas on foot of action taken under Section 37.  </p><p>The Section 37 process is one of the tools available to the Department to ensure that adequate suitable education provision is made for children with special needs and it is not a substitute for advance planning.</p><p>All parties would prefer to see schools volunteer to provide more places rather than places being secured on the back of an order or a direction from the Minister. The evidence available this school-year is that schools are willing to work collaboratively with the Department and NCSE on the provision of new school places for children with special educational needs and I am grateful to all concerned for their ongoing work in this regard.</p><p>I can also reassure the Deputy that the local SENOs continue to be available to assist and advise parents of children with special educational needs.</p><p>Parents seeking special class placements for their children are advised to contact NCSE locally so that their needs can be taken into account for planning purposes.</p></reply>

Actions consist of a range of measures, including the provision of lockers and in the case of second level school the arrangement of the timetable into double class periods, active liaison with parents and the co-ordination of homework by subject teachers.</p>  <p>  The use of digital resources by teachers and students in schools is increasing. While conventional textbooks are still widely used, a number of schools have introduced or are considering introducing e-books and other digital resources to enhance students' work in school and at home. Schools can use the book grant scheme to purchase a range of digital resources relevant to the curriculum. It should be also be noted that Scoilnet.ie, the Department funded website, supports Primary and Post-Primary teachers in sharing and finding useful resources for the classroom, including the World Books online encyclopaedia resource, and other valuable online content and resources to assist in teaching and learning.</p>  <p>  The decision to use tablet devices, and as a consequence eBooks, is a matter for the Board of Management of each school. Where the introduction of new technology is planned, there should be consultation with members of the school community including parents. The cost and other implications must be fully considered by the Boards of Managements before a decision is made. It is a matter for each individual school to determine which particular measures are most suited to its individual circumstances and to how the school concerned organises teaching and learning.</p></reply>

Among other things, the policy advice recommended that: </p><p>- &ldquo;NCSE establishes ten fully staffed regional support teams to build school and teacher capacity through continuing professional development (CPD) programmes and where appropriate, in-school support&rdquo;; </p><p>- &ldquo;A broader range of support options is made available as part of whole-school, targeted-school and intensive-school support, which encompasses and enhances the existing extensive support options already in place in schools&rdquo; and that </p><p>- &ldquo;&hellip; behaviour practitioners are available (as part of the NCSE regional support service) to provide advice and guidance to schools&rdquo;.</p><p>Following this advice, in March 2019 the Minister announced a trial of a new School Inclusion Model (SIM) to provide the right supports at the right time to students with additional needs. </p><p>NCSE employs a number of specialist roles to support schools and build teacher capacity in the areas of autism and behaviour. These roles include autism advisors and behaviour advisors, who are assigned across regional support teams to provide advice and support to schools.</p><p>For schools located in South Dublin, Kildare and West Wicklow, as part of the SIM pilot project NCSE provides additional support to schools through four behaviour practitioners and additional speech and language therapists and occupational therapists. There are 660 schools in this area, which includes schools in the Dublin 12 area.</p><p>The supports provided by these therapists and practitioners aim to build school and teacher capacity to include all students, including students with special educational needs, by facilitating them to access the curriculum and to have positive and inclusive school experiences.</p><p>The role of the NCSE Behaviour Practitioners in particular is to enable, support and promote the full inclusion, participation and well-being of all students in school and community activities by establishing and enhancing socially significant behaviours.</p><p>This work is focussed on assisting schools to:</p><p>- promote universal positive behaviour approaches,  </p><p>- prevent and plan for behaviours that impact learning and prevent and  </p><p>- plan and respond to behaviours of concern using The NCSE Behaviour Support Framework.</p><p>Schools within the SIM pilot initially access Behaviour Practitioner support by attending one of NCSE&rsquo;s teacher professional learning seminars. Teachers attending these seminars have access to a follow-on workshop and may request further in school support in line with the seminar and workshop content.</p><p>Over the course of 2021, the Behaviour Practitioners delivered 18 courses to 316 teachers. The courses aimed to build teacher capacity to support their students in areas such as Practical Strategies for Behaviour in the Classroom; Autism and Promoting Positive Behaviour and Pathways to Prevention.</p><p>The second way schools and teachers can access in-school support is making a request through the NCSE in-school support portal at ncse.ie/in-school-support. </p><p>In 2021 the NCSE received 1,951 requests for in school support of which 806 related to autism and 730 related to behaviour. In 2022 to date, the NCSE received 927 requests for in school support of which 364 related to autism and 359 related to behaviour. </p><p>In School Support requests are responded to as follows: </p><p>-Initially an in school support request is received by the local Team Manager (TM) who reviews the request and follows up with the school if additional information is required</p><p>-TM assigns the request to an appropriate Advisor based on the nature of the request eg, Autism, Behaviour, SET etc</p><p>-Advisor contacts the school and scopes out the nature of the response to the schools request with the Principal, SENCO etc.</p><p>-The nature of the response could include whole school staff CPD, in classroom support with individual teacher / small group of teachers </p><p>-The support can be delivered in person or online as required</p><p>-Where required the Advisor may arrange a number of engagements with the school to meet their request</p><p>-Advisors may also recommend some of NCSE seminars where appropriate to need the schools request.</p><p>Finally, the NCSE also has also developed resources for teachers to support positive behaviour in school and resources for parents of primary aged children at home and post primary aged young people. Other useful resources such as videos for parents can be accessed through the NCSE&rsquo;s YouTube channel.</p><p>The NCSE does not employ autism behaviour therapists, but through its regional teams the NCSE has advisors (seconded teachers) with specialisms in behaviour and autism. Schools may also access the advisor support service through the same system ncse.ie/in-school-support</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-05-12a.320.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022051200069#WRG03300"><p>My Department is working along with other Government Departments and agencies to support full implementation of the Government&rsquo;s national drug strategy - Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery 2017-2025 and is leading on a number of actions to build the skills, knowledge and resilience and well-being in all of our young people so they are equipped to deal with the challenges they face, including those relating to drug use.  </p>  <p>  Last year, my Department participated in the mid-term review of the drug and alcohol strategy, published in November 2021. On its publication, Minister of State for Public Health, Well-being and the National Drugs Strategy, Frank Feighan, T.D, identified as a priority &lsquo;the need to address the social determinants and consequences of drug use and criminality in disadvantaged communities&rsquo; requiring the involvement and co-operation of a range of government department and agencies in tackling the root causes of drug and alcohol use.  To address  priorities over the remaining period of the Strategy, six strategic priorities have been identified in the review to strengthen the health-led approach to drug use and to align with the EU Drugs Strategy and Action Plan.  </p>  <p>  The first priority is to strengthen the prevention of drug use and its associated harms among children and young people.  My Department will participate in the work of the dedicated Strategic Implementation Group established by the Department of Health to lead on this priority. </p>  <p>  Schools also play an important role  in supporting their students to develop the skills and knowledge they need to make informed choices when faced with difficult issues including drugs and alcohol which unfortunately most of them will face.  This is mainly done through the Social, Personal and Health Education Programme which has a specific module on the use and misuse of a range of substances.  SPHE is currently mandatory in all primary schools and in junior cycle.  It forms part of the mandatory Well-being area of learning for the new junior cycle introduced in 2017.  SPHE along with the implementation of the Well-being Policy Statement and Framework 2018-2023 aim to support the development of socially and emotionally competent, resilient young people who respect themselves, their peers and are able to form healthy relationships and make healthy life choices and decisions. Schools are also encouraged to deliver the SPHE programme in senior cycle.  Topics within SPHE include student decision-making skills, safety and protection.  Students learn how to exercise judgement, weigh up different possibilities, examine the steps and choices they take to inform decision making and develop the ability to assess the consequences of poor decisions and risky behaviour. Schools also have access to a number of resources to support the delivery of the substance use module of SPHE. Examples include the "Walk Tall" Programme for primary pupils developed by the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) and a post-primary resource called "On My Own Two Feet", published by my Department. The new 'Know the Score' programme is a substance misuse programme published in 2019 for Transition Year or 5th year pupils. It was jointly developed by the HSE, my Department and the Drugs and Alcohol Task Forces.</p>  <p>  In order to strengthen links between schools and local Drug and Alcohol Task Forces, last year an information resource was developed and circulated to all 4,000 primary and post primary schools.  Developed by the Drug and Alcohol Task Forces in conjunction with my Department, the resource provides information on the range of supports that drug and alcohol task forces can provide to schools, parents and students to prevent and tackle drug and alcohol use and to strengthen communications between local schools and drug and alcohol task forces.  It also provides information on a range of valuable resources for schools and parents relating to drug and alcohol use.</p>  <p>  My Department currently provides funding to 3 projects in Local Drugs Task Force Areas in Dublin.  These are the Blanchardstown Early School Leavers Project, Crinan Youth Project (Salesian Youth Enterprises) and Familibase.</p>  <p>  There are also range of supports available to schools in Dublin&rsquo;s North East Inner City area. My Department supports schools in the North East Inner City of Dublin to improve educational outcomes of the pupil cohort. My Department is represented on the Programme Implementation Board for the NEIC and has allocated a dedicated NEIC Education Initiatives Manager to work with schools and key stakeholders in the area.  My Department has been involved in the establishment of the Principals&rsquo; Network for schools in the NEIC area and is involved in the P-Tech and City Connects pilot initiatives.</p>  <p>  Where a school has concerns in relation to the use of their premises for anti-social behaviour and drug dealing they should be brought to the attention of the local Garda Crime Prevention Officer who will prepare a report on a visit to the school. The information in this report outlining recommended security measures should be considered by the school authority in the first instance to determine what follow up actions are required. The school authority may email the report to my Department at this email address emergency_works@education.gov.ie where it will be examined and advice will issue as to what, if any, recommendations contained in the report fall under the scope of the Emergency Works Scheme.</p></reply>

These supports are available generally in schools who have large numbers of children for whom English/Irish is not their first language but it has been of particular importance in recent weeks to support the large numbers of children enrolled in our schools coming from Ukraine. </p><p><b>English Additional Language Support (EAL)</b></p><p>Generally the Special Education Teaching allocation provides a single unified allocation for special educational support teaching needs to each school, based on each school&rsquo;s educational profile and provides schools with a baseline teaching allocation to assist pupils who have learning and literacy difficulties, including those arising from English Additional Language (EAL)</p><p><b>Additional Allocations for Schools with High Concentrations of Pupils that require Language Support (EAL)</b></p><p>Schools where a significant number of the total enrolment is made up of language support (EAL) pupils with less than B1 (Level 3) proficiency can make an appeal to the Independent Primary Teachers Appeals Board for additional resources.

These Education and Language Teams are hosted by the 16 regional education and training boards (ETBs) and are staffed by regionally-based education support personnel. These staff work closely with local schools and community services to ensure good co-ordination and alignment of supports for Ukrainian children. The Department is working with the teams to ensure all necessary supports for Ukrainian children are provided as quickly as possible.</p><p>The primary role of the REALT is to build on existing regional education support structures and the initial focus will be on assisting families in securing school places. REALT will also support schools in the area to meet the needs of these children as they emerge, to advise and support the Department of Education in developing new capacity where required, and to co-ordinate the provision of education services to schools and families across their defined area.</p><p>These teams will ensure that clear, accessible information flows are in place between schools, local education support services and national support structures in relation to people arriving from Ukraine.</p><p>The regional teams will be hosted and administratively supported within the ETBs and will lead a network of other key agencies, including Tusla Education Support Service (TESS), NEPS regional personnel, NCSE regional personnel and Management body local nominees working together with local schools. All of the key agencies working together in a holistic manner will bring added value and efficiencies to the process of supporting the Ukrainian children.  </p><p>My Department is committed to providing every support possible to all those fleeing war in Ukraine and seeking protection in Ireland. </p><p>An allocation of English Language Support hours is provided to schools who have recently enrolled Ukrainian pupils as per the table below.  <table>    <tr>       <th>Number of Ukrainian pupils<br /><br />1 &ndash; 4</th>       <th>Number of Hours <br /><br />5</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>5 &ndash; 8</td>       <td>10</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>9 &ndash; 13</td>       <td>15</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>14 &ndash; 20</td>       <td>20</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>21 - 30</td>       <td>25</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>31 &ndash; 40</td>       <td>35</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&amp;gt;40</td>       <td>50 </td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

The review is being conducted with a view to examining the current scheme and how it currently operates, its broader effectiveness and sustainability and that it adequately supports the provision of services to students and their families. </p>  <p>  The review encompasses the School Transport Scheme for Children with Special Educational Needs and the Primary and Post-Primary School Transport Schemes in terms of how each element of the schemes currently operate, to include eligibility criteria, trends, costs and cost drivers, and overall effectiveness in meeting the objectives of the schemes.  </p>  <p>  The review will consider issues such as climate action, supporting rural development and promoting where possible initiatives that encourage walking and cycling to school. </p>  <p>  The review will also examine the potential for integration of different strands of the scheme and a more co-ordinated approach with other Government Departments that also use transport services.  </p>  <p>  Wider considerations relating to operation of the scheme are now taking place in the second phase of the review.  As part of this phase of the review, the Department has conducted an extensive stakeholder engagement process. The Department is analysing the views of all relevant stakeholders so that they may be considered as part of the assessment and in informing policy on the future operation of the scheme.

This was acknowledged in the Comprehensive Review of the Special Needs Assistant Scheme (SNAs) published by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) in 2018. </p>  <p>  The Review made a number of recommendations regarding SNAs and the need for a more broadly based set of supports including therapeutic supports for pupils with complex needs.  The Review also referenced the training needs of SNAs. The policy advice was considered by the Department and it was decided that priority should be given to the development of a training programme for SNAs who may not have had a recent opportunity to access a training programme tailored to their role.  </p>  <p>  A public procurement competition was held for the development and delivery of a new national training programme for SNAs. A detailed specification of need and learning outcomes was developed and published for the competition. Formal accreditation to the National Qualifications Framework was not a requirement for the programme. Following evaluation of the tenders received, the contract was awarded to University College Dublin (UCD) School of Education, in conjunction with UCD School of Nursing, Midwifery and Health Systems.  </p>  <p>  UCD has a strong reputation in the world of education and training.  It brings with it a wealth of experience and research knowledge in the training and has very strong quality assurance arrangements for its programmes.  Feedback from programme participants is a key feature of this quality assurance process.  </p>  <p>  This programme aims to enhance the knowledge, skills and expertise of SNAs whose work is central to the inclusion of students with additional care and complex needs in school life.  </p>  <p>  The programme consists of five modules, delivered online over a 10-month period. Flexibility is a key part of the approach to the delivery of the programme and participation is voluntary. </p>  <p>  The programme is fully funded by the Department and delivered at no cost to the participating SNA.</p>  <p>  Each participant who completes the programme successfully will receive a certificate from UCD School of Education which may be of assistance in pursuing further education.  </p>  <p>  &euro;2.45m will be allocated to this programme over a 4 year period based on a full uptake of 3,500 SNAs.  Each phase of the programme has been fully subscribed to date. 500 have completed the programme and the first award ceremony took place on the 25 February 2022. A new cohort of 1,000 commenced the programme September last.  </p>  <p>  This programme allowed SNAs the opportunity to refresh and update their knowledge and skills and provide an opportunity to interact with educators and colleagues in a learning and supported professional environment. </p>  <p>  This is the first national training programme for SNAs employed in schools and is tailored to their needs.  As this is the first programme, it is appropriate to take the time to review outcomes which will inform the future approach to ongoing training and professional development of SNAs. Part of that consideration will include accreditation.</p></reply>

In common with similar schemes which operate in other jurisdictions, the focus of the RACE scheme is on the need to remove examination access barriers, while retaining the need to assess the same underlying skills and competencies, and to apply the same standards of achievement, as apply to all other students. </p>  <p>  Under the existing provisions of the RACE Scheme, every possible effort is also made by the SEC to accommodate candidates who experience accidents, serious illness or other trauma either immediately before or during the examinations. </p>  <p>  There are arrangements that can be made between the SEC and the school in the best interests of an ill or injured candidate to enable the candidate to proceed with their examination on the scheduled date. For candidates who suffer from epilepsy, these arrangements might include supervised rest breaks during the examinations; access to a smaller special examination centre; and alterations to the start and end time of the examinations. </p>  <p>  It is acknowledged that students experience many forms of trauma and adversity, such as serious illness and bereavement, around the time of the Leaving Certificate examinations. The issues arising here are complex and must be balanced against the absolute need to maintain integrity and public confidence in the examinations system. </p>  <p>  Deferred examinations were held for the first time in 2019 for students who had experienced bereavement of a close family member. The SEC had commenced a comprehensive review of the broader issue of how best to support students experiencing other forms of trauma and adversity at examinations time which included consultation with stakeholders as well as research into practices in other jurisdictions.</p>  <p>  For the 2022 Leaving Certificate, I have announced that there will be a deferred sitting of the Leaving Certificate for students unable to sit one or more papers in the main sitting in June due to serious medical conditions or close family bereavement. It is intended that the deferred sitting will commence shortly after the conclusion of the main sitting.  </p>  <p>  Epilepsy Ireland was among the organisations which submitted a response to the SEC&rsquo;s consultation in early 2020 noting that this process was halted due to the pandemic. More recently, officials from the SEC met with Epilepsy Ireland on Friday the 29th April 2022 in relation to access to the deferred examinations series. </p>  <p>  Further details of the deferred sitting of the Leaving Certificate will be issued by the SEC in due course.</p></reply>

In the current school year over 121,400 children, including over 15,500 children with special educational needs, are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;289m in 2021.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the Department's School Transport Scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school.</p>  <p>  With regard to increasing fuel costs, as the Deputy will be aware, Government has announced a reduction in excise on fuel will result in a decrease in the cost of fuel.  The reduction of 20 cent per litre on petrol and 15 cent per litre on diesel will be in place until 31 August at an estimated cost of &euro;320m. This is a national measure aimed at easing the financial burden on contractors and families at this time. </p>  <p>  In saying this, the Department of Education is aware that a number of contractors have highlighted concerns about the ability to sustain school transport services to the end of the current school year given the recent increases in the cost of fuel. </p>  <p>  In this context, the Department of Education is considering in consultation with other relevant departments and Bus &Eacute;ireann the implications that increasing fuel costs may have on the provision of school transport services and is engaging with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on this matter.  The Department is also very aware of the potential impact of the current situation in Ukraine which is impacting fuel prices further. </p></reply>

I set out a clear vision for Senior Cycle, building upon the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment&rsquo;s (NCCA&rsquo;s) Advisory Report. The NCCA&rsquo;s review of senior cycle involved an extensive range of research, consultations and communications with a wide range of stakeholders, including teachers.</p>  <p>  The three tenets of Senior Cycle reform are to: </p>  <p>  - Empower students to meet the challenges of the 21st century  </p>  <p>  - Enrich the student experience and build on what&rsquo;s strong in our current system </p>  <p>  - Embed well-being and reduce student stress levels</p>  <p>  Introducing significant change at Senior Cycle needs to be thought through carefully and it is essential to ensure that the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA), State Examinations Commission (SEC), the Department and schools can work through the changes with all stakeholders over a sustained period of time.</p>  <p>  I have requested the NCCA to invite a selection of schools, representative of the different types and sizes of schools across Ireland, to become &ldquo;network schools&rdquo;. In order to successfully deliver on the vision I have set out, we need to partner with schools to trial, evaluate, learn, adjust and succeed.</p>  <p>  Network schools will be given the opportunity to participate at an early stage in revised curriculum and assessment arrangements. These schools will receive support through a variety of forms to enable their participation. The network school approach will allow the curriculum and assessment arrangements to be co-constructed with students and their teachers allowing specific aspects of these proposals to be progressed and evaluated.</p>  <p>  It will be important to carefully manage this work so that students in these schools, or in other schools, would not be disadvantaged in any way and this will be an important consideration during the delivery phase of the reforms I have announced.</p>  <p>  I have also announced a number of more immediate actions. Bearing in mind the significant assessment load at the end of sixth year, and to ensure a positive impact on students as soon as possible, as an interim measure I have asked the SEC to immediately alter the timing of Paper One in both Irish and English so that Paper One would take place at the end of fifth year commencing for fifth years entering fifth year in September 2023.</p>  <p>  It is also my intention that in the future Oral examinations and the Music practical performance will take place during the first week of the Easter break of 6th year as was the case this year. The advice of the SEC on the implementation of these changes on a permanent basis, following an evaluation of the arrangements in 2022 by the SEC, will be duly considered in this regard.</p>  <p>  To enhance students&rsquo; options further, Leaving Certificate Applied (LCA) students will have improved access to Mathematics and Modern Foreign Languages from September 2022, broadening the options for LCA students.</p>  <p>  A Senior Cycle Programme Delivery Board will be established which will have responsibility for overseeing the achievement of actions forming part of this suite of reforms. A detailed implementation plan will be developed through ongoing collaboration and co-creation and consultation with education partners, including teachers, students, school leaders and parents.</p></reply>

This significant investment allows us to move forward with certainty on our ambitious plans and deliver high quality building projects, with a real focus on sustainability, for school communities across Ireland.</p>  <p>  This investment will build on the good progress being made on adding capacity to cater for demographic changes and provision for children with special educational needs. This investment will also facilitate an increased focus on the modernisation of existing school stock and help transition the school system for an era of net zero carbon by 2050.</p>  <p>  My Department has a large pipeline of projects for delivery under the school building programme. The main elements of this pipeline currently involve in excess of 1,300 school building projects for delivery under the Department&rsquo;s Large Scale and Additional Accommodation Scheme. These projects are currently in progress across the various stages of planning, design, tender and construction. Most of which are expected to be either under construction or completed in the period up to 2025 and are being progressed as quickly as possible</p>  <p>  There are currently in excess of 250 school building projects at construction (on site) with a continuous stream of other projects at or near the tendering stage. </p>  <p>  It is anticipated that 150 to 200 school building projects will be completed annually during the 2022 to 2025 period.</p>  <p>  During the period 2018 to 2021 691 school building projects were completed under the Large Scale Capital Programme (LSCP) and the Additional School Accommodation Scheme (ASA).  These projects delivered in excess of 64,000 school places. </p>  <p>  My Department is at the forefront of design with respect to sustainable energy in school buildings and this performance has been recognised at both National and International level with sustainable energy awards for excellence in Design and Specification.</p>  <p>  New renewable technologies and approaches are tested to ensure compatibility with school design and operational requirements under the research programme.  Successful and repeatable results are then incorporated into all new school designs and refurbishments through my Department&rsquo;s Technical Guidance Documents, which set the benchmark for sustainable design in school buildings with a clear focus on energy efficiency. The Department&rsquo;s policy is supported by a strong research programme with fifty three research projects at various stages including the energy website www.energyineducation.ie. which is a joint partnership with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI).                           </p>  <p>  Schools designed and built in accordance with the Department&rsquo;s schools technical guidance documents have been achieving A3 Building Energy Ratings since 2009 with schools typically achieving up to 20% higher performance and 25% better carbon performance than required by the 2019 Building Regulations,  along with 10% of primary energy provided via photovoltaics and infrastructure provision for electric vehicle charging.</p>  <p>  The Department have been using test schools to evaluate the suitability of renewable energy options for schools over the past twenty plus years. Nearly 60 % of the research programme features renewable aspects. These renewables include wind generation, solar hot water heating, photovoltaics, rain water recovery, geothermal heat pumps, air source heat pumps and biomass heating systems. Results have varied with respect to their applicability in a school environment.  Research continues in many areas. </p>  <p>  My Department and the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications established a jointly funded pathfinder programme with the SEAI, testing and demonstrating energy efficiency and decarbonisation retrofit approaches. This pathfinder is a great example of collaboration ensuring the deployment of new design approaches and technologies are introduced to the educational environment on an evidence based approach.</p>  <p>  This Pathfinder programme is paving the way for, and informing, a much larger national schools&rsquo; programme for the energy retrofit of schools built prior to 2008 as included in the National Development Plan. It is facilitating research on a range of typical retrofit options, which will have been tried and tested. It is providing valuable development information for a solution driven delivery strategy which will be founded on a solid evidence base that has proven the robustness and scalability of renewable solutions within the schools&rsquo; sector.  </p>  <p>  The longer-term outcome of the pathfinder will be to create an accurate and scalable model for energy efficient retrofits of schools across Ireland. </p>  <p>  The pathfinder programme builds on significant investment by the Department of Education in energy efficiency through the 2009/10 Cavity and Attic Insulation/Water Conservation Scheme and ongoing Summer Works and refurbishment projects.</p>  <p>  The upgrades target a Building Energy Rating of B, 50% energy efficiency improvement and 51% emissions reduction. The works typically involves upgrades to the building fabric including wall and roof insulation, doors and windows, air tightness improvements, LED lighting and heating upgrades as well as renewable technologies.   </p></reply>

Information from a range of sources, including Child Benefit data, school enrolment data and information on residential development activity is used for this purpose.  Additionally, Project Ireland 2040 population and housing targets inform my Department's projections of school place requirements.</p><p>Having considered the projected requirements in each school planning area, my Department then makes an assessment of the existing capacity within that particular area and its ability to meet any increased demand.  </p><p>Where data indicates that additional provision is required at primary or post primary level, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:</p><p>&middot;Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,</p><p>&middot;Extending the capacity of a school or schools,</p><p>&middot;Provision of a new school or schools.</p><p>My Department's projections of post primary school place requirements in East Cork show some continued growth in enrolments in the short- to medium-term across most areas, with most growth anticipated in the Midleton_Carrigtwohill school planning area. </p><p>However, in response to projected future need and to enrolment pressures in the area, there has been significant capital investment by my Department at post primary schools in East Cork.  A new post primary school, Carrigtwohill Community College, was established in 2016.  A project to deliver a new, modern 1,000 pupil school building for that school is underway.  Additionally, an extension at St. Colman's Community College, Midleton has been recently completed and a number of other large school building projects are also in train, delivering expanded capacity at St. Aloysius' College in Carrigtwohill, Midleton CBS, St. Mary's High School in Midleton, Pobalscoil na Tr&iacute;on&oacute;ide in Youghal, Col&aacute;iste an Phiarsaigh in Glanmire. Col&aacute;iste Mhuire Cobh and Carrignafoy Community College in Cobh.</p><p>While my Department is aware of increasing pressures and demand for additional school places in East Cork, it is important to note that where enrolment pressures arise, it may not be as a result of lack of accommodation but may be driven by the following factors: </p><p>- Duplication of applications &ndash; pupils have applied for a place to a number of schools in the area </p><p>- School of choice &ndash; pupils can&rsquo;t get a place in their preferred school while there are places in other schools in the town/area </p><p>- Some towns/areas have single sex schools and while places are available in the school they are not available to all pupils </p><p>- External draw &ndash; pupils coming from outside the local area</p><p>My Department is working to establish the true extent of any capacity issues through ongoing discussions with the relevant school authorities. In that context, similar to the process adopted in advance of the current academic year, my Department is engaging with patron bodies, including patrons of schools in East Cork areas, to identify particular capacity requirements for the forthcoming years which may necessitate further action to that already in train including, where required, the provision of modular accommodation solutions. </p><p>As a result of ongoing discussions with patrons in the School Planning Area, St Colman&rsquo;s College, Midleton has recently offered places for an additional 1<sup>st</sup>year class group for the 2022/23 school year.</p><p>Additionally, my Department will continue to work to advance the planned and current projects in East Cork and to ensure sufficient places for both mainstream provision and for pupils with special education requirements both for the coming academic year and into the future.</p><p>Given medium- to long-term projected demographic trends, it is not currently anticipated that there will be a requirement for a further new post primary school in the area, nevertheless, my Department will continue to monitor the situation.</p></reply>

A ballot was undertaken and the result was 95% agreement in favour of the deal.  I am very pleased to hear of this overwhelmingly positive result on what has been a long running issue, the resolution of which has been a priority for me since my appointment. </p>  <p>  It is important to recognise that the majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools receive assistance to provide for these staff under grant schemes, and that where a school employs a staff member to support those functions those staff are employees of individual schools and responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school.  On that basis, there has been extensive engagement between my Department and school management bodies to work towards a resolution. I would also like to acknowledge the willingness of F&oacute;rsa and in particular the school secretary representatives for their constructive engagement in this process, and to recognise the support of Minister McGrath and his officials in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform at all stages of the negotiations.</p>  <p>  The main elements of the package offered include, in recognition of the invaluable work carried out by school secretaries,  moving their pay rates to a scale which is aligned with the Clerical Officer Grade III pay scale on a pro rata basis according to a secretary&rsquo;s current working pattern. This process will provide for pay increases (backdated to 1 September 2021) to school secretaries who choose to move to the new terms. It also provides for lower-paid but longer serving secretaries to be placed higher up the salary scale.  Secretaries may also choose to receive additional pay to ensure they no longer need to apply to the Department of Social Protection for payment of benefits for periods when they are not working due to school holidays. The final element of the package will introduce standardised arrangements in respect of annual leave, maternity benefit and sick pay.</p>  <p>  The work to implement this agreement will include a complex process of assimilating each individual secretary to the new terms and conditions which will vary depending on individual circumstances. The Department will expedite this process and will communicate further as the work progresses.</p>  <p>  This offer relates only to school secretaries at present, while there is agreement in principle to take the same approach to the consideration of appropriate pay and conditions of grant funded caretakers there remains a deficit of data on working terms and conditions of such staff. Once the implementation plan for secretaries has been put in place, intensive engagement will begin on regularising the pay and conditions of grant funded caretakers.</p></reply>

In 2021 nearly 38,000 children availed of the summer programme, an increase of 60% from the previous year.</p>  <p>  A key objective of this year&rsquo;s scheme is to increase the number of schools offering the summer programme to their students. Steps have been taken to afford schools as much flexibility as possible, and to ease administrative requirements. This year there is provision to recruit newly qualified teachers graduating this summer as well as undergraduate student teachers who have registered with the Teaching Council under Route 5.</p>  <p>  To support and facilitate schools and principals with organising and running the programme, the 2022 Summer Programme allows principals to delegate these functions to other members of staff through the Overseer role and preparation hours. The Overseer and preparation roles provide an exciting personal opportunity for teachers to develop their leadership skills and experience with recognition at a whole-school level.</p>  <p>  Enhanced measures have been put in place to encourage participation of schools. These include:  </p>  <p>  - A Centralised Application Process to reduce the administrative burden on schools. </p>  <p>  - Provision of funding to schools towards preparation and overseeing of the programmes. </p>  <p>  - Provision to recruit final year student teachers graduating this summer and Route 5 undergraduate student teachers. </p>  <p>  - Guidance, information and support provided to schools to help design and deliver the programmes. </p>  <p>  - Capitation Grant Funding provided to cover the running costs of the scheme, including enhanced capitation for special schools and classes.</p>  <p>  This year, for the first time, there will be an online claims system for schools to submit payments details for those staff taking part in the school based summer programme. This will provide for faster and more streamlined payments to staff.</p>  <p>  In addition, with the assistance of the National Association of Management Boards in Special Schools (NAMBSE), the Department and Inspectorate recently hosted a webinar for Special Schools and provided a presentation on the supports and benefits of running a school based summer programme. The presentation focused on the positive outcomes for students that participated in the 2021 programme.</p>  <p>  While the number of special schools and classes taking part has risen over the last 2 years, we want to continue this growth in participation further. The Department will continue to work with all stakeholders to support parents in accessing summer provision and with schools to ensure that they have the resources and supports necessary to successfully run these programmes. Planning for the 2023 Summer Programme is due to commence shortly and with a view to addressing future plans for the programme.</p>  <p>  It is acknowledged that not all schools will be in a position to provide a school-based programme, so a home-based programme continues to be available for students with complex needs where the school-based programme is unavailable.</p></reply>

The total funding available to provide the programme was &euro;40 million, which was a one hundred per cent increase on the allocation for summer provision in 2020.</p>  <p>  The programme&rsquo;s aims were to support pupils to re-engage with education, to build their confidence and increase their motivation, promote well-being and for some who are at key transition stages, help to ensure they could move on to their planned educational placement for the start of the next school year along with their peers.</p>  <p>  For the first time ever, all schools (primary and-post primary) were encouraged to provide summer programmes and the eligibility criteria was extended to include post-primary children with complex needs and children at risk of educational disadvantage. Prior to this expansion, summer programmes were only available to special schools and pupils in special classes in primary schools and in DEIS schools. This resulted in 945 schools participating in the overall programme, a rise of 72% over 2020. 24,656 pupils participated in the 2021 school-based programme, an increase of 85% over 2020.</p>  <p>  The 2022 summer programme was launched last week, with schools invited to register to participate in the different strands of the programme along the same lines as that offered in 2021.  While the number of schools taking part has risen over the last 2 years we want to continue this growth in participation further.</p></reply>

For example, since 2013, the Department has provided funding to BeLonG To, for StandUp! Awareness which is a campaign that supports school communities to take a stand against bullying that is homophobic, transphobic or bi-phobic. The campaign also seeks to raise awareness in schools about the experience of LBGTI+ Students. The Department has also collaborated with advocacy bodies and partners to prepare a resource document for schools to support LGBTQI+ students, which has been made available online and to schools. </p>  <p>  The Action Plan on Bullying 2013 and the Anti Bullying Procedures for Primary and Post Primary Schools 2013 set out the Department's approach to tackling bullying and promoting an anti-bullying culture in schools. The Department has recently commenced a review of the Action Plan and the Anti Bullying Procedures that will take account of research and developments since they were published. It will specifically consider cyber bullying, identity bullying and sexual harassment, among other areas. </p>  <p>  Access to Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE) is an important right for students, and it is important that the SPHE/RSE programme that is in place in our schools is relevant, up-to-date, and inclusive of all of our students and staff. This is reflected in the Programme for Government commitment to &lsquo;develop inclusive and age appropriate RSE and Social, Personal and Health Education curricula across primary and post-primary levels, including an inclusive programme on LGBTQI+ relationships and making appropriate legislative changes, if necessary&rsquo;.  Following an extensive review of the RSE curriculum, focusing on a range of topics including healthy positive sexual expression and relationships and LGBTQI+ matters, the NCCA published &lsquo;the Report on the Review of Relationships and Sexuality Education in primary and post-primary schools&rdquo; in December, 2019.  The NCCA has begun work to update the SPHE/RSE curriculum for Junior Cycle, Senior Cycle and Primary.  A draft revised Junior Cycle specification will be published before the end of this year which will be subject to further public consultation.</p>  <p>  Finally, specifically in terms of staff, it is also worth noting that under employment law, employers, including schools, have a duty to ensure the health and safety of their employees in the workplace as set out in the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 (as amended).</p>  <p>  My Department offers an Employee Assistance Service for all school staff, including LGBTQI+ employees. This free service includes a wide range of supports including a confidential 24/7 helpline, short-term counselling, a well-being portal, webinars, podcasts and blogs. It also provides advice and support to managers to help them deal with health and well-being issues in the workplace. </p>  <p>  The Department has no role or input into conferences organised by Education Partners.</p></reply>

In that same report it can be seen that post primary enrolments are forecast to peak in 2024 and then decline thereafter to 2039, by circa 90,000 places.  Although these projections do not account for arriving Ukrainian students, it is clear that at a national level there will be increasing levels of capacity within our existing schools infrastructure.  While local and regional variations will, of course, be relevant, the use of such capacity - to meet the needs of Ukrainian children in the first instance - will be an important element in my Department&rsquo;s strategic planning for capital investment in our schools. In this regard, a capacity survey at post-primary level has indicated available capacity of the order of 20,000 school places.  There is also very good capacity at primary level given the downward trend in demographics and this will be analysed at an individual school and town/area level when a capacity survey of special schools and primary schools is undertaken at end May/early June 2022.   </p>  <p>  Where data indicates that there is not sufficient existing capacity to meet school place requirements in an area and that additional provision is required at primary or post primary level, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following</p>  <p>  - Extending the capacity of a school or schools, </p>  <p>  - Provision of a new school or schools. </p>  <p>  Requirements for additional school accommodation provision across the country, including in the Ballyfermot_D10 school planning area, will continue to be kept under review.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to work to advance projects to ensure sufficient places for both mainstream provision and for pupils with special education requirements both for the coming academic year and into the future. My Department has a large pipeline of projects for delivery under the school building programme to cater for current and future educational demands including in the Ballyfermot D10 area.  The current status of these approved projects is listed on a county by county basis on www.gov.ie and is regularly updated to reflect their progress through the various stages.  </p>  <p>  In regards to repurposing an old school site, when a school building becomes vacant as a result of closure, amalgamation or replacement, the future use of the old building is in the first instance a matter for the property owner. When the property owner applies to the Minister for permission to either use the property for community purposes or to sell it, my Department makes an assessment as to whether the property is required for future educational use. If it is concluded that the property has no viable future educational use, my Department permits that it may be used for community or other purposes or may be sold.</p></reply>

The recruitment and appointment of teachers to fill teaching posts is a matter for the individual school authority. In accordance with Department Circular 31/2011, schools are required to ensure that individuals appointed to teach are registered teachers with qualifications appropriate to the sector and suitable to the post for which they are employed. In post primary schools teachers are required to be registered Route 2 with the Teaching Council and have qualifications in the subjects for the post they are appointed to in order to receive incremental salary. It should also be noted that schools and other educational institutions are required to comply with anti-discrimination and other employment legislation, such as the Employment Equality Act 1998.</p>  <p>  Section 37 (1) of the Employment Equality Act, 1998 allowed for the exclusion of discrimination on particular grounds in certain employments.  The amended Section 37 now draws a distinction between religious institutions that are entirely privately funded and those which are funded by the taxpayer. The rationale is in the case of the second category, the Government has the right to protect employees who are paid from public monies from unfair treatment or discrimination in their work place.  </p>  <p>  The amended Section 37 now requires relevant employers in schools with a religious ethos to show that any favourable treatment of an employee or prospective employee is limited to the religion ground and action taken against a person is objectively justified by reference to that institution&rsquo;s aim of protecting its religious ethos. This provision raises the threshold for discrimination so that schools are precluded from discrimination on any other equality grounds and that any action taken is reasonable and proportionate.</p></reply>

The NCCA&rsquo;s review of senior cycle involved an extensive range of research, consultations and communications with a wide range of stakeholders.</p>  <p>  The three tenets of Senior Cycle reform are to:</p>  <p>  - Empower students to meet the challenges of the 21st century</p>  <p>  - Enrich the student experience and build on what&rsquo;s strong in our current system</p>  <p>  - Embed well-being and reduce student stress levels</p>  <p>  As part of these reforms, two new subjects; Drama, Film and Theatre Studies and Climate Action and Sustainable Development, will be introduced for Leaving Certificate students, starting in September 2024 in network schools. I have requested the NCCA to develop these new subject areas as a matter of priority.</p>  <p>  Introducing significant change at Senior Cycle needs to be thought through carefully and it is essential to ensure that NCCA, State Examinations Commission (SEC), the Department and schools can work through the changes with all stakeholders over a sustained period of time.</p>  <p>  I have requested the NCCA to invite a selection of schools, representative of the different types and sizes of schools across Ireland, to become &ldquo;network schools&rdquo;. In order to successfully deliver on the vision I have set out, we need to partner with schools to trial, evaluate, learn, adjust and succeed.</p>  <p>  Network schools will be given the opportunity to participate at an early stage in the new subjects. These schools will receive support through a variety of forms to enable their participation. The network school approach will allow the curriculum and assessment arrangements to be co-constructed with students and their teachers allowing specific aspects of these proposals to be progressed and evaluated.</p>  <p>  My Department will be engaging with the Teaching Council during this period in relation to the registration and eligibility requirements for teachers of the new subjects as well as with the initial teacher education (ITE) providers and teacher professional support services (as regards continuous professional development for teachers) as appropriate in regard to the training of relevant teachers for the subjects. There has also been some preliminary engagement with those providers in regard to Senior Cycle redevelopment. The focus over time will be on ensuring an alignment between ITE provision and the redeveloped Senior Cycle across a range of areas. </p></reply>

Many deaf or hard of hearing pupils are included in mainstream classes at primary and post-primary level. Whilst other children who are deaf or hard of hearing and have more complex needs may attend special schools or classes, which have lower pupil teacher ratios. </p>  <p>  The NCSE has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide. The visiting teacher service forms part of the NCSE support service for schools, and visiting teachers are now recruited, deployed and managed by the NCSE.</p>  <p>  The visiting teachers are qualified teachers with particular skills and knowledge of the development and education of children with varying degrees of hearing loss and/or visual impairment. They offer longitudinal support to children, their families and schools from the time of referral through to the end of post-primary education. They help children to develop tactile and sensory skills and give advice on self-help and other skills needed for independent living. They provide support in the development of pre-Braille skills, where necessary, and give instruction in mobility where appropriate.</p>  <p>  Visiting teachers can refer children for assessment of low-vision aids and train the children in their use. They help children to develop tactile and sensory skills and give advice on self-help and other skills needed for independent living. They provide support in the development of pre-Braille skills, where necessary, and give instruction in mobility where appropriate. Teachers can refer the child for further mobility instruction where required.</p>  <p>  Each visiting teacher operates in a particular region and manages a caseload of students. The visiting teacher supports children/young people, parents, guardians, teachers and other professionals involved with the child. Each visiting teacher works in partnership with parents to provide advice, and offer guidance, in matters pertaining to the child&rsquo;s education and overall development. The frequency and nature of support takes into account a range of factors based on the individual&rsquo;s needs. </p>  <p>  Currently there are 43 visiting teachers posts allocated across the 10 NCSE regional teams, supported by teams of professionals and agencies such as audiological scientists, ophthalmology services, speech and language therapists, low vision specialists, psychologists, early intervention teams and school staff.  </p>  <p>  Under the Assistive Technology scheme, as set out in my Department&rsquo;s Circular 0010/2013, funding is provided to schools towards the cost of computers and specialist equipment, which are required for educational purposes. All equipment provided under this scheme supports children who, in order to access the school curriculum, require essential specialist equipment.</p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) is responsible for processing applications from schools for special educational needs supports. SENOs also make recommendations to my Department where assistive technology/specialised equipment is required. The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in making recommendations for support.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Education and the Minister of State for Special Education and Inclusion announced on the 2nd March 2022 a new scheme to support students in both primary and post primary Schools whose primary Language is ISL </p>  <p>  The newly introduced scheme will involve two key strands of support:</p>  <p>  - Programme of intensive in-school support for individual students to enable them access teaching and learning and participate in school life</p>  <p>  - Programme of training and support to build capacity among the school community including teachers, special needs assistants, other school staff and pupils on communication using Irish Sign Language</p>  <p>  - The new scheme is targeted at children and young people attending primary, special and post-primary school, who were born without an auditory nerve or due to infection, disease, trauma, failed technology intervention (for example cochlear implants), their auditory nerve has ceased to function completely and whose primary means of communication is using Irish Sign Language. </p>  <p>  - Under the scheme, a package of dedicated specialist ISL supports will be allocated to relevant schools so these students have a more inclusive school experience. This new scheme builds on current provision to ensure the needs of the children are met.</p>  <p>  - Funding is also provided by the Department for a home tuition service whereby tutors visit the homes of deaf and hard of hearing preschool children and school-going pupils to provide training in ISL for these children and their families including their grandparents.</p>  <p>  - The Department also provides funding for assistive technology for pupils who are deaf or hard of hearing, equipment is provided under this scheme to enable students attend school and engage with the curriculum. </p>  <p>  - Reasonable accommodations and supports are made available to support children with special educational needs, including students who are deaf/hard of hearing, to participate in state exams.</p></reply>

The programme was developed following extensive engagement with education stakeholders, parent and disability advocacy groups.</p>  <p>   The programme aims are to support pupils to maintain their connection with education, to build their confidence and increase their motivation, promote well-being and for those who are at key transition stages, helping to ensure they continue their education journey in September either in school or in further/higher education or training. </p>  <p>  In 2021, due to the ongoing pandemic, the government announced a expansion to the summer programme.  Under this expansion, students with complex special educational needs and those at greatest risk of educational disadvantage had access to an enhanced summer programme of education. The total provisional spend across the school and home-based elements for 2021 was &euro;36m.</p>  <p>  While, it is critically important to support a summer based programme in our special schools and special classes, it is also essential to ensure that the children with complex special educational needs (SEN) who are in our mainstream settings also have access to this critical support.  At the time when the &lsquo;July Provision&rsquo; was established, the concert of learning loss during school holidays was something which may have been considered to impact only those students in special schools and special classes. As our system has become more inclusive and many of these children with more complex needs now attend mainstream settings, it is recognised that they too will be impacted by school holidays and require that additional support to ensure they achieve their potential.</p>  <p>  My Department held consultations with education stakeholders and advocacy groups, following this, steps were taken to encourage more schools to participate including the following: the provision of paid overseeing and preparation time for schools, a reduction in the administrative burden for schools, arrangements to pay staff sooner, greater guidance, an online payments portal for schools, and greater flexibility in the timing of the programme.</p>  <p>  The complexities of organising a summer programme in special school environments is recognised and further enhanced funding for special schools is being provided this year including increase capitation and preparation to support these schools.</p>  <p>  Concerns around availability of staff have been further addressed with the provision to recruit final year student teachers and student teachers registered with the Teaching Council under Route 5. To support and facilitate schools and principals with organising and running the programme, principals may delegate these functions to other members of staff through the Overseer role and preparation hours. Overseers, teachers and SNAs who work on the programme will be paid for this work based on what they are normally paid during the school year in addition to their normal salary.</p>  <p>  In 2021 377 special schools and schools with special classes ran a programme, with in the region of 5,587 pupils attending. For context in 2011 there were 149 schools and 2,461 pupils attending the &lsquo;July provision&rsquo; programme. The number of special schools running a programme under the &lsquo;July provision&rsquo; scheme had fallen from 54 in 2011 to 34 in 2019. It is important to note that we have actually seen an increase in the number of special schools running a programme in both 2020 and 2021 with 39 special schools taking part in 2021.</p>  <p>  While the number of special schools and classes taking part has risen over the last 2 years we want to continue this growth in participation further. The Department will continue to work with all stakeholders to support parents in accessing summer provision and with schools to ensure that they have the resources and supports necessary to successfully run these programmes.</p>  <p>  It is acknowledged that not all schools will be in a position to provide a school-based programme, so a home-based programme continues to be available for students with complex needs where the school-based programme is unavailable. It is important that the home-based programme provides support for the education and/or care needs of students with complex needs during the summer break period.</p>  <p>   Under the home-based programme grant funding is made available so that parents/legal guardians can engage the services of a teacher or an SNA to provide tuition or care support as appropriate in the child&rsquo;s home.  Schools are requested to provide parents with the contact details of a teacher/SNA where possible.</p></reply>

In 2021 nearly 38,000 children availed of the summer programme, an increase of 60% from the previous year.</p>  <p>  A key objective of this year&rsquo;s scheme is to increase the number of schools offering the summer programme to their students. Steps have been taken to afford schools as much flexibility as possible, and to ease administrative requirements. This year there is provision to recruit newly qualified teachers graduating this summer as well as undergraduate student teachers who have registered with the Teaching Council under Route 5.</p>  <p>  To support and facilitate schools and principals with organising and running the programme, the 2022 Summer Programme allows principals to delegate these functions to other members of staff through the Overseer role and preparation hours. The Overseer and preparation roles provide an exciting personal opportunity for teachers to develop their leadership skills and experience with recognition at a whole-school level.</p>  <p>  Enhanced measures have been put in place to encourage participation of schools. These include:</p>  <p>  - A Centralised Application Process to reduce the administrative burden on schools.</p>  <p>  - Provision of funding to schools towards preparation and overseeing of the programmes.</p>  <p>  - Provision to recruit final year student teachers graduating this summer and Route 5 undergraduate student teachers.</p>  <p>  - Guidance, information and support provided to schools to help design and deliver the programmes.</p>  <p>  - Capitation Grant Funding provided to cover the running costs of the scheme, including enhanced capitation for special schools and classes.</p>  <p>  This year, for the first time, there will be an online claims system for schools to submit payments details for those staff taking part in the school based summer programme. This will provide for faster and more streamlined payments to staff.</p>  <p>  In addition, with the assistance of the National Association of Management Boards in Special Schools (NAMBSE), the Department and Inspectorate recently hosted a webinar for Special Schools and provided a presentation on the supports and benefits of running a school based summer programme. The presentation focused on the positive outcomes for students that participated in the 2021 programme.</p>  <p>  While the number of special schools and classes taking part has risen over the last 2 years, we want to continue this growth in participation further. The Department will continue to work with all stakeholders to support parents in accessing summer provision and with schools to ensure that they have the resources and supports necessary to successfully run these programmes.

The system is intended to act as a conduit for key skills which are required to develop enterprise in the State for the benefit of our economy, while simultaneously protecting the balance of the labour market.  The system is, by design, vacancy led and driven by the changing needs of the labour market, expanding and contracting in tandem with its inherent fluctuations.</p>  <p>  The State&rsquo;s general policy is to promote the sourcing of labour and skills needs from within the workforce of the State and other EEA states.  However, where specific skills prove difficult to source within the EEA, an employment permit may be sought in respect of a non-EEA national who possess those skills.</p>  <p>  The employment permit system is managed through the operation of the critical skills and the ineligible occupations lists which determine employments that are either in high demand or are ineligible for consideration for an employment permit.  In order to maintain the relevance of these lists of occupations to the needs of the economy, they undergo twice-yearly evidence-based reviews.  These reviews are guided by research undertaken by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN), the Skills and the Labour Market Research Unit (SLMRU), SOLAS and include a public consultation process and extensive consultation with other Government Departments through the Interdepartmental Group on Economic Migration Policy.  Account is taken of education outputs, sectoral upskilling and training initiatives and known contextual factors such as Brexit and, in the current context, COVID-19 and their impact on the labour market.</p>  <p>  My Department experienced a significant increase in applications for employment permits in the past year, impacting on processing times.  From the start of January to the end of December 2021, some 27,666 applications were received, representing a 69% increase over the same period in 2020 (16,293) and a 47% increase on 2019 (18,811), which itself represented an 11 year high in applications.  16,275 employment permits were issued in 2021, with a total of 17,968 applications processed which represents a significant volume of activity.  The increased demand was also driven by the extension of categories of employment permits, in particular for the agricultural sector, following the Review of the Occupational Lists announced  in October 2021.  This included 3,000 permits made available to the agricultural sector. </p>  <p>  My Department recognises the impact delays on the processing times for work permits has for businesses and their workers and has developed a plan of action to reduce processing times built up over the pandemic.  The plan includes both additional staffing and systemic changes.  The processing team has trebled in size and daily output has more than tripled compared to 2021 levels.  Internal processes have been streamlined and initiatives introduced which are all having an impact.  </p>  <p>  Since the implementation of this plan, the Employment Permits Unit has made positive progress to reduce the current backlog reducing the number of applications awaiting processing from c.11,000 in January 2022 to under 6,500 to date.  </p>  <p>  As new staff were trained on Critical Skills and Intra Corporate Transfer Employment Permits, processing times for those permits have fallen from 21 weeks to 6 weeks.  </p>  <p>  All flexible resources have now been redeployed to address processing times for General Employment permit applications which currently stand at 22 weeks.  My Department expects to see a consistent strong fall in waiting times for General Employment Permits, from mid-May, with processing times considerably reduced by end Q2.  In Q3 my Department will continue to drive down waiting times across all permit types.  </p>  <p>  Full details on current processing times are published on my Department&rsquo;s website - Current processing dates for employment permits - DETE (enterprise.gov.ie).</p></reply>

One of the main issues raised at that meeting was concern over energy security and prices.</p>  <p>  Alongside other Fora led by my Department, such as the Retail Forum and the LEO Steering Group, I regularly meet with business representatives and relevant stakeholders where a range of issues are raised including fuel and inflationary costs.</p>  <p>  The agencies under my Department&rsquo;s remit also continue to implement a range of programmes open to SMEs to increase their energy and other efficiencies thereby reducing costs with a view to maintaining and improving their competitiveness.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland also regularly survey impacted clients which helps to inform our thinking on how best to help these companies remain resilient to current and future shocks and disruptions. Enterprise Ireland continues examine any necessary measures to help companies respond to the current business pressures. In particular, they are considering how the EU's temporary state aid crisis framework could be used to assist companies which are vulnerable but viable.</p>  <p>  The Climate Enterprise Action Fund currently being administered by Enterprise Ireland which helps firms to plan climate action will be further built upon with additional funding for a range of initiatives launching later this year. These will fund investment in carbon measurement and abatement technologies for manufacturing enterprises and will be open to clients, or potential clients, of Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.</p>  <p>  LEOs also support clients to reduce costs with initiatives such as Green for Micro, Lean for Micro and the Trading On-Line Voucher programmes.</p>  <p>  The recently launched Climate Toolkit for Business also provides a useful resource to firms seeking to better understand their carbon footprint and plan.</p>  <p>  Government Departments have been consulting with stakeholders on specific measures that could be considered to ameliorate the short to medium term challenges to energy security. The Energy Supply Emergency Group is an inter-departmental and inter-agency group with responsibility for informing the Government response to the impact of rising energy costs on business, in addition to security of energy supply more generally, and a longer-term reduction in Ireland&rsquo;s dependency on imported oil and gas.</p>  <p>  Under the aegis of this Group, my Department has established the Business Energy Users Sub-Group to lead on consultations with business and industry to learn about the specific impacts on Irish businesses, and to hear their concerns and perspectives on the appropriate and most effective tools for policy action. The work of this sub-group, as part of the wider Energy Supply Emergency Group has informed the National Energy Security Framework which was launched by the Government on 13th April 2022.</p>  <p>  The Government has provided clear and practical guidance to business users on ways of maximising their energy efficiency and thus helping to manage overall levels of demand across our energy networks. This guidance is available on www.gov.ie.</p>  <p>  In the long term the Government are working towards having up to 80% of our electricity from renewables by 2030, which will make a significant difference in protecting Ireland from similar energy price shocks in future.</p>  <p>  We are encouraging and supporting firms to make investments in increased energy efficiency and a reduced carbon footprint, for example, SEAI, provide direct grants such as the support scheme for renewable heat, project assistance grants, the EXEED grant scheme, tax incentives available through the Accelerated Capital Allowance, and funding for energy audits.</p></reply>

The Government has put a range of policies and measures in place at national level to alleviate fuel and energy poverty. These measures supplement lower income households through the Fuel Allowance and other payments, as well as providing free energy efficiency upgrades through the SEAI schemes and the Social Housing retrofitting programme. Examples of key recent developments include:</p><p>-Budget 2022 incorporated a range of measures to support citizens with the rising cost of living.  These measures included increases to weekly social welfare payments, targeted measures with increases in the living alone allowance and the qualified child increase and a &euro;5 increase in the weekly rate of fuel allowance, with that increase implemented immediately in October.  The weekly income threshold for Fuel Allowance was also increased by &euro;20 which enables more people to qualify for this support.</p><p>-Further measures were recently announced to help mitigate the effects of rising energy costs.  As part of these measures an additional lump sum payment of &euro;125 was paid to all households in receipt of the Fuel Allowance payment.  This lump sum payment, in addition to the Budget increase, will mean low-income households will see an increase of 41% this fuel allowance season when compared to last season. </p><p>-This year, 58% (&euro;203 million) of the total Government retrofit budget of &euro;352 million will be spent on dedicated energy poverty retrofit supports and local authority retrofits. These supports are available nationwide and are linked to a household&rsquo;s individual circumstances.</p><p>-A once-off payment of &euro;200 (inclusive of VAT) is being paid from April 2022 onwards to all domestic electricity accounts as part of the Government&rsquo;s package of measures to provide further support to households in the context of increased living costs.</p><p>In addition to the measures outlined above, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities has in place a suite of protections against disconnection that are set out in the Supplier Handbook. In brief, priority customers cannot be disconnected, while vulnerable customers are protected over winter months from 1 November to 31 March each year. Additionally, under the supplier led voluntary Energy Engage Code, suppliers will not disconnect a customer who is engaging with them at any time.  Accordingly, any customers who are experiencing difficulties with their Bills should engage with their supplier to discuss the various options and assistance available. </p></reply>

As such, it is being applied automatically to all domestic electricity accounts which were held with suppliers on 29 March. </p>  <p>  Suppliers are required to maintain records of any accounts they have been unable to credit, and to return these unallocated credits  to ESB Networks by 15 July 2022.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that updates on the electricity credit, including frequently asked questions, are available on gov.ie at: www.gov.ie/en/publication/4ae14-electricity-costs-emergency-benefit-scheme/</p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to 7% average annual emissions reduction to 2030; ultimately, the goal is for a zero-emission mobility system by 2050. Electrification will be key to achieving this objective in the transport sector.</p>  <p>  Electric vehicles (EVs) are the most prominent transport mitigation measure in the  Climate Action Plan and Ireland has set an ambitious target of 945,000 EVs on our roads by 2030. This target is challenging but indicates the scale of the transformation that is needed across all sectors if Ireland is to achieve its climate targets in the coming years.</p>  <p>  The Department supports the uptake of eSPSVs through the  Electric Small Public Service Vehicle (eSPSV) Grant Scheme. A grant of up to &euro;10,000 to support the purchase of a BEV in the taxi/hackney/limousine sector with an additional &euro;2,500 available for those choosing to make their vehicle wheelchair accessible. Those scrapping older, more polluting, or high mileage vehicles are now eligible for double the normal grant if they make the switch to electric. The Scheme is funded by the Department and administered by NTA acting as agents of the Department with delegated authority and as the licensing authority for SPSVs. &euro;15m was allocated in 2022 to support SPSVs to switch to electric.</p>  <p>  In addition, to promote the decarbonisation of the heavy-duty sector, and to assist road transport companies to transition from fossil fuels, the Department launched a new Alternatively-Fuelled Heavy-Duty Vehicle (AFHDV) Purchase Grant Scheme in 2021. The Scheme supports the purchase of new large vans, trucks, buses and coaches.</p>  <p>  The Scheme, which is administered by TII, is intended to help bridge some of the difference in purchase price between conventional heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs) and those powered by alternatively-fuelled power-trains that offer environmental benefits over standard diesel vehicle technologies, and that would not otherwise have been bought.</p>  <p>  To accord with EU State Aid rules, grant levels under the Scheme are calculated as a percentage of the difference in price between a conventionally-fuelled diesel HDV and its alternatively-fuelled equivalent. Maximum grant levels for eligible vehicles depend on the size of the company or enterprise applying for the grant, and on the fuel-type of the vehicle that the applicant wishes to buy.</p>  <p>  &euro;3m was allocated to this scheme in 2021 and given the excellent response to the initiative, a further &euro;3m was allocated this year.  </p>  <p>  My Department convened the Electric Vehicle Policy Pathway (EVPP) Working Group to produce a roadmap to achieving the 2030 EV target. This Group considered a variety of regulatory, financial, and taxation policies to accelerate EV adoption and recommended that the generous suite of EV supports already in place in Ireland should be retained until at least end-2022. Additional measures to further incentivise EVs and/or disincentivise fossil fuelled vehicles will also be necessary. Cost-effective, targeted policy supports should continue to be developed and strengthened over the coming years. </p>  <p>  An Implementation Group has been established to progress the recommendations and consider further potential measures to drive the adoption of the EVs. This Group will report on its progress to Government in Q4 of this year.  </p>  <p>  In addition, work is underway to establish Zero Emission Vehicles Ireland as a matter of priority. This office will co-ordinate the implementation of existing and future EV measures and infrastructure.  Our objective is to develop and refine cost-effective, targeted policy supports over the coming years.  </p>  <p>  Innovations that provide reliable solutions for people willing to transition to electric vehicles are to be welcomed, particularly if they provide options for people who might be unable to purchase a new vehicle. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-05-12a.472.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022051200073#WRL01600"><p>Where a person is in receipt of payments from the Department of Social Protection (DSP), and has an additional source of income such as an occupational pension, the mechanism used to tax payments from the DSP, is by reducing the person&rsquo;s annual tax credits and rate band to take account of the amount of their taxable DSP payments. This ensures that their weekly payment from the DSP is paid gross to the recipient, while their weekly/monthly occupational pension paid by their pension provider will have any tax due on the DSP income and on the occupational pension deducted from it.  </p>  <p>  In addition, it is important to point out that if a person is aged 65 or over, they may avail of the annual age exemption limits. Section 188 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (TCA 1997) provides for these exemptions and associated marginal relief. Where the age exemption applies the claimant&rsquo;s income will be exempt from income tax in that year.</p>  <p>  The age exemption applies for any year of assessment where an individual is aged 65 years or over and his or her total income does not exceed &euro;18,000. Where an individual is a married person or civil partner and is jointly assessed to tax, the age exemption will apply where either individual is aged 65 or over and where the couple&rsquo;s total income does not exceed &euro;36,000. The relevant income thresholds may be increased further if the individual has a qualifying child. The thresholds are increased by &euro;575 in respect of both the first and second child, and &euro;830 in respect of each subsequent child.</p>  <p>  Marginal relief may be available where the individual&rsquo;s or couple&rsquo;s income exceeds the relevant exemption limit but is less than twice that amount. Where marginal relief applies the individual or couple is taxed at 40% on all income above the exemption limit to a ceiling of twice the exemption limit.  Once the income exceeds twice the exemption limit marginal relief is no longer available and the individual pays tax under the normal tax system.  It should be noted, however, that where the individual&rsquo;s income is greater than the exemption limit but below twice that limit, the taxpayer is always given the benefit of the more favourable treatment as between the use of marginal relief or the normal tax system of credits and bands.   </p>  <p>  I am aware that, depending on a person&rsquo;s circumstances, increases in weekly DSP payments may result in higher tax deductions from a person&rsquo;s occupational pension and a reduced weekly/monthly net occupational pension.  However, over the course of a year as a result of the increased payment, a person&rsquo;s combined net income from their occupational and State pensions after the increase will always be higher than it was before the increase.    </p>  <p>  For clarity, Budget 2022 included an increase of &euro;5 per week in the State Pension and &euro;3 per week increase in the Living Alone Allowance. In general, an increase of &euro;8 per week in DSP income would mean an increase of approximately &euro;1.60 per week in tax deducted from a weekly occupational pension (the same weekly increase of &euro;8 would be &euro;32 per month and would result in an additional &euro;6.40 per month being deducted from the occupational pension).</p>  <p>  However, Budget 2022 included a significant tax package amounting to a cost of &euro;520 million. This included a substantial income tax package comprising of an increase of &euro;50 in each of the main tax credits &ndash; personal tax credit, employee tax credit and the earned income credit &ndash; from &euro;1,650 to &euro;1,700.  An increase of &euro;1,500 in the income tax standard rate band for all income earners was also introduced. Further details can be located at the following link - www.gov.ie/en/publication/7e491-taxation-measures/.    </p>  <p>  Having regard to the fiscal demands and pressures facing the State in 2022, it would not have been possible to increase all tax credits and reliefs and remain within the fiscal parameters. However, it is worth pointing out that the age exemption limits are at a level which compares favourably with the tax treatment of the generality of taxpayers.      </p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that they have communicated directly with the Deputy in relation to the taxpayer in question on this matter.    </p>  <p>  I am further advised by Revenue that on review of the records of the person concerned, they are paying less tax on their private pension in the current year than in 2021. This is due to the combination of the increased DSP payments announced in Budget 2022 and the increased personal and PAYE tax credits for 2022, which reduce the amount of tax the person is due to pay on their income.  The tax deducted from their private pension in 2022 is currently &euro;6.62 per month as opposed to &euro;8.02 per month, as was the case in the latter half of 2021. Taking the increase in the DSP pension and the reduction of tax from the private pension into consideration, the taxpayer&rsquo;s net monthly income has increased in 2022.     </p>  <p>Additional guidance on a range of other tax credits and reliefs, such as the age tax credit,  that may be available for individuals over 65 years of age can be found in Tax and Duty Manual Part 15-01-26, which can be located at the following link &ndash; Tax and Duty Manual: www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/tdm/income-tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax/part-15/15-01-26.pdf.  </p></reply>

Both Heritage Ireland 2030, the new national heritage plan, and A Living Tradition, the new vernacular architectural heritage strategy, contain actions to address the issue of insurance of protected structures, including thatched buildings. Officials in my Department are currently establishing a thatch steering group to address this question, amongst others.</p>  <p>  Action 6 of A Living Tradition is to &lsquo;enhance the protection and conservation of historic thatched roofs&rsquo;. Work is currently underway to establish the facts of the situation: which companies are prepared to provide insurance; the affordability of such premiums; and, the terms and conditions of such policies for owners. Through dialogue with the insurance sector, this study will seek to understand what providers perceive as the issues in insuring such buildings. It will also gather statistical evidence on the perceived risks associated with thatched buildings, as well examining models in other jurisdictions, so as to engage constructively with the sector in an informed way. The views of owners will also be sought, as well as those of the Central Bank, which is responsible for the prudential supervision of such undertakings authorised in Ireland, and other relevant bodies.</p>  <p>  My Department is committed to investing in the preservation and continued use of thatched homes so that they remain a living part of our heritage and community life into the future. To this end, my Department oversees a number of schemes to assist in the conservation of protected structures such as thatched cottages. These include the dedicated Renewal or Repair of Thatched Roof Grant Scheme as well as the Built Heritage Investment Scheme and the Historic Structures Fund. Guidance for owners of thatched properties can also be found in my Department&rsquo;s Advice Series.</p></reply>

Over the course of the two-day programme, I met with senior officials from President Biden's Administration, engaged with a number of foreign policy organisations, and met representatives from the Irish American community.</p>  <p>  In Washington D.C., I participated in a public discussion at the German Marshall Fund on Ireland&rsquo;s response to Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine, as well as Ireland&rsquo;s unique position within the EU-US transatlantic relationship. I underscored the need for strong international cooperation in support of the international rules based order, now more than ever. </p>  <p>  My engagements with National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, Chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Bob Menendez, and Senator Pat Toomey, were valuable opportunities to discuss priority issues, particularly in relation to Northern Ireland, Brexit, immigration, and foreign policy issues such as Ukraine, the JCPOA, and the humanitarian situation in Syria.</p>  <p>  On Northern Ireland, it was clear to me in my discussions that this remains a priority on a bipartisan basis across the political system in the US. The US will continue to play a vital role in supporting peace, stability and prosperity in Northern Ireland. The role of the US Special Envoy to NI has been greatly valued by the Irish government over many years, and the appointment of a new Envoy was something I emphasised in my exchanges. We will continue to ensure that the Irish perspective is understood through continued high-level contact, as well as through the ongoing engagement by our Embassy in Washington DC.  </p>  <p>  I was also pleased to visit Boston, a city with a large and historic Irish-American population, where there is great interest in Ireland and the Irish perspective. I participated in a number of engagements including at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library, Harvard University, and Boston College, where I discussed developments in Northern Ireland, Ukraine, and the EU-US relationship.</p>  <p>  I also met with leaders of local Irish community organisations, who briefed me on their critical support to the Irish community in Boston during the pandemic. My meetings with Governor Charlie Baker and members of the Massachusetts State House were a great opportunity to reaffirm Ireland&rsquo;s strong historic, political and economic links with the State of Massachusetts and to explore how we might further strengthen these links.</p></reply>

Due to the complex nature of the FBR process, the large increase in applications received following the Brexit vote in the UK, and the pause in the Service due to necessary Covid-19 restrictions, applicants should allow approximately 2 years from the receipt of supporting documentation for processing of FBR applications at this time.

Such applicants may continue to contact the Passport Service directly.

These applications include:</p>  <p>  - All Passport Express applications - Section 9 Certificate of Identity</p>  <p>  - First time adult online applications - Identity Verification Form</p>  <p>  - First time child online applications - Child Passport Identity and Consent Form (Guardian A)</p>  <p>  The witnessing of these forms is a vital element of the identity verification process for the Passport Service, as it provides initial assurance that the person in the photograph is the same person presenting to submit the passport application form.</p>  <p>  In the case of an application for a minor the witnessing of this form provides evidence that guardians give consent for a passport to be issued to the child. In order to protect the integrity of the Irish passport and also the rights of parents or guardians and children, it is important that forms are correctly completed and verified by the Passport Service by calling the Garda station to confirm the Garda's signature.</p>  <p>  It is stated in a note to the witness on the identity and consent forms that they may be contacted to confirm the validity of their signature. It is the responsibility of the witnessing Garda to ensure that the signature is correctly recorded in the logbook, so that when the Passport Service calls at a later date the signature can be verified.</p>  <p>  There are a small number of cases where the Passport Service has difficulty contacting a Garda station in order to verify the Garda's signature. Whilst the Passport Service makes every effort to contact the Garda station in these cases, unfortunately, the passport application may be delayed. In some cases, the applicant may be requested to submit a new witnessed form where the Passport Service has been unable to contact the Garda station. The Passport Service will only request a new witness form after multiple attempts have been made to contact the Garda station. </p>  <p>  A new document management system that was put in place at the beginning of March is ensuring that these applications which require further documents are being turned around within 15 working days of receipt of the additional documents.</p>  <p>  It is not the experience of the Passport Service that failure to contact Garda stations to verify witnesses is a widespread issue.</p>  <p>  The Passport Service is continuously looking at ways to make the application process easier for applicants and advises during the online application process to make sure that the identity and consent form is correctly witnessed once they have completed the online process. </p>  <p>  The Passport Service provides instructions on how to correctly complete these forms on the Department's website (www.dfa.ie/passports/how-to-get-your-application-witnessed/).</p>  <p>  The Passport Service is also working on public education materials, including video tutorials, with a view to assisting applicants to complete their application correctly. </p>  <p>  In addition to this, the Passport Service maintains a close working relationship with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and regularly offers training and guidance to Garda&iacute; on the correct completion of the required identity and consent forms.</p>  <p>  The Passport Service published a full-page informational advertisement in the April and May editions of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s magazine, the Garda Review, to assist Garda&iacute; with the process of witnessing passport identity and consent forms. This advertisement includes the information that Passport Service will ring the Garda station to verify all first time passport applicants&rsquo; consent form details.</p>  <p>  The Passport Service takes its responsibility to protect the integrity of the Irish passport very seriously. The Irish passport has a strong international reputation due to the strength of the security features within the passport book and the robust processes involved in its issuance. The Irish passport was recently ranked 5th in the Henley Global Passport Index as it provides our citizens with visa-free access to 187 countries.</p>  <p>  There are no plans at present to amend the process for the witnessing of identity and consent forms by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></reply>

This equipment could include such items as body armour and helmets. A similar approach is followed by both Austria and Malta. </p>  <p>  Ireland is providing its full contribution to the EPF assistance measures, Ireland&rsquo;s contribution currently stands at &euro;33m. It is expected that a further tranche of funding for Ukraine via the EPF will be proposed in the coming days, taking the total support provided by the EU to &euro;2 billion.

The contribution of the ready-to-eat meals and body armour is a specific element of the Government&rsquo;s contribution through the European Peace Facility and is in addition to the further &euro;20 million provided in humanitarian assistance to the UN and the Red Cross which is already being disbursed through UN and NGO partners in Ukraine and in neighbouring countries. </p>  <p>  That also includes a dedicated Ukraine civil society fund of &euro;2 million specifically to support NGOs responding to the crisis. </p>  <p>  Ireland is also one of over 40 countries that referred the situation in Ukraine to the International Criminal Court (ICC). Ireland is providing a further &euro;3 million to the ICC, which will assist with regard to all situations before the court.</p>  <p>  The Health Service Executive has also provided medical supplies through the EU&rsquo;s Civil Protection Mechanism and the Department of Foreign Affairs&rsquo; Rapid Response Register has been activated, making skilled humanitarians available at short notice to the UN system.</p></reply>

Ireland is a strong proponent of the important role the EU can play in support of international peace and security and of the UN. It is essential, therefore, that Ireland remains fully engaged in all CSDP processes and contributes fully to the development of the policy in order that we can influence its evolution. </p>  <p>  Ireland is engaged with a number of European Union defence-related initiatives and frameworks, including the European Defence Agency (EDA), the Coordinated Annual Review on Defence (CARD), the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO), the EU Satellite Centre (EU SatCen), the European Defence Fund (EDF) and the European Peace Facility (EPF).</p>  <p>  The European Defence Agency was set up in 2004 during Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the EU and Ireland joined the Agency in July of that year.  The EDA is an Agency of the European Union, which supports Member States to develop a range of capabilities and capability standards to support CSDP, in particular the deployment of military capabilities in support of Crisis Management Tasks, as outlined in the Treaty on European Union. Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the Agency provides access to research and information on developing and maintaining professional capabilities and research that we cannot self-generate.  This is important in terms of Ireland's ability to participate in UN-mandated Peacekeeping Operations.  Ireland contributes, on an annual basis, to the operational budget of the EDA.  </p>  <p>  In May 2017, the Council endorsed the modalities to establish the Coordinated Annual Review on Defence (CARD).  This is a process which aims to create greater transparency by sharing Member States information on future defence policy, capability development, budgets and investment.  All 27 EU Member States, including Ireland, participate and contribute to the CARD process. </p>  <p>  Ireland joined the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) in 2017.  The establishment of PESCO represents a further development in EU Cooperation in support of international peace and security under CSDP.  Under PESCO, Member States come together in different groups to develop and make available additional capabilities and enablers for peacekeeping and crisis management operations.  Ireland is currently participating in one PESCO project and is an observer on a further nine projects.   </p>  <p>  Ireland has participated in The EU Satellite Centre (EU SatCen) since 2007. The EU SatCen is an Agency working for the Common Security and Defence Policy of the European Union under the Political Supervision of the Political and Security Committee and the Operational Direction of the High Representative, which is governed by a Council Joint Action. In the international security and defence field, it handles sensitive and classified data to support CSDP military operations and civilian missions.  The Department of Defence and the Department of Foreign Affairs contribute to the budget of the EU SatCen.      </p>  <p>  The European Defence Fund (EDF) is an industrial sectoral programme, providing funding for research and capability development, which supports the European Defence and Industrial Technology Base in delivering capabilities for Common Security Defence Policy operations. The fund is designed to foster innovation to address new security and defence challenges and allow economies of scale through greater industrial and research cooperation and enhancing the competitiveness of the EU defence industry. The EDF is funded within the Multi-annual Financial Framework which itself is funded directly by the Exchequer.  Member State contributions to the EU Budget (Own Resources) are currently calculated annually by the EU Commission in line with the provisions outlined in Own Resources Decision (ORD) Regulation. As Ireland&rsquo;s contributions go into the general pool of revenue that funds all EU budget expenditure, including the EDF, there is no defined cost to the Exchequer for the EDF.       </p>  <p>  Ireland contributes to the funding of common costs for EU military crisis management operations through the European Peace Facility (EPF). The EPF, established in March 2021, replaced the Athena Mechanism and the African Peace Facility. Under the EPF, the Department of Defence has responsibility for the financing of common costs relating to EU military operations under the EU's common security and defence policy (CSDP). The Department of Foreign Affairs has responsibility for the funding of African peace support operations, previously handled by the African Peace Facility, as well as Assistance Measures in order to provide assistance to individual countries and regional or sub-regional organisations.  In 2020, the European Council agreed a &euro;5bn financial ceiling for the EPF over the seven years of the 2021-2027 MFF. Actual spending of EPF funds require separate unanimous Council Decisions for each operation or assistance measure, such as the recent examples of the EPF Assistance Measures in support of Ukraine. An annual ceiling for each of the seven years is set out in the Council Decision establishing the EPF.  Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to EU Assistance Measures under the EPF is currently funded by the Department of Foreign Affairs.</p>  <p>  The Strategic Compass, approved by foreign and defence ministers at the Foreign Affairs Council on 21 March 2022 and subsequently endorsed by EU Leaders at the European Council on 24-25 March, gives the European Union an ambitious plan of action for strengthening the EU's security and defence policy by 2030. The Strategic Compass is a means of setting out the EU's shared strategic vision for Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) and of enhancing the role of the EU in international peace and security.  While discussions continue on the Implementation of the Strategic Compass, it should be noted that decision-making power in relation to its proposed actions remain a national competence. Ireland will continue to work with fellow Member States to ensure the ambitions of the document are realised.</p></reply>

In February, March and again in April of 2022, the Council of the European Union adopted assistance measures under the European Peace Facility (EPF).

The report was published on the 9th February 2022.  </p>  <p>  The Commission undertook a significant body of work encompassing their wide-ranging terms of reference.  The report contains 69 main recommendations with a large number of sub recommendations.  The Commission's terms of reference included the consideration of appropriate capabilities, structures and staffing for the Army, the Air Corps, the Naval Service.</p>  <p>  The Commission's report proposes significant changes for the Defence Forces, including to Defence Forces culture, high-level command and control structures, and for the level of Defence provision in Ireland.  Clearly, there are matters that will require careful consideration and in some critical aspects inter-departmental discussion. This includes the level of resourcing that may be allocated to Defence, legislative implications and the governance framework that will be required to underpin any changes the Government approve on foot of the Commission's report. </p>  <p>  The report is being fully considered, in consultation with Ministerial colleagues and other stakeholders. The intent is that following relevant consideration, and before the summer recess, I will revert to Government with a proposed response to the Commission's recommendations and a high-level action plan.  </p>  <p>  As outlined previously, I will not engage in speculative discussion regarding the recommendations in the Commission&rsquo;s Report or the outcome of the deliberative process. </p></reply>

The Department of Defence has received a capital allocation under the National Development Plan of &euro;566m over the 2022-2025 timeframe. Within that capital allocation the Defence annual capital budget for 2022 is &euro;141m. This level of capital funding will allow the Defence Organisation to undertake a programme of sustained equipment replacement and infrastructural development across the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service as identified and prioritised in the Defence White Paper and builds on the significant investment programme over recent years.</p>  <p>  The Equipment Development Plan (EDP) published in June 2020, completed through extensive joint civil-military work, provides a comprehensive list of planned equipment projects which will be progressed over five years. This plan builds on the intentions set out in the White Paper in relation to equipment acquisition, modernisation and upgrade and has been developed to ensure that our Defence Forces have the major equipment platforms, ancillary equipment and force protection equipment to carry out their important roles both at home and overseas. The current position regarding the major equipment platform projects is as follows.</p>  <p>  The Equipment Planning process recognises the need to maintain and upgrade military capabilities having regard to emerging operational requirements and changes in technology and this is an ongoing process. </p>  <p>  The mid-life upgrade of the Army&rsquo;s fleet of 80 Mowag Piranha III armoured personnel carrier vehicles is well underway and is due to be completed by 2023. In addition, orders for an additional 30 Armoured Utility Vehicles (AUVs) are nearing completion with the final 4 due for delivery during 2022. These vehicles will more than double the existing fleet and will provide a level of protected mobility between the levels of soft-skinned light transport and heavier armoured vehicles. </p>  <p>  There is also continuous investment in the non-armoured vehicle fleet.  In 2019, a contract was signed with Toyota Ireland for the replacement of the Army's fleet of 3/4 tonne 4X4 vehicles.  To date 210 vehicles have been delivered with the remaining 70 expected in 2022. In March 2020, a tender process was completed for the supply of one hundred and twenty (120) new 4X4 Troop Carrying Vehicles, with 60 delivered to date. A further 30 are scheduled to be delivered in 2022 and all 120 vehicles concluding by 2023. A scheduled vehicle replacement programme is also currently underway for the replacement of 22 heavy logistics vehicles between 2022 and 2025.   </p>  <p>  In addition to the above mentioned major capital programmes, the entire Defence Forces fleet undergoes ongoing review and replacement as required. As a result, an additional 120 vehicles of varying types will be delivered in 2022. </p>  <p>  In relation to air-based capability, my immediate priorities have been the acquisition of three Pilatus PC-12 aircraft in the Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance (ISTAR) role and to acquire two Airbus C295 maritime patrol aircraft.  An additional PC-12 was also acquired in 2020 in response to the Covid 19 situation. </p>  <p>  The White Paper provides for the replacement of the two CASA 235 maritime patrol aircraft with consideration to be given to their replacement with larger more capable aircraft which would enhance maritime surveillance and provide a greater degree of utility for transport and cargo carrying tasks. A contract for the supply of two C295 Maritime Patrol Aircraft was signed with Airbus Defence and Space in December 2019, with delivery of the aircraft expected in 2023.  Some &euro;276 million, including VAT, has been committed to the acquisition of all of these enhanced capabilities, with delivery of the aircraft expected in 2023. </p>  <p>  The Naval Service Vessel Renewal and Replacement Programme is ongoing, this programme includes radar and other equipment upgrades along with the replacement of Naval Service Reserve motor launches. The programme of works for the midlife refit and upgrade of L&Eacute; R&oacute;is&iacute;n has been completed, while works are ongoing on L&Eacute; Niamh. Marine Advisors have been appointed to support the procurement of multi-role vessel to replace the flagship, L&Eacute; Eithne, with work underway that will inform a public tender competition in due course. Two Inshore Patrol Vessels have been purchased from the New Zealand Government to replace L&Eacute; Orla and L&Eacute; Ciara, it is expected these vessels will be transported to Ireland in 2023 following the completion of a programme of works.</p>  <p>  The examples given, whilst not exhaustive, demonstrate my commitment to update and upgrade the Defence Forces equipment and capability, within the financial envelope available. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Government established an independent Commission on the Defence Forces in December 2020. The work of the Commission encompasses the consideration of appropriate military equipment capabilities, structures and staffing, and their report will inform decisions regarding the future development of the Defence Forces.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Defence Forces have a modern and effective range of equipment which is line with best international standards, to enable them to meet operational requirements.</p></reply>

LOA 1 is essentially proceeding as we are at present and trying to move back to a full establishment figure of 9,500. The Commission has concluded that this would leave the Defence Forces unable to mount a credible defence of the State. LOA 2 would address specific priority gaps to improve on-island and overseas capabilities. LOA 3, would bring Ireland in line with other small neutral European countries in terms of spend. I am on the record as saying that LOA 2 is the minimum that we should aim for. This level of ambition will require an additional 2000 personnel beyond the establishment figure of 9,500 and an increase in the defence budget of some 50%.  The Defence Forces are responsible for recruitment and I have requested them to examine their recruitment practices and structures to facilitate this increase in numbers.</p>  <p>  This Commission report also includes, inter alia, consideration of issues relating to training, facilities, recruitment and retention and, following relevant consultation, I will revert to Government with a proposed response to the Commission's recommendations and a high-level action plan, which will set out proposed timelines and oversight arrangements for its implementation.</p>  <p>  In the interim, my focus remains on restoring all branches of the Defence Forces to the current agreed strength and in that context, there are a number of initiatives which are presently being implemented to counter ongoing staffing challenges.</p></reply>

Training and Education remain central to capability development and are key elements of the five pillars of the Defence Capability Framework. Through the provision of military capability, the Defence Forces achieves its mission to defend Ireland and its assigned interests internationally.</p>  <p>  The primary focus of the Defence Forces, when not engaged on operations, is training and preparation. The appropriate training for all Defence Forces Formations and Units is based on conventional military doctrine to prepare them for the roles laid down by Government. The Defence Forces deliver military programmes and modules of training meeting national and international standards encompassing both academic and military best practice. The Defence Forces also engage with external national and international educational institutions, both military and civilian, to ensure that Defence Forces training is in line with international best practice.</p>  <p>  Adherence to such international best practice ensures the levels of modernisation, transformation and interoperability required for the Defence Forces to deploy successfully on peacekeeping missions. NATO has become the standard-setting organisation for modern military forces and NATO standards include a wide-ranging set of specifications including detailed training standards and operational procedures. The continued participation by Ireland in NATO&rsquo;s Partnership For Peace mechanism ensures that the Defence Forces have the necessary interoperable capabilities to participate in modern demanding peacekeeping operations alongside other European Military Forces, including those from like-minded states.</p></reply>

The principal role of the Reserve is to augment the PDF in crisis situations. As such, the RDF undertakes training in preparation to assist the PDF when required.</p>  <p>  The scheduling of training in the Defence Forces, including the Reserve, is underpinned by an analysis of training needed to meet operational output requirements and capability development needs. Members of the Army Reserve (AR) and Naval Service Reserve (NSR) are volunteers who undertake training in their spare time. In order to facilitate the voluntary nature of Reserve Service and to maximise attendance of Reserve personnel, training continues to be organised both in and out of normal working hours, at weekends and during academic and traditional holiday periods. </p>  <p>  The current budget for the RDF is &euro;2.150m, of which &euro;2.068m is allocated to paid training, which provides for seven days annual paid training for each effective member of the AR and NSR. The budget also provides for fourteen days paid training for all additional personnel recruited, along with career and specialist courses for selected members of the Reserve in line with Reserve priorities. This provision is sufficient having regard to the existing strength of the RDF and the voluntary nature of Reserve training. </p>  <p>  RDF recruits undergo varied training in areas such as combat first aid, military law and tactical training. A major part of Recruit training is in the use of the Steyr 5.56mm Assault Rifle. After recruit training is complete, personnel are then trained in the operation of basic radio communications, map reading, Nuclear, Biological &amp;amp; Chemical warfare defence and the Light Machine Gun. Each Corps also carries out specialist training in its particular field. For example, the Infantry and Cavalry Corps train in weapons and tactics and the Corps of Engineers train in engineering tasks, such as demolition, construction and mine warfare.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that members of the AR and NSR are afforded the opportunity to avail of training and update their skills on an ongoing basis and that the extensive and professional training provided to the Reserve is a major motivating factor.   </p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy will be aware that the recently published Commission on the Defence Forces contained a number of recommendations on the role and structure of the Reserve Defence Forces. These, in line with the totality of the recommendations are currently under deliberation.</p></reply>

This is to enable the Defence Forces to carry out the roles assigned by Government, as set out in the White Paper on defence. Equipment priorities for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service are being considered in the context of the lifetime of the White Paper on defence as part of the capability development and equipment development planning, EDP, process. Further additions to the equipment development plan are under consideration.</p>  <p>  The Department of Defence has received a capital allocation under the national development plan of &euro;566 million over the 2022 to 2025 timeframe. Within that capital allocation, the defence annual capital budget for 2022 is &euro;141 million. Over recent years the capital budget has also been augmented through the reallocation of a pay underspend within the Defence Vote. </p>  <p>  The Naval Service Vessel Renewal and Replacement Programme is ongoing, this programme includes radar and other equipment upgrades along with the replacement of Naval Service Reserve motor launches. The programme of works for the midlife refit and upgrade of L&Eacute; R&oacute;is&iacute;n has been completed, while works are ongoing on L&Eacute; Niamh. Marine Advisers have been appointed to support the procurement of multi-role vessel to replace the flagship, L&Eacute; Eithne, with work underway that will inform a public tender competition in due course. Two Inshore Patrol Vessels have been purchased from the New Zealand Government to replace L&Eacute; Orla and L&Eacute; Ciara, it is expected these vessels will be transported to Ireland in 2023 following the completion of a programme of works.</p>  <p>  The Naval Service is equipped with a various surveillance equipment in order to undertake the roles assigned by Government, including certain capabilities that allow for underwater search and surveying, for example, an underwater remotely operated vehicle, ROV, and a magnetometer system. As part of the ongoing development of capabilities, further capabilities that will enhance the Naval Service&rsquo;s under-sea situational awareness, such as multibeam echo sounder systems, are also being developed.  </p>  <p>  The Government established an independent Commission on the Defence Forces in December 2020.  The work of the Commission encompassed the identification of appropriate capabilities, structures and staffing and their report will inform decisions regarding the future development of the Defence Forces. The Commission's recommendations are currently being considered.</p></reply>

The EDP builds on the intentions set out in the White Paper in relation to equipment acquisition, modernisation and upgrade and has been developed to ensure that the Defence Forces have the major equipment platforms, ancillary equipment and force protection equipment to carry out their important roles both at home and overseas. </p>  <p>  The White Paper provides for the replacement of the two CASA 235 maritime patrol aircraft with consideration to be given to their replacement with larger more capable aircraft which would enhance maritime surveillance and provide a greater degree of utility for transport and cargo carrying tasks. A contract for the supply of two C295 Maritime Patrol Aircraft was entered into with Airbus Defence and Space in December 2019, with delivery of the aircraft expected in 2023.

The Defence Forces provide the fullest possible assistance to the appropriate Lead Department in the event of an emergency situation in its Aid to the Civil Authority role. </p>  <p>  At National level, representation on the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning, by both the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces, ensures the fullest coordination and cooperation in the event of an emergency and that the command structure within the Defence Forces is compatible with the requirements in this area. </p>  <p>  Major Emergency Plans have been developed by local and regional authorities and these plans identify the procedures for requesting assistance from the Defence Forces.</p>  <p>  The Defence Forces retains a wide range of specialist skills which can be deployed in such circumstances, including for a natural disaster or terrorist incidents. The Operations Directorate in Defence Forces Headquarters manages the necessary cross-service coordination in responding to both emergency and security issues. These arrangements have proved effective in all emergencies encountered to date.</p>  <p>  With regard to security threats, primary responsibility for the internal security of the State rests with the Department of Justice and Equality and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Among the roles assigned to the Defence Forces in the White Paper on Defence is the provision of Aid to the Civil Power (ATCP), which, in practice, means to provide assistance and support to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when requested to do so.  </p>  <p>  There is ongoing and close liaison between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces regarding security matters, including ATCP deployments and a wide variety of military training activities are specifically designed to counter or respond to possible security emergencies. Regular coordination and liaison meetings take place between the Defence Forces and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to ATCP issues. </p>  <p>  The full spectrum of Defence Forces personnel and equipment is available for deployment in response to any security and other emergencies that may arise. Within the Defence Forces, both the Ordnance Corps and the Army Ranger Wing specialise in providing an immediate response to emergency incidents that might require their highly specialised capabilities. The role of the Defence Forces in these situations is dependent on the nature of the incident and the type of assistance requested. </p>  <p>  The Defence Forces Alert System provides joint and coherent direction regarding responses to any potential national threat. This system ensures a quick, uniform and appropriate response to situations and enables the response to be phased, or brought to maximum effect as required. The readiness of Army, Air Corps and Naval Service personnel and assets are scalable in terms of size and timeliness, and can be adjusted to suit specific threats or situations.</p>  <p>  I can confirm that the Defence Forces keep their operational plans and response capabilities for dealing with a wide range of threats under constant review. It is my priority as Minister with responsibility for Defence to ensure that the operational capacity of the Defence Forces is maintained to the greatest extent possible to enable the Defence Forces to carry out their roles both at home and overseas. </p>  <p>  There is an ongoing requirement to consider whether the capabilities we maintain are appropriate, having regard to the security environment, the roles that we wish the Defence Forces to undertake, and likely risks. This is the work that the Commission on the Defence Forces were requested to undertake. The report of the Commission on the Defence Forces was published in February 2022. It is a substantial report running to over 180 pages and 69 main recommendations many of which have sub recommendations.  It recommends significant changes for the Defence Forces and Defence provision in Ireland. It covers high level Defence Forces structures, defence capabilities, organisation, culture and human resources, the Reserve Defence Force and funding.</p>  <p>  The Commission's report is being fully considered, in consultation with Ministerial colleagues and other stakeholders. The intent is to revert to Government with a proposed response and a high-level action plan in advance of the summer recess.</p></reply>

This is reflected in the Programme for Government, which states that this Government will develop inclusive and age appropriate curricula for RSE and Social, Personal and Health Education across primary and post-primary schools.</p>  <p>  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment was requested to conduct a review of RSE provision in Irish schools, focussing on a range of topics including healthy positive, sexual expression and relationships and LGBTQ+ matters. The NCCA published &ldquo;The Report on the Review of Relationships and Sexuality Education in primary and post-primary schools&rdquo; in December, 2019.</p>  <p>  This report resulted in the NCCA establishing two development groups, one for primary and one for post-primary, to oversee the work of developing an updated curriculum materials in this area and supporting the development of guidance material for schools. These groups have met frequently since their initial establishment.</p>  <p>  The immediate focus of the NCCA work has been on creating support materials for teachers as part of an Interim Guidance Toolkit. This Toolkit aims to support effective teaching and learning of SPHE/RSE and to deepen teachers' understanding and skills in addressing important and sensitive topics. </p>  <p>  The NCCA Toolkit is being expanded in 2022 to include further age and stage appropriate guidance for teachers on how to address these topics within the SPHE classroom. </p>  <p>  In tandem with this work, preparation for the broader redeveloping and updating of the SPHE curriculum has begun. Updated curricula will be developed for Primary, Junior Cycle and Senior Cycle.  </p>  <p>  A draft revised Junior Cycle specification is due to be agreed at NCCA Council in early Summer, with a public consultation to follow. The final revised specification is due to be completed by the end of 2022. </p>  <p>  Preparation to update the Senior Cycle SPHE/RSE specification has commenced and it is intended that a meeting of the Senior Cycle development group will be convened in the next week. This group will prepare a background paper and brief which will form the basis of their work of redeveloping the Senior Cycle SPHE/RSE specification. </p>  <p>  Following publication of the Primary Curriculum Framework, expected in early 2023, NCCA will establish a development group for the curricular area of Well-being. Learning pertaining to RSE in primary school will be addressed within the curricular area of Well-being and the subjects of Physical and Health Education and Social, Personal and Values Education. This development group will work on the development of a specification for the curricular area and corresponding subjects. This advice will be developed through research, deliberation, consultation, and engagement with networks.  </p>  <p>  In redeveloping the SPHE curriculum, the NCCA will be making explicit the importance of fostering young people's self-awareness and self-esteem and building the foundational skills and dispositions needed for building caring and healthy relationships (including respectful communication, showing empathy, and appreciating difference). </p>  <p>  Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) Health and Well-being Advisers provide bespoke, tailored in-school support for RSE and SPHE in a range of ways that best suit the needs of the school. CPD for SPHE within the remit of the Junior Cycle for Teachers (JCT) support service is specifically informed by the NCCA Short Course in SPHE and the associated Assessment Guidelines. The content of the CPD is also informed by teacher feedback on the SPHE CPD provision. The PDST and JCT made a number of supports available to schools in the 2020/21 school year.</p>  <p>  In addition to this, I have recently announced my Department's intention to provide funding for a new postgraduate programme to upskill registered post-primary teachers teaching SPHE/RSE. </p>  <p>  This programme will provide a pathway for progression for post-primary teachers interested in developing their skills in teaching SPHE/RSE and in so doing build capacity and leadership within the teaching profession in relation to the teaching of SPHE/RSE. The intention to provide teachers with access to a new postgraduate course to be developed for teachers in post-primary schools teaching SPHE/RSE.

The Action Plan contains 12 actions that focus on the provision of support for schools, teacher training, research and awareness raising and aims to ensure that all forms of bullying are addressed.  A number of these actions have been implemented in full while others, which by their nature involve continuous action, are the subject of ongoing implementation. </p>  <p>  As part of the implementation of the Action Plan, anti-bullying procedures for all primary and post primary schools, which include a specific reference to cyberbullying, were published at the beginning of the 2013/14 school year. The procedures are designed to give direction and guidance to school authorities and school personnel in preventing and tackling school-based bullying behaviour amongst its pupils and in dealing with any negative impact within school of bullying behaviour that occurs elsewhere. They include specific requirements in relation to the use of prevention and education strategies and the consistent investigation, follow up and recording of bullying behaviour. </p>  <p>  Support and resources in the area of online safety and digital citizenship are provided by Webwise. Webwise promotes the autonomous, effective and safer use of the internet by young people through a sustained information and awareness strategy targeting school leaders, teachers, parents/guardians and learners themselves with consistent and relevant messages.  </p>  <p>  There are also extensive training and curricular supports, including through the Social Personal Health Education (SPHE) curriculum and the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST), to assist schools in the development of policies and practices on the safe use of the internet and on the prevention of bullying including cyber-bullying. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, in February of this year I established a Steering Committee to review the 2013 Action Plan on Bullying. This Steering Committee is chaired externally by Dr. Noel Purdy of Stranmillis University College in Antrim. </p>  <p>  This review involves significant consultation and collaboration across my Department, with other Government Departments and Bodies including the Ombudsman for Children, and also involves consultation with a broad range of education stakeholders, including parents and students, school management bodies and teacher and school staff unions. </p>  <p>  The review will take account of the significant developments and relevant research since the action plan was published in 2013. It will specifically consider cyber bullying, identity bullying and sexual harassment, among other areas. </p>  <p>  The review will also give detailed consideration to the recommendations contained in the Oireachtas Joint Committee Report on School Bullying and the Impact on Mental Health which was published last August. </p>  <p>  The Steering Committee consists of senior officials from the Department of Education, including the Inspectorate and the National Educational Psychological Service, representatives of the National Parents&rsquo; Council Primary, National Parents&rsquo; Council Post-Primary, Irish Second Level Students&rsquo; Union (ISSU), the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, the National Anti-bullying Research Centre in DCU and other external experts and representatives of advocacy organisations which include BelongTo, Webwise, Parentline National Traveller Women&rsquo;s Forum, Women&rsquo;s Aid and the Independent Living Movement Ireland. The Steering Committee has held five meetings to date.   </p>  <p>  The Anti-bullying procedures for Primary and Post Primary Schools will also be reviewed and updated in parallel with this work. A working group comprised of representatives from each of the relevant management bodies and teacher and school staff unions, along with representatives from the National Parents&rsquo; Council Primary, National Parents&rsquo; Council Post-Primary, Irish Second Level Students&rsquo; Union (ISSU) and the National Anti-bullying Research Centre in DCU has been established to review the anti-bullying procedures for schools. </p></reply>

It also acknowledges and harnesses the diversity of languages spoken in Irish primary schools.  It supports the introduction of modern foreign languages in senior classes, incrementally building on children&rsquo;s existing knowledge and awareness of language and progressing competency. </p>  <p>  The initial plan was for the consultation to take place between January and June of 2020. However, the impact of Covid required changes to be made with the data gathering ultimately taking place over two phases between February 2020 and March 2022. The data from the consultation is currently being analysed and will be reported on in the coming months. The Department will consider this report when available later in 2022.  </p>  <p>  Last year I invited expressions of interest from English-medium and Irish-medium primary and special schools to participate in a new language sampler module. The &lsquo;Say Yes to Languages&rsquo; sampler module allows schools identify a modern foreign language of their choice, or Irish Sign Language (ISL).  Schools are supported by Post-Primary Languages Ireland (PPLI) in providing a six-week sampler module across a range of additional languages including Irish Sign Language (ISL).</p>  <p>  This six-week sampler module is targeted at pupils in 3rd to 6th class for up to 1 hour per week within the normal school timetable. It is open to schools to participate on a voluntary basis. Schools will have the autonomy to determine the language they wish to introduce to the children and to secure a language tutor e.g. language teacher/language assistant from a post-primary school /a member of the school/wider community who is fluent in the target language.  </p>  <p>  PPLI have developed the module content in consultation with the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE). PPLI also provide a short online training programme for the language tutors identified by each school. There is additional training for schools management and class teachers who are hosting the module, should they wish to access it.  Delivery of the sampler module could be online or by way of a blended approach. PPLI are providing advice on sourcing language tutors/teachers.</p>  <p>  There was huge interest in the sampler module with 470 schools and some 40,000 pupils participating in the scheme in 2021/22 and 12 different languages have been selected including:  French, German, Irish Sign Language, Spanish, Italian, Mandarin Chinese, Lithuanian, Romanian, Polish, Portuguese, Arabic and Tamil.  A grant of up to &euro;1,000 has been provided to each participating school.</p>  <p>  The module  has now been extended for a second year 2022/23 and is currently open for applications from primary schools until May 25.  Details of the scheme are outlined in Circular 0028/2022: www.gov.ie/en/circular/88a1a-say-yes-to-languages-language-sampler-module-202223/.  The module will be extended to 8 weeks in 2022/23 and the grant will be increased to &euro;400 per classroom up to a maximum of &euro;1,600.</p>  <p>  The sampler module aims to: </p>  <p>  - Generate awareness among pupils of the range of languages used by their peers, including Irish Sign Language, in their schools and communities which may help support greater inclusion and appreciation of diversity in society</p>  <p>  - Encourage uptake of  languages at post-primary level </p>  <p>  - Provide opportunities for increased levels of collaboration among the school community with regard to the celebration of languages and cultures</p>  <p>  - Support implementation of Languages Connect, Ireland&rsquo;s Strategy for Foreign Languages in Education 2017 &ndash; 2026. </p>  <p>  The sampler module will also inform future developments in the area of language acquisition and development of the Primary Curriculum Framework. I would encourage primary and special schools to explore this opportunity to take part in this new module.</p>  <p>  Language classes may also be provided by primary schools through extra-curricular classes which are organised locally by schools.</p></reply>

This is reflected in the Programme for Government, which states that this Government will develop inclusive and age appropriate curricula for RSE and Social, Personal and Health Education across primary and post-primary schools.</p>  <p>  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment was requested to conduct a review of RSE provision in Irish schools, focussing on a range of topics including healthy positive, sexual expression and relationships and LGBTQ+ matters. The NCCA published &ldquo;The Report on the Review of Relationships and Sexuality Education in primary and post-primary schools&rdquo; in December, 2019.</p>  <p>  This report resulted in the NCCA establishing two development groups, one for primary and one for post-primary, to oversee the work of developing an updated curriculum materials in this area and supporting the development of guidance material for schools. </p>  <p>  The immediate focus of the NCCA work has been on creating support materials for teachers as part of an Interim Guidance Toolkit. This Toolkit aims to support effective teaching and learning of SPHE/RSE and to deepen teachers' understanding and skills in addressing important and sensitive topics. </p>  <p>  The NCCA Toolkit is being expanded in 2022 to include further age and stage appropriate guidance for teachers on how to address these topics within the SPHE classroom. </p>  <p>  In tandem with this work, preparation for the broader redeveloping and updating of the SPHE curriculum has begun. Updated curricula will be developed for Primary, Junior Cycle and Senior Cycle.  </p>  <p>  A draft revised Junior Cycle specification is due to be agreed at NCCA Council in early Summer. The final revised specification is due to be completed by the end of 2022.</p>  <p>  Preparation to update the Senior Cycle SPHE/RSE specification has commenced and it is intended that a meeting of the Senior Cycle development group will be convened in the next week. This group will prepare a background paper and brief which will form the basis of their work of redeveloping the Senior Cycle SPHE/RSE specification.  </p>  <p>  Following publication of the Primary Curriculum Framework, expected in early 2023, NCCA will establish a development group for the curricular area of Well-being. Learning pertaining to RSE in primary school will be addressed within the curricular area of Well-being and the subjects of Physical and Health Education and Social, Personal and Values Education. This development group will work on the development of a specification for the curricular area and corresponding subjects. This advice will be developed through research, deliberation, consultation, and engagement with networks.  </p>  <p>  In redeveloping the SPHE curriculum, the NCCA will be making explicit the importance of fostering young people's self-awareness and self-esteem and building the foundational skills and dispositions needed for building caring and healthy relationships (including respectful communication, showing empathy, and appreciating difference). </p>  <p>  Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) Health and Well-being Advisers provide bespoke, tailored in-school support for RSE and SPHE in a range of ways that best suit the needs of the school. CPD for SPHE within the remit of the Junior Cycle for Teachers (JCT) support service is specifically informed by the NCCA Short Course in SPHE and the associated Assessment Guidelines. The content of the CPD is also informed by teacher feedback on the SPHE CPD provision. The PDST and JCT made a number of supports available to schools in the 2020/21 school year.</p>  <p>  In addition to this, I have recently announced my Department's intention to provide funding for a new postgraduate programme to upskill registered post-primary teachers teaching SPHE/RSE. </p>  <p>  This programme will provide a pathway for progression for post-primary teachers interested in developing their skills in teaching SPHE/RSE and in so doing build capacity and leadership within the teaching profession in relation to the teaching of SPHE/RSE. The intention to provide teachers with access to a new postgraduate course to be developed for teachers in post-primary schools teaching SPHE/RSE. Schools and teachers will be supported to access the upskilling programme and course fees will be covered by Department funding.</p>  <p>  This programme will upskill registered post-primary teachers in SPHE/RSE.  In the course of the programme, it is intended that each participant will be provided with high quality pedagogical content knowledge and will be empowered to become an effective and enthusiastic teacher of this subject. The design and delivery of the programmes should recognise recent curricular and other reforms.</p>  <p>  My Department has recently engaged with higher education institutions (HEIs) and it is hoped that a number of HEIs will be interested in designing and developing an upskilling programme.</p>  <p>  The Request for Tender notice for the Provision of a Postgraduate NFQ Level 9 SPHE/RSE Programme for Post Primary Teachers was published on the etenders website last month and HEIs are required to submit tenders by 30th May. Any tenders received will then be reviewed by an evaluation panel and it is envisaged that a tender(s) could be awarded for the design and development of a programme during the summer.

Additionally, Project Ireland 2040 population and housing targets inform my Department's projections of school place requirements.</p>  <p>  Having considered the projected requirements in each school planning area, my Department then makes an assessment of the existing capacity within that particular area and its ability to meet any increased demand.  </p>  <p>  Where data indicates that additional provision is required at primary or post primary level, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:</p>  <p>  - Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Extending the capacity of a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Provision of a new school or schools.</p>  <p>  My Department's projections of post primary school place requirements in Lucan show an anticipated continued growth in enrolments in the short- to medium-term. </p>  <p>  However, in response to projected future need and to enrolment pressures in the area, my Department currently has 3 major projects underway for schools in this School Planning Area as follows:</p>  <p>  - St. Joseph&rsquo;s College Lucan &ndash; project at stage 2b &ndash; project is extension/refurbishment to cater for 1,000 pupils (current enrolment of 904 pupils in 2021/22)</p>  <p>  - Lucan Community College &ndash; project at stage 2b &ndash; project is extension/refurbishment to cater for 1,000 pupils (current enrolment of 926 pupils in 2021/22)</p>  <p>  - Griffeen Community College &ndash; project at stage 2b &ndash; project is new school for 1,000 pupils. There has also been additional interim accommodation approved for this school for 2022/23 (current enrolment of 286 pupils in 2021/22)</p>  <p>  While my Department is aware of increasing pressures and demand for additional school places in Lucan, it is important to note that where enrolment pressures arise, it may not be as a result of lack of accommodation but may be driven by the following factors:</p>  <p>  - Duplication of applications &ndash; pupils have applied for a place to a number of schools in the area</p>  <p>  - School of choice &ndash; pupils can&rsquo;t get a place in  their preferred school while there are places in other schools in the town/area</p>  <p>  - Some towns/areas have single sex schools and while places are available in the school they are not available to all pupils</p>  <p>  - External draw &ndash; pupils coming from outside the local area</p>  <p>  My Department is working to establish the true extent of any capacity issues through ongoing discussions with the relevant school authorities. In that context, similar to the process adopted in advance of the current academic year, my Department is engaging with patron bodies, including patrons of schools in Lucan, to identify particular capacity requirements for the forthcoming years which may necessitate further action to that already in train including, where required, the provision of modular accommodation solutions. </p>  <p>  I understand that principals of schools in the area have had a number of meetings to establish an overall picture of school place requirements for the next academic year.  My Department will continue to have close engagement with the relevant school patrons and authorities in order to monitor the situation and implement any solutions which may be required.</p>  <p>  Additionally, my Department will continue to work to advance the planned and current projects in Lucan and to ensure sufficient places for both mainstream provision and for pupils with special education requirements both for the coming academic year and into the future.</p>  <p>   It is the responsibility of my  Department  to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places in an area.  Parents can choose which school to apply to and where the school has places available the pupil should be admitted.</p>  <p>  It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of all schools to draft, publish and implement a school admission policy in accordance with the Education Acts 1998 to 2018. In schools where there are more applicants than places available a selection process may be necessary.  This may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in their school of first choice. </p>  <p>  The admission policy, including the selection criterion to be used where the school is oversubscribed, must comply with the Education Acts 1998 to 2018, be non-discriminatory and be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.</p>  <p>  Where a board of management make a decision to refuse admission, a parent/guardian can appeal that decision under section 29 of the Education Act, 1998, and an independent appeals committee will be appointed to consider the appeal. The role of the section 29 hearing committee is to examine the application for enrolment and consider if it was correctly processed by the school, in accordance with the school&rsquo;s Enrolment Policy. The section 29 appeals committee cannot consider matters that are not provided for within the school&rsquo;s Enrolment policy. If a parent/guardian considers that a school has erred in their processing of an enrolment application, a section 29 appeal committee can examine how the  application was processed by the school and identify if the school did not follow its Enrolment policy.  In cases where an error occurred the section 29 appeal committee will consider if the error had a material effect on the application. Where an error had a material effect on an enrolment application, the section 29 appeal committee can direct the school to enrol the student or adjust the students ranking on the waiting list.  My Department has no authority to compel a school to admit a student, except in circumstances where an appeal under section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 has been allowed and the appeals committee directs that the school admit the child concerned. </p>  <p>  A section 29 appeal must be made no later than 63 calendar days from the date of the school&rsquo;s decision to refuse admission.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that if refused admission is due to the school being oversubscribed, and the parent/guardian wishes to appeal this decision they must first make a written request to the school seeking a review of the board of management&rsquo;s decision.  This request for a review to the board of management is time bound and must be made within 21 calendar days from the date of the decision by the school to refuse admission to the child.</p>  <p>  If refused admission is for a reason other than the school being oversubscribed, a parent/guardian may, but are not required to, request a review by the board of management within 21 calendar days from the date of the decision by the school to refuse admission to the child.  Where a parent/guardian has been refused admission for a reason other than the school being oversubscribed and chooses not  to seek a review by the board of management they may make an appeal to an independent appeals committee no later than 63 calendar days from the date of the school&rsquo;s decision to refuse admission.</p>  <p>  Full details on the section 29 appeals process for refused enrolment are available on the Gov.ie website at the links below:</p>  <p>  www.gov.ie/en/publication/8248c-appeals-in-relation-to-refusal-to-admit-a-student-due-to-a-school-being-oversubscribed/</p>  <p>  www.gov.ie/en/publication/31c4f-appeals-in-relation-to-refusal-to-admit-a-student-for-a-reason-other-than-the-school-being-oversubscribed/</p>  <p>   In addition, Tusla Education Support Services (TESS) the Educational Welfare Service  is the legal body which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school placement for their child.

In 2021 nearly 38,000 children availed of the summer programme, an increase of 60% from the previous year.</p>  <p>  A key objective of this year&rsquo;s scheme is to increase the number of schools offering the summer programme to their students. Steps have been taken to afford schools as much flexibility as possible, and to ease administrative requirements. This year there is provision to recruit newly qualified teachers graduating this summer as well as undergraduate student teachers who have registered with the Teaching Council under Route 5.</p>  <p>  To support and facilitate schools and principals with organising and running the programme, the 2022 Summer Programme allows principals to delegate these functions to other members of staff through the Overseer role and preparation hours. The Overseer and preparation roles provide an exciting personal opportunity for teachers to develop their leadership skills and experience with recognition at a whole-school level.</p>  <p>  Enhanced measures have been put in place to encourage participation of schools. These include:</p>  <p>  - A Centralised Application Process to reduce the administrative burden on schools.</p>  <p>  - Provision of funding to schools towards preparation and overseeing of the programmes.</p>  <p>  - Provision to recruit final year student teachers graduating this summer and Route 5 undergraduate student teachers.</p>  <p>  - Guidance, information and support provided to schools to help design and deliver the programmes.</p>  <p>  - Capitation Grant Funding provided to cover the running costs of the scheme, including enhanced capitation for special schools and classes.</p>  <p>  This year, for the first time, there will be an online claims system for schools to submit payments details for those staff taking part in the school based summer programme. This will provide for faster and more streamlined payments to staff.</p>  <p>  In addition, with the assistance of the National Association of Management Boards in Special Schools (NAMBSE), the Department and Inspectorate recently hosted a webinar for Special Schools and provided a presentation on the supports and benefits of running a school based summer programme. The presentation focused on the positive outcomes for students that participated in the 2021 programme.</p>  <p>  Participation in the scheme is voluntary and is therefore a matter for the Board of Management of a school whether or not it will participate in the programme in any given year. Furthermore, the Department cannot compel schools to participate in the programme. </p>  <p>  While the number of special schools and classes taking part has risen over the last 2 years we want to continue this growth in participation further. The Department will continue to work with all stakeholders to support parents in accessing summer provision and with schools to ensure that they have the resources and supports necessary to successfully run these programmes.</p></reply>

Budget 2022 provided an additional 620 new SET posts for allocation to primary and post primary schools in 2022/23.  This will bring the total number of SETs in the system to 14,385. </p><p>The SET Model represented a significant shift in the way that students with SEN are supported in mainstream classes.  Previously, students needing additional teaching support required a diagnosis in order to access support which caused delays in providing the support and also imposed a burden on both schools and parents. The change in policy was welcomed by both schools and parents. The Model is based on the principle that those students with the greatest need receive the most support.</p><p>The model encourages schools to support students with SEN in mainstream classes alongside their peers.  In fact most students with SEN are enrolled these classes. This approach is also consistent with the EPSEN Act.</p><p>When the SET model was introduced it was designed to be updated on a regular basis so as to distribute the total available resources across the school system based on profiled need. Because the level of student need may change in a school over time, some schools will gain under this distribution, with these gains balanced by equivalent reductions in schools where the model indicates reduced need. Re-profiling is the means of ensuring that new or increasing need in schools is met by transfer/redistribution of teaching resources from other schools whose need has reduced as shown by the model.</p><p>Schools are front-loaded with resources, based on each school&rsquo;s profile. The allocations to schools include provision to support all pupils in the schools, including where a child receives a diagnosis after the allocation is received by a school, or where there are newly enrolling pupils to the school. </p><p>Both the Department and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) are committed to ensuring that all schools are treated equally and fairly in the manner in which their school profiles have been calculated.</p><p>Accordingly, a number of review processes have been put in place to support schools.</p><p>A process is in place to address circumstances where the school profile significantly changed following the allocation process e.g. a developing school where the net enrolment numbers significantly increased.</p><p>The criteria for qualification for mainstream school developing school posts are set out in the Primary and Post Primary School Staffing Schedule for the 2022/23 school year.</p><p>Schools who qualify for additional mainstream developing school posts in accordance with these criteria also qualify for additional Special Education Teaching Allocations to take account of this developing status. </p><p>It is also acknowledged that there are some circumstances, which may arise in schools, which fall outside the allocations for developing school status. </p><p>These relate to exceptional or emergency circumstances which could not have been anticipated e.g. where the school profile changes very significantly, or where other exceptional circumstances have arisen in a school and which may require a review of schools capacity to provide additional teaching support for all pupils who need it in the school, or of their utilisation of their allocations.</p><p>A process is available where schools can seek a review of their allocations by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), including the utilisation of their allocations, in circumstances where a school considers that very exceptional circumstances have arisen subsequent to the development of the profile. </p><p>If a school wishes to make an exceptional needs review appeal they may do so at the following link: ncse.ie/for-schools</p></reply>

Updated guidance for schools on Practical Steps for the Deployment of Good Ventilation Practices in Schools was provided at the end of May following the work of an expert group that carefully considered the role of ventilation in managing COVID-19. The updated guidance for schools is also fully in line with the most recent guidance on non-healthcare building ventilation during COVID-19, published by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre November 2021. </p>  <p>  To provide additional support in the context of Covid-19 the payment of a minor works grant totalling &euro;45m for primary schools and special schools, plus a once-off Covid-19 minor works funding of &euro;17m for post-primary schools, was issued in December 2021. All recognised schools in the free scheme have received their grants and had the discretion to use the grant to meet their needs.</p>  <p>  Given that each school setting is different, individual schools are best placed to decide how best to use this funding to address their particular needs. Specialist advice/assistance of a Chartered Engineer or Registered Architect is an important source of support for schools.  This will help ensure that appropriate solutions are being put in place to address ventilation issues including advice on whether a HEPA Air Cleaner Unit is required to deal with a poorly ventilated room.  There is no one solution that fits all scenarios, each application requires bespoke analysis and selection of the appropriate unit(s) matched to the specific room size and volume. </p>  <p>  Air cleaning devices are not a substitute for good ventilation but can be considered pending the completion of interventions/works where poor ventilation persists. This is line with the Expert Group recommendations. Air filtration does not negate the need for natural ventilation and opening windows as required. Furthermore Mike Ryan of the World Health Organisation&rsquo;s Health Emergencies Programme has advised that schools not rely solely on air filters.</p>  <p>  In the case where a school has difficulty engaging a Chartered Engineer or Registered Architect the Department can assist, with a dedicated ventilation team  available to support school principals in this regard.  Schools that identify inadequate ventilation in a room can utilise their minor work grant or apply for emergency works grant assistance to address ventilation enhancements where the minor work grant does not cover the full cost of the works required.</p>  <p>  Outside of the minor works grant funding to date 27 schools have applied for additional funding under the emergency works scheme to assist with ventilation. Of these, 15 have been approved, 1 was returned to the school to review the scope of the application, 2 were incorrectly classified as ventilation related and assessed separately, 7 were rejected as the application form was not fully completed and 2 are currently being assessed by a member of the Department&rsquo;s technical team. None of the 15 approved identified a need for an air filter.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-05-12a.649.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1472" speakername="Josepha Madigan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022051200077#WRP02800"><p>Earlier this month, the Government announced this year's Summer Programme to allow all primary and post-primary schools to offer a summer programme for students with complex special educational needs and those at greatest risk of educational disadvantage. </p>  <p>  The programme aims are to support pupils to maintain their connection with education, to build their confidence and increase their motivation, promote well-being and for those who are at key transition stages, helping to ensure they continue their education journey in September either in school or in further/higher education or training.</p>  <p>  Building on the 2021 programme, all primary and post primary schools can offer a summer programme and in line with last year&rsquo;s funding, there is up to &euro;40 million available to provide for this year&rsquo;s programme. In 2021 nearly 38,000 children availed of the summer programme, an increase of 60% from the previous year.</p>  <p>  While, it is critically important to support a summer based programme in our special schools and special classes, it is also essential to ensure that the children with complex special educational needs (SEN) who are in our mainstream settings also have access to this critical support.  At the time when the &lsquo;July Provision&rsquo; was established, the concert of learning loss during school holidays was something which may have been considered to impact only those students in special schools and special classes. As our system has become more inclusive and many of these children with more complex needs now attend mainstream settings, it is recognised that they too will be impacted by school holidays and require that additional support to ensure they achieve their potential.</p>  <p>  A key objective of this year&rsquo;s scheme is to increase the number of schools offering the summer programme to their students. Steps have been taken to afford schools as much flexibility as possible, and to ease administrative requirements. This year there is provision to recruit newly qualified teachers graduating this summer as well as undergraduate student teachers who have registered with the Teaching Council under Route 5.</p>  <p>  To support and facilitate schools and principals with organising and running the programme, the 2022 Summer Programme allows principals to delegate these functions to other members of staff through the Overseer role and preparation hours. The Overseer and preparation roles provide an exciting personal opportunity for teachers to develop their leadership skills and experience with recognition at a whole-school level.</p>  <p>  Enhanced measures have been put in place to encourage participation of schools. These include:</p>  <p>  - A Centralised Application Process to reduce the administrative burden on schools.</p>  <p>  - Provision of funding to schools towards preparation and overseeing of the programmes.</p>  <p>  - Provision to recruit final year student teachers graduating this summer and Route 5 undergraduate student teachers.</p>  <p>  - Guidance, information and support provided to schools to help design and deliver the programmes.</p>  <p>  - Capitation Grant Funding provided to cover the running costs of the scheme, including enhanced capitation for special schools and classes.</p>  <p>  This year, for the first time, there will be an online claims system for schools to submit payments details for those staff taking part in the school based summer programme. This will provide for faster and more streamlined payments to staff.</p>  <p>  In addition, with the assistance of the National Association of Management Boards in Special Schools (NAMBSE), the Department and Inspectorate recently hosted a webinar for Special Schools and provided a presentation on the supports and benefits of running a school based summer programme. The presentation focused on the positive outcomes for students that participated in the 2021 programme.</p>  <p>  While the number of special schools and classes taking part has risen over the last 2 years, we want to continue this growth in participation further. The Department will continue to work with all stakeholders to support parents in accessing summer provision and with schools to ensure that they have the resources and supports necessary to successfully run these programmes. </p>  <p>  It is acknowledged that not all schools will be in a position to provide a school-based programme, so a home-based programme continues to be available for students with complex needs where the school-based programme is unavailable.</p></reply>

In that regard, as part of the annual demographic exercises, my Department engages with each of the local authorities to obtain the up-to-date information on significant new residential development in each area.  This is necessary to ensure that schools infrastructure planning is keeping pace with demographic changes.</p>  <p>  The most recent analysis undertaken by my Department projects that over 90% of the 314 school planning areas at primary level show decreasing enrolments for the period to 2025 compared with 2021, whereas some 88% of school planning areas at post-primary level are anticipated to have increased enrolments for the period to 2028, with most expected to reach a peak in the next two or three years. </p>  <p>  Where demographic data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, be provided through: </p>  <p>  - Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Extending the capacity of a  school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Provision of a new school or schools.    </p>  <p>  The requirement for additional school places in County Kildare school planning areas is kept under on-going review.  Additionally, my Department will continue to liaise with the local Council in respect of its review of the Development Plan with a view to identifying any potential long-term school accommodation requirements and in this regard will be making a submission to the draft Co. Kildare Development Plan 2023-2029 which is currently at public consultation stage.  New schools are established by my Department on the basis of identified demographic demand in an area, and only after consideration of the capacity of existing schools to absorb the expected school place demand.</p></reply>

When the NCSE sanction a special class in a school, the school can apply to my Department for capital funding to re-configure existing spaces within the school building to accommodate the class or to construct additional accommodation. Similarly, where special schools wish to expand provision, the school can apply to my Department for capital funding to accommodate additional placements.</p>  <p>  The NCSE has additionally provided my Department with projections of future requirements for classes for students with special education requirements. These are informing my Department's advance planning for special class accommodation.</p>  <p>  This advance planning is building on the significant work to date in delivering additional classrooms for students with special education needs.  Such classrooms for pupils with special education needs are included as standard in the accommodation brief for new school buildings and major extension projects, unless local circumstances indicate that they will not be required. Typically, two classrooms for pupils with special education needs are provided in new primary schools and four classrooms are provided in new 1,000 pupil post primary schools, with pro-rata provision for schools of other sizes.  </p>  <p>  My Department has a large pipeline of projects for delivery under the school building programme. The main elements of this pipeline currently involve in excess of 1,300 school building projects for delivery under the Department&rsquo;s Large Scale and Additional Accommodation Scheme. These projects are currently in progress across the various stages of planning, design, tender and construction. Most of these projects are expected to be either under construction or completed in the period up to 2025 and are being progressed as quickly as possible. There are currently in excess of 250 school building projects at construction (on site) with a continuous stream of other projects at or near the tendering stage.  It is anticipated that 150 to 200 school building projects will be completed annually during the 2022 to 2025 period.</p>  <p>  The current status of approved projects is listed on a county by county basis on www.gov.ie and is updated on a monthly basis to reflect their progress through the various stages. </p>  <p>  The Special Education Teaching allocation provides a single unified allocation for special educational support teaching needs to each school, based on each school&rsquo;s educational profile.</p>  <p>  Under the allocation model, schools have been provided with a total allocation for special education needs support based on their school profile. </p>  <p>  The provision of a profiled allocation is designed to give a fair allocation for each school which recognises that all schools need an allocation for special needs support, but which provides a graduated allocation which takes into account the level of need in each school. </p>  <p>  Schools are front-loaded with resources, based on each school&rsquo;s profile. The allocations to schools include provision to support all pupils in the schools, including where a child receives a diagnosis after the allocation is received by a school, or where there are newly enrolling pupils to the school. </p>  <p>  Both the Department and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) are committed to ensuring that all schools are treated equally and fairly in the manner in which their school profiles have been calculated.</p>  <p>  The Special Needs Assistant (SNA) scheme is designed to provide schools with additional adult support staff who can assist children with special educational needs who also have additional and significant care needs.  Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.</p>  <p>  SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. </p>  <p>  It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-05-12a.692.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022051200078#WRQ02500"><p>As the Deputy may be aware, for school planning purposes, my Department divides the country into 314 school planning areas and utilises a Geographical Information System (GIS) and statistical modelling to anticipate school place demand. Information from a range of sources, including Child Benefit data, school enrolment data and information on residential development activity is used for this purpose. Additionally, Project Ireland 2040 population and housing targets inform my Department's projections of school place requirements. </p>  <p>  Having considered the projected requirements, my Department then makes an assessment of the existing school accommodation capacity within that particular area and its ability to meet any increased demand.  A national inventory of school capacity, which utilises information from schools&rsquo; annual returns, is maintained by my Department and is supplemented by data on enrolment trends at individual schools as well as other indicators of potential capacity.  My Department&rsquo;s GIS is a critical tool in assessing such data in support of strategic planning for school accommodation needs.  The GIS facilitates the geospatial analysis of capacity relative to school place demand and the customised reporting of data at local, regional and national levels. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, at primary level national enrolments peaked in 2018 and are projected to decline by over 120,000 by 2033, as outlined in my Department&rsquo;s statistical report of November 2021: &ldquo;Projections of full-time enrolment Primary and Second Level 2021-2040&rdquo;.  In that same report it can be seen that post primary enrolments are forecast to peak in 2024 and then decline thereafter to 2039, by circa 90,000 places.  Although these projections do not account for arriving Ukrainian students, it is clear that at a national level there will be increasing levels of capacity within our existing schools infrastructure.  While local and regional variations will, of course, be relevant, the use of such capacity - to meet the needs of Ukrainian children in the first instance - will be an important element in my Department&rsquo;s strategic planning for capital investment in our schools. In this regard, a capacity survey at post-primary level has indicated available capacity of the order of 20,000 school places.  There is also very good capacity at primary level given the downward trend in demographics and this will be analysed at an individual school and town/area level when a capacity survey of special schools and primary schools is undertaken at end May/early June 2022.    </p>  <p>  Where the geospatial assessment of demand and capacity in an area indicates that additional provision is required my Department considers the options of extending the capacity of a school or schools, or of providing a new school or schools.  The timing and duration of the accommodation need is also considered in determining the optimum accommodation solution &ndash; for example a short-term accommodation requirement does not require a long-term accommodation solution. </p>  <p>  Separately, where a school considers that it has a requirement for additional mainstream or special education needs accommodation it is open to the school authority to apply under my Department&rsquo;s Additional School Accommodation (ASA) scheme.  The assessment of such applications is also informed by a geospatial analysis of demand and capacity in the relevant area, and a consideration of the timing and duration of the need.  The level of capacity in an individual school or in neighbouring schools is relevant when decisions on enrolment are being made.  It is important that capacity across a town or area is fully utilised before additional accommodation is approved.  </p>  <p>  While the main focus of resources over the last decade has been on provision of additional capacity to cater for increasing demographics, under Project Ireland 2040 there will be an increasing focus on the upgrade and refurbishment of the existing school stock. My Department is at the forefront of design with respect to sustainable energy in school buildings and this performance has been recognised at both National and International level with sustainable energy awards for excellence in Design and Specification. My Department&rsquo;s Technical Guidance Documents set the benchmark for sustainable design in school buildings with a clear focus on energy efficiency and they are based on solid energy research projects. Schools that are designed and built in accordance with the Department&rsquo;s schools technical guidance documents have been achieving A3 Building Energy Ratings since 2009 with current schools typically achieving up to 20% higher performance than required by the current Building Regulations, along with 10% of primary energy provided via photovoltaics and infrastructure provision for electric vehicle charging.  </p>  <p>  My Department and the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications established a jointly funded pathfinder programme with the SEAI, testing and demonstrating energy efficiency and decarbonisation retrofit approaches. This pathfinder is a great example of collaboration ensuring the deployment of new design approaches and technologies are introduced to the educational environment on an evidence based approach. This Pathfinder programme is paving the way for, and informing, a much larger national schools&rsquo; programme for the energy retrofit of schools built prior to 2008 as included in the National Development Plan. It is facilitating research on a range of typical retrofit options, which will have been tried and tested. It is providing valuable development information for a solution driven delivery strategy which will be founded on a solid evidence base that has proven the robustness and scalability of renewable solutions within the schools&rsquo; sector. The longer-term outcome of the pathfinder will be to create an accurate and scalable model for energy efficient retrofits of schools across Ireland. The deep energy retrofit programme for schools built prior to 2008 is due to be rolled out as included in the National Development Plan.   </p>  <p>  My Department has a large pipeline of projects for delivery under the school building programme to cater for current and future educational demands.  The pipeline of projects is kept under continual review to ensure alignment with Project Ireland 2040 objectives. Good progress continues to be made with the rollout of projects, and the current status of projects being delivered is listed in tabular format, on a county by county basis, on the Department&rsquo;s website at www.gov.ie and is regularly updated. </p></reply>

In the current school year over 121,400 children, including over 15,500 children with special educational needs, are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;289m in 2021.  </p>  <p>  Under the terms of the School Transport Schemes children are eligible for transport at primary level where they reside not less than 3.2 kms from and are attending their nearest national school, and at post primary level where they reside not less than 4.8 kms from and are attending their nearest post primary school/education centre as determined by the Department/Bus &Eacute;ireann, having regard to ethos and language.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Department commenced a review of the School Transport Scheme in February 2021. The review is being conducted with a view to examining the current scheme and how it currently operates, its broader effectiveness and sustainability and that it adequately supports the provision of services to students and their families. </p>  <p>  The review encompasses the School Transport Scheme for Children with Special Educational Needs and the Primary and Post-Primary School Transport Schemes in terms of how each element of the schemes currently operate, to include eligibility criteria, trends, costs and cost drivers, and overall effectiveness in meeting the objectives of the schemes.  The review will also examine the potential for integration of different strands of the scheme and a more co-ordinated approach with other Government Departments that also use transport services.  </p>  <p>  Following commencement of this review the Steering Group presented me with an initial interim report on eligibility with an examination of issues for mainstream pupils relating to the nearest and next nearest school.  Following consideration of this report, I approved the extension of temporary alleviation measures for the 2021/22 school year for transport for post-primary students who were otherwise eligible for school transport but were attending their second nearest school and had applied and paid on time.   </p>  <p>  Wider considerations relating to operation of the scheme are now taking place in the next phase of the review which is currently underway.  Decisions in regard to measures for the 2022/23 school year will be made shortly.  The Steering Group will continue to report to me on an interim basis as the review progresses.</p></reply>

The most recent survey results in relation to the 2021 survey were published by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) on 6 May 2022. </p>  <p>  It is welcome that the national rate of child poverty, which is based on consistent poverty, decreased significantly, from 7.2% in SILC 2020 to 5.2% in SILC 2021. There were also decreases in the At Risk of Poverty rate for children from 16.4% in 2020 to 13.6% in 2021, and the Basic Deprivation rate from 18.9% in 2020 to 17.0% in 2021.  </p>  <p>  Poverty data is not available at county level, only at a regional level. Data in relation to County Clare would be included in the data for the Southern region.  However, child poverty data at regional level is not readily available on the CSO website.  The issue of producing poverty statistics is a matter for the CSO.   </p>  <p>  Addressing child poverty is a Government priority. The Roadmap for Social Inclusion 2020-2025 notes that no child in Ireland should live in poverty and that, where it happens due to adverse circumstances, available supports should ensure that the child and their family exit poverty as soon as is possible. The Roadmap highlights the importance of both income supports and access to services, particularly to basic essential services such as housing, health and education, in addressing poverty and social exclusion.  </p>  <p>  Budget 2022 included a range of measures to support families and children including increases to all core weekly payments and to the qualified child rates; an increase in the weekly income threshold for the Working Family Payment for all family sizes; an increase in the Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance for older and younger children; and the extension of the Hot School Meals programme.</p></reply>

However, in 2012 the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) developed a measure which defined food poverty as the inability to have an adequate and nutritious diet due to issues of affordability or accessibility. This measure is derived using data collected as part of the annual Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC). For 2020, the achieved sample size for SILC was 4,243 households and 10,683 individuals. </p><p>Using this approach food poverty is measured by the percentage of individuals experiencing one of more of the following:</p><p>1. Unable to afford a meal with meat, or vegetarian equivalent, every second day. This indicator suggests severe food deprivation, and is one of the 11 deprivation items used for the consistent poverty measure.</p><p>2. Unable to afford a weekly roast dinner (or vegetarian equivalent). This indicator refers to the affordability of food, and in addition, the affordability of a cultural norm. While reference to a weekly roast may seem outdated, the indicator refers to those who cannot afford this. This item is also one of the 11 deprivation items used for the consistent poverty measure.</p><p>3. Missing one substantial meal in the last fortnight due to lack of money. This item, in its reference to the affordability of food, but not the quality or adequacy of it, refers to severe food deprivation. This item is not one of the 11 deprivation items used for the consistent poverty measure. Also, it is asked of all respondents over 16 years of age whereas the other deprivation items are asked at a household level.</p><p><b>Table 1: Percentage of the population experiencing food poverty</b> <table>    <tr>       <th></th>       <th>2014</th>       <th>2015</th>       <th>2016</th>       <th>2017</th>       <th>2018</th>       <th>2019</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Food poverty rate (%)</td>       <td>13.1</td>       <td>12.2</td>       <td>9.8</td>       <td>8.7</td>       <td>7.0</td>       <td>7.4</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The most recent Survey of Income and Living Conditions data was published by the CSO last week (6 May 2022) which will enable the calculation of the most recent rate of food poverty based on these indicators. </p></reply>

The group met on four occasions in 2021 and has met twice this year to date. The group has focused on two pieces of work to date.  The first is a high-level mapping exercise of programmes, services and supports across Government that address food poverty and provide supports in this area. </p><p>The second piece of work is the development of a research proposal. The group is aware that extensive research into food poverty exists, and any upcoming research and events are discussed at Food Poverty Working Group meetings.

Broadly speaking, there are a range of known drivers of food poverty including: affordability; accessibility; sufficiency; and quality. However, this research aims to identify the drivers of food poverty in each case study area and examine the range of service providers and actors relating to food poverty in each area. It should also identify any gaps and overlaps in service provision.  The findings from this research should further inform the delivery of commitment 61 of the Roadmap for Social Inclusion.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-05-12a.733.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022051200079#WRR02100"><p>My Department provides a suite of income supports for those who are unable to work due to an illness or disability.  It is important to note that entitlement to these supports is generally not contingent on the nature of the illness or disability but on the extent to which a particular illness or disability impairs or restricts a person&rsquo;s capacity to work. Budgetary provision is not made in respect of any individual illness or disease.  </p>  <p>  In March 2020, under the Health (Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Act 2020 (No. 1) and subsequent regulations, the Government provided for entitlement to Illness Benefit for persons who have been diagnosed with Covid-19 or who are a probable source of infection with Covid-19. </p>  <p>  My Department has liaised with the Departments of Health and Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to these emergency provisions, which require a Government Order for continued effect.  </p>  <p>  The rate of payment of the enhanced Illness Benefit payment in respect of Covid-19 is higher than the normal maximum personal rate of illness benefit, for a limited period.  The enhanced rate is &euro;350 per week, with additional payments in respect of dependent adults and children. </p>  <p>  Expenditure on this payment amounted to almost &euro;57 million in the period March to December 2020 and to &euro;106 million in 2021.  Expenditure in 2022, to end-April, was over &euro;141 million.  </p>  <p>  The enhanced rate is  payable for a maximum of ten weeks for those diagnosed with Covid-19.  In a case where a person continues to be ill beyond 10 weeks, standard Illness Benefit may be paid for an extended period, based on the person&rsquo;s continued eligibility.  Illness Benefit is the primary income support payment for people who are unable to attend work due to illness of any type and who are covered by Pay Related Social Insurance contributions.  It is payable for up to two years, depending on satisfying the eligibility conditions. </p>  <p>  Apart from these income supports, my Department also provides means tested supports under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme for people who are ill but who do not qualify for Illness Benefit.  The Department may also make an exceptional needs payment to help meet essential, once-off expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet from their weekly income.     </p>  <p>  My Department keeps the range of income supports under review in order to make sure they meet their objectives.  Any changes to the current system would need to be considered in an overall policy and budgetary context. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

In the means test, both schemes have an income disregard of &euro;140 per week. In addition, 50% of earnings between &euro;140 and &euro;350 are also disregarded, i.e., 50% of earnings in this band are disregarded for the purpose of the means test. Earnings above &euro;350 are assessed in full.</p>  <p>  Budget 2022 measures, will see from June:</p>  <p>  - An increase in the upper disregard of &euro;25 per week, from &euro;350 to &euro;375 for both payments</p>  <p>  - An increase of &euro;5.10 being applied to the general weekly means disregard entry point for the Disability Allowance. This increase will bring the entry point of the weekly means disregard for Disability Allowance in line with that of the Blind Pension, at &euro;7.60 per week.</p>  <p>  There are a number of scholarships, such as those awarded by certain charitable organisations, which are not assessed as part of the means test for any social welfare payment.  These include payments under the 1916 Bursary Fund and under Higher Educational Scholarships for Adult Learners from Uversity, to a maximum of &euro;7,000 per annum.  Uversity is a registered charity that has been awarding Higher Education Scholarships to adult learners since 2018.  In addition disregards were introduced for persons in receipt of the Disability Allowance and Blind Pension who have been granted a bursary, stipend or scholarship towards completing a PhD in 2021/22. </p>  <p>  Legislation does not provide for a disregard for funding from grants for artists and as such, any awards made through these types of schemes are assessed as income in the means test.  </p>  <p>  Any proposed changes to the means test for schemes, would need to be considered in an overall budgetary and policy context.</p>  <p>  In addition to the age at which a person becomes eligible, there are a number of other differences between the Disability Allowance and Blind Pension schemes, for example, relating to aspects of the means test, taxation, access to the Free Travel Scheme and eligibility for concurrent payments.  </p>  <p>  With regards to capital in the assessment of means, my Department uses a formula, which is set out in legislation, to calculate a person's weekly means from capital.  For Blind Pension, and most other social assistance schemes, the formula is as follows: the first &euro;20,000 is fully disregarded, the next &euro;10,000 assessed at &euro;1 per thousand, the next &euro;10,000 is assessed at &euro;2 per thousand, with the remainder assessed at &euro;4 per thousand.  The capital assessment formula applying to Disability Allowance is unique in the social welfare system, in that the first &euro;50,000 is fully disregarded; the next &euro;10,000 assessed at &euro;1 per thousand, the next &euro;10,000 is assessed at &euro;2 per thousand, with the remainder assessed at &euro;4 per thousand.  (The &euro;50,000 capital disregard is being extended to the Carer's Allowance payment in June 2022.)</p>  <p>  Under Pathways to Work (2021 &ndash; 2025) the Government has committed to &ldquo;Review the current long-term disability payment schemes with a view to removing inconsistencies/anomalies and ensure that they recognise the continuum of disabilities and support employment.&rdquo; I would hope to bring forward proposals on this issue for public consultation later this year.</p></reply>

Particular priority is afforded to those on the lowest incomes and social welfare dependents through the special rate of maintenance grant.</p>  <p>  The means test arrangements of the student grant scheme are applied nationally.  In the case of both employed and self-employed applicants, gross income is assessed with certain specified social welfare and health service payments excluded.</p>  <p>  The Student Grant Scheme provides for different levels of income thresholds where families have (i) less than 4 dependent children (ii) between 4 and 7 dependent children and (iii) 8 or more dependent children. </p>  <p>  Also, in recognition of the additional cost to families where more than one person is attending college, an increment for each additional relevant person, can be applied to the income thresholds at the rates outlined in the student grant scheme. For 2022/23 academic year I have increased the maximum increment that can be applied for each additional family member attending college at the same time to &euro;4,950. In this way, the Student Grant Scheme is responsive to the individual circumstances of particular families.</p>  <p>  The decision on eligibility for a student grant is a matter, in the first instance, for the centralised student grant awarding authority SUSI (Student Universal Support Ireland) to determine. </p>  <p>  I intend to implement, in a phased way, the recommendations of the Student Grant Scheme review in the context of successive annual Estimates processes. However, this will be dependent on the availability of resources to this Department and overall consideration of Budgetary and Ministerial priorities. I intend to publish, during the Summer in advance of each year&rsquo;s Estimates process, a paper outlining potential options and impacts, to be considered in the Budgetary process, related to the Student Grant scheme and other programmes related to student supports and costs of higher education, including with respect to those priorities identified in the Student Grant Scheme Review. </p>  <p>  Apart from the Student Grant Scheme, students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Students can?be assisted towards their rent, childcare costs, transport costs and books/class materials. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the third level institution attended. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis. </p>  <p>  In addition, Tax Relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education. Further information on this tax relief is available from a student's local Tax Office or from the Revenue Commissioners website, www.revenue.ie.</p></reply>

Such appeals can be made by the appellant on line via www.studentgrantappeals.ie. </p>  <p>  In this particular case I have been informed by SUSI that in the 2020/2021 academic year the applicant appealed their adjacency and was advised that their appeal was not submitted within the required timeframe for an appeal (30 days from date of original decision plus additional 30 days if supporting reason for delay is accepted by Appeals team). It was determined that the appeal was received outside the 60 days and was, therefore, refused. In the 2021/2022 academic year the applicant was advised through the support desk in SUSI that if they were on placement in 21/22 academic year, they need to request a review and send in evidence of this.  To date SUSI has received no internal review request on 2021/22 academic year application.</p>  <p>  Maintenance grants under the Student Grant Scheme are awarded either at the non-adjacent rate or the adjacent rate, depending on the distance between the applicant&rsquo;s normal residence and the college attended. </p>  <p>  The adjacent rate of maintenance grant is payable in the case of students whose normal residence is 45km or less from the approved institution which he or she is attending. The non-adjacent rate of maintenance grant is payable in all other cases.</p>  <p>  The measurement of the distances relating to the award of adjacent or non-adjacent rates of student grant is a matter for the relevant grant awarding authority. The distance measurement for student grant rates is governed by Article 27(3)(a) and (b) of the Student Grant Scheme 2022. This provides that the relevant distance will be measured in line with agreed guidelines. </p>  <p>  The guidelines require that the shortest most direct route between the applicant's normal residence and the institution being attended should apply. In determining the shortest most direct route, the relevant awarding authority shall establish:</p>  <p>   -  the method for measuring a route;</p>  <p>   -  the factors to be taken into account in establishing and measuring a route. </p>  <p>  The qualifying distance criterion for students to qualify for the non-adjacent rate of grant has been reduced from 45km to 30km, effective from the start of the 2022/23 academic year.</p>  <p>  I have prioritised these changes for the 2022/23 academic year and they will benefit thousands of students building on the improvements that have already been made and have been a priority for me since taking up my Ministerial appointment.</p>  <p>  This Department also provides funding for the Student Assistance Fund (SAF). The fund is available in various publicly funded higher education institutions. The SAF provides financial assistance to students experiencing financial difficulties while attending third level. Students can be assisted towards their rent, childcare costs, transport costs and books/class materials. </p>  <p>  The SAF is open to both full and part-time registered students on courses of not less than one year's duration leading to an undergraduate or postgraduate qualification.  Further details of the fund is available from the Access Office in the higher education institution attended.  Further information on the SAF is available at www.studentfinance.ie.</p></reply>

Unfortunately, he had to leave his phase 2 off-the-job training in Sligo on 06/11/2020 due to an injury. Your constituent was subsequently called to complete his phase 2 off-the-job training in Finglas Training Centre on 04/01/2022. </p>  <p>  The rate of pay calculated was the phase 2 rate, which he will receive up until 13/05/2022. The calculation was explained to your constituent by the Authorised Officer in Finglas TC and the Officer has offered to meet with your constituent to explain this in more detail if he so wishes. In terms of parity with his peers, the same procedure is applied to all apprentices to determine their rate of pay. </p>  <p>  I will bring your criticisms of the time taken to return this response to the attention of SOLAS.

The information packs were also provided to Garda Diversity Officers (GDO) to promote awareness within minority communities in their areas. The Garda National Diversity Forum also supported these efforts.</p><p>I am advised that the GNDIU also conducted an information Webinar which included a Q&amp;amp;A with representatives from the Public Appointments Service<b>, </b>HR Competitions, Garda Probationers and Garda Interns, in which members of the Travelling Community participated. </p><p>Until this year, people applying to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na were required to have proven proficiency in two languages in order to join the Garda&iacute; &ndash; one of which was required to be English or Irish. That requirement has changed, and candidates are now only required to have one of these languages to enter An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We know that there are under-represented groups who are much less likely to have studied two languages, and the removal of the two language requirement takes away another barrier to entry for these groups. </p><p>I am pleased to say that there has been a very welcome increase in the number of people from the Traveller Community applying for a job with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with 43 applicants describing themselves as &lsquo;White Traveller&rsquo;, which is up from just 19 applicants in 2019. There was also as increase in people from people from other minority backgrounds. This is really important as it is essential that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is representative of the communities that it protects.</p><p>I am advised that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na does not record the ethnicity of Garda personnel and therefore the number recruited from the 2019 competition is not available.</p><p>- I would in conclusion like to advise the Deputy that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na launched the first Garda Diversity Internship last November, which is a first of its kind initiative for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The internship aims to increase the accessibility, understanding of, and potential for a career in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for school-leavers and graduates, particularly those from groups typically under-represented in the organisation. There are currently 29 interns employed on the programme on a full-time, short-term basis; 13 third level graduates and 15 recent school leavers. </p></reply>

Adults with full eligibility can access a range of services including GP services, prescribed drugs and medicines, all in-patient public hospital services in public wards, including consultants&rsquo; services, all out-patient public hospital services including consultants&rsquo; services, dental, ophthalmic and aural services and appliances, and maternity and infant care service.</p>  <p>  Persons with limited eligibility are eligible for in-patient and outpatient public hospital services including Consultant services, Emergency Department or minor injury care, are subject to certain charges. Other services such as allied healthcare professional services may also be made available to persons with limited eligibility. Where a person accesses private healthcare in Ireland there is no facility for the cost of that care to be reimbursed by the public health system.</p>  <p>  Regarding cataract waiting lists, the 2022 Waiting List Action Plan was launched on 25 February this year. The Plan allocates &euro;350 million to the HSE and National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to reduce waiting lists by 18 percent this year which will bring the number of people waiting to their lowest point in five years. Public hospitals will be supported by the NTPF in a number of different ways, including funding the operation of cataract clinics in the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital and in Nenagh General Hospital. While the NTPF will seek to arrange over 150 different types of procedures in public and private hospitals, covering the full range of complexity on the waiting lists, there will be a particular focus on 15 procedures which, prior to NTPF engagement, accounted for more than 50% of the inpatient/day case waiting list. For the 15 high volume procedures, including cataracts, the NTPF will offer treatment for all clinically suitable patients waiting more than 6 months. </p></reply>

To that end, I fully appreciate the importance of facilitating access to employment for doctors arriving in Ireland. </p>  <p>  My Department, along with the Medical Council and the HSE will continue to ensure that all avenues are being explored with a view to enabling Ukrainian qualified doctors to apply for registration, always conscious of the need to ensure that patient safety is to the fore when any decisions are being taken.  The HSE, through the National Doctors Training &amp;amp; Planning Unit (NDTP), in partnership with the Council and the Postgraduate Training Bodies, is coordinating an information gathering process which is collating information about healthcare professionals who are coming to Ireland. This data collection process is ongoing and will assist the relevant bodies in supporting these doctors and enable them to contact the individual doctors directly. The HSE is also looking at other options which these doctors can avail of while registration is pending, such as medical translation and access to CPD resources.   </p>  <p>  The Medical Council is the statutory agency responsible for the registration and regulation of doctors in Ireland.  In order to protect patients, it has a responsibility to ensure that all doctors registered to practice medicine in Ireland are safe to do so and meet the requirements to practice as set out in legislation.  Officials from my Department have been in regular contact with the Council to examine the ways in which support can be provided to doctors arriving from Ukraine and to ensure that practitioners can be assisted and facilitated in gaining registration where possible. The Council is working with a range of stakeholders in this regard including the HSE, Postgraduate Training Bodies and the Irish Medical Schools Council.</p></reply>

These regulations apply an up-to-date and comprehensive system of control to medicinal products and identify those products which may only be supplied on medical prescription. They define what a &ldquo;prescription&rdquo; is with reference to those healthcare professionals who are entitled to prescribe. Pharmacists do not currently prescribe prescription controlled medicinal products, but dispense such products in accordance with the authority conferred to supply, underpinned by a validly issued prescription. </p>  <p>  The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is the Competent Authority in Ireland responsible for deciding the legal supply category for a medicine.

The natural history, clinical course and consequences of COVID19 are still not completely understood. It is recognised that most patients with COVID-19 return to baseline after acute infection with SARS-CoV-2, but a proportion report ongoing health issues.</p>  <p>  The number of people that are affected with longer term sequelae after acute COVID-19 remains unknown, but published reports indicate that approximately 10&ndash; 20% of COVID-19 patients experience lingering symptoms for weeks to months following acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients with persistent symptoms following COVID-19 infection may be followed up by their GP or in hospital settings as clinically appropriate. Those who are concerned about Long COVID, should engage with their GP in the first instance for advice and referral, if needed.  </p>  <p>  The HSE has developed an interim Model of Care for Long COVID which aims to build on existing service provision, in addition to establishing new services across a number of health care settings including GP, community services and acute hospitals. There will be a phased implementation with a focus on establishing, Post-Acute and Long COVID clinics nationally as initial priority. This will involve expanding the resources at existing clinics where required and development of new clinics in line with the Model of Care. </p>  <p>  The HSE has advised that funding of &euro;2.2 million has been allocated within the HSE for Long COVID service development in 2022.  Access to these services will be in line with the current approach across health and social care services. </p>  <p>  In line with current policy, those without the means to access services, including Long COVID services,  may be eligible to apply for a medical card to assist with access. Under the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is based primarily on means. The Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without undue hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself and his or her family, having regard to his or her overall financial position and reasonable expenditure.</p>  <p>  The issue of granting medical cards based on having a particular disease or illness was previously examined in 2014 by the HSE Expert Panel on Medical Need and Medical Card Eligibility. The Group concluded that it was not feasible, desirable, nor ethically justifiable to list medical conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility. In following the Expert Group&rsquo;s advice, a person&rsquo;s means remains the main qualifier for a medical card.</p>  <p>  However, every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines. The HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income threshold where they face difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from, the social and medical impacts of an illness.</p>  <p>  The Disability Allowance and Illness Benefit Schemes do not fall under the remit of the Department of Health, however information on the scheme and how to apply can be found at www.gov.ie/en/service/df6811-disability-allowance/ and www.gov.ie/en/service/ddf6e3-illness-benefit/</p></reply>

The natural history, clinical course and consequences of COVID19 are still not completely understood. It is recognised that most patients with COVID-19 return to baseline after acute infection with SARS-CoV-2, but a proportion report ongoing health issues.</p>  <p>  The number of people that are affected with longer term sequelae after acute COVID-19 remains unknown, but published reports indicate that approximately 10&ndash; 20% of COVID-19 patients experience lingering symptoms for weeks to months following acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients with persistent symptoms following COVID-19 infection may be followed up by their GP or in hospital settings as clinically appropriate.  Those who are concerned about Long COVID, should engage with their GP in the first instance for advice and referral, if needed. </p>  <p>  The HSE has developed an interim Model of Care for Long COVID which aims to build on existing service provision, in addition to establishing new services across a number of health care settings including GP, community services and acute hospitals. There will be a phased implementation with a focus on establishing, Post-Acute and Long COVID clinics nationally as initial priority. This will involve expanding the resources at existing clinics where required and development of new clinics in line with the Model of Care. </p>  <p>  The HSE has advised that funding of &euro;2.2 million has been allocated within the HSE for Long COVID service development in 2022.</p></reply>

Eligibility guidelines for this payment, as applies in HSE and Section 38 organisations, were published by the HSE on 19th April and are available at www.hse.ie/eng/staff/resources/hr-circulars/hr-circular-012-2022-pandemic-special-recognition-payment.html </p><p>Separately, the Department of Health shall shortly publish information for those other certain healthcare employees that are covered by the Government Decision and the process available to their employers to implement this measure for their eligible staff. This shall cover eligible staff in: </p><p>- Private Sector Nursing Homes and Hospices (e.g. Private, Voluntary, Section 39 etc.); </p><p>- Eligible staff working on-site in Section 39 long-term residential care facilities for people with disabilities; </p><p>- Agency roles working in the HSE; </p><p>- Health Care Support Assistants (also known as home help / home care / home support) contracted to the HSE; </p><p>- Redeployed members of Department of Defence to work in the HSE; </p><p>- Paramedics employed by the Department of Local Government, Housing and Heritage</p><p>I am also mindful of other workers who played their own part during this difficult period in sustaining other services. It is tough to draw a line on this matter, but the Government based its decision on the risks which the above front-line workers faced. In recognition of the efforts of all workers, volunteers, and the general public during the COVID-19 pandemic, and in remembrance of people who lost their lives due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Government announced a public holiday which took place on 18 March 2022. From February next year there will also be a new permanent public holiday established to mark Imbolc/St Brigid&rsquo;s Day.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost.</p>  <p>  The NHSS covers the cost of the standard components of long-term residential care which are: </p>  <p>  - Nursing and personal care appropriate to the level of care needs of the person; </p>  <p>  - Bed and board; </p>  <p>  - Basic aids and appliances necessary to assist a person with the activities of daily living; and </p>  <p>  - Laundry service.</p>  <p>  Costs not covered by the NHSS include those individually incurred for items like social activities, newspapers and hairdressing. This may also include medical services such as therapies and some medical equipment. A person's eligibility for other schemes, such as the medical card scheme or the drugs payment scheme, is unaffected by participation in the NHSS or residence in a nursing home.  In determining the services covered by the NHSS it was considered very important that the care recipient and the taxpayer would be protected and would not end up paying for the same services twice. For this reason, medications and aids that are already prescribed for individuals under an existing scheme are not included in the services covered by the NHSS, as this would involve effectively paying twice for the same service.</p>  <p>  It is important to state that residents of nursing homes should enjoy the same levels of support and access to services as when they lived in their own homes. It is acknowledged that the reason they require 24 hour levels of support is due to their level of dependency, which in turn may require access to clinical services including hospital and other outpatient appointments in the community. The HSE provides for a level of Intermediate Care Vehicles, which are used predominantly for non-emergency transport between acute hospitals for admission and discharge purposes. They would be reserved for those who would need specific support in transport. In other cases, normal transport arrangements apply. These arrangements (e.g. wheelchair taxi) are normally funded by the individual.</p>  <p>  Although the NHSS covers core living expenses, residents can still incur some costs in a nursing home, as set out above. In recognition of this, anyone in receipt of financial support under the NHSS retains at least 20% of their income. The minimum amount that is retained is the equivalent of 20% of the State Pension (Non-Contributory).</p></reply>

As an immediate response to concerns raised, the South/South West Hospital Group (SSWHG) Interim Chief Operations Officer has been on site in UHK directly supporting management and clinicians in the hospital, initially on a 2 day a week commitment. This process has focused on the identification of delays within UHK patient flow streams and solutions which mitigate associated patient risks. This arrangement was put in place to ensure that the SSWHG will have the necessary assurances required regarding the on-going safe management of patients in UHK. The SSWHG Management team (within the individual managerial portfolio&rsquo;s) is also providing support to the various members of the UHK Management Team on an ongoing basis.</p>  <p>  The HSE has further advised me that the National Director for Acute Operations, Mr. Liam Woods, and members of the SSWHG Management Team met with the Executive Management Board of UHK, Clinical Directors, representatives of the Consultant Group and other key stakeholders in November 2021 in UHK to discuss the challenges facing the hospital. A Review Team has been established comprising members from Acute Operations, Special Delivery Unit (SDU), the National Integrated Care Programme for Older Persons (ICPOP) as well as representatives from the SSWHG.</p>  <p>  This multidisciplinary Review Team are tasked with identifying the improvements required to achieve and sustain effective operations at the hospital. The Review Team have been on site in UHK and have engaged with stakeholders in the hospital to identify these measures, as well as to provide support to clinical teams at UHK. The Team are developing an Action Plan that will further support the required changes at a local level.</p>  <p>  The HSE has advised me that the draft Action Plan is very near completion, and it is the intention of the Review Team to share the findings and recommendations with the UHK and SSWHG. The HSE and SSWHG are committed to supporting the implementation of these recommendations and are keen to move on strengthening the governance, leadership and management arrangements at the hospital. </p>  <p>  The HSE has assured me that they will continue to keep local representatives and the public informed in relation to the provision of services at the hospital.</p></reply>

Within my Department, I have established a Rapid Response Team to actively monitor the impacts on agrifood supply chains and to contribute to the whole of Government response to this crisis.</p>  <p>  I have also established the National Fodder and Food Security Committee, headed by Teagasc, to coordinate an industry response to the emerging crisis in feed, fodder, fertiliser and other inputs, and to develop contingency plans and advice to assist farmers in managing their farm enterprises. While there are sufficient supplies of fertiliser and animal feed at present, price remains a concern.</p>  <p>  In March, the Government approved my proposal to support Irish farmers with a targeted intervention package for the tillage sector and a multispecies sward initiative, worth over &euro;12 million. This package is aimed at producing more native crops and reducing dependency on imports, and on producing crops with a low demand for chemical fertiliser.</p>  <p>  Following discussions at EU level, including extensive engagement by EU Agriculture Ministers, the European Commission announced on 23rd March, via the communication &ldquo;Safeguarding food security and reinforcing the resilience of food systems&rdquo;, a range of measures to enhance global food security and to support farmers and consumers across the EU, in light of rising food prices and input costs. </p>  <p>  This includes an exceptional aid package to support impacted farming sectors, and I announced on 13th April that Ireland's allocation of &euro;15.8 million in exceptional EU funding would be deployed to support the pig and horticulture sectors.</p>  <p>  As you are aware the Government introduced a temporary reduction in excise duty on fuels, assistance on the price of electricity &amp;amp; gas, and a targeted and temporary grant scheme for hauliers, all of which will be of some assistance to farmers and the agrifood sector. On Marked Gas Oil (MGO) specifically, the Minister for Finance reduced the rate on MGO by 2c/litre inclusive of VAT from 10th March. </p>  <p>  Effective from 1st May 2022 a further VAT inclusive 3 cent reduction for MGO will apply, bringing the overall rate of MOT to &euro;111.14 per 1,000 Litres.  This reduced rate fully offsets the 1st May 2022 increase in the carbon tax and will apply until 11th October 2022. While primary responsibility for taxation policy is with the Minister for Finance, I continue to work closely with him to ensure that the tax code reflects the Government&rsquo;s priorities for the agrifood sector and the economy generally.</p>  <p>  Earlier this month, I brought a Memo for Information to Government on measures aimed to assist cattle and sheep farmers to produce fodder for next winter. </p>  <p>  The aim is to encourage farmers to grow more grass and conserve as much fodder (silage and/or hay) during 2022 to prevent a fodder crisis during the coming winter and the impact that would have for animal welfare. </p>  <p>  My Department is continuing to engage with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the detail of the scheme, and I will provide more detail on these measures in due course.</p>  <p>  I continue to engage with all our stakeholders and continue to work across Government, and with our European partners, to respond to this crisis, using all of the tools at our disposal. I believe we must support our farm families and their businesses through this period of significant upheaval.</p></reply>
