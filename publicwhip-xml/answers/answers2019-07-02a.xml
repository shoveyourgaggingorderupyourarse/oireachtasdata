Questions on any policy matters arising should be directed to the relevant line Minister.</p><p>The Labour Force Survey (LFS) is the official source of estimates of employment in the State.  However, the LFS only measures the level of employment in the quarter, and not the job losses or job gains which contributed to the change in employment. It is a household survey which provides quarterly statistics on the level of employment and unemployment.  Changes in the level of employment, as measured by the LFS, are the outcome of both jobs lost and jobs created over the period in question.  </p><p>The most recent figures available for employment levels are for the first quarter (Q1) of 2019.</p><p>The quarterly LFS estimates of employment are produced by NUTS-3 Regions (<i>NUTS-3 is a geocode standard referencing the eight subdivisions of Ireland for statistical purposes</i>).  Due to the methodology and sample size of the survey it is not possible to produce reliable county estimates from the LFS.</p><p>The number of persons aged 15 years and over in employment in Q1 2019 was 2,301,900.  This was an annual increase of 81,200 or 3.7% since Q1 2018, when there were 2,220,700 persons in employment.  Employment increased in all eight NUTS-3 regions over the year. The largest rates of increase were recorded in the Mid-East and South-West regions, at 7.4% and 4.2% respectively.</p><p>The Q1 2019 total of 2,301,900 was a quarterly increase, before seasonal adjustment, of 20,600 persons in employment since quarter four of 2018. There were quarterly increases in all NUTS-3 regions except the South-East and Midland regions, where employment decreased by 200 and 1,400 respectively.  These figures are not adjusted for seasonality.</p></reply>

The risks identified relate to safety, fire safety management, layout, size, age, fixtures, fittings and lighting. Environmental risks were identified in relation to safe evacuation of patients. Elms Ward was found to have significant risk to patients and staff due to its uneven floor.</p><p>To comply with legislative requirements, and in the best interests of patients and staff, the HSE needs to close the ward on a phased basis with effect from 1st July 2019, to be completed by August. This decision was based solely on health and safety concerns, and not as a cost saving measure.  There will be some reduction in access to transitional care beds from acute settings, however, all patients will remain in the Hospital until their current care is completed. The Department has been assured that all commitments for booked respite care will be honoured and plans are being put in place to that effect. </p><p>Staff were advised of this decision through consultation with their line management and they will be reassigned within the Hospital. The HSE has advised the Department that significant capital is required to address the health and safety issues and part of the project development process will be to examine all options available to provide safe services.</p><p>The primary focus must be on patients.  Engagement with them, their families, staff, union representatives and any other relevant stakeholders is on-going to ensure minimal impact for all concerned during the closure of the ward.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-07-02a.18.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1261" speakername="Jim Daly" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019070200058#WRA01300"><p>I would like to assure the Deputy that addressing the health needs of homeless persons and improving their access to healthcare services are a priority for the Department of Health and the HSE.   </p>  <p>  Currently, health services for the homeless population are delivered by multiple providers including Statutory Services, Non-Government Organisations and charitable organisations. In addition to local Community Mental Health Teams and Acute Mental Health Units, HSE Mental Health Services have established Specialist Homeless Mental Health Teams, dedicated to meet the mental health needs of people who are homeless.   </p>  <p>  There are two Specialist Homeless Mental Health Teams located in Dublin, one in Cork and a dedicated mental health homeless team is currently being developed in Kerry.   </p>  <p>  The HSE is currently working on a service improvement project which focuses on improving mental health care pathways for people who are homeless. This project will create a stepped model of care to ensure the homeless population in Community Health Organisations 6, 7 and 9 receive timely access and appropriate mental health care which cater for their mental health needs. The model will establish clear mental health care pathways into, and between, primary care, addiction services and specialist mental health services and support mental health staff working within the NGO structures.   </p>  <p>  HSE Homeless Multidisciplinary Teams are established in each Community Health Organisation. These teams comprise nurses, social workers, occupational therapists, mental health and addiction workers. These teams ensure that people who are homeless are linked with appropriate health and social care services.   </p>  <p>  Counselling is available to homeless persons through a national service, Counselling in Primary Care. Counselling is also available through the HSE Addiction Services and by HSE-funded Non-Government Organisations such as the Dublin Simon Community Sure Steps Counselling service and Merchants Quay Ireland. In 2018, the National Office for Suicide Prevention provided additional funding to the Dublin Simon service for a homeless-specific Out-of-Hours Counselling Service.   </p>  <p>  Families in emergency homeless accommodation have access to the all the services mentioned, in addition to the general mental health services that are available to all citizens. Most people with mental health problems can be treated by their GP, but when necessary, are referred to specialist HSE Mental Health Services. </p>  <p>  Again, let me assure the Deputy that addressing the matter of persons and families in emergency homeless accommodation is priority for the Government and the mental health and wellbeing of each person is a particular concern for the Department of Health.  For this reason, in 2016, the Department allocated &euro;2 million New Development funding for mental health homeless services. This year, the Department apportioned an additional &euro;1 million New Development funding to boost mental health provision across homeless, travellers, refugees and addiction services.</p></reply>

Over the past four years we have seen a considerable increase of nearly &euro;140 million in the budget which has grown from &euro;306 million in 2015 to almost &euro;446 million this year.</p><p>In 2019, the HSE intends to provide 17.9 million home support hours to 53,000 people and a further 360,000 hours of support through intensive home care packages to 235 people. Up to the end of April, about 5.6 million home support hours were delivered nationally. </p><p>In 2019, additional funding has been made available to CHO Dublin North City and County in order to provide 2,813,000 home support hours, an increase of 54,824 hours on last year.</p><p>Despite this significant level of service provision, the demand for home support continues to grow. In the first four months of the year some 5,761 new clients commenced receipt of home support.</p><p>I acknowledge that in some cases access to the service may take longer than we would like.  </p><p>I recently met with senior HSE management and representatives from CHO management on the issue of home support. Through this engagement,  I have been provided with reassurance that the HSE will meet its service plans targets this year with respect to home support services.</p></reply>

These organisations provide a broad range of services and are governed by Service Level Agreements with the HSE.</p><p>There are approximately 2,200 Section 39 voluntary organisations and 150 of these receive funding from the HSE in excess of &euro;1m per annum.  A substantial number of these Section 39 voluntary organisations provide disability services.</p><p>Significant resources have been invested by the health sector in various services during the past number of years. Since our Government took office, the National Service Plan budget for social inclusion, mental health, disability services, and services for older people, has been increased by &euro;747 million / 24%. This year alone, the Health Service Executive has allocated &euro;3.9 billion to these programmes.</p><p>I understand that a number of service providers have highlighted their individual challenges, which include deficits accrued over many years. My Department and the HSE continue to put significant effort and resources into assisting service providers to manage priority needs within the funding available.</p><p>As Minister of Health, my primary concern is to ensure the continuity of appropriate person-centred services is maintained and delivered in an equitable manner consistent with the care and support needs of individuals.</p><p>Arising from the 2019 Report of the Independent Review Group established to examine the role of voluntary organisations in publicly funded health and personal services, I intend to establish a new dialogue forum between the Department, relevant health agencies and representation from voluntary organisations in the health and social care sector to provide a mechanism for engaging with the sector on the proposed Sl&aacute;intecare reforms and other policy initiatives and to consider the group's recommendations on governance.</p><p>More broadly, I am continuing my examination of the recommendations of the report in the context of strengthening the relationship between the State and the voluntary organisations in the best interests of the service users. My focus will always be on the service users and their families.</p></reply>

The NHSS budget for 2019 is &euro;985.8m which is an increase of &euro;24.3m over its 2018 budget.</p><p>The National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) negotiates and agrees maximum prices with registered private and voluntary nursing homes for each private and voluntary nursing home who wishes to be an approved nursing home for the purposes of the Scheme. The NTPF has statutory independence in the performance of its function, and negotiates with each nursing home on an individual basis. Separately, under Sectiion 33 of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009, provision is made for the HSE to make charges in respect of long term care services. The provision sets out that charges shall not exceed the cost incurred by the HSE in relation to the provision of such care services. There are no plans to amend the legislation in this regard.</p><p>The nursing home sector has raised concerns in relation to staffing, particularly with regard to securing access to appropriately qualified staff. On foot of these concerns nursing home providers have requested the removal of health care assistants from the ineligible list of permits issued by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation to bring in workers from outside of the EEA. The representatives of the nursing homes sector have been advised that there needs to be a clear demonstration that recruitment difficulties are solely due to shortages and not to other factors such as salary or working conditions. The sector has been advised that more evidence is required of the labour shortages and to demonstrate full engagement with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection in relation to recruitment of healthcare assistants from within the EU in the first instance. On provision of this evidence by the sector this matter may be considered further.</p></reply>

The standard of care delivered to residents in public units is generally very high, but we recognise that many of our community hospitals are housed in buildings that are less than ideal in the modern context. It is important therefore that we upgrade our public bed stock and this is the aim of the Capital Investment Programme for Community Nursing Units. </p>  <p>  The HSE is responsible for the delivery of health and personal social services, including the facilities at St. Joseph&rsquo;s Community Hospital Stranorlar, Ramelton Community Hospital and Lifford Community Hospital, Donegal. The HSE have advised the following in relation to these facilities.</p>  <p>  The Community Nursing Unit programme provides for the retention of services at St. Joseph&rsquo;s Community Hospital Stranorlar and Ramelton Community Hospital with a requirement for refurbishment of both centres.</p>  <p>  In the short term the HSE will invest minor capital in both units in 2019 and 2020 in order to deal with HIQA compliance issues and an agreed schedule of works is being finalised with HIQA.</p>  <p>  The redevelopment of the Lifford unit on the existing site is not deemed viable. The need for additional beds and the potential to develop a new facility on a greenfield site will be reviewed further post 2021.</p></reply>

It increased by 125 whole time equivalents (WTE), or just over 4 per cent, in the year to the end of May 2019. In the five years to the end of May 2019 the number of consultants has increased by 533 - over 20 per cent - and now stands at 3,121 WTE's. </p>  <p>  While it would be preferable if all vacant posts could be occupied on a permanent basis, the majority of vacant posts not filled on a permanent basis are filled by alternative arrangements; fixed-term, locum or other agency arrangements, to support service delivery. It is recognised that many areas in our health system currently lack sufficient capacity to meet the ever-increasing demand for services and the needs of patients, resulting in unacceptably long waiting times for hospital appointments and procedures. Reducing waiting time for patients for operations and procedures is a key priority for Government. Last year saw a considerable improvement in the number of patients waiting for procedures. As a result of increased activity and the ongoing collaboration between the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF), the number of patients waiting for an inpatient or day case procedure fell to 70,204 in December 2018.  This was from a peak of 86,100 in July 2017, and represents a reduction of over 18% in the overall number of patients waiting for a procedure. The number of patients waiting in excess of 3 months fell by more than 17,700, or 31% in the same period from July 2017 to the end of December 2018.</p>  <p>  Budget 2019 announced that the Government had further increased investment in tackling waiting lists, with funding to the National Treatment Purchase Fund increasing from &euro;55 million in 2018 to &euro;75 million in 2019.  The joint Department of Health, HSE, and NTPF Scheduled Care Access Plan 2019 was published in March. Under the plan, the HSE, in line with the National Service Plan, will deliver 1.155 million elective inpatient and day case discharges at a value of &euro;1.4 billion in 2019.</p>  <p>  Recruitment and retention of consultants has been examined by the Public Sector Pay Commission.  The Commission found that evidence of recruitment campaigns with very low levels of applications was indicative of on-going difficulties regarding the recruitment of consultants. The Commission acknowledged that the difference in pay between the pre-existing and new entrant consultants is greater than that for other categories of public servants. It proposed that the parties to the Public Service Stability Agreement jointly consider what further measures could be taken, over time, to address the pay differential. </p>  <p>  The Government accepted the Report of the Commission and recognises that there are significant recruitment and retention challenges in relation to consultant posts. The proposal of the Commission does need to be addressed. The next step is to engage with the representative organisations of medical consultants.</p></reply>

The Report identified around 4,000 people (based on 2008 census) with disabilities in Ireland living in congregated settings, defined as a residential setting where people live with ten or more people. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Partnership Government contains a commitment to continue to move people with disabilities out of congregated settings to enable them to live independently and to be included in the community.  The objective is to reduce this figure by one-third by 2021 and ultimately, to eliminate all congregated settings.</p>  <p>  By the end of this year, we will have exceeded this target and under 2,100 people with a disability will remain living in congregated settings. I want to emphasise that the appropriate supports and resources are being put in place to ensure that people are supported as they move out of residential centres. The model of care for individuals will be based on a person centred plan (PCP). The PCP may change over time in line with an individual&rsquo;s needs and circumstances and the model of service delivery applicable at a particular time. </p>  <p>  Any opportunity for residents to live in smaller settings in the community will come after considerable planning and discussion with those residents and their families. It will be on the basis that it will enhance their life, and anyone who moves will continue to access the services they require. </p>  <p>  The HSE has prioritised the transition of a further160 people from congregated settings in 2019 under its Service Plan, and I am informed that 49 people have moved into their homes in the community to the end of March this year.   </p>  <p>  The HSE is responsible for leading out on the recommendations of "Time to Move on from Congregated Settings - A Strategy for Community Inclusion". I am informed that the total budget to St Patrick's Centre Kilkenny is &euro;16.94m. St. Patrick's has submitted funding proposals related to decongregation to the HSE and a validation of these requirements is underway. In the context of same, it is not appropriate to prejudge the outcome of this process until the matter concludes.</p></reply>

Furthermore consultant led Virtual ENT clinics are also being set up. </p>  <p>  For the specialty of Urology, a Locum Consultant Urologist has been appointed to focus on the longest waiting patients.

All applications for Consultant posts should be made using the Consultant Application Portal Module in the Doctors Integrated Medical System (DIME). Where a post is vacant, alternative arrangements are usually made to support service delivery.</p>  <p>  The HSE has advised that there are currently two Consultant Cardiologists employed in Sligo University Hospital, one permanent staff member and one temporary staff member. An application has been submitted to fill a retirement post in this service. Once  approval is received for this post, Saolta University Health Care Group  will advertise the two Consultant posts for the Cardiology service.  </p>  <p>  With regard to national cardiac services, the National Review of Specialist Cardiac Services is ongoing. The aim of the Review is to achieve optimal patient outcomes at the population level with particular emphasis on the safety, quality and sustainability of the services that patients receive through establishing the requirements for an appropriate configuration of specialist cardiac services throughout Ireland. </p>  <p>  While much work has been completed in relation to informing the optimal configuration of adult cardiac services, some significant and important work remains outstanding. In order to allow this work to be completed, the work of the Steering Group will continue through the summer months. I am advised by the Steering Group that it will be in a position to confirm a completion date this September.</p></reply>

The Department of Health is committed to the Mental Health Commission&rsquo;s vision of a mental health service underpinned by the human rights of service users. </p>  <p>  I welcome the positive trend towards greater compliance with Commission regulations by the 64 Approved Centres in 2018. I note that compliance across Approved Centres has improved from 76% in 2017 to 79% in 2018. I am glad to see that the Commission has registered significant progress between 2016 and 2018, with 32 Centres achieving good compliance and no Centres with poor compliance. </p>  <p>  However, I recognise that further improvements are needed. The Commission, in both the 2018 Annual Report and in the Inspector's Report, identified areas of low compliance in certain Approved Centres. In instances where the high standards are not being met, it is important that the Commission continues to work with the HSE to identify solutions and to put these in place. In this regard, the HSE, with the Commission, has developed Corrective and Preventative Action Plans for centres found to be non-compliant. </p>  <p>  The Department of Health will continue to monitor progress made by the HSE in improving compliance, to improve service delivery for mental health service users across the system.</p></reply>

The next step is to engage with the representative organisations of consultants.  However, brokering an affordable solution will be a significant challenge, in particular within the context of budgetary pressures and broader public sector policy.  While pay has a significant impact in recruitment and retention of consultants, a number of other factors are also important, including, <i>inter alia</i>, opportunities for career development, training opportunities and location.  The Commission stated it was strongly supportive of the full implementation of the recommendations of the Strategic Review of Medical Training and Career Structures, the 'MacCraith' recommendations.</p><p>Concerning Nurses, the recent nursing agreement and the new Enhanced Practice Nurse/Midwife contract will see the financial position of nurses and midwives improve and should help to both recruit and retain nurses in the public health service.  In relation to pay, the new Enhanced Practice Nurse and Midwife contract will deliver salary improvements for those that migrate to this new role ranging from between 2% - 11%. The Enhanced Nurse/Midwife Practice salary scale ranges between &euro;35,806 to &euro;47,201. The agreement will see improvements to a range of allowances, their extension to additional nurses and midwives, and a new allowance for those in medical surgical wards up to the maximum full year cost of &euro;10m. It also includes a commitment to increase the number of Advanced Nurse Practitioners to a minimum of 2% of the nursing workforce. The HSE is currently working on a plan to deliver the implementation of the agreement. </p><p>Finally,  in relation to the industrial action which took place on 26 June 2019 by SIPTU support staff grades, I was pleased that talks between the parties resumed at the Workplace Relations Commission last Thursday.  While some progress was made, it was not possible to reach agreement on all issues.  As a result, the matter has now been referred to the Labour Court for an hearing on Wednesday, 3 July 2019.</p></reply>

The report also finds that, on the basis of the information available to the Inquiry, the use of additional laboratories did not result in a reduction of the quality of the screening provided to Irish women and there is no evidence to suggest deficiencies in screening quality in any laboratory.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, Dr. Scally expressed concern about accreditation in relation to one laboratory in Salford, UK. This is ancillary to the main MedLab facility in Dublin. The performance data of this ancillary lab was included in that reviewed by the Inquiry in mid-2018, when it concluded that there was no reason, on quality grounds, why existing contracts for laboratory services should not continue. The Inquiry notes this lab has also been subject to a quality assurance visit by HSE staff. The provision of screening by this laboratory is being phased out, noting that MedLab is now focused on clearing its backlog of slides, and all new slides being read by either Quest Diagnostics or the Coombe. Accreditation is one important element in providing assurance about quality, of course, but notwithstanding that there is a concern about accreditation, the key issue is whether there was any deficiency in screening quality. Dr. Scally says there is no evidence of any such deficiency.</p>  <p>  I am not aware of the specific dates involved in relation to the accreditation of the laboratory in Manchester and I would emphasise the independence of Dr Scally's work in this regard. However, when the Deputy raised this issue at D&aacute;il statements on 19 June, I undertook to follow up with Dr Scally on the Deputy's behalf. I have been advised that Dr. Scally wrote to the Deputy on 23 June to provide an answer to his queries.</p></reply>

The Cappagh Hospital IPDC Orthopaedic waiting list has decreased by 5% when compared to the same period last year and 96% of patients are waiting 9 months or less.</p>  <p>  The NTPF data also shows that there are 2,122 patients from Cavan/Monaghan on the Outpatient Orthopaedic waiting list, which represents 3% of the National orthopaedics waiting list. 73% of the patients from Cavan/Monaghan are on the Cavan General Hospital Outpatient Orthopaedics waiting list, and of these 61% of patients are waiting 12 months or less.</p>  <p>  More broadly, Budget 2019 announced that the Government has further increased investment in tackling waiting lists, with funding to the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) increasing from &euro;55 million in 2018 to &euro;75 million in 2019. The joint Department of Health/HSE/National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) Scheduled Care Access Plan 2019 was published in March and sets out measures to improve care for patients waiting for scheduled care in 2019 by reducing waiting times for inpatient/day case treatment and outpatient appointments. The plan places a strong focus on ten high-volume Inpatient/Day Case procedures, including hip/knee replacements. When combined with HSE activity, it is projected that the NTPF will be in a position to offer treatment to all clinically suitable patients waiting more than 6 months for one of these high-volume procedures.</p>  <p>  A key element of the Plan is the stabilisation of the Outpatient Waiting List. Under the Plan the HSE, in line with the National Service Plan, will aim to deliver 3.3 million outpatient appointments, of which approximately 1 million will be first appointments. For its part the NTPF will aim to deliver 40,000 first Outpatient appointments.</p>  <p>  The NTPF advise that over recent months they have placed a particular focus on engaging with hospital groups and individual hospitals to identify outpatient waiting list proposals. While the NTPF have already approved over 38,000 outpatient appointments, they advise that the impact of these initiatives may not be seen until the end of the year. Approximately 75% of outpatient appointments approved to date relate to 4 high-volume specialities, specifically Ophthalmology, ENT, Orthopaedics, and Dermatology. </p>  <p>  In addition, my Department is working with the HSE and NTPF, under the Access Plan, with the objective of developing medium-long term improvement initiatives for patient access to hospital procedures. This will include moving care to more appropriate settings and providing care at the lowest level of complexity such as providing ophthalmology in the community; maximising the use of Advanced Nurse Practitioner led clinics; and physiotherapists to manage orthopaedic clinics.</p></reply>

In this regard, the Government is committed to improving waiting times for hospital appointments and procedures.</p>  <p>  The joint Department of Health/HSE/National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) Scheduled Care Access Plan 2019 was published in March and sets out measures to improve care for patients waiting for scheduled care in 2019 by reducing waiting times for inpatient/day case treatment and outpatient appointments.</p>  <p>  The Access Plan sets out the activity levels for the NTPF, who will supply additionality to HSE activity in order to reduce waiting times experienced by patients for a hospital appointment, operation or procedure.  </p>  <p>  A key element of the Plan is the stabilisation of the Outpatient Waiting List. Under the Plan the HSE, in line with the National Service Plan, will aim to deliver 3.3 million outpatient appointments, of which approximately 1 million will be first appointments. For its part the NTPF will aim to deliver 40,000 first Outpatient appointments.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Sl&aacute;intecare Action Plan 2019 which was published by my Department, includes a specific workstream on Access and Waiting Lists. Sl&aacute;intecare emphasises the need to invest in increased capacity while also shifting the balance of care from hospitals to community services for better health outcomes and a more sustainable health service. In addition, many of the other service reforms and enhancements included in Slaintecare will support timely access to care for patients in the coming years.</p>  <p>  In line with Sl&aacute;intecare objectives, my Department is working with the HSE and the NTPF, to develop medium-long term improvement initiatives for patient access to hospital procedures. This will include moving care to more appropriate settings and providing care at the lowest level of complexity. The HSE advise that one such example is a pilot scheme which commenced in January 2019 in Sligo University Hospital: the eight-week &ldquo;Pain Management Education Programme&rdquo; (PMEP) involves physiotherapy, psychology, and Pain Nurse-delivered education. </p>  <p>  The NTPF advise that over recent months they have placed a particular focus on engaging with hospital groups and individual hospitals to identify outpatient waiting list proposals. To date in 2019, the NTPF have approved funding for pain management appointments in Tallaght, the Mater and St. Vincent&rsquo;s hospitals, and welcomes proposals from all acute hospitals for initiatives to improve access for patients awaiting outpatient appointments.</p></reply>

Last year saw considerable improvement in the number of patients waiting for procedures. As a result of increased activity and the ongoing collaboration between the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF), the number of patients waiting for an Inpatient or Day case procedure fell to 70,204 in December 2018, from a peak of 86,100 in July 2017. This represents a reduction of over 18% in the overall number of patients waiting for a procedure. The number of patients waiting more than 3 months fell by more than 17,700, or 31% in the same period from July 2017 to the end of December 2018.</p><p>Budget 2019 announced that the Government had further increased investment in tackling waiting lists, with funding to the NTPF increasing from &euro;55 million in 2018 to &euro;75 million in 2019. </p><p>The joint Department of Health, HSE, and NTPF Scheduled Care Access Plan 2019 was published in March. Under the Plan the HSE, in line with the National Service Plan, will deliver 1.155 million elective inpatient and day case discharges at a value of &euro;1.4 billion in 2019. The Scheduled Care Access Plan includes:</p><p>- detailed plans from the NTPF to fund 25,000 IPDC treatments; 5,000 Gastro Intestinal Scopes; and 40,000 outpatient first appointments.</p><p>- Projections by year end to reduce the overall number of patients on the waiting list (excluding GI scopes) from just over 70,200 in Dec 2018 to under 60,000;</p><p>- Within this overall reduction the number of patients waiting longer than 3 months will reduce from 40,200 at the end of 2018 to 31,000;</p><p>- It is also projected that for ten identified high volume procedures, including hip and knee replacements, all clinically suitable patients waiting more than 6 months will be offered treatment in 2019. These 10 procedures account for over a third of the active inpatient day case waiting list and represent 60% of NTPF planned activity in 2019.</p><p>The latest NTPF figures show that there 1,301 patients on the Galway University Hospital (GUH) IPDC Orthopaedics waiting list. Of these, 81% (1,053) are waiting 12 months or less.</p><p>The GUH Orthopaedics IPDC Waiting List is contained in the following table. </p><p>*Please note that patients listed for surgery at Merlin Park Hospital are captured under the GUH waiting list.</p><p>In relation to the alternative arrangements in place to treat patients of Merlin Park Hospital for orthopaedic procedures, including Galway University Hospital and other hospitals, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly.</p><p>Galway University Hospitals IPDC Orthopaedics waiting list<table><tr><th>0-3 mths</th><th>3-6 mths</th><th>6-9 mths</th><th>9-12 mths</th><th>12-15 mths</th><th>15-18 mths</th><th>18-24 mths</th><th>24-36 mths</th><th>36-48 mths</th><th>48+ mths</th><th>Total </th></tr><tr><td>406 </td><td>245 </td><td>240 </td><td>162 </td><td>108 </td><td>43 </td><td>64 </td><td>26 </td><td>6 </td><td>1 </td><td>1301 </td></tr></table></p></reply>

Over the past four years we have seen a considerable increase of nearly &euro;140 million in the budget which has grown from &euro;306 million in 2015 to almost &euro;446 million this year. In 2019, the HSE intends to provide 17.9 million home support hours to 53,000 people and intensive home care packages to 235 people, equating to a further 0.36m hours. </p>  <p>  Despite this significant level of service provision, the demand for home support continues to grow. The allocation of funding for home supports across the system, though significant, is finite and services must be delivered within the funding available. The HSE is required to deliver the service within the available budget, and this means ensuring the hours allocated to the service are affordable. This requires the HSE to manage the budget and service provision throughout the year to ensure a balanced budget for 2019.   </p>  <p>  The development of a new, standalone statutory scheme and system of regulation for home-support services is a long-standing objective of the Government.  This is currently progressing in line with the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy which commits to the introduction of the new scheme in 2021. It is intended that the new statutory scheme will improve access to adult home support services on an affordable and sustainable basis while the introduction of a system of regulation will ensure public confidence in these services. </p>  <p>  Building on a review of the home care systems in 4 EU countries which was published in April 2017, the Department is currently engaged in a review of the policy goals, objectives and guiding principles of adult home support service provision in ten countries. This review will assist in identifying international good practices, the learning from which will be incorporated into the development of the new statutory scheme.</p></reply>

In preparation for the development of the statutory scheme, the Department commissioned the Health Research Board to carry out a review of the home-care systems in four European countries. In addition, the Department conducted a public consultation on home-care services, on which a report was published in 2018. These reports are available on the Department&rsquo;s website and will help to ensure that the new scheme is informed both by international experience and by the views of stakeholders, including service-users. </p>  <p>  Work is currently being progressed in relation to a review of the management, operation and funding of current home care services in Ireland. This will provide a baseline for the design of an effective, sustainable service as part of the development of a statutory home care scheme. This review, which will be completed by the end of the year, will provide a baseline for the design of an effective, sustainable service as part of the development of a statutory homecare scheme. </p>  <p>   Work is on-going to determine the optimal approach to the development of the statutory scheme within the broader context of the Sl&aacute;intecare reforms. The Department&rsquo;s Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy commits to the introduction of the statutory scheme in 2021. In 2019 work will focus on the design of the scheme, the options for regulation and a review of existing services. Further consultation will also be undertaken in 2019 (with key stakeholders and service-users) and will continue throughout the process of developing the new scheme.</p></reply>

Improving timely access for patients to scheduled and unscheduled care is at the heart of Sl&aacute;intecare. The Sl&aacute;intecare Action Plan 2019 which was published by my Department, includes a specific workstream on Access and Waiting Lists. Sl&aacute;intecare emphasises the need to invest in increased capacity while also shifting the balance of care from hospitals to community services for better health outcomes and a more sustainable health service. In addition, many of the other service reforms and enhancements included in Slaintecare will support timely access to care for patients in the coming years.</p>  <p>  Last year saw considerable improvement in the number of patients waiting for procedures. As a result of increased activity and the ongoing collaboration between the HSE and the NTPF, the number of patients waiting for an Inpatient or Day case procedure fell to 70,204 in December 2018, from a peak of 86,100 in July 2017. This represents a reduction of over 18% in the overall number of patients waiting for a procedure. The number of patients waiting more than 3 months fell by more than 17,700, or 31% in the same period from July 2017 to the end of December 2018.</p>  <p>  Budget 2019 announced that the Government had further increased investment in tackling waiting lists, with funding to the NTPF increasing from &euro;55 million in 2018 to &euro;75 million in 2019. </p>  <p>  The joint Department of Health, HSE, and NTPF Scheduled Care Access Plan 2019 was published in March. Under the Plan, the HSE in accordance with the National Service Plan, will aim to deliver 1.155 million elective inpatient and day case discharges at a value of &euro;1.4 billion in 2019. The Scheduled Care Access Plan also includes:</p>  <p>  - detailed plans from the NTPF to fund 25,000 IPDC treatments; 5,000 Gastro Intestinal Scopes and 40,000 first outpatient appointments.</p>  <p>  - Projections by year end to reduce the overall number of patients on the Inpatient/Day Case waiting list (excluding GI scopes) from just over 70,200 in Dec 2018 to under 60,000;</p>  <p>  - Within this overall reduction the number of patients waiting longer than 3 months will reduce from 40,200 at the end of 2018 to 31,000;</p>  <p>  -It is also projected that for ten identified high volume procedures, all clinically suitable patients waiting more than 6 months will be offered treatment in 2019. These 10 procedures account for over a third of the active inpatient day case waiting list and represent 60% of NTPF planned activity in 2019. </p>  <p>  A key element of the Scheduled Access Plan is the stabilisation of the Outpatient Waiting List. Under the Plan the HSE will aim to deliver 3.3 million outpatient appointments, of which approximately 1 million will be first appointments. </p>  <p>   While the meeting of short-term targets is always welcome, more can be achieved and, in this regard, the HSE, Department of Health and NTPF, under the Access Plan, will work together with the objective of developing medium-long term improvement initiatives for patient access to hospital procedures. This will include moving care to more appropriate settings and providing care at the lowest level of complexity such as providing ophthalmology in the community; maximising the use of Advanced Nurse Practitioner led clinics; and physiotherapists to manage orthopaedic clinics.</p>  <p>  With regard to unscheduled care, Ireland is seeing a growing demand, which is evident from the increased pressures on hospital Emergency Departments (EDs), particularly during peak periods such as winter. This is a very busy period for our health services, with many hospitals reporting significant numbers of patient attendances. For the first five months of 2019, the number of patients attending hospital EDs increased by 4.9%, and the number of ED admissions increased by 3.3% compared to the same period last year. </p>  <p>  Despite the significant increase in demand, our health services have managed better for the first five months of 2019 than in the previous year, and the numbers of patients waiting on trolleys nationally were 6.8% lower than the same period last year. </p>  <p>  The HSE are undertaking a review of performance across all Hospital Groups and Community Health Organisations over the winter period, which has now been extended to include a review by an independent expert group. </p>  <p>  The group will carry out a comparative analysis of unscheduled care performance across the nine hospital sites and the relevant Community Healthcare Organisations that were the subject of specific focused support through Winter 2018/2019. The terms of reference and membership of the group have been agreed and are now published on the HSE website.</p>  <p>  The Health Service Capacity Review published last year was crystal clear on the need for a major investment in additional capacity in both hospital and community &ndash; combined with a widescale reform of the manner and the location of where health services are provided.</p>  <p>  Increasing capacity is a priority for Government. Since 2017, an additional 241 acute hospital beds opened, and the National Service Plan for 2019 provides for a comprehensive capacity programme. The number of available inpatient beds is expected to increase to above 11,000 following the investment planned in the National Service Plan 2019.</p></reply>

The CSO appreciates that Government and policy-makers need to know how Ireland is performing in a general sense; need data to assess economic, social and environmental conditions; and require evidence to evaluate policy outcomes.</p><p>Well-being, in its broadest sense, can be viewed as a measure of how people feel about their lives as a whole and as a measure of all aspects of life. As a result, it is a complex multi-dimensional issue influenced by factors such as the state of the environment, the educational levels of the population, economic performance, public safety, and the health of the population, amongst other factors.</p><p>The most prominent report on this topic published by the CSO is The Wellbeing of the Nation 2017.  This report was published in January 2018 and provides a series of indicators across eight domains.  The domains were selected based on their importance to well-being and they encompass many aspects of people&rsquo;s everyday life.  They have also been selected to be in line with international best practice where possible, whilst also remaining relevant to Irish information needs. The table below shows the domains and corresponding indicators.</p><p><b>Domains and corresponding indicators featured in The Wellbeing of the Nation 2017</b><table><tr><th>Domain</th><th>Indicators</th></tr><tr><td>Economy</td><td>Average debt per household<br /><br />Modified Gross National Income (GNI*)<br /><br />Average total annual earnings<br /><br />Consumer price index</td></tr><tr><td>Work</td><td>Unemployment rate<br /><br />Long-term unemployment rate<br /><br />Employment rate of those with a disability<br /><br />Percentage working greater than 48 hours per week<br /><br />Enforced job instability<br /><br />Discrimination in the workplace</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>Educational attainment<br /><br />Early school leavers indicator<br /><br />Digital skills of those aged 16-74<br /><br />Programme for international student assessment (PISA) mathematics score</td></tr><tr><td>Housing and natural Environment</td><td>Homelessness<br /><br />Air quality<br /><br />River water quality<br /><br />Recovered packaging recycling rates</td></tr><tr><td>Governance and Equality</td><td>Female representation in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann<br /><br />Consistent poverty rate<br /><br />Equality of income distribution<br /><br />Percentage that experienced discrimination </td></tr><tr><td>Health</td><td>Self-perceived health<br /><br />Healthy life years at birth<br /><br />Overweight/obesity<br /><br />Binge drinking at least once a week<br /><br />Deaths by suicide</td></tr><tr><td>Public Safety</td><td>Self-reported victimisation<br /><br />Worry about becoming a victim of personal crime or theft and damage<br /><br />Perception of seriousness of crime in Ireland<br /><br />Number of injuries or fatalities from road traffic accidents</td></tr><tr><td>Time Use</td><td>Volunteering<br /><br />Participation in sport<br /><br />Average weekly household expenditure on sports and leisure<br /><br />Commuting time</td></tr></table></p><p>Other related work undertaken by the CSO includes the presentation, in co-operation with Ordnance Survey Ireland, of geospatial information on the EU and UN Sustainable Development Goals (see ). Further work is under way this year on a CSO thematic report on the SDGs; and the CSO is also developing a set of energy poverty indicators.</p><p>To aid with communicating statistics and indicators on well-being, the CSO has also begun work on an interactive well-being dashboard, which will be similar to the Key Short-term Economic Indicators dashboard on the CSO website ().  The aim of the dashboard will be to present up-to-date statistics on well-being in an easily accessible way.</p></reply>

Occasional requests from organisations are also considered on a case by case basis.  Permission for the use of the pool is subject at all times to Defence Forces requirements and signed conditions, which includes the requirement for the schools, clubs and organisations to have appropriate insurance. </p>  <p>  I am further advised that as the swimming pool in the Defence Forces Training Centre, Curragh Camp is a relatively modern facility, which was completed and first taken into use in July 2001, there are no immediate plans or requirement for capital investment in this facility. However, there is provision to spend in the order of &euro;113,000 this year for the ongoing maintenance of the pool.</p></reply>

This is primarily to enable the Defence Forces to carry out their roles as assigned by Government as set out in the White Paper on Defence.  Equipment priorities for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service are being considered in the context of the lifetime of the White Paper on Defence as part of the capability development and equipment planning process.  </p>  <p>  In this context the principal aim over the period of the White Paper is to replace and upgrade, as required, existing capabilities in order to retain a flexible response for a wide range of operational requirements at home and overseas. In accordance with the National Development Plan, the capital allocation for Defence has been increased to &euro;106 million for 2019, an increase of &euro;29 million. The Defence Capital envelope for the period 2018-2021 is &euro;416m, and this will enable investment in major equipment platforms, including the continuing replacement and refurbishment of Naval Service Vessels.</p>  <p>  The White Paper underpins the ongoing replacement of the Naval Service fleet. A significant investment over recent years has been on the procurement of new Off-Shore Patrol Vessels (OPVs) for the Naval Service. The fourth ship in the programme, L&Eacute; George Bernard Shaw, was commissioned into service in May 2019 reflecting an investment by the Government of over &euro;250 million in the new ships programme since 2010. The four ships are performing well in operational service. </p>  <p>  Despite the recent acquisitions to the Naval Service fleet, three ships in the current flotilla are over 30 years old (L&Eacute; Eithne and L&Eacute; Ciara were built in 1984 and L&Eacute; Orla was built in 1985).  The White Paper provides for the replacement of the current Naval Service flagship L&Eacute; Eithne with a multi role vessel (MRV) which will be enabled for helicopter operations and will also have a freight carrying capacity. It is the intention to hold a public tender competition in due course to cover the supply of the MRV subject to the availability of funding within the overall Defence capital funding envelope. The cost of the MRV will only be known once the tender competition is concluded. </p>  <p>  Future Naval Service capabilities are being planned as part of the White Paper project planning process which will determine the Defence Organisation&rsquo;s maritime capability requirements. </p></reply>

The Department also  provides up to a maximum of 70% grant aid to each Local Authority Civil Defence unit, as well as other supports such as training for local volunteer instructors. It also supplies vehicles, equipment, uniforms and personal protective equipment</p>  <p>  The White Paper also recognises the important role of Local Government in the management of Civil Defence. The Civil Defence Officer who is an employee of the Local Authority is responsible for the day-to-day management and operation of Civil Defence in their Local Authority area. </p>  <p>  When Civil Defence&rsquo;s current PHECC operating licence was up for renewal in November 2018, my officials reviewed the current Statutory Declaration which must be signed by organisations who wish to provide emergency medical services. That review identified that some assurances and details required as part of the licensing process are not within the control or remit of my Department as responsibility for operations rests with Local Authorities.</p>  <p>  Since January 2019, my officials have been working closely with senior officials in both PHECC and Local Authorities in order to find a satisfactory solution to this issue, while conscious of the unique structure of Civil Defence.</p>  <p>  Following recent engagement between officials from my Department and from the County and City Management Association, it has been agreed that Local Authorities will provide some of the assurances required as part of the signing of the Statutory Declaration. In order to put in place the necessary processes and collate the required assurances, my officials applied for a further extension to its existing licence which currently expires on 30 July 2019. Upon considering that request, PHECC agreed to give a further month's extension, up to 31 August 2019 subject to a satisfactory progress report at the next PHECC Council meeting on 11 July 2019.</p>  <p>  I can assure you, I am committed to ensuring the excellent service Civil Defence volunteers provide in terms of emergency medical services continues beyond the 30 July 2019. My officials continue to engage constructively to resolve the issue.</p></reply>

For the avoidance of doubt the Government recently prescribed them by Order under s. 85 of the 2006 Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act (S.I.

The Amhara Regional President Ambachew Mekonnen and two of his advisors were killed, and the perpetrator has been identified as the Amhara Region security chief, Asaminew Tsige. Some hours later, a bodyguard killed General Seare Mekonnen, Chief of Staff of the Ethiopian Defence Forces, and a retired officer, at the general&rsquo;s home in Addis Ababa. </p>  <p>  Following the attacks, the Federal Government imposed an internet blackout across the country. State media announced that Asaminew was killed by the military in a firefight on 24 June. Asaminew, an Amhara nationalist, had been imprisoned under the premiership of former Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi for insubordination and plotting a coup attempt, and was released last year by current Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed as part of a large-scale release of political prisoners. The internet has now been restored. </p>  <p>  The EU issued a statement condemning the killings, calling for restraint from all sides of the Ethiopian political spectrum, and reiterating the need for continued peaceful and democratic reforms in Ethiopia. It also reiterated the EU&rsquo;s support for the efforts of Prime Minister Abiy and his Government in this context.  During a visit to Ethiopia in January, the Taoiseach met with Prime Minister Abiy and expressed Ireland&rsquo;s support for Ethiopia&rsquo;s ongoing reforms, as well as raising concerns regarding the high levels of internal displacement. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s travel advice for Ethiopia has been updated following the events of 22 June, and our Embassy in Addis Ababa is in contact with Irish citizens registered in Ethiopia. Ireland&rsquo;s Ambassador to Ethiopia has been briefed on the events by the Ethiopian Foreign Ministry and the Prime Minister&rsquo;s Office. The Embassy continues to closely monitor the political and security situation, in cooperation with the EU Delegation in Addis Ababa. </p>  <p>  Ireland continues to support the political and economic reform process underway in Ethiopia, including through the Irish Aid programme: Ethiopia is Ireland's most significant bilateral development partner with a budget this year of &euro;32 million.  </p></reply>

The report concerns possible evidence of a disinformation campaign partly aimed at exacerbating divisions in Northern Ireland and is an issue which the relevant security services here will be appraising.  </p>  <p>  Protecting democratic processes and institutions from disinformation is a major challenge for all societies. In order to tackle this challenge, the EU is building a robust framework for coordinated action which is fully in line with European values and fundamental rights, and with which Ireland is fully engaged.</p>  <p>  Measures adopted to date by the European Council - the EU Joint Action Plan against Disinformation and the dedicated Elections Package &ndash; have already helped to deter attacks and expose disinformation. Within the framework of these actions, increased public awareness has made it harder for malicious actors to manipulate the public debate.</p>  <p>  More broadly, the EU has strengthened its capabilities to identify and counter disinformation, via the Strategic Communication Task Forces and the EU Hybrid Fusion Cell in the European External Action Service.  A Rapid Alert System has also been established to facilitate the prompt exchange of information between Member States and the EU institutions where suspect disinformation campaigns have been detected. </p>  <p>  The EU also works closely with online platforms and industry through a voluntary Code of Practice to increase the transparency of political communications and to prevent the manipulative use of their services.  This allows users to know why they see specific political content and ads, and see where they come from and who is behind them. </p>  <p>  The fight against disinformation is a long-term challenge that concerns all parts of our societies and requires continuous commitment and efforts. The private sector, especially the online platforms, have a particular responsibility. Further proposals to strengthen our collective action in response to this ever-evolving threat are likely and Ireland will fully support any such actions once they align with our fundamental values, notably the right to freedom of expression. </p></reply>

The demolition of Palestinian homes, and demolition or seizure of related structures such as water tanks, wells, solar panels, schools and animal housing, are cruel and unjust actions. The only possible conclusion we can draw from the systematic nature of these policies, especially in areas where illegal Israeli settlements have already been constructed, is that they are aimed at forcing Palestinians off their land.</p>  <p>  Ireland joined the European Commission-led West Bank Protection Consortium in 2017 at my instigation, during my first visit to Israel and Palestine as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. The Consortium plays a leading role in supporting threatened communities and coordinating the provision of essential services to them, including material assistance and legal aid. Ireland&rsquo;s membership of the Consortium underlines our commitment to reducing the vulnerability of Palestinian communities living in Area C of the West Bank.</p>  <p>  My primary concern is the hardship and injustice that demolitions and confiscations cause for Palestinian families. But it is right that the question of recompense for humanitarian relief funded by our taxpayers should also be pursued. Ireland is part of a group of EU Member States which pursue this issue consistently through the West Bank Protection Consortium.  It is the practice of the Consortium to raise this directly with the Israeli authorities and to date, the donors to the Consortium have sought compensation in the amount of over &euro;121,000 in respect of confiscated or demolished assets. </p>  <p>  In October 2018, seven donor-funded humanitarian structures were confiscated by the Israeli authorities from two vulnerable Palestinian communities located in Area C of the occupied West Bank. The structures were co-funded by the EU and the West Bank Protection Consortium, and were provided in order to address the basic needs of the population and to support children&rsquo;s right to education in a safe environment as part of a humanitarian response mechanism. </p>  <p>  There were worrying reports that the confiscated humanitarian assets were to be auctioned by the Israeli Civil Administration earlier this month, but I understand that the auction has since been postponed.  Irish diplomats based in Ramallah and in Tel Aviv are following this matter closely and are working with other members of the Consortium to determine how best to pursue this issue. </p>  <p>  The practice of demolition and confiscation of humanitarian assets, including education infrastructure, is contrary to Israel&rsquo;s obligations under International Law, including provisions of international humanitarian law, and in particular the Fourth Geneva Convention. These practices also cause suffering to ordinary Palestinians, and impinge on the right of children to an education.</p>  <p>  Ireland regularly conveys our views on these actions to the Israeli authorities, both directly and through the EU. I have done so myself on my visits to the region. </p></reply>

Ireland supported an EU statement at that session welcoming Ms. Callamard's report, condemning the killing in the strongest possible terms, and stressing that full accountability must be achieved. The EU statement called on Saudi Arabia to disclose all information available and to fully cooperate with all investigations into the killing.</p>  <p>  Ireland also took the opportunity to make a national statement in this dialogue, emphasising that the protection of journalists and media workers is essential in protecting and promoting the freedom of expression. Specifically on the death of Mr. Khashoggi, Ireland supported the report&rsquo;s focus on accountability, and joined calls that those responsible for the killing must be held to account.  </p>  <p>  Ireland, from the beginning, has supported calls for thorough, credible and transparent investigation into the killing of Mr Khashoggi, which must get to the facts of the case and ensure full accountability for all those responsible. During the last Universal Periodic Review of Saudi Arabia's human rights record at the HRC in November 2018, Ireland raised concerns regarding the case. In March 2019 Ireland signed a joint statement at the HRC condemning the killing, and calling on Saudi Arabia to disclose all information available and to fully cooperate with all investigations into the killing, including the inquiry by the Special Rapporteur. </p>  <p>  I met with the Saudi Ambassador in October 2018 and February 2019 and stressed the need for a full and transparent investigation to establish the truth.</p>  <p>  Freedom of expression is a fundamental right under international human rights law and journalists play a vital role in holding governments to account. In September 2018, Ireland co-sponsored a resolution on &lsquo;Safety of Journalists&rsquo; at the HRC, condemning all violence against journalists and urging all states to ensure accountability for such attacks.</p></reply>

The agreement reflects not only the close historical and cultural links between Ireland and the US, but also the vibrancy of the modern economic and commercial relationship between our countries.</p>  <p>  These Working Holiday Authorisations (WHAs) are intended to facilitate US citizens who wish to travel for an extended period in Ireland and to engage in employment as an incidental aspect of their holiday.   </p>  <p>  In 2017, 528 WHAs were granted to US citizens through the Government&rsquo;s Embassy and Consulate network in the US.

I am concerned by persistent reports of desperate conditions and mistreatment of migrants and refugees in detention centres.  Recent reports of an outbreak of tuberculosis in some detention centres, with a number of people confirmed to have died of the disease in one detention centre, are a matter of particular concern. Ireland and the EU believe that detention centres are not a suitable place for migrants in Libya, and should be closed. This outbreak further underlines that this is the case. </p>  <p>  Political fragmentation and the fragile security situation in Libya limit the capacity of the international community to access all areas where migrants are located, or to influence the situation on the ground. The EU provides support to the work of the UNHCR and IOM in Libya, which have staff on the ground there, and who are best placed to provide protection and assistance to vulnerable migrants and refugees in detention centres and elsewhere. They are also working on relocating migrants and refugees to safer places, both inside Libya, and where voluntary return is possible, to their countries of origin. </p>  <p>  Ultimately, ensuring adequate treatment of migrants and refugees will require restoration of political stability, and a fully functioning Government. Ireland and the EU continue to support the efforts of the UN Special Representative, Ghassan Salam&eacute;, to bring this about.  All Libyans, and all international parties, should give their full support to the UN-led political efforts, and parties should ensure that they follow through on commitments made during the talks. All EU Member States have called on the parties to the conflict in Libya to immediately implement a ceasefire, and to re-engage in the UN-led process for an inclusive political settlement. This is the only way to ensure that civilians in Libya, including migrants and refugees, will no longer have to endure the mistreatment and desperate conditions that have been reported.</p></reply>

Following US withdrawal from the Iran Nuclear Deal (JCPOA) last year, the EU conveyed our great regret at the decision to the US Government. The EU believes that there is no credible alternative to the JCPOA, which was a significant diplomatic achievement. We remain fully committed to its preservation and full implementation, which is in the security interest of all. We share the US view that Iran's ballistic missile activities should be curtailed, and that its regional activities have exacerbated and prolonged conflicts. However, we believe that the best way to achieve an end to these is to show that diplomatic problem-solving can work, by holding to the gains from the nuclear agreement. </p>  <p>  Following the recent ratcheting up of tensions, High Representative/Vice President Federica Mogherini made a statement on 13 May 2019, which called on both parties to show maximum restraint and to avoid any escalation on a military side. This view was also directly shared with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo by HR/VP Mogherini in her consultations with him in May. The EU has expressed deep regret at the continuing US efforts to tighten general economic sanctions on Iran, and also at Iran&rsquo;s subsequent decision to partially suspend its operation of some commitments under the JCPOA, including limitations on its stocks of nuclear materials. We are also very concerned about the attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman, for which there can be no excuse. No party has yet claimed responsibility for these. The European Union will continue to monitor tensions between the US and Iran, and where the opportunity arises with both Governments and relevant interlocutors, will encourage a return to diplomatic dialogue and constructive communication. </p>  <p>  The EU strongly urges Iran to continue to implement its commitments under the JCPOA in full and to refrain from any escalatory steps. Ireland and the EU will continue to endeavour to ensure the effective fulfilment of the JCPOA and adherence to its commitments by all remaining parties. All parties to the JCPOA, including Iran, Russia and China, met in Vienna on 28 June to discuss continuing implementation of the agreement.</p></reply>

The office will allow Ireland to build on our existing presence in this economic and financial powerhouse. The primary focus of the Mission will be on trade and economic issues, alongside political engagement with the federal authorities. Significant numbers of Irish companies operate in Hesse and there is potential to grow our engagement in areas such as FinTech. Frankfurt is also home to the European Central Bank and the Single Supervisory Mechanism, making it the financial capital of the Euro area, vitally important to Ireland&rsquo;s economic interests. The office will also undertake an intensive public diplomacy programme, with a media and cultural promotion focus,  to develop Ireland's profile and image in Hesse and the neighbouring states Rheinland-Pflaz and Saarland. </p>  <p>  The new Consulate General in Los Angeles will facilitate the development of high level business, community and political contacts, and will maximise the economic opportunities on offer in the fifth largest economy in the world, particularly in relation to tech and the creative industries, but also in finance, bio-tech, healthcare, aerospace and aviation. The office will have a strong economic focus, with forty percent of the foreign direct investment to Ireland already coming from the west coast region of the US. The office will also strengthen our presence on the ground by opening up new opportunities for investment and job creation. The new Consulate General will focus on building networks and supporting the 140 Irish companies operating in California, several of whom have large operations in Southern California.  It will also take a lead role in coordinating cultural and artistic linkages to Ireland, initially with a focus on Los Angeles but eventually California and Western US.</p></reply>

Section 32D and 32E of the Central Bank Act 1942, as amended, provide that the Central Bank Commission may make regulations relating to the imposition of levies and fees on the financial services sector in respect of the recoupment of the costs of financial regulation. </p><p>As it stands, the financial services industry currently funds 80% of the costs incurred by the Central Bank for financial regulation, with certain exceptions. [Banks which had participated in the Eligible Liabilities Guarantee (ELG) Scheme, namely AIB, Bank of Ireland and Permanent TSB, which are required to fund 100% of the Central Bank's regulatory costs. The levies for Credit Unions are currently capped at 0.01% of total assets as at 30 September in the previous year. As a result, the Credit Union sector currently funds approximately 9% of the cost of their regulation.] This means that the subvention from the Central Bank amounts to approximately 20% of the total cost. What this translates to in monetary terms will be determined by the resources required by the Bank to discharge its legal responsibilities during a given year. </p><p>As until now, levies were based on estimates, at the end of each year, budgeted income and expenses are compared with actual income and expenses by the Central Bank, on a category by category basis, in order to arrive at the amount over (surplus) or under (deficit) recovered from Industry. Deficits are added to the amount to be raised from Industry in the following year while surpluses are deducted. </p><p>In 2018, the cost of financial regulation activities was funded by levies of approximately &euro;128 million and subvention of &euro;66 million. However, there was a deficit carried forward from 2017, which meant that the actual amount of Levy income raised from industry for 2018 was approximately &euro;137 million.</p><p><b><i>Table 1: 2018 Levy Income by sector (extracted from Note 40, 2018 Financial Statements of the Central Bank)</i></b><table><tr><th>Sector</th><th>2018 Levy Amount</th><th>2018 Levy Income including deficit from 2017 Levy Amount</th><th>% of total 2018 Levy Income</th></tr><tr><td></td><td>&euro;000</td><td>&euro;000</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Credit Institutions</td><td>54,751</td><td>59,753</td><td>43.7%</td></tr><tr><td>Insurance Undertakings</td><td>35,647</td><td>35,002</td><td>25.6%</td></tr><tr><td>Intermediaries &amp;amp; Debt Management Firms</td><td>6,098</td><td>5,925</td><td>4.3%</td></tr><tr><td>Securities &amp;amp; Investment Firms</td><td>19,894</td><td>23,594</td><td>17.3%</td></tr><tr><td>Investment Funds</td><td>5,508</td><td>5,418</td><td>4.0%</td></tr><tr><td>Credit Unions</td><td>1,665</td><td>1,665</td><td>1.2%</td></tr><tr><td>Moneylenders</td><td>887</td><td>741</td><td>0.5%</td></tr><tr><td>Approved Professional Bodies</td><td>34</td><td>18</td><td>0.0%</td></tr><tr><td>Bureaux de Change</td><td>11</td><td>4</td><td>0.0%</td></tr><tr><td>Home Reversion, Retail Credit &amp;amp;   Credit Servicing Firms</td><td>1,371</td><td>2,601</td><td>1.9%</td></tr><tr><td>Payment Services &amp;amp; E-Money   Institutions</td><td>1,270</td><td>1,875</td><td>1.4%</td></tr><tr><td>Total Funding</td><td>127,136</td><td>136,596</td><td>100.0%</td></tr></table></p><p>More information on the 2018 levies and levy income, and a more detailed version of Table 1, can be found in the Central Bank's 2018 Annual Report, available at the following link: </p><p>If industry was fully charged, there would be no subvention, however, there are certain costs (e.g. markets supervision) which it may be appropriate to continue to subvent on an ongoing basis where the costs cannot be attributed to specific firms but do relate to the orderly function of markets and the financial stability agenda.</p><p>In 2015, the Department of Finance and Central Bank of Ireland issued a joint public consultation on &lsquo;Funding the cost of Financial Regulation&rsquo; (CP95).  </p><p>In response to that consultation, my predecessor as Minister for Finance, Michael Noonan, agreed to a phased movement towards 100 per cent Industry Funding in order to eliminate subvention, by the taxpayer, of regulatory costs. Since then, recovery rates have increased in stages across most industry sectors, determined on a yearly basis. Now, in order to give greater clarity to industry, I have approved the trajectory to bring the recovery rate of levies across sectors to 100 per cent over the coming years.  This change in policy will apply the user pays principle to the regulation of financial services. </p><p>The following table shows the planned trajectory for levy rates across all sectors. Credit Union recovery rates from 2022 onwards will be subject to review and a public consultation to guide strategy once 50% recovery rates have been achieved. The Central Bank published this trajectory on 14 June 2019 and it is available on the Central Bank website at the following link: </p><p><b><i>Table 2: Trajectory of recovery rates to fund the cost of Financial Regulation</i></b><table><tr><th>Levy Year</th><th>2017</th><th>2018</th><th>2019</th><th>2020 </th><th>2021 </th><th>2022 </th><th>2023 </th><th>2024 </th></tr><tr><td>Levied in  </td><td>2017</td><td>2018</td><td>2020</td><td>2021</td><td>2022</td><td>2023</td><td>2024</td><td>2025</td></tr><tr><td>ELG Banks</td><td>100%</td><td>100%</td><td>100%</td><td>100%</td><td>100%</td><td>100%</td><td>100%</td><td>100%</td></tr><tr><td>Banks</td><td>65%</td><td>80%</td><td>90%</td><td>100%</td><td>100%</td><td>100%</td><td>100%</td><td>100%</td></tr><tr><td>Insurance Undertakings</td><td>65%</td><td>80%</td><td>90%</td><td>100%</td><td>100%</td><td>100%</td><td>100%</td><td>100%</td></tr><tr><td>Investment Firms &amp;amp; Fund Service Providers</td><td>65%</td><td>80%</td><td>90%</td><td>100%</td><td>100%</td><td>100%</td><td>100%</td><td>100%</td></tr><tr><td>Funds</td><td>65%</td><td>65%</td><td>80%</td><td>90%</td><td>100%</td><td>100%</td><td>100%</td><td>100%</td></tr><tr><td>Retail Intermediaries &amp;amp; Debt Management Co&rsquo;s</td><td>50%</td><td>65%</td><td>70%</td><td>75%</td><td>80%</td><td>90%</td><td>100%</td><td>100%</td></tr><tr><td>Moneylenders</td><td>65%</td><td>65%</td><td>70%</td><td>75%</td><td>80%</td><td>90%</td><td>100%</td><td>100%</td></tr><tr><td>Approved Professional Bodies</td><td>65%</td><td>65%</td><td>70%</td><td>75%</td><td>80%</td><td>90%</td><td>100%</td><td>100%</td></tr><tr><td>Bureau de Change/Money Transmitters</td><td>65%</td><td>65%</td><td>70%</td><td>75%</td><td>80%</td><td>90%</td><td>100%</td><td>100%</td></tr><tr><td>Retail Credit / Home Reversion / Credit Servicing Firms</td><td>65%</td><td>65%</td><td>70%</td><td>75%</td><td>80%</td><td>90%</td><td>100%</td><td>100%</td></tr><tr><td>Payment &amp;amp; EMoney Institutions</td><td>65%</td><td>65%</td><td>70%</td><td>75%</td><td>80%</td><td>90%</td><td>100%</td><td>100%</td></tr></table></p><p>Invoices for 2019 levies will issue on an arrears basis in Quarter 3 2020 as the Central Bank implements its strategy to move from levies based on budgeted to lives based on actual costs.  This is to address an aspect of volatility in response to industry feedback by eliminating large balancing surpluses and deficits (as identified above) in favour of levies based on the Central Bank&rsquo;s audited financial statements. While businesses should accrue for 2019 costs in their financial statements, many will welcome the cashflow effect arising from this change.  </p><p>Further information can be found in the Funding Strategy and Guide to the 2018 Industry Funding Regulation, where the Central Bank set out its 3-year funding strategy.

Government budgetary policy is formulated based on what is right for the economy given our position in the economic cycle, not by a narrow, literal interpretation of what is permissible under the fiscal rules.</p><p>Table A1 of the Summer Economic Statement 2019 sets out an itemised 'walk' from the gross fiscal space permitted within the expenditure benchmark pillar of the European fiscal rules to net fiscal space. </p><p>This difference between gross and net fiscal space takes account of the measures that have already been provided for within the fiscal projections. The residual - net fiscal space - represents an additional amount on top of the existing budgetary increases that a literal application of the fiscal rules would allow. Using net fiscal space therefore worsens the headline general government balance.</p><p>The breakdown of pre-committed voted expenditure is shown in block <i>j</i>. The table details amounts that have been budgeted for in relation to demographics, the Public Service Stability Agreement and the carryover of Budget 2019 measures. As these all relate to current expenditure measures the nominal and fiscal space cost is the same. </p><p>However, as this table relates to fiscal space the amount shown for voted capital expenditure represents the smoothing over a four-year period in accordance with European fiscal rules. The corresponding nominal increase for 2020 is &euro;0.7 billion, as noted elsewhere in the Summer Economic Statement.</p><p>Row <i>k</i>delineates the movement related to &lsquo;other expenditure&rsquo;.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-07-02a.398.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019070200063#WRF02800"><p>At the outset, the Deputy should note that I am responsible for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation.  Neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  Consequently, I am not in a position to direct insurance companies as to the price or the level of cover to be provided to motorists, including young motorists.</p><p>I understand that motor insurers use a combination of rating factors in making their individual decisions on whether to offer cover and what terms to apply.  Factors include those such as the age of the driver and the relevant driving experience, as well as the age and type of vehicle, how the vehicle is used, the claims record, and the number of drivers.  Insurers do not all use the same combination of rating factors, and as a result prices vary across the market.  In addition, insurance companies also price in accordance with their own past claims experience.  I acknowledge the point that it would be helpful if insurers provided appropriately anonymised actuarial data to support their case with regard to pricing policy for younger motorists, however insurers argue that such information is commercially sensitive and unfortunately I am not in a position to compel them to disclose such information.  </p><p>Notwithstanding the above, the Cost of Insurance Working Group was established in July 2016 and undertook an examination of the factors contributing to the increasing cost of insurance in order to identify what short, medium and long-term measures could be introduced to help reduce the cost of insurance for consumers and businesses.  The initial focus of the Working Group was the issue of rising motor insurance premiums and as part of that exercise, there was and has been extensive interaction with the insurance industry and its representative bodies.  The <i>Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance</i>was published in January 201 and makes 33 recommendations with 71 associated actions to be carried out in agreed timeframes, which are set out in an Action Plan.  In January 2018, the Working Group published the <i>Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance.  </i>This Report makes a further 15 Recommendations with 29 associated actions.  While this Report is focussed on addressing issues linked to business insurance, the implementation of recommendations from both reports will have a positive impact for all consumers and businesses including young motorists.  </p><p>There has been significant work to date in implementing the recommendations of the two aforementioned reports, including the following:</p><p>- the establishment of the Personal Injuries Commission, and its subsequent recommendations relating to addressing award levels for soft tissue injuries &ndash; this has provided the objective evidence we need to be able to address award levels;</p><p>- the establishment of the National Claims Information Database in the Central Bank to increase transparency around the future cost of private motor insurance;</p><p>- reforms to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board through the <i>Personal Injuries Assessment Board (Amendment) Act 2019</i>;</p><p>- amendments to Sections 8 and 14 of the <i>Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004</i>to make it easier for businesses and insurers to challenge cases where fraud or exaggeration is suspected;</p><p>- the reform of the Insurance Compensation Fund to provide certainty to policyholders and insurers; and,</p><p>- various reforms of how fraud is reported to and dealt with by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including increased co-ordination with the insurance industry, as well as the recent decision by the Garda Commissioner to develop a divisional focus on insurance fraud which will be guided by the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (GNECB) which will also train Garda&iacute; all over the country on investigating insurance fraud, and the recent success under <i>Operation Coatee</i>, which targets insurance-related criminality.  </p><p>I believe that these reforms are having a significant impact with regard to private motor insurance (CSO figures from May 2019 show that the price of motor insurance is now 24.5% lower than the July 2016 peak).  </p><p>Undoubtedly the single most essential challenge which must be overcome if there is to be a further sustainable reduction in insurance costs for motorists is to bring the levels of personal injury damages awarded in this country more in line with those awarded in other jurisdictions.  In this regard, the Personal Injuries Commission has highlighted the significant differential between award levels in Ireland and other jurisdictions, and has made a number of recommendations to address this issue, in particular the establishment of a Judicial Council to compile guidelines for appropriate general damages for various types of personal injury.  In this regard, relevant amendments were agreed to the Judicial Council Bill at Report Stage in the Seanad two weeks ago and I am pleased that the Bill subsequently completed its consideration by the Seanad.  This is a significant step and both I and Minister of State D&rsquo;Arcy are hopeful that the Bill can now complete its consideration by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and be enacted before the summer recess.</p><p>Finally, I would advise younger drivers who are quoted increased premiums to consult the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission website (), which has an informative section regarding the purchase of car insurance generally.  One of the key tips listed to help cut costs is to &ldquo;shop around&rdquo; and &ldquo;always get quotes from several insurance providers when you need to get or renew insurance&rdquo;.  Insurance Ireland also operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to obtaining insurance.  Insurance Ireland can be contacted at feedback@insuranceireland.eu or 01-6761914.</p></reply>

The UCITS Directive sets out a common set of rules for the cross-border distribution of collective investment schemes via the European Passport.

The Irish Real Estate Funds (IREF) regime was introduced in Finance Act 2016 in response to concerns raised regarding the use of certain collective investment vehicles to invest in Irish property. Investors had been using the structures to minimise their exposure to Irish tax on Irish property transactions. The regime provides, with some exceptions, that where a unit holder receives value from the IREF, an IREF withholding tax of 20% will generally apply. </p><p>In respect of the value of assets held by Irish Real Estate Funds (IREFs), only partial information is available from the IREF tax returns filed with Revenue for the years 2017 and 2018. In this regard, IREFs are required to file an IREF tax return only where they have a taxable event in a particular year and therefore not all IREFs will have made returns for these years. The initial information in relation to IREFs that have made a return is available at .</p><p>IREFs were required by regulation to file annual financial statements on or before 30 January 2019 with Revenue for accounting periods which ended during 2017 and accounting periods which ended on or before 30 June 2018. The information contained on the financial statements is currently being reviewed and analysed by Revenue. Once this analysis is completed, Revenue will be in a position to provide more detail on the value of Irish real estate held by IREFs. </p><p>In relation to the Deputy's question different types of funds, authorised investment funds in Ireland are established as either Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS) or Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs). The IREF regime does not apply to UCITS funds as UCITS are widely-held retail funds with diversification requirements. AIFs are authorised by the Central Bank as either a Qualifying Investor AIF (QIAIF) or a Retail Investor AIF (RIAIF).  IREFs are generally structured as unit trusts, Irish collective asset-management vehicles (ICAVs) or as a designated investment company. I am advised by Revenue that, as previously stated, as the analysis of IREF financial statements has not yet completed, Revenue is not currently in a position to provide the information requested by the Deputy.  I expect this analysis to conclude, and to be in a position to provide the resulting data to Deputies, in the near future.</p></reply>

The Central Bank has included specific chapters within the Credit Union Handbook which deal with Lending and Savings, Chapters 13 and 19 respectively. The Credit Union Handbook is available at the following link: </p><p>In relation to lending, on 24 October 2018 the Central Bank published Consultation Paper (CP125) on potential changes to the lending framework for credit unions. The proposals contained in CP125 include the removal of the existing lending maturity limits which cap the percentage of credit union lending which may be outstanding for periods of greater than 5 and 10 years, and the introduction of concentration limits, on a tiered basis, for home mortgage and commercial loans expressed as a percentage of total assets.</p><p>The consultation period closed on 9 January 2019. Following its review of feedback received, in accordance with statutory requirements, the Central Bank will be undertaking consultations with myself, the Credit Union Advisory Committee and credit union representative bodies on proposed draft regulations. Following this the Central Bank expects to publish a feedback statement and final regulations in the latter half of 2019. </p><p>In terms of savings, the Credit Union Act 1997 (Regulatory Requirements) Regulations 2016 (the 2016 Regulations) set an individual savings limit of &euro;100,000 that applies on a per member basis. The 2016 Regulations also provided that credit unions could apply to the Central Bank to retain individual members&rsquo; savings in excess of &euro;100,000, which were held at commencement of the Regulations and that credit unions with total assets in excess of &euro;100 million can apply to the Central Bank for approval to increase individual member savings in excess of &euro;100,000. </p><p>The introduction of the savings limit by the Central Bank followed a public consultation, CP88 - <i>Consultation on Regulations for Credit Unions on commencement of the remaining sections of the 2012 Act</i>.  In the feedback statement to CP88, the Central Bank outlined that having considered the feedback received the Central Bank was of the view that an individual members savings limit of &euro;100,000 is appropriate given the stage of development of the sector and the Central Bank&rsquo;s mandate to ensure the protection of members&rsquo; funds by credit unions and safeguarding the stability of the sector.</p><p>The Deputy might also be interested to note that I will be bringing forward the Credit Union Interest on Loans Bill 2019 shortly. This bill will amend the current one per cent per month interest rate ceiling for credit unions, permitting credit unions to charge up to two per cent per month. This amendment will provide credit unions with greater flexibility to risk price loan products and in so doing may create an opportunity for credit unions to provide new product offerings.</p></reply>

The term charge-back can cover many circumstances.  Requests for refunds may be handled by the card issuer in accordance with rules established by industry.  </p>  <p>  It may be helpful, however, to outline the legal position in respect of unauthorised and incorrectly executed payments.  The European Union (Payment Services) Regulations 2018 (S.I. No. 6 of 2018), transposed the Payment Services Directive (&ldquo;PSD2&rdquo;) into Irish law and establish common rules for certain types of electronic payments, including card payments.  Under these rules, a payment service user is entitled to rectification of an unauthorised or incorrectly executed payment transaction from a payment service provider where the payment service user notifies the payment service provider.  The payment service user must make this notification without undue delay, and no later than 13 months after the debit date.  The payer's payment service provider must refund the amount of any unauthorised payment transaction immediately and in any event not later than the end of the following business day, except where fraud is suspected.</p>  <p>  I would advise any person who is not satisfied with the actions of a card issuer in respect of an unauthorised or incorrectly executed payment transaction to make a complaint under the company's internal complaint resolution process.  If they are not satisfied with the outcome of the complaint, they can make a complaint to the independent Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.  Investigations by the Ombudsman are free of charge to the complainant.</p></reply>

This is a technical assumption embedded in the projections.</p>  <p>  The origin of the technical tax reductions dates back to the full application of net fiscal space, with the indicative allocation set out in the SES 2016 (table 2).  In line with the Programme for Partnership Government this was distributed on a 2:1 basis between spending and tax to present an illustrative budgetary package.  This assumption is carried forward within the extended range of fiscal forecasts.</p>  <p>  The indicative nominal budgetary package in table 6 of the SES 2019 is consistent with this.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the exact amounts and distribution between revenue and expenditure is a matter for Government and will be announced at the time of the respective Budget.  Such decisions will take into account the economic and social circumstances at that time and also the desired objectives.</p></reply>

This represents a substantial starting point. </p>  <p>  On top of that, the so-called automatic stabilisers will kick in which will help cushion the economy.  The automatic stabilisers refer to the counter-cyclical support that the public finances provide to the economy through social protection payments occasioned by higher unemployment and on the revenue side, lower tax collections which help cushion aggregate demand.  </p>  <p>  In addition, supports providing temporary targeted funding for the most affected sectors will be deployed as appropriate.</p>  <p>  The initial analysis is that the overall impact on the public finances of a disorderly Brexit would be a reduction in the General Government Balance of an illustrative order of &euro;6&frac12; billion.</p></reply>

To qualify for a Primary Medical Certificate, an applicant must satisfy one of the following conditions:</p><p>- be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs;</p><p>- be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs;</p><p>- be without both hands or without both arms;</p><p>- be without one or both legs;</p><p>- be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg;</p><p>- have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.</p><p>The Scheme represents a significant tax expenditure.  Between the Vehicle Registration Tax and VAT foregone, and the fuel grant, the scheme cost &euro;65m in each of 2016 and 2017, rising to &euro;70m in 2018.  This figure does not include the revenue foregone in respect of the relief from Motor Tax provided to members of the Scheme.

However, given the scope and scale of the scheme, any possible changes to it can only be made after careful consideration, taking into account the existing and prospective cost of the scheme as well as the availability of other schemes which seek to help with the mobility of disabled persons, and the interaction between each of these schemes.  </p><p>Accordingly, I have no plans to amend the qualifying medical criteria for the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers Scheme at this time.</p><p>Finally, I would like to point out that legislation is being brought forward by the Minister for Health to replace the closed Motorised Transport Grant.</p></reply>

Revenue will not have the relevant information until after the relief has been applied for.  Furthermore, it is not possible to estimate the number of additional jobs likely to be created in the two years under the schemes. </p><p>However, the Exchequer costs and amounts of investment raised from the start of the incentive until 2017 are as follows: <table><tr><th><b>Year   </b></th><th><b>1st Tranche Exchequer Cost &euro;m </b></th><th><b>2nd Tranche Exchequer Cost &euro;m   </b></th><th><b>Amount Invested &euro;m   </b></th></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>18.6</td><td>N/A</td><td>62.1</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>31</td><td>N/A</td><td>103.1</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>28</td><td>N/A</td><td>93.4</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>23.3</td><td>2</td><td>77.8</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>17.3</td><td>2.9</td><td>57.6</td></tr><tr><td>2011/2012</td><td>15.7</td><td>3.2</td><td>52.2</td></tr></table></p><p>A statistical report on the Employment and Investment Incentive (EII) is available on the Revenue website at: </p><p>In relation to value for money and as the Deputy may be aware, in 2018 I commissioned Indecon Economic Consultants to carry out a review which included an examination of the impact and cost effectiveness of EII (Chapter 5).  The report is available at the following link: . </p><p>The review found that the EII &quot;should continue to be provided in order to facilitate funding for Irish based SMEs and start-ups&quot;. </p><p>The review also made a number of proposals for changes to the incentive to enhance its efficiency and effectiveness and, in Finance Act 2018, I brought forward a priority package of measures to address the main shortcomings identified with the scheme.  </p><p>The changes made put in place an amended applications process incorporating a move to a largely self-certification model as well as a substantially revised, simplified and updated legislative text in Part 16 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  In addition, they included the introduction of a new Start-up Capital Incentive to facilitate investment in very small enterprises.  Finally, the operation of the EII and SURE schemes was extended for a further year to the end of 2021</p><p>The move to self-certification has brought EII in line with other similar tax reliefs.  While Revenue will still offer some guidance where requested, it is now within the control of the company to determine their qualification under the incentive and avail of the relief as they deem appropriate.</p><p>Subject to further analysis which is currently being undertaken, it is possible that further legislative changes may be brought forward in the context of this year's Budget and Finance Bill process with the aim of ensuring that the EII schemes operate as intended in an efficient and effective manner.  In this regard, the Deputy may wish to note that my Department recently carried out a public consultation process on tax incentives aimed at the SME sector across a number of tax heads.  The EII schemes were included in that process. </p><p>With respect to the debt vs. equity nature and form of the investment, the Indecon report suggested that all shares would be new ordinary shares.  However, consideration was given to the fact that investors would not necessarily want these new ordinary shares and would therefore not invest.  As such, I decided that other forms of share capital could be allowable under the scheme.  The scheme was amended to allow redeemable, cumulative, preference share capital, provided that, it is not possible to amend the terms of those shares, for example, through side agreements that would otherwise reduce the risk. </p><p>Finally Revenue has also advised me that it is not possible to identify the number of additional jobs created by the EII from 2012 to 2017.  However, in its 2018 review, Indecon found strong overall growth in employment of firms who received EII.</p></reply>

These projections also formed the basis for the Summer Economic Statement. The 2018 outturn figures reflect the expenditure incurred in respect of the Social Protection Christmas Bonus for 2018. </p>  <p>  Payment in respect of a Christmas Bonus commenced again in 2014, initially at a rate of 25%. The percentage rate has increased each year since 2014 and reached 100% in 2018. In line with the practice that such payments are funded based on the fiscal position for the year, in each of the years 2014 to 2019, the Revised Estimates Volume did not include a specific allocation in respect of a Social Welfare Christmas Bonus. This reflects the fact that the decision on paying a bonus, including the rate of that bonus, takes into account the overall fiscal position each year. Given that the decision to pay a Christmas Bonus this year relates to 2019 expenditure, it would not impact on the unallocated resources of &euro;700 million available for 2020 outlined in the Summer Economic Statement.</p>  <p>  The Christmas Bonus is paid both from funds voted by the D&aacute;il and from the Social Insurance Fund. At the end of May, the surplus on the Social Insurance Fund was &euro;120 million ahead of profile, driven by strong growth in PRSI receipts, and net voted expenditure of the Social Protection Vote was &euro;19 million below profile.  A continuation of these trends in receipts and expenditure would see such upside being available as an offset against the impact on the General Government Balance of any budgetary decision in respect of a Christmas Bonus payment for 2019. </p>  <p>  On the broader question of making our multi-year current expenditure projections more robust, both in the light of the analysis offered by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, and of my experience of managing current expenditure, I have decided in the Summer Economic Statement, published last week, to increase the rate of current expenditure growth post 2020 to 3 &frac14; per cent. Taking into account projected capital expenditure growth, this allows for an annual increase in gross total expenditure of c. 3 &frac12; per cent over the period 2021 to 2024. This is an appropriate level of growth, given the uncertainties arising in the external environment and the current position in the economic cycle. It is in this context that the scope for annual resource allocations, including the question of an annual Christmas bonus, will fall to be determined. </p></reply>

Current expenditure pre-commitments relating to demographics, the Public Service Stability Agreement, and the carryover of Budget 2019 measures amount to &euro;1.2 billion with &euro;0.7 billion for additional investment on capital programmes as set out in the NDP. As set out in the SES,  as part of the Budget 2020 estimates process, consideration will be given to the funding of additional costs in relation to the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital and the National Broadband Plan reflecting the most up-to-date position relating to capital spending at the time. Given these potential additional costs, the SES includes an expenditure reserve of up to &euro;0.2 billion for 2020 to accommodate funding requirements for the National Broadband Plan and the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital. This expenditure reserve represents the potential additional funding that may need to be met for these projects next year from within the overall budgetary package of &euro;2.8 billion. Consequently, after taking account of the expenditure pre-commitments of &euro;1.9 billion and the expenditure reserve of up to &euro;0.2 billion this leaves &euro;0.7 billion to be specifically allocated as part of Budget 2020.

Inclusive in this pre-committed expenditure is an increase in capital expenditure of &euro;0.7 billion as set out in the National Development Plan. Further to this, there is an expenditure reserve of up to &euro;0.2 billion to be established in 2020 to accommodate funding requirements for the National Broadband Plan and National Children&rsquo;s Hospital. This expenditure reserve relates to capital expenditure and consequently, this would result in an overall nominal increase in capital expenditure of up to &euro;0.9 billion. After taking account of the expenditure pre-commitments and the expenditure reserve, this leaves &euro;0.7 billion of unallocated funding available in 2020. </p>  <p>  Table 7 and Annex 1 of the Summer Economic Statement set out indicative estimates of &lsquo;fiscal space&rsquo; out to 2024. The amount of &euro;1.1 billion shown in respect of capital/NDP expenditure in Annex 1 takes into account the smoothing over a four-year period in accordance with the Expenditure Benchmark methodology. Consequently, as this calculation reflects the significant increases in Gross Fixed Capital Formation since 2016, the capital expenditure impact on the fiscal space calculation exceeds the nominal increase in capital expenditure outlined above. </p></reply>

The Act provides a &ldquo;stepped disclosure regime&rdquo; that allows workers to report wrongdoing internally to their employer or externally to a competent authority or, subject to certain conditions, to make a public disclosure. Workers in public bodies also have the option of making a disclosure to the relevant Government Minister. Protections against retaliation take the form of civil remedies available through the Workplace Relations Commission or the courts.</p>  <p>  Most protected disclosures are made by workers to their employers and, in the majority of cases, are dealt with internally by the employer. In addition, it is not necessary for a worker to explicitly state they are making a protected disclosure in the course of reporting a wrongdoing. Accordingly, it is not possible to accurately determine how many reports of wrongdoing that would be covered by the Protected Disclosures Act have been made in total since the Act came into force.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may, however, wish to note that research by Transparency International Ireland, published in the Speak Up Report 2017, found that one in ten workers will make a report of wrongdoing during the course of their careers. Furthermore, Section 22 of the Act requires public bodies to report each year on the number of protected disclosures made to them. While this information is not normally collated centrally, my Department compiled the data published by public bodies as part of the Statutory Review of the Act, published last year, and found that 370 protected disclosures were made to public bodies between 2014 and 2016. There is no equivalent obligation on the private sector to report on the numbers of disclosures made so a complete picture of the overall numbers of disclosures is not available.</p></reply>

The purpose of these reviews is to strengthen the existing guidance to better align with the realities of project delivery and with a particular focus on improved financial appraisal, cost estimation and management.  </p><p>The following reforms will be considered and implemented as part of the Public Spending Code review:</p><p>- Strengthen and harmonise capital appraisal guidance;</p><p>- Greater clarity on governance  and roles and responsibilities, particular in terms of who is the Sanctioning Authority and who is the Sponsoring Agency for major projects; </p><p>- Introduce new mechanisms to improve the accuracy of cost estimates;</p><p>- Improve project life cycle to better reflect the realities of project delivery; and</p><p>- Complement the Project Ireland 2040 Capital Tracker in monitoring projects and costs.</p><p>The revised central elements of the Public Spending Code relating to the appraisal and management of public capital projects will be published this summer.  Further technical guidance building upon these central elements will follow in the second half of 2019 and in 2020.</p><p>Procurement legislation is established on an EU wide basis through the suite of procurement directives. The most recent directives were issued in 2014 and have all been transposed into Irish law by means of Statutory Instrument.</p><p>The Capital Works Management Framework (&quot;CWMF&quot;) is the structure that has been developed to deliver the Government&rsquo;s objectives in relation to public sector construction procurement reform. It consists of a suite of best practice guidance, standard contracts and generic template documents that must be used on all projects that are to be delivered under the Exchequer-funded element of the National Development Plan (&quot;NDP&quot;).  It is managed by the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) in consultation with the Government Contracts Committee for Construction (GCCC).  </p><p>The performance of a key component of the CWMF; the public works contract, was reviewed in 2014 and a series of recommendations that apply to the conditions of contract have been implemented since 2016.</p><p>That review prompted the OGP to undertake a broader review of the procurement of public works projects in order to develop the next generation of the CWMF.  </p><p>A set of objectives have been developed to manage the review process which will permit a progressive refinement of the CWMF rather than awaiting the completion of the entire work programme prior to implementation.  Enhanced risk management throughout a project&rsquo;s life cycle and quality of information will inform all aspects of the work programme.  </p><p>Consultation has already commenced with industry and the public bodies charged with the delivery of public works projects on a broad range of issues that are impacting on the successful and timely delivery of projects.  These are wide ranging and warrant careful consideration and cover areas such as: </p><p>- price variation;</p><p>- risk management;</p><p>- creating a better quality : price balance in the award of contracts;</p><p>- adoption of BIM on public works projects;</p><p>- liability, indemnity and insurance requirements;</p><p>- performance evaluation;</p><p>- encouraging collaborative working.</p><p>It is proposed to publish a range of position papers throughout 2019 and 2020 on these and other issues and invite submissions from interested parties.  Upon conclusion of the consultation process recommendations will be prepared by the GCCC on the measures necessary to address any shortcomings identified.  </p><p>The programme commenced with a focus on the early stages of a project&rsquo;s development with the publication of a position paper on the engagement of the consultant technical professionals upon which submissions have been received.  The paper focusses on improving the manner in which consultants are engaged to provide expert advice to contracting authorities on matters such as design, cost estimating, project management, procurement and contract administration.</p></reply>

His Department is the Sponsoring Agency for the project, while Government is the Sanctioning Authority.</p>  <p>  The Public Spending Code is the set of rules and procedures that are in place to support public bodies in achieving value for money as they implement all projects, including major projects, through the course of the project&rsquo;s lifecycle. Each project works through a lifecycle from project identification, appraisal/business case, planning &amp;amp; design, procurement and implementation, to review.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has responsibility for the Public Spending Code, including the current review of the Code.  However, responsibility for complying with all of the requirements of the Public Spending Code is a matter for each Sponsoring Agency and Sanctioning Authority.</p>  <p>  I was informed about Eir withdrawing from the procurement process for the National Broadband Plan, and the correspondence from Eir's Chief Executive Officer to the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, when this happened in 2018. </p>  <p>  In terms of engaging with Eir on their recent statements on the National Broadband Plan, these are matters, in the first instance, for the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, as the Minister responsible for the procurement process on the National Broadband Plan.  However, officials from my Department will, of course, be liaising with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment on the issue, and will seek to be kept informed in relation to that Department's engagement with Eir and any developments that may emerge from that process.</p></reply>

It is open to any school to make an application to the NCSE to establish a special class. In deciding where to establish a special class in an area, the NCSE take account of the current and projected demand and the available school accommodation both current and planned.  In this regard, the SENO may approach individual schools to discuss the matter with a view to finding the optimal location in terms of convenience and sustainability.</p>  <p>  When the NCSE sanction a special class in a school, the school can apply to my Department for capital funding to reconfigure existing spaces within the school building to accommodate the class and/or to construct additional accommodation.   </p>  <p>  The number of ASD special classes has more than doubled in the last 5 years from 511 in 2014 to 1,196 across the country now. Provision in special schools has increased from 6,848 placements in 2011 to 7,872 this year. The NCSE has informed my Department that they intend to establish approximately 156 new ASD special classes nationally for 2019/20 school year to meet currently identified need.</p>  <p>  Details of all special classes for children with special educational needs are available by county on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie.</p>  <p>  From time to time, the NCSE identifies local areas where additional special class provision is required. In those circumstances, Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) work with the schools and families concerned to resolve the issues involved. </p>  <p>  As the matter raised by the Deputy refers to an individual child, I have arranged for the Deputy's question to be forwarded to the National Council for Special Education for direct reply.</p></reply>

My Department has commenced the process of restoring capitation this year with a 5% increase in capitation funding that will apply from the start of the 2019/2020 school year. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, my colleague, the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Regina Doherty T.D., has recently announced an increase to the back to school allowance for the 2019/2020 school, bringing the total budget provision for the scheme to over &euro;56 million this year.</p>  <p>  I also want to give parents a strong voice in ensuring costs are always kept to a minimum. My Department published a Circular in 2017 which details the measures to be adopted by schools to reduce the cost of school uniforms and other costs. In addition, work on the drafting of the Education (Student and Parent Charter) Bill 2019 is close to being finalised and I intend to seek Government approval shortly for its publication. Under the Bill, each school will be required to prepare, publish and implement a Student and Parent Charter in accordance with national guidelines to be published by the Minister after consultation with the education partners. The charter legislation will include requirements for consultation and engagement with parents and students on matters relating to school life and will include provision for full transparency in relation to costs and the use of any voluntary contributions sought by schools.</p>  <p>  I believe that these actions will also significantly strengthen the focus on reducing back to school costs for parents.</p></reply>

The challenges identified included matters relating to teacher allocation, the curriculum, recruitment of staff, travel and independent and DEIS status for island schools. </p><p>As a result of its deliberations, including meetings with representatives from Galway/Roscommon ETB and Donegal ETB, under whose auspices the five post-primary schools located on the islands operate, the working group recommended the provision of an additional package of supports for island post-primary schools from September 2018<b>.</b></p><p>This ring-fenced package of supports for island post-primary schools, which is additional to the supports which are being provided under the Gaeltacht School Recognition Scheme in which all of the 5 island post-primary schools are participating, is set out in the following table.</p><p>In relation to the recruitment of teachers by island schools, as part of the overall implementation of the Policy on Gaeltacht Education 2017-2022, my Department has made arrangements and provided funding for the commencement of two new Irish medium teacher education programmes to increase the supply of teachers who can deliver high quality Irish-medium education. These programmes include a 2 year part-time Irish-medium M.Ed. in Irish-medium and Gaeltacht Education, which commenced in Mary Immaculate College in September 2018 and a 4 year full-time B.Ed Irish-medium initial teacher education programme, which will commence in Marino Institute of Education from September 2019. Funding is being provided for 30 new places per annum on each of the two new programmes. In addition, provision has been made for the secondment of two teaching posts to the Irish-medium Professional Masters in Education at NUIG to work towards increasing the number of teachers who can teach a range of subjects through the medium of Irish.</p><p>Another initiative, which is being implemented under the Policy on Gaeltacht Education is the e-hub pilot project, which aims to utilise online delivery to extend the subject range available through the medium of Irish to students in isolated post-primary Gaeltacht schools, commencing with Higher Level Leaving Certificate Physics.  3 of the 5 island post-primary schools will be participating in the pilot project commencing from September 2019. This will enable students in these schools to undertake the Higher Level Leaving Certificate Physics examination in 2021.</p><p>In relation to the assignation of DEIS status to island schools, such schools are assessed on the same basis as all other schools in the country for the purposes of inclusion in the programme<i>. </i>This assessment is based on data in the DES Primary Online Database (POD) and Post-Primary Online (PPOD) Databases, and CSO data from the National Census of Population as represented in the Pobal HP Index for Small Areas which is a method of measuring the relative affluence or disadvantage of a particular geographical area. A detailed document explaining the methodology used in the Identification process under DEIS plan 2017 is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.education.ie/en/Schools-Colleges/Services/DEIS-Delivering-Equality-of-Opportunity-in-Schools-/DEIS-Identification-Process.pdf.  <i></i></p><p>DEIS Plan 2017 states that the improved data on the socio-demographic of schools resulting from the new identification model will have an impact not only on the assessment of schools for inclusion in the programme but also on the scaling of resources to allow for more graduated levels of support.  This is turn allows for the ultimate objective of allocating resources to best meet the identified need of individual schools.</p><p>My Department is currently undertaking data analysis in the context of resource allocation to match identified need, including the examination of variables known to be strong predictors of educational disadvantage.  All schools, including Island Schools, are being considered using the new identification model. Until this analysis is complete, it is not intended to extend the DEIS programme to any further schools.</p></reply>

The use of digital technologies, allows teachers to unlock and deepen learning across all areas including literacy, numeracy, languages, arts education and STEM. Students will be able to recognise the benefits of the online interconnected world as an important source of information to create knowledge and problem solve and not just see the internet as a source of information to be &ldquo;consumed&rdquo;. Through the effective use of technology students will learn to collaborate and create with their peers. They will develop research, analytical, creativity and communication skills which will support their future careers and strengthen their lifelong prospects </p>  <p>  The Digital Strategy for Schools acknowledges that the embedding of digital technologies in teaching and learning is a complex endeavour. The important focus, as provided for in the Digital Strategy, must be for digital technologies to add value to the learning process as part of a suite of tools in the classroom, such as books and whiteboards, alongside more modern learning devices, to enhance teaching and learning. It was for this reason that the Digital Learning Framework was developed together with the extensive range of CPD programmes for teachers and schools on the effective use of digital technologies in the classroom/schools. The Framework provides a roadmap to help schools embed the use of digital technologies in teaching and learning and in leadership &amp;amp; management. The Framework promotes student engagement in the teaching and learning process whereby students become engaged thinkers, active and discerning learners and where digital interactions are respectful and positive and conductive to well-being. </p>  <p>   In the context of the DLF, schools are supported to develop a Digital Learning Plan, and have flexibility to determine how best to embed the use of digital technologies in teaching and learning in their school, taking into account their individual circumstances and contexts.  The DLF supports and complements the School Self Evaluation (SSE) process and will allow schools to evaluate their own progress and measure where they stand against benchmarks of effective and highly effective practices in the use of digital technologies in teaching and learning and leadership and management. The Framework does not provide for comparison of academic performances. </p>  <p>  The Framework is in its second year of dissemination and is accompanied by an extensive CPD framework for teachers and schools.  </p>  <p>  My Department has also commissioned the ERC to conduct a more longitudinal study of the DLF of a three year duration. This study commenced in January 2019. The focus of the Evaluation will be the implementation of the Digital Learning Framework from the multiple perspectives of school principals, teachers, learners and Digital Learning Team leaders over a three-year period. </p></reply>

Some schools received slightly reduced allocations, where the data indicates less need, and some schools maintained their existing allocations.</p><p>No school has lost a full special education teaching post as a result of the re profiling process.</p><p>There  has also been be no reduction to the overall number of special education teaching posts within the school system. There are currently over 13,400 special education teachers in schools, an increase of 37% since 2011.</p><p>Under the allocation model, schools have been provided with a total allocation for special education needs support based on their school profile. </p><p>The school referred to by the Deputy has 15.95 special education teaching hours, for an enrolment of 45 pupils at the time the profile was developed. </p><p>This represents a proportionately a high allocation ratio, which takes into account the school profile. </p><p>It gives an average allocation of 1 special education teacher to every 71 pupils, as opposed to a national average of 1 special education teacher to every 100 pupils in the primary school sector.</p><p>Both my Department and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) are committed to ensuring that all schools are treated equally and fairly in the manner in which their school profiles have been calculated.</p><p>Accordingly, a number of review processes have been put in place to support schools.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) published details of an appeal process for the 2019 allocation process for schools on their website . </p><p>Schools were advised that the appeal will consider circumstances where schools considered that their school profile was calculated incorrectly, using the data set out in DES Circulars 007 and 008 2019. An appeal could be submitted for a review of the information used and of the calculation of the allocation. </p><p>The NCSE wrote to schools on 31st May, 2019 to advise them of the outcome of the appeals. </p><p>A second process will be put in place to address circumstances where the school profile significantly changed following the allocation process e.g. a developing school where the net enrolment numbers significantly increased.</p><p>The criteria for qualification for mainstream school developing school posts are set out in the Primary and Post Primary School Staffing Schedule for the 2019/20 school year.</p><p>Schools who qualify for additional mainstream developing school posts, in accordance with these criteria, will also qualify for additional Special Education Teaching Allocations to take account of this developing status. </p><p>Finally, it is acknowledged that there are some circumstances, which may arise in schools, which fall outside the appeals process, or allocations for developing school status. </p><p>These relate to exceptional or emergency circumstances which could not have been anticipated e.g. where the school profile changes very significantly, or where other exceptional circumstances have arisen in a school and which may require a review of schools capacity to provide additional teaching support for all pupils who need it in the school, or of their utilisation of their allocations.</p><p>A process will also be available where schools can seek a review of their allocations in the coming months, including the utilisation of their allocations, in circumstances where a school considers that very exceptional circumstances have arisen subsequent to the development of the profile.  </p><p>This process will recommence in September 2019. </p><p>I am satisfied that there are in place a number of processes which can review the special education teacher allocation for schools where necessary.</p><p>The very significant levels of additional provision we have made in recent years to provide additional Special Education Teachers means that all schools are resourced to provide for the special educational needs of children in their schools.</p></reply>

Section 64 of the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018, which was commenced in October 2018, explicitly prohibits the charging of fees or seeking payment or contributions for admission to or for continued enrolment in a school. No charge may be made, in respect of instruction in any subject of the school curriculum or for recreation or other activities where all pupils are expected to take part.</p>  <p>  When a child is enrolled in a school certain charges may be legitimately requested such as:</p>  <p>  -  payment for school books, lockers, text messages or photocopied material provided by the school where the charge is reasonable and simply reflects the true costs concerned; or </p>  <p>  -  charges for meals and refreshments provided pupils are not obliged to purchase same and can bring their own refreshments to school (e.g. lunchbox); or </p>  <p>  -  payments in respect of extra-curricular activities provided such activities are not obligatory and individual pupils can choose whether or not to participate.  </p>  <p>  However, as outlined above such charges may not be used as a condition of admission to a school placement. It is permissible for a school to seek payments in respect of extra-curricular activities provided such activities are not obligatory and individual pupils can choose whether or not to participate. </p>  <p>  I believe that schools need to be accountable to parents and we need greater levels of communication, engagement and transparency in how schools serve their communities.

A letter to this effect will issue shortly. </p>  <p>  The Digital Strategy for Schools 2015&ndash;2020, which is currently being implemented, reflects my Department&rsquo;s current policy on the effective use of digital technologies in teaching, learning and assessment in primary and post primary schools. It sets out a clear vision that is focused on realising the potential of digital technologies to transform the learning experiences of students by helping them become engaged thinkers, active learners, knowledge constructors and global citizens who participate fully in society and the economy.</p>  <p>  My Department, though its teacher support services, provides extensive training, supports and resources to schools to assist with the implementation of the Digital Strategy and in the development of policies and practices on the effective use of digital technologies in teaching and learning including their safe and ethical use. This includes supports on the prevention of bullying and harassment using the internet.</p>  <p>  Webwise.ie is a key educational resource for schools which promotes the promotes the autonomous, effective and safer use of the internet by young people through a sustained information and awareness strategy targeting school leaders, teachers, parents and children themselves with consistent and relevant messages. This resource is funded by my Department and the EU and is managed by the Professional Development for Teachers (PDST). </p>  <p>  Within the PDST, there is also a team of 22 full time personnel focusing on health and wellbeing with the goal of helping schools, through the Social Personal Health Education (SPHE) curriculum and other means to develop and promote students&rsquo; mental, emotional, social, sexual, personal and physical health in the context of a positive health-promoting school environment.</p>  <p>  Individual schools have however autonomy to determine whether they wish to supplement or support the school's work with other external resources/materials, such as those referenced by the Deputy, but this is a matter for each individual school itself to determine.</p></reply>

However, given educational disadvantage can manifest differently in urban and rural settings, urban DEIS schools  receive more supports than rural DEIS schools.  The list of supports is available at <i>www.education.ie/en/Publications/Policy-Reports/DEIS-Plan-2017.pdf</i>. </p><p>In relation to the criteria for determining whether a school should be included in the DEIS programme, when DEIS was first introduced in 2006, the identification of schools for inclusion was based on two different processes at primary and post primary.  At primary level, there was a survey of school principals using the following socio-economic variables: %unemployment; %local authority accommodation; %lone parenthood; %travellers; %large families (more than 5 children); %pupils eligible for free books.  At post primary level a combination of data from the Departments pupil database including school level retention rates together with exam achievement data and exam fee waiver data, which indicated that students had medical cards, was used.</p><p>Following a review of DEIS in 2016 and an extensive consultation process, a new identification process was developed for assessing schools levels of concentrated disadvantage. The key data sources used in the new DEIS identification process are the DES Primary Online Database (POD) and Post-Primary Online (PPOD) Databases, and CSO data from the National Census of Population as represented in the Haase Pratschke Deprivation Index  (HP Index).  The HP Index combines three underlying dimensions of affluence/disadvantage, identified as Demographic Profile, Social Class Composition and Labour Market Situation, to achieve a balanced measure of relative affluence and deprivation, which evenly applies across the urban-rural continuum.Variables used in the compilation of the HP Index include those related to demographic growth, dependency ratios, single parent rates, education levels, overcrowding, social class, occupation and unemployment rates. This data is combined with pupil data, anonymised and aggregated to small area, to provide information on the relative level of concentrated disadvantage present in the pupil cohort of individual schools.  The calculation of the level of disadvantage in each school using the HP index is therefore based on the socio-economic background of their pupil cohort using centrally held data and is not based on the location of the school but on the geographical CSO Small Areas where the pupil cohort resides.</p><p>A detailed document explaining the methodology used in the Identification process under DEIS plan 2017 is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>w</i><i>ww.education.ie/en/Schools-Colleges/Services/DEIS-Delivering-Equality-of-Opportunity-in-Schools-/DEIS-Identification-Process.pdf</i><i>.</i></p><p>Following an initial application of this new methodology, 79 new schools were brought into the DEIS programme in 2017 with a further 30 being upgraded from Band 2 to Band 1 status.  These schools were assessed as having the highest levels of concentrated disadvantage.  </p><p>My Department is currently undertaking data analysis in the context of resource allocation to match identified need, including the examination of variables known to be strong predictors of educational disadvantage.  All schools at both Primary and Post Primary are being assessed using the new identification model.  </p><p>This analysis is being carried out by members of the DEIS Technical Group which contains representatives of the Department&rsquo;s Statistics and Social Inclusion Units, the Inspectorate and the Educational Research Centre. Work is ongoing by this group, including consultation with relevant experts. I am confident that the culmination of this analysis will facilitate the ultimate aim of matching resources to identified need and will allow us to target extra resources at those schools most in need.</p><p>Until this analysis is complete, it is not intended to extend the DEIS programme to any further schools.</p></reply>

I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of resources. </p><p>Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, almost 2,800 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, of whom 57 were assigned to the Tipperary  Division. This and on-going recruitment will clearly provide significant additional policing hours throughout the country, both in terms of the increase in new Garda&iacute; and the redeployment of Garda&iacute; to frontline policing duties due to civilianisation of their current roles. I believe that the injection of this large number of experienced officers into the field, along with the new recruits, will be really beneficial in terms of protecting communities. This and on-going recruitment will clearly provide the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; to deliver a visible effective and responsive policing service to communities across all Garda Divisions including the Tipperary Division.</p><p>In relation to the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute; it is important to keep in mind that newly attested Garda&iacute; have a further 16 months of practical and class-room based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing. To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required training and development structures and resources in place, including trained Garda tutors and access to a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme.</p><p>The number of newly attested Garda&iacute; allocated to the Tipperary Division since the recommencement of recruitment to date is outlined below.

Once assessed as having special reception needs, there are a number of ways in which those needs are responded to. For example, Tusla provides the required supports to meet the needs of unaccompanied minors once identified as such. </p><p>Vulnerable persons include minors, unaccompanied minors, disabled people, elderly people, pregnant women, single parents, victims of human trafficking, persons with serious illnesses, persons with mental disorders and persons who have been subjected to torture, rape or other serious forms of psychological, physical or sexual violence, such as victims of female genital mutilation.</p><p>The Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) is not privy to all information held by other agencies or Departments in relation to applicants of international protection.  The individual professionals communicate with RIA (within the bounds of patient confidentiality) if a particular need is identified that will affect the person&rsquo;s accommodation requirements.  As a result, it is not possible to provide data on the number of persons found to have special reception needs.</p><p>An initial interview is conducted with all<b></b>applicants when they first attend the International Protection Office in Dublin.  If the applicant indicates at that point that he or she requires accommodation, he or she will then be assessed for any specific accommodation needs. The information provided is taken into account when assigning accommodation to the particular individual.</p><p>As detailed in the Regulations, the Minister for Health and the HSE has a lead responsibility in relation to health including mental health assessments.  Applicants are invited for an initial health assessment on a voluntary basis. Every effort is made to ensure that residents' specific needs are met.  Where more intensive care needs are required, such cases are referred to the HSE.</p><p>There is a specific Health Screening Team funded and managed by the HSE located on the site of the Balseskin Reception facility for the purpose of assessing those who have just arrived in the State. The team comprises of GPs, a Medical Officer, a Clinical Nurse Specialist and two nurses, a primary care social worker, two primary care psychologists and clerical/administration support. This team offers a range of individual services and screening for medical and psychosocial needs with onward referral as necessary. </p><p>In addition, arrangements are in place with Safetynet, who carry out health screening in various parts of the country on behalf of the HSE, to offer this screening service to those who do not, for whatever reason, avail of it in Dublin.  Safetynet staff liaise with RIA if the person is deemed vulnerable on medical or related grounds. This can include a request that particular steps be taken as regards that person&rsquo;s accommodation.</p><p>There is on-going engagement between RIA and the HSE in relation to how best to meet the health and related needs of protection applicants.  The HSE National Office for Social Inclusion has commissioned research to explore the concept of vulnerability with a view to further improving on the processes which are already in place.  </p><p>It is important to emphasise that all sectors within the Direct Protection system share a role in identifying and supporting applicants who present as vulnerable. This is particularly the case where vulnerabilities may become evident beyond the initial stage of the protection process.  </p><p>The Department continues to work hard to improve services to persons claiming international protection and seek our assistance, and to meet the requirements of the 2018 regulations, despite significant pressures with regard to the provision of accommodation.  </p></reply>

This continuing investment is intended to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can be mobile, visible and responsive on the roads and in the community to prevent and tackle crime.  </p><p>The Deputy may also wish to be aware that a total of &euro;10 million has been made available for the purchase and fit-out of Garda vehicles in 2019.  I understand from the Garda authorities that this allocation will be used for purchase and fit-out of over 300 new vehicles for operational use this year. </p><p>As the Deputy will appreciate, in accordance with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 as amended, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for managing and controlling the administration and business of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Further, the allocation of Garda resources is a matter for the Commissioner, in light of identified operational demands. This includes responsibility for the allocation of Garda vehicles among the various Garda divisions.  As Minister, I have no role in these matters. I am assured, however, that Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure their optimum use.</p><p>The Garda authorities advise that the following table outlines the number of vehicles assigned to each Garda Division by District, excluding National Units and Garda Headquarters, as of 21 June 2019.  For security reasons, a breakdown of marked and unmarked vehicles is not included in the table.<table><tr><th></th><th>Cars </th><th>Vans</th><th>Motorbikes</th><th>4 x

The competence to prevent, detect, investigate and prosecute corruption is spread across An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and a number of other bodies with a mandate to tackle corruption. </p>  <p>  These include, inter alia, the Central Bank of Ireland, the Standards in Public Office Commission, local authorities, the Ombudsman, Parliamentary Committees on Members' Interests, the Anti-Corruption Unit in the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau, the Criminal Assets Bureau, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Public Accounts Committee, other Oireachtas committees, regulators, Government Departments, the Director of Public Prosecutions and tribunals of enquiry and commissions of investigation. </p>  <p>  In addition, Ireland has an extensive range of legislative provisions to prevent and combat corruption. These include the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995, the Standards in Public Office Act 2001, Freedom of Information Act 2014 and the Protected Disclosures Act 2014. </p>  <p>  In relation to recent legislative developments, the Criminal Justice (Corruption Offences) Act 2018 was commenced in full on the 30 July 2018. The Act repealed and replaced the seven previous Prevention of Corruption Acts 1889 to 2010. The Act is not merely a consolidation of the old provisions. It strengthens and clarifies the law in relation to corruption. </p>  <p>  Ireland is also a party to a number of anti-corruption international instruments.  These are the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Convention on Combating Bribery of Public Officials in International Business Transactions and the Council of Europe's Group of States against Corruption (GRECO).  As such, Ireland is subject to regular peer evaluations associated with the implementation of these international agreements with recommendations for improvement made following each review.  </p>  <p>  Mr James Hamilton, the anti-corruption expert and former Director of Public Prosecutions, is chairing an interdepartmental and multi-agency Review of Ireland&rsquo;s Anti-Fraud and Anti-Corruption structures.  The Review Group, which will report later this year, is examining the effectiveness of the State&rsquo;s procedural, legislative and resourcing frameworks for the investigation, prosecution and prevention of fraud and corruption offences.</p></reply>

A breakdown of the returns is as follows:</p>  <p>  - &euro;32.357 million under the Proceeds of Crime Legislation;</p>  <p>  - &euro;157.078 million Tax and Interest;</p>  <p>  - &euro;4.391 million in Social Welfare overpayments.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that the legislative framework underpinning the work of the Criminal Assets Bureau is kept under review to ensure its on-going effectiveness and robustness. </p>  <p>  This is evidenced by the strengthening of the Proceeds of Crime legislative framework to further support the work of the Criminal Assets Bureau. In this regard, new powers were introduced under the Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Act 2016 which provide for Bureau Officers, subject to certain conditions, to immediately seize and detain property for a 24 hour period. Provision is also made for this period to be extended upon the authorisation of the Chief Bureau Officer, subject to certain conditions, for a further period not exceeding 21 days. The 2016 Act also lowered the thresholds applicable to seizures by reducing the value of property involved from &euro;13,000 to &euro;5,000. In addition, regulations were made to reduce the prescribed amount of cash suspected of being the proceeds of crime which can be seized, from &euro;6,500 to &euro;1,000. </p></reply>

This is the overall policy framework dealing with prevention, provision of services to victims and holding  perpetrators to account</p><p>- Changes to legislation arising from the introduction of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 and the Victims of Crime Act 2017</p><p>- The ratification of the Istanbul Convention on preventing and combatting  violence against women and domestic violence on 8 March, 2019</p><p>- The roll out of Divisional Protective Service Units within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. These are specialised units tasked with improving services to victims,  improving the investigation of sexual violence incidents, and identifying and managing risk</p><p>- The review that I initiated of the protections for vulnerable witnesses in the investigation and prosecution of sexual offences, being chaired by Tom O&rsquo;Malley which is expected to report in Q3 of this year</p><p>- A major national awareness campaign  on sexual harassment and sexual violence -  &lsquo;No Excuses&rsquo; - which I launched on 9 May. This is a high impact national media campaign, which aims to increase the awareness of sexual harassment and sexual violence and to bring about changes in societal attitudes and behaviours, with the aim of decreasing and preventing these offences. </p><p>A number of measures have also been taken to educate and change the behaviours of perpetrators of sexual crimes. The Irish Prison Service and the Probation Service provide a number of assessment and intervention treatment programmes for people convicted of sexual violence. These include the following:</p><p>- The Prison Service Psychology Service deliver a group intervention programme, in conjunction with the Probation Service, known as Better Lives, whereby a convicted sex offender can avail of relevant treatment to address their offending behaviour;</p><p>- Therapeutic one- to-one interventions with sex offenders in the prison setting, primarily delivered through the Prison Services&rsquo; Psychology Service;</p><p>- Probation Service engagement including work on reducing the risk following release and addressing child protection issues;</p><p>- Post Release Supervision Orders implemented by the Probation Service where supervision of offenders has been sanctioned by the Court, following release;</p><p>- The delivery by the Probation Service, in conjunction with PACE (a community based non-governmental organisation) of the Safer Lives Group Treatment Programme. This sex offender treatment programme runs on an inter-disciplinary, co-facilitated model, which includes psychologists, probation officers and safer lives staff members.</p><p>PACE also operates a number of other separate services. The Foothold Floating Support Service provides one to one support for men leaving custody convicted of a sexual offence. The Circles of Support and Accountability (CoSA) provides support to the offender by providing an inner circle of support, usually volunteers from the community, who are in turn surrounded by a professional circle and community. </p><p>While Tusla has statutory responsibility for the care and protection of victims of domestic, sexual or gender based violence, and is providing &euro;25.3 million for these services in 2019, my Department provides funding through its Victims of Crime Office to promote and assist the development of support services to victims of crime.  Such services continue to provide important information and support to victims of crime, including emotional support, court accompaniment, accompaniment to Garda interviews, accompaniment to sexual assault treatment units, counselling and referral to other services. In this regard, the Victims of Crime Office has allocated a total of &euro;12.5 million since 2011, to provide funding support to victim support services. In addition, Cosc, the National Office for the Prevention of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-Based Violence, has provided funding of &euro;380,000 since 2011 to the Rape Crisis Network Ireland's legal coordination service. </p><p>Details of the funding amounts made available for the period in question are set out in the following table. <table><tr><th>Year </th><th>Victims of Crime Funding </th><th>Cosc Funding </th></tr><tr><td>2019 </td><td>&euro;1.712m </td><td>&euro;50,000 </td></tr><tr><td>2018 </td><td>&euro;1.712m </td><td>&euro;40,000 </td></tr><tr><td>2017 </td><td>&euro;1.712m </td><td>&euro;40,000 </td></tr><tr><td>2016 </td><td>&euro;1.462m </td><td>&euro;40,000 </td></tr><tr><td>2015 </td><td>&euro;1.212m </td><td>&euro;40,000 </td></tr><tr><td>2014 </td><td>&euro;1.212m </td><td>&euro;40,000 </td></tr><tr><td>2013 </td><td>&euro;1.196m </td><td>&euro;40,000 </td></tr><tr><td>2012 </td><td>&euro;1.141m </td><td>&euro;45,000 </td></tr><tr><td>2011 </td><td>&euro;1.205m </td><td>&euro;45,000 </td></tr></table></p><p>In relation to the investigation of such crimes, as the Deputy will appreciate, it is the Garda Commissioner who is responsible for carrying on and managing and controlling generally the administration and business of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter. I have sought information from the Garda Commissioner in relation to the issues raised by the Deputy. I will write to the Deputy when the information is to hand.</p><p>The Deputy may also wish to note that the Government has approved a new national survey approach to the collection of data on the prevalence of sexual violence by the Central Statistics Office in Ireland and work is underway on this project.  Finally, while I am concerned at the year on year increases in sexual offences reported by the CSO, I welcome the fact that more and more victims are coming forward to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Increased reporting by victims of sexual offences to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may also be interpreted as an increase in confidence of victims to report. I would continue to encourage anyone who has been a victim of sexual assault to come forward and report the incident to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></reply>

A Family Court Bill will be introduced to create a new dedicated Family Court within the existing court structures. These courts will have new procedures aimed at less adversarial resolution of disputes and will have appropriate facilities and case management arrangements. </p>  <p>  A working group was established in 2017, comprising officials from the Department of Justice and Equality, the Courts Service and the Legal Aid Board, to examine the operational aspects relating to the family court and develop an overall architecture for the new family court structure. The Department of Children and Youth Affairs and Tusla also participated in the working group. Key issues that arose in consultations included family court venues and facilities, resources and capital investment in family courts and integration of relevant family and child services to provide the best possible family law outcomes. </p>  <p>  In 2018, a task force on the Family Court comprising senior officials from the Department of Justice and Equality, the Legal Aid Board and the Courts Service was formed to seek agreement on core questions of policy and costs.  A representative of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs has also joined the group. The work of this group is at an advanced stage. Issues being examined include court areas and locations, use of courthouses, provision of facilities and services, arrangements for management of resources, and oversight arrangements. </p>  <p>  Work is well advanced on the General Scheme of a Family Court Bill. When finalised, the General Scheme will be submitted for Government approval in the usual manner and will have to undergo pre-legislative scrutiny. The Bill will then be drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. It is not possible at this stage to estimate when the Bill will be ready for publication. </p>  <p>  The Family Court Bill is only one component of a new Family Court system. The provision of appropriate court facilities and services, and the capital and current resources that may be required for this, will be just as important, if not more so, for the operation of a new family court system. </p>  <p>  The Government is committed to building a new Family Law Centre and Children&rsquo;s Court in Dublin 7. The Government&rsquo;s Infrastructure and Capital Investment Plan 2016-2021 provides for development of a Family Law and Children&rsquo;s Court at the Hammond Lane site. The project is to be delivered as a Public Private Partnership. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998 management of the courts, including the provision of accommodation for court sittings, is the responsibility of the Courts Service, which is independent in exercising its functions. </p>  <p>  My officials have been in ongoing discussions with the Courts Service who have been advised that &euro;80 million in capital funding has been made available for the Hammond Lane project.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, Budget 2020 is still under consideration. </p></reply>

Ireland also contributes to the Council of Europe, European Commission for the Efficiency of Justice (CEPEJ) report which compares data on justice systems and court efficiencies from 47 countries. Both reports are available online at <i>www.ec.europa.eu</i>and <i>www.coe.int </i>respectively. These reports assist in providing ongoing international benchmarking which can be used as reference points when undertaking analysis of Ireland&rsquo;s justice system. </p><p>The seventh edition of the scoreboard was published on 26 April 2019 and it refers mostly to data from the year 2017. </p><p>I want to highlight in particular that in relation to online availability of information about the judicial system for the general public, Ireland is one of five member states to meet all criteria assessed including access to information on the justice system and presentation of tailor-made information for specific groups of society which would otherwise have difficultly accessing this information.</p><p>Ireland has the fourth highest general government expenditure on the law courts and the report shows that expenditure has increased year on year.</p><p>With regard to the perceived independence of the courts and judges among the general public and among companies, Ireland, which has traditionally scored well in these important metrics, was in fifth highest place. </p><p>While recognising the value of gathering international data in relation to the independence, quality and efficiency of national justice systems, it is important to note the existence of anomalies that can arise when comparing such data.  In some cases, data is collated in different ways in different countries, underpinning the differing geographical, economic and legal systems and as such, the data is not always directly comparable.</p></reply>

It also includes a vehicle the means of propulsion of which is electrical, or partly electrical and partly mechanical. Whether or not a vehicle requires a push-start is legally irrelevant.<br /><br />E-scooters and powered skateboards fall into this category, and are therefore considered to be mechanically propelled vehicles. Any users of such vehicles in a public place (as defined in the Road Traffic Act 1961) must have insurance, road tax and a driving licence, with penalties under road traffic laws (including fixed charge notices, penalty points, fines and possible seizure of the vehicle) for not being in compliance with these requirements  .<br /><br />As it is currently not possible to tax or insure e-scooters or electric skateboards, they are not considered suitable for use in a public place. There is no anomaly within the law. </blockquote><p>Insofar as the specific statistics sought by the Deputy are concerned, I am advised by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that, unfortunately, this data cannot be easily collated, as PULSE does not allow for the disaggregation of such statistics based on vehicle type. To collate the information, a manual trawl of all road traffic licence/insurance/tax offence records concerning mechanically propelled vehicles would have to be undertaken, which, I am advised, would require a disproportionate amount of Garda time and resources, and, therefore, cannot be justified.</p><p>Finally, in relation to the legal position of such vehicles, Minister Ross had requested the Road Safety Authority (RSA) to carry out research into how e-scooters and other such vehicles are regulated in other countries, particularly in other EU Member States, indicating that <i>'</i>the goal is to understand the road safety implications of the use of such vehicles on public roads, especially when interacting with other vehicles'. I am informed that the Minister has since received this report, which is now being considered in his Department.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that the Cohort Model of resource allocation is currently used for the allocation of personnel within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including newly attested probationer Garda&iacute; from the Garda College. Using this model, the allocation and transfer of Garda Personnel is determined by a number of factors, including crime and non-crime workload, minimum establishment, population, area, policing arrangements, and operational strategies. When considering the allocation of resources to a Division, comprehensive consultation is carried out with local Garda management during which all factors are taken into consideration.</p><p>In relation to the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute;, it is important to keep in mind that they have a further 16 months of practical and class-room based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.  To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required training and development structures and resources in place, including trained Garda tutors and access to a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme.</p><p>I am further informed by the Commissioner that while not all Garda Stations are training stations it is important to note that the allocation of probationer Garda&iacute; to a Divisional training station facilitates the reassignment of Garda&iacute; to other stations within the Division, if required, by the Divisional Officer.</p><p>Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, almost 2,800 Garda recruits have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, of whom 118 were assigned to the Kildare Garda Division. This year to date, two intakes of probationer Garda&iacute; have attested and been allocated on the 8 March, and the 10 June respectively. Six newly attested Garda&iacute; were allocated to the Kildare Division in March 2019: two to Kildare Garda Station, two to Leixlip Garda Station and two to Naas Garda Station. The allocation of resources within the Division is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer. </p><p>The Government has increased the budget for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to &euro;1.76 billion for 2019, which includes provision for the recruitment of up to 800 Garda&iacute; this year. The Commissioner has now informed me that he plans to recruit a total of 600 trainee Garda&iacute; in 2019 and 600 Garda Civilian Staff.  This Garda Staff recruitment will allow the Commissioner to redeploy a further 500 fully trained Garda&iacute; from administrative duties to frontline policing in 2019. </p><p>I believe that the injection of this large number of experienced officers into the field, along with the new recruits, will be really beneficial in terms of protecting communities. This and on-going recruitment will clearly provide the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; to deliver a visible effective and responsive policing service to communities across all Garda Divisions including the Kildare Division.</p><p>For more general information on Garda Facts and Figures please see the following link</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-07-02a.852.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019070200070#WRN01600"><p>The Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010 was most recently updated in November last year by the Criminal Justice (Money, Laundering and Terrorist Financing) (Amendment) Act 2018. The 2018 Act transposed in large part the Fourth EU Anti Money Laundering Directive and also brought Irish law into line with the recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force, an international standard-setting body.</p>  <p>  The main change brought about by the 2018 Act was the introduction of new requirements around a risk-based approach. This means, first of all, that the businesses concerned (which the legislation calls designated persons), must assess the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing involved in carrying out their business. They must have policies and procedures in place to mitigate these risks. They must determine the risk attaching to each customer or transaction, on a case-by-case basis, taking into account relevant factors. And they must then carry out whatever due diligence measures are warranted by that level of risk. This represents a more targeted and therefore more effective application of measures by the designated person.</p>  <p>  The 2018 Act also recognises the reality that many businesses today operate in group structures across borders. It made a number of amendments to the 2010 Act in this regard.  The Act expanded the requirements on Irish companies to ensure that their subsidiaries overseas apply high anti-money laundering standards. If a group implements policies and procedures properly, its subsidiaries are not subject to some restrictions that normally apply in respect of high-risk third countries.</p>  <p>  The 2018 Act also extended the scope of existing obligations in other ways. For example, some measures which previously only applied to banks, now apply to other financial institutions. There are extra measures that must be applied to the beneficiaries of life assurance policies. Measures applying to politically exposed persons will now apply to those resident in Ireland as well as those resident abroad.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, of great importance in the global fight against money laundering and terrorist financing is the role of the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU). The FIU in Ireland is part of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. It is responsible for receiving suspicious transaction reports from designated persons and analysing them, so that it can be used to combat crime. The 2018 Act expands the remit of the FIU. It requires them to have access to all of the information they need to carry out their functions and allows for cooperation and information sharing between the FIU in Ireland and the FIUs of other Member States. </p>  <p>  The 2018 Act also introduced a fitness and probity regime for the owners of private members&rsquo; gaming clubs. This change, which transposes a provision of the Fourth Directive, requires both those who hold a directorial function, as well as the beneficial owners of such clubs, to apply to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the Minister for Justice for a certificate of fitness. It is now a criminal offence to carry on such activities without that certificate.</p>  <p>  In addition to the changes above, the Government also approved the drafting of a further Bill to amend the 2010 Act in January of this year, provisionally titled the Criminal Justice (Money, Laundering and Terrorist Financing) (Amendment) Bill 2019. The General Scheme for this Bill was published on my Department&rsquo;s website in January and its aim is to give effect to the criminal justice elements of the Fifth EU Anti Money Laundering Directive.</p>  <p>  While drafting work is ongoing, the General Scheme, as published, will amend some provisions of the 2010 Act, and insert others, concerned with:</p>  <p>  - the use of virtual currencies for terrorist financing and limiting the use of pre-paid cards;</p>  <p>  - safeguards for financial transactions to and from high-risk third countries;</p>  <p>  - the scope of designated bodies under the existing legislation;</p>  <p>  - enhanced customer due diligence (CDD) requirements;</p>  <p>  - the prevention of credit and financial institutions from creating anonymous safe-deposit boxes;</p>  <p>  - a Regulation-making power for the Minister which will set out what is considered to be a &ldquo;prominent public function&rdquo;. </p>  <p>  - a number of technical amendments.</p>  <p>  In addition to the &lsquo;money laundering legislation&rsquo; above, the Deputy may also wish to note that my colleague, the Minister for Finance, has introduced, and will introduce further, legislation to deal with those elements of the Money Laundering Directives that fall within his policy remit. This includes the establishment of beneficial ownership registers and centralised bank account registers, etc.</p></reply>

As of 24 June 2019, the Dublin Visa Office was processing tourist/visit visa applications received in Dublin on 10 June 2019.  Processing times for other Visa Offices overseas and for Embassies will vary but are generally between 3 and 6 weeks at this time, with many applications processed inside those timeframes, depending on travel dates.</p>  <p>  I am also advised by INIS that the visa service is experiencing an increase in the number of visa applications across most categories, in line with increased economic activity generally.  Notwithstanding this, processing times are on a par with, and in many cases, better than the same time last year.</p>  <p>  The business target for processing 'short-stay C' visas is within eight weeks (current processing time in Dublin for most categories is within four weeks).  However, the processing time at each office and location worldwide is determined by a number of factors such as the volume and complexity of applications, whether investigation is required or not, individual circumstances, peak application periods, seasonal factors, and the resources available.  While every effort is made to process applications as quickly as possible, processing times inevitably vary as a result.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy can be assured that every effort is made to keep processing times to a minimum, and a number of measures have been put in place to deal with the increased demand for visas to come to Ireland.  This has included the assignment of additional staff to deal with applications, and more generally the streamlining of visa processes where possible.  The position in this regard is being kept under review.</p>  <p>  The central concern in deciding on visa applications, as with all visa services worldwide, is to strike an appropriate balance between protecting the country's vital national interests by maintaining an effective immigration regime while at the same time facilitating travel for those who meet the criteria.  Each visa application is therefore decided on its own merits taking all factors into account.</p></reply>

Ireland&rsquo;s main exports to Vietnam include medical and pharmaceutical products valued at &euro;18.6m in 2018.  Ireland's food exports to Vietnam have grown considerably in recent years.  While meat and dairy products are the largest share of this, beverages and seafood also contributed strongly.  In 2017 (the most recent year with available figures), services exports from Ireland to Vietnam were valued at &euro;164m.  Services imports from Vietnam for the same year totalled &euro;13m.  Last year, Ireland imported &euro;167m worth of goods from Vietnam which mainly consisted of clothing, footwear and furniture.  </p><p>Through the Government&rsquo;s Trade Strategy, &lsquo;<i>Ireland Connected: Trading and Investing in a Dynamic World</i>&rsquo;, we aim by 2020 to increase indigenous exports by Enterprise Ireland supported companies, including food, to reach &euro;26 billion and secure 900 new foreign direct investments.  As part of the Government&rsquo;s Global Ireland 2025 strategy, Enterprise Ireland will open a new office in Ho Chi Minh City this year to support Irish businesses to expand into the Vietnamese market and to take advantage of the new opportunities presented by the FTA. </p><p>Negotiations for a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between the EU and Vietnam were concluded in December 2015.  On 31 June 2019 the EU and Vietnam signed the Free Trade Agreement along with the EU-Vietnam Investment Protection Agreement (IPA).  The FTA will unlock a market with huge potential for Irish and EU firms and includes the elimination of nearly all tariffs (over 99%) on EU exports to Vietnam.  65% of these tariffs will be liberalised at entry into force of the FTA with the remainder phased out over a 10-year period.  The FTA also covers non-tariff barriers to trade and other trade related issues such as public procurement, competition, services, investment, intellectual property rights, regulatory issues, and sustainable development.  I support the entry into force of the EU-Vietnam FTA so that Irish firms may benefit from the new business opportunities provided for by the Agreement. </p><p>Opportunities exist for Ireland to grow exports in dairy products, pork, seafood and alcoholic beverages by taking advantage of reduced tariffs under the FTA.  Currently tariffs on EU exports of spirits to Vietnam are particularly high at 48% and will eliminated over a 7-year period following entry into force of the FTA.  The elimination of tariffs of 15% on frozen pork products is also significant for Irish producers. </p><p>Ireland is an exceptionally open economy and is dependent on international trade and investment as sources of growth.  Building new export opportunities for our businesses forms a vital part of Ireland&rsquo;s enterprise strategy.  We favour ambitious and balanced trade agreements, negotiated by the EU Commission on our behalf, which are designed to deliver jobs and growth for the benefit of our citizens.  The EU-Vietnam FTA and the EU&rsquo;s other trade agreements help to open new markets, break down barriers and provide new opportunities for Irish firms.  </p><p>As part of the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day &ldquo;Promote Ireland&rdquo; Programmes, Ministerial visits around the world, including Vietnam, were organised to ensure that we use this exposure to maximise the promotion of Ireland's trade, tourism and investment interests.  </p><p>In a wider context, Vietnam is a member of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN).  The EU is working towards achieving a region-to-region FTA with ASEAN by first concluding FTAs with individual ASEAN members.  The first of these was signed with Singapore in October 2018, the Vietnam FTA is the second, and negotiations for an FTA with Indonesia, the largest county in the ASEAN group, are ongoing.  In addition, the benefits of comprehensive EU Free Trade Agreements with third Countries are not solely economic but also involve the establishment of strong lines of communication and areas of common interest with other economies.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-07-02a.901.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1249" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019070200070#WRN06500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 358 and 364 together.</p>  <p>  While there is a minimum share capital requirement of &euro;25,000 for Public Limited Companies set out in the Companies Act 2014, there are currently no plans to introduce legislation to set the minimum level of paid up share capital and reserves required by a limited company as a proportion of the annual turnover of the company. </p>  <p>  Minimum share capital requirements are often cited as a potential method of protecting creditors. However, the money that is paid in as share capital is not required to be kept separate but is mingled with the other funds of the company and/or used by it. Thus, even if minimum thresholds of share capital were to be required, there would still not be a readily available cash fund equivalent to the share capital from which to cover creditors&rsquo; claims against the company in an insolvency situation. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, a requirement to set share capital and reserves as a proportion of turnover could represent a significant obstacle to the conduct of commerce through company structures and have unintended consequences. If a minimum level were set and a company breached that minimum it could result in the loss of limited liability and force viable companies into liquidation with adverse consequences for employment in such companies.  Further, if a company had a poor trading year, the amount of proportionate reserves required would fall in monetary terms as turnover may be reduced but a company&rsquo;s debts could increase nonetheless. </p>  <p>  Limited liability is one of the principal reasons why most businesses decide to incorporate in the first place. The availability of limited liability facilitates entrepreneurship and job creation by allowing entrepreneurs to trade without compromising personal assets. However, the availability of limited liability is a privilege not a right and is subject to safeguards to protect the interests of other stakeholders. The Companies Act 2014 contains provisions in which the separate legal personality of the company may be pierced in certain circumstances to visit liability on persons concerned in the carrying on of the business e.g.:</p>  <p>  Section 610 - Civil liability for fraudulent and reckless trading  </p>  <p>  Section 612 - Misfeasance </p>  <p>  Section 722 - Fraudulent Trading.</p>  <p>  Section 599 and 600 contain further safeguards as they provide respectively that in certain circumstances a related company may be required to contribute to the debts of a company being wound up, and for the pooling of assets of related companies.</p>  <p>  It should also be noted that minimum share capital requirements are stringent in respect of their application to companies which have a director who has been restricted. Section 819(3) of the Companies Act 2014 requires that any company which has a director who is subject to a restriction order must have an allotted share capital of nominal value not less than &euro;500,000 in the case of a public limited company (other than an investment company) or a public unlimited company, and &euro;100,000 in the case of any other company type. These requirements can be difficult to meet. However, perhaps more importantly, the fact that a director is subject to a restriction order can make it much more difficult for a company to obtain credit and as a result, the threat of restriction acts as a powerful disincentive. The Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement has extensive powers to investigate and prosecute cases of corporate failure involving directors who act dishonestly or irresponsibly, particularly in respect of insolvency situations.</p></reply>

In this regard, the Government is committed to improving waiting times for hospital appointments and procedures.</p>  <p>  The joint Department of Health/HSE/National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) Scheduled Care Access Plan 2019 was published in March and sets out measures to improve care for patients waiting for scheduled care in 2019 by reducing waiting times for inpatient/day case treatment and outpatient appointments. </p>  <p>  The NTPF works with public hospitals, as opposed to with patients directly, to offer and provide the funding for treatment to clinically suitable long waiting patients who are on an inpatient/day case waiting list for surgery, having been referred on to such a list following clinical assessment by a consultant/specialist at an outpatient clinic. </p>  <p>  The key criteria of the NTPF is the prioritisation of the longest waiting patients first. While the NTPF identifies patients eligible for NTPF treatment, it is solely on the basis of their time spent on the Inpatient/Daycase Waiting List.  The clinical suitability of the patient to avail of NTPF funded treatment is determined by the public hospital.</p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.  Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy, a standardised approach to managing scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures, since January 2014, has been developed to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care.

The same Act allows Vhi to form subsidiaries to perform any of its functions under the Acts (excluding the main health insurance business which is carried out by only one subsidiary).</p>  <p>  As a part of authorisation by the Central Bank, Vhi was restructured to separate the many functions of the Voluntary Health Insurance Board.

As Minister for Health I do not have a role in the day-to-day commercial decisions of Vhi or its subsidiaries.  My Department officials meet regularly with Vhi senior management to discuss governance matters, financial performance and the strategic direction of Vhi to ensure I am briefed on important developments, some of which are commercially sensitive.

In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the Health Service Executive (HSE). The HSE issues income guidelines to assist in determining entitlement to medical and GP visit cards. Any revision to the income thresholds must have regard for Government policy, increases in the Consumer Price Index and other issues which may be relevant.   While there are no plans at present to revise the income thresholds for medical cards, it is vitally important that the medical card system is responsive and considerate to people's needs and circumstances. In that regard my Department keeps medical card issues, including existing thresholds under constant review. Any new policy measures regarding income thresholds for either medical cards or GP visit cards to be incorporated into the forthcoming Budget will be considered by Government as part of the 2020 Estimates process. </p>  <p>  A number of measures have been introduced in recent years to improve access to free GP care and other health services. Since July 2015, all children under 18 years of age with a diagnosis of cancer are awarded a medical card.  This card is valid for a period of 5 years. Since July 2017, all children under the age of 16 for whom a Domiciliary Care Allowance is paid also has automatic eligibility for a medical card. </p>  <p>  Children aged under 6 years and individuals over 70 and those in receipt of a Carer's Allowance or Carer's Benefit are now automatically eligible for a GP visit card. Most recently in April of this year, a 10% increase was applied across all GP Visit Card income thresholds enabling more people to access free GP care. </p>  <p>  In context of the above, it is important to note that approximately 42.8% of the population now have access to free GP care. In addition, if a person's sole income is derived from a social welfare payment, even where this payment is in excess of the current income thresholds, the person will be awarded a medical card. </p></reply>

However cervical screening will not prevent all cases of cervical cancer. In the cases of 1,482 women who had been screened and were later given a diagnosis of cervical cancer, CervicalCheck carried out an audit of their previous cervical screening tests. The objective of audit and quality review at CervicalCheck was to facilitate continued improvement and ongoing learning within the programme. The audit found that 221 of these women could have been provided with a different result. </p>  <p>  In August 2015, a decision was taken by the HSE, in line with international best practice, to provide information on the outcome of the audit for onward communication to patients but the intention to disclose this information was not followed through and many of the women concerned were not informed about the results of the audit. </p>  <p>  Consideration is being given to an appropriate form of apology, and this will be discussed with the 221+ before any final decision is made. I have met and spoken with many of the women involved, including at a meeting in January 2019, at which I apologised for how women and families were treated, as well as thanking them for sharing their views and experiences. The National Cancer Screening Service wrote last year to each woman affected, or their next of kin, apologising for the failures in relation to disclosure and setting out the actions being taken by the HSE to address the issues identified. The former Director General of the HSE, and the former head of Cervical Check have also apologised personally to individual women when the opportunity has arisen. Last year, Cervical Check placed advertisements with national media outlets apologising for how standards fell short in relation to this issue. </p>  <p>  It is also very important to note the actions taken by the State to address the issues identified in the Scoping Inquiry led by Dr Scally. Government has accepted in full the recommendations of the Scoping Inquiry and work is ongoing to implement these in full. In relation to the women concerned I am pleased that the Ex-Gratia Scheme has made its first payments in relation to the non-disclosure of audit results, and I understand that the panel will meet again shortly to consider further payments.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings. </p><p>Participants in the Scheme contribute up to 80% of their assessable income, such as their pension and a maximum of 7.5% per annum of the value of assets held, such as their principal private residence or cash assets. The first &euro;36,000 of an individual&rsquo;s assets is not counted at all in the financial assessment.

Many areas in our health service currently lack sufficient capacity to meet the ever-increasing demand for services and the needs of patients, resulting in unacceptably long waiting times for hospital appointments and procedures.</p>  <p>  In this regard, the Government is committed to improving waiting times for scheduled care in acute hospitals. The joint Department of Health/HSE/National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) Scheduled Care Access Plan 2019 was published in March and sets out measures to improve care for patients waiting for scheduled care in 2019 by reducing waiting times for inpatient/day case treatment and outpatient appointments.</p>  <p>  A key element of the Plan is the stabilisation of the Outpatient Waiting List. Under the Plan the HSE, in line with the National Service Plan, will aim to deliver 3.3 million outpatient appointments, of which approximately 1 million will be first appointments. For its part the NTPF will aim to deliver 40,000 first Outpatient appointments.</p>  <p>  The Access Plan sets out the activity levels for the NTPF, who will supply additionality to HSE activity, in order to reduce waiting times experienced by patients for a hospital appointment, operation or procedure.  </p>  <p>  The Access Plan ensures an appropriate balance between high volume activities and offering treatment to complex long waiting patients. The NTPF is working with public hospitals to seek NTPF-funded solutions for very long waiting patients, either in the private sector or in public hospitals where there is available capacity. </p>  <p>  In addition, my Department is working with the HSE and NTPF, under the Access Plan, with the objective of developing medium-long term improvement initiatives for patient access to hospital procedures. This will include moving care to more appropriate settings and providing care at the lowest level of complexity such as providing ophthalmology in the community; maximising the use of Advanced Nurse Practitioner led clinics; and physiotherapists to manage orthopaedic clinics.</p>  <p>  The HSE has advised that the Galway University Hospital chronic pain service is a tertiary referral service and is delivered across both University Hospital Galway and Merlin Park University Hospital. The service consists of 6 clinics per month, where new and review patients are seen, and patients may also have trigger point injections performed at these clinics. All appointments are followed up by the Registered Advanced Nurse Practitioner (RANP) to avoid routine review clinic appointments.</p>  <p>  In addition, there are 2 interventional pain management sessions carried out in the Surgical Day ward per week (8 per month).  One session (6 patients) is radiology guided procedures and 1 session (6 patients) is non-radiology guided. This list consists of 12 patients per week and in-patients may also be added.</p>  <p>  There are also scheduled interventional pain lists (6 per month) in Merlin Park.  Four sessions are radiology guided and 2 sessions are non-radiology guided. These lists consist of 6 patients per session. In total 14 intervention sessions a month are carried out between UHG and MP.</p>  <p>  The Registered Advanced Nurse Practitioner offers a telephone follow up service for all patients following intervention to avoid repeat Outpatient Department appointments for routine follow ups.  A number of in-patients are reviewed on a consultation basis also. The pain clinic has the support of 6 psychology sessions a month. Group sessions are conducted 3 times a year.</p>  <p>  The HSE advise that all patients are called in order of clinical priority and/or in chronological order and additional clinics to support the waiting lists are currently being discussed.</p></reply>

The Commission found that evidence of recruitment campaigns with very low levels of applications was indicative of on-going difficulties in regard to recruitment of consultants.  Research undertaken on its behalf identified a number of relevant factors including relative pay, training opportunities and the lack of attractiveness of specific posts, particularly in smaller hospitals.  </p>  <p>  The Commission acknowledged that the difference in pay between the pre-existing and new entrant consultants is greater than for other categories of public servants.  It did not view the measures announced last September for new entrant public servants generally, as being sufficient to address the degree of pay differential which exists for Consultants. Given its analysis, the Commission proposed that the Parties to the Public Service Stability Agreement jointly consider what further measures could be taken, over time, to address the pay differential. </p>  <p>  The Government accepted the Report of the Commission and recognises that there are significant recruitment and retention challenges in relation to consultant posts. The proposal of the Commission does need to be addressed. The next step is to engage with the representative organisations of medical consultants.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the current recruitment challenges, the number of consultants working in the public health service continues to grow year on year. It increased by 125 whole time equivalents or just over 4 per cent in the year to the end of May 2019. In the five years to the end of May 2019 the number of consultants has increased by 533 - over 20 per cent - and now stands at 3,121 WTE's. </p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their income and assets while the State pays the balance of the cost. </p>  <p>  The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings. An applicant to the scheme can choose any public, voluntary or approved private nursing home.  The home must have availability and be able to cater for the applicant's particular needs. </p>  <p>  Participants in the Scheme contribute up to 80% of their assessable income and a maximum of 7.5% per annum of the value of assets held. Assets include cash assets and all forms of property whether situated in the State or not. The capital value of an individual&rsquo;s principal private residence (PPR) is only included in the financial assessment for the first three years of their time in care. This is known as the three year cap.</p>  <p>  In line with the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009 a transferred asset, is assessed as per its value on the date application for State support was first made. This is provided in Schedule 1 of the Act. In the context of a transferred asset, it relates to an asset which has been transferred at any time in the period of 5 years prior to, or at any time on or subsequent to, the date on which an application for State support is first made by or on behalf of that person. It relates to circumstances in which the transfer was made for no consideration, for nominal consideration, or for consideration which is less than 75 per cent of the estimated market value of the interest of the person in the asset at the time of the transfer, with some exceptions relating to the transfer of assets in the context of the maintenance of a child or other matrimonial proceedings.</p></reply>

GPs are remunerated for these services primarily on a capitation basis, with a range of additional support payments and fees for specific items of service. GPs are also remunerated for services they provide on behalf of the HSE under other public health schemes, such as the Maternity and Infant Care Scheme, Primary Childhood Immunisation Scheme etc.</p>  <p>  Under the GMS scheme GPs are also paid a subsidy towards the cost of employing a practice nurse and/or a practice secretary. The rate payable depends on the GP's GMS panel size and the level of experience of the nurse or secretary.</p>  <p>  GPs working in rural areas who meet the qualifying criteria will also qualify for the rural support allowance of &euro;20,000 per annum.</p>  <p>  I am pleased that we have recently been able to conclude an agreement with the Irish Medical Organisation on a major package of GP contractual reforms which will benefit patients and general practitioners and make general practice a more attractive career option for doctors.</p>  <p>  Agreement has been reached on the provision of new services and on a wide-ranging set of modernisation and reform measures. In return for cooperation with these service developments and reforms, the Government will increase investment in general practice by approximately 40% (or &euro;210 million) over the next 4 years. This will see significant increases in capitation fees for GPs who participate in the reform programme and the introduction of new fees and subsidies for additional services such as the chronic disease programme.</p>  <p>  There will be increased support for GPs working in rural practices and for those in disadvantaged urban areas. Improvements in the maternity and paternity leave arrangements have also been agreed, in recognition of the need to ensure that general practice is compatible with doctors&rsquo; family friendly commitments. </p>  <p>  Each GP who holds a GMS contract has been invited to sign up to the reform measures which will allow them to access the new fees from 1 July 2019.  I am informed that a high proportion of GPs holding a GMS contract have already responded positively to this invitation.</p></reply>

The Act specifies the criteria for decisions on the reimbursement of medicines.  As Minister for Health, I have no role or powers in relation to such matters.</p><p>Decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds by the HSE, including advice from the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). </p><p>The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) of medicines for the HSE and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist the HSE in its decision-making process. The NCPE uses a decision framework to systematically assess a drug's clinical and cost effectiveness as a health intervention at the submitted price. </p><p>The HSE has a robust assessment and commercial negotiation process for new medicines. This process challenges inappropriate costings from applicant companies and delivers improved value for money on new medicines, allowing more treatments to be provided within a finite budget. </p><p>The HSE strives to reach a decision in as timely a manner as possible. However, because of the significant monies involved, it must ensure that the best price is achieved, as these commitments can be ongoing multi-million euro investments. If the HSE were not to challenge pharmaceutical companies pricing fewer medicines could be provided from the resources provided.</p><p>I am advised by the HSE that it has received applications for the following indications for osimertinib.</p><p>1. The treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic EGFR T790M mutation-positive NSCLC.</p><p>In respect of this indication, the HSE received a health technology assessment (cost utility analysis) for this application in May 2018.</p><p>A summary copy of that report is available on the NCPE website (www.ncpe.ie) @ .</p><p>Following the assessment and after a number of rounds of commercial negotiations and HSE reviews, the HSE notified the applicant in February 2019 that it was minded to not approve osimertinib for the second line treatment of EGFR T790M mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancers.</p><p>The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 requires a period of representations after such notifications, before the HSE makes any formal final decision. The HSE reviewed representations received at its May 2019 meeting and is currently considering this.</p><p>2. The first-line treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with activating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations.</p><p>In respect of this indication, a health technology assessment is ongoing.

Following consideration of the matter, it was decided to withdraw the Memorandum from the Cabinet Agenda at that time.  I intend to revert to Government in due course with revised proposals to reflect the discussions at that Cabinet meeting and further discussions between myself and Minister Harris, on the best way to progress the Transport Scheme.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers scheme, operated by the Revenue Commissioners, remains in place.  This scheme provides VRT and VAT relief, an exemption from road tax and a fuel grant to drivers and passengers with a disability, who qualify under the relevant criteria set out in governing regulations made by the Minister for Finance. Specifically adapted vehicles driven by persons with a disability are also exempt from payment of tolls on national roads and toll bridges. Transport Infrastructure Ireland has responsibility for this particular scheme.</p>  <p>  There are improvements in access to a range of transport support schemes available to persons with disabilities in the State and on-going work is being carried out by Government Departments, agencies and transport providers to further improve access to public transport services. Under the National Disability Inclusion Strategy, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has responsibility for the continued development of accessibility and availability of public transport for people with a disability.</p></reply>

It can also enter the food chain as an environmental contaminant in water, due to its use in intensive farming methods, livestock production and sewage discharge.  In humans, nitrite and nitrate from food are rapidly absorbed by the body and, for the most part, excreted as nitrate.  Some of the nitrate absorbed by the body is converted in the body into nitrite, the absorption of which can lead, in excessive quantities, to a reduced ability of red blood cells to bind and transport oxygen through the body.  Nitrite in food (<i>and nitrate converted to nitrite in the body</i>) may also contribute to the formation of a group of compounds known as nitrosamines, some of which are carcinogenic.</p><p>For decades the salts of nitrate and nitrite have been added to food to preserve it and they also help hinder the growth of harmful microorganisms.  The use of additives in food is strictly controlled by EU legislation.  They must undergo a comprehensive scientific safety assessment before being authorised for use in the manufacture or preparation of foodstuffs.  The natural occurrence of nitrate in foods such as vegetables is regulated by maximum levels set out in EU Regulation 1881/2006 as amended.  </p><p>The FSAI has indicated that the safety of nitrate has been comprehensively evaluated by European Union (EU) and International Scientific Experts, including the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA), an international expert scientific committee that is administered jointly by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations and the World Health Organisation.</p><p>In a re-evaluation on the safety of nitrate, EFSA concluded in 2017 that the exposure to nitrate resulting from its use as a food additive did not lead to an exceedance of the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) and was estimated to be less than 5% of the overall exposure to nitrate in food from all dietary sources.  However, EFSA noted that total dietary exposure to nitrate from all sources (food additives, natural presence and contamination) exceeded the current ADI in all European populations considered.  Similar conclusions were drawn concerning dietary exposure to nitrites from all sources.</p><p>An assessment carried out by EFSA in 2008 on nitrates present in food as contaminants compared the risk and benefits of exposure to nitrate from vegetables and concluded that the beneficial effects outweighed potential health risks from exposure to nitrate through vegetables, and that the average European consumer would not exceed the ADI.  </p><p>In 2010, a further opinion was delivered on the potential health risks for infants and young children from naturally occurring nitrate in leafy vegetables, which concluded that levels of nitrate in these vegetables do not pose a health concern for most children.</p><p>As previously noted, nitrites, including when used as food additives, contribute to the formation of nitrosamines.  Applying some worst-case scenario assumptions, EFSA concluded that the formation of nitrosamines in the body from use of food additives at approved levels was of low concern for human health.  However, EFSA further noted that nitrite unintentionally present in meat products from other sources such as environmental contamination can also contribute to the formation of nitrosamines. EFSA concluded that these levels of nitrosamines might give rise to potential health concerns but that more research was needed to address uncertainties and knowledge gaps that may exist in this area.</p><p>According to the most recent Irish Total Diet study performed by the FSAI between 2012 to 2014, exposure estimates to both nitrite and nitrate in adults and children resident in Ireland were found to be below the respective health-based guidance values.  The study identified vegetables as the most important dietary contributor for nitrate, and ham as the only dietary contributor for nitrite.  The study concluded that exposure to nitrates and nitrites from food is not of concern.</p></reply>

Consideration of the welfare and best interests of children born through AHR is a key principle underpinning the General Scheme. Subject to certain conditions being met, AHR treatments will be available to people irrespective of gender, marital status or sexual orientation.</p>  <p>  My officials and I have engaged with LGBT Ireland (the group referred to by the Deputy) in relation to provisions within both the General Scheme of the Assisted Human Reproduction Bill and Parts 2 &amp;amp; 3 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015.  As part of this process of engagement, LGBT Ireland  also made a formal submission to my Department in relation to these matters.</p>  <p>  Given the comprehensive scope of the legislation and the ethical, legal and social issues which arise from AHR practices, it is anticipated that certain areas of the General Scheme will require further consideration and refinement during the ongoing process of drafting the Assisted Human Reproduction Bill in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General.  An analysis of the Joint Committee&rsquo;s report on the General Scheme, once completed, and the response of stakeholders, including LGBT Ireland,  will feed into this process.</p></reply>

This was down from 2,711 in April 2018. The HSE has prioritised reducing both short- and long-term CAMHS waiting lists. This has helped to reduce the waiting lists of those waiting over 12 months, which has reduced from 352 in April 2018 to 316 in April this year.  In April 2019 approximately 80% of young people were offered a first appointment within 12 weeks in community CAMHS settings </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the number of referrals to CAMHS increased from around 12,800 referrals received in 2011 to around 18,100 referrals expected in 2019. Cases assessed by professionals as urgent are seen as a matter of priority.  </p>  <p>  The recent Budget provided an additional &euro;55 million to progress new developments in mental health which brings overall HSE mental health funding to nearly &euro;1 billion in 2019. This funding has helped to increase services available in this area.</p>  <p>  There are now 70 CAMHS teams, compared to 49 in 2008, and 3 Paediatric Liaison Teams. All aspects of CAMHS nationally are being improved by the HSE under its annual Service Plans. This includes better out-of-hours and 7/7 day cover, progression of Day Hospital care, developing specialist teams such as Eating Disorders, and improved Prevention and Early Intervention services.</p>  <p>  To this end, we have also tried to reduce demand on CAMHS. The HSE funds Jigsaw to provide early intervention mental health services which focus on the needs of 12-25 year olds. Their early intervention model provides tangible supports for young people at primary care level who have mild and emerging mental health difficulties. There are currently 13 Jigsaw Services in communities across Ireland providing mental health support to young people with 2 more sites in Wicklow and Tipperary expected to be opened in the next year .</p>  <p>  In conjunction with the Department of Health and the HSE, I am progressing various initiatives to enhance CAMHS, and also to adopt a wider approach around Prevention and Early Intervention measures, designed to alleviate pressures on the specialist CAMHS service. These include maximising the impact of the additional Primary Care Assistant Psychologists recruited in 2018 to relieve pressures on CAMHS; roll-out by the HSE of various e-mental health pilot projects; and additional Psychiatric Nurse training places coming on-stream to help fill existing vacancies.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health will continue to monitor CAMHS activity and staffing data.  In addition, I have held meetings with, and sought further information from, the Chief Officers and Executive Clinical Directors of the CHOs specifically on CAMHS vacancies, with a view to improving the rate of recruitment for CAMHS staff. </p></reply>

This is to strengthen the governance, transparency and oversight of any proposed new programmes or changes to existing programmes. Similar to the UK National Screening Committee, the Committee&rsquo;s role will be to undertake an independent assessment of the evidence for screening for a particular condition against internationally accepted criteria and make recommendations accordingly. </p><p>Ireland, very much like the UK has always evaluated the case for commencing a national screening programme against international accepted criteria &ndash; collectively known as the Wilson Junger criteria. The evidence bar for commencing a screening programme should and must remain high.  This ensures that we can be confident that the programme is effective, quality assured and operating to safe standards.</p><p>It is correct that the number of conditions screened for by Member States (MS) in Europe does vary. This does not reflect major differences in the genetic background of populations or estimated prevalences but rather highlights different MS approaches to (1) the estimation of risks and benefits in their populations and (2) responding to the cultural demands and ethical difficulties arising from a lack of evidence to screen for many of these rare conditions. Detailed knowledge about the natural course of many rare diseases, their variants and specifically information on the medium and long term outcomes after early treatment initiation are still insufficient.</p><p>There is no doubt that newborn screening programmes has the potential to be rapidly transformed by new technologies, new therapies and ever increasing expectations but this highlights the need to continue with a robust, methodologically sound and detailed analysis of the evidence in each and every case against the Wilson and Junger criteria. </p><p>I will shortly be announcing the name of the incoming Chair of the National Screening Committee.

The Commission found that evidence of recruitment campaigns with very low levels of applications was indicative of on-going difficulties in regard to recruitment of consultants.  Research undertaken on its behalf identified a number of relevant factors including relative pay, training opportunities and the lack of attractiveness of specific posts, particularly in smaller hospitals.  </p>  <p>  The Commission acknowledged that the difference in pay between the pre-existing and new entrant consultants is greater than for other categories of public servants.  It did not view the measures announced last September for new entrant public servants generally, as being sufficient to address the degree of pay differential which exists for Consultants. Given its analysis, the Commission proposed that the Parties to the Public Service Stability Agreement jointly consider what further measures could be taken, over time, to address the pay differential. </p>  <p>  The Government accepted the Report of the Commission and recognises that there are significant recruitment and retention challenges in relation to consultant posts. The proposal of the Commission does need to be addressed. The next step is to engage with the representative organisations of medical consultants.</p>  <p>  It should also be noted that while pay has an impact in recruitment and retention of consultants, a number of other factors are also important, including, inter alia, opportunities for career development, training opportunities and location. The Commission stated it was strongly supportive of the full implementation of the recommendations of the Strategic Review of Medical Training and Career Structures, the 'MacCraith' recommendations, as they have the potential to resolve many of the issues raised with the Commission relating to recruitment and retention. The Department continues to monitor progress on implementation of these recommendations.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the current recruitment challenges, the number of consultants working in the public health service continues to grow year on year. It increased by 125 whole time equivalents or just over 4 per cent in the year to the end of May 2019. In the five years to the end of May 2019 the number of consultants has increased by 533 - over 20 per cent - and now stands at 3,121 WTE's.</p></reply>

In this regard, the Government is committed to improving waiting times for hospital appointments and procedures. </p>  <p>  The joint Department of Health/HSE/National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) Scheduled Care Access Plan 2019 was published in March and sets out measures to improve care for patients waiting for scheduled care this year by reducing waiting times for inpatient/day case treatment and outpatient appointments. </p>  <p>  The Access Plan sets out the activity levels for the NTPF and the HSE.  The NTPF will supply additionality to HSE activity in order to reduce waiting times experienced by patients for a hospital appointment, operation or procedure.  </p>  <p>  A key element of the Plan is the stabilisation of the Outpatient Waiting List. Under the Plan the HSE, in line with the National Service Plan, will aim to deliver 3.3 million outpatient appointments, of which approximately 1 million will be first appointments. For its part the NTPF will aim to deliver 40,000 first Outpatient appointments.  The HSE and the NTPF will focus in particular on a number of specialties with a high volume of referrals, which include ophthalmology. The NTPF is engaging with the HSE and public hospitals to seek solutions for very long waiting patients. NTPF funded treatment is provided in private hospitals or in public hospitals where there is available capacity. </p>  <p>  In addition, my Department is working with the HSE and NTPF, under the Access Plan, with the objective of developing medium-long term improvement initiatives for patient access to hospital procedures. This will include moving care to more appropriate settings and providing care at the lowest level of complexity such as providing ophthalmology in the community; maximising the use of Advanced Nurse Practitioner led clinics; and physiotherapists to manage orthopaedic clinics. </p>  <p>  The latest published waiting list figures show that at the end of May 2019 there were 4,408 patients awaiting a first Ophthalmology outpatient appointment at University Hospital Limerick. Of this number, 1,184 (27%) were waiting 18 months or longer.</p>  <p>  With regard to the specific issue raised by the Deputy in relation to first time Ophthalmology outpatient appointments in University Hospital Limerick, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy Directly.</p></reply>

It provides a basis for uniform reporting by countries with a wide range of different models of organising their national health systems.  Since the inception of the SHA methodology in 2013, Irish current expenditure has increased each year and this aligns with other OECD countries reflecting changes in demographics, macroeconomic growth and technological change.</p>  <p>  The latest figures for Ireland according to the SHA methodology were included in the CSO statistical release, 20 June 2019. Overall there was a 5% increase in health expenditure in Ireland between 2016 and 2017. Ireland&rsquo;s current health expenditure was &euro;21.1 billion in 2017, which represents 7.2% of GDP or 11.7% of GNI* (Modified Gross National Income).</p>  <p>  If modified GNI* us used, Ireland is above the OCED average and if GDP is used Ireland is below the OECD average.</p>  <p>  From the most recent report, the majority of health expenditure (73%) was funded by government, with the balance funded by private sources including health insurance (14%) and household out-of-pocket expenditure (12%).</p>  <p>  Even within a country, accurately measuring healthcare expenditure can be challenging due to uncertainty over what constitutes expenditure on health. A key feature of the SHA methodology is that it focuses solely on expenditure for health purposes which excludes expenditure on social care, and the implication of this is not insignificant for countries including Ireland where health and social care is delivered by the same providers. The Department has commissioned the Economic and Social Research Institute to examine this issue to assist the Department in a more forensic and more meaningful comparable examination of health expenditure and value for money.</p>  <p>  The HSE National Service Plan (NSP) is an important accountability instrument in use by the Department in determining how the HSE is performing against its targets as it captures in a clear and quantified way the range of health and social care services to be provided by the HSE for the allocation it has received.  It establishes links between funding, staffing and services and it incorporates activity measures, outcome-based performance indicators and deliverables in key service areas, which are matched with targets and timescales. In line with this, the NSP incorporates a value improvement programme with agreed savings to be achieved in 2019.</p>  <p>  The Department provides oversight of the performance of the HSE in relation to the delivery of the services set out in the NSP, including the ongoing monthly performance management of the health system against the agreed activity and savings targets.</p></reply>

In this regard, the Government is committed to improving waiting times for hospital appointments and procedures.</p>  <p>  Last year saw considerable improvement in the number of patients waiting for procedures. As a result of increased activity and the ongoing collaboration between the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF), the number of patients waiting for an Inpatient or Day case procedure fell to 70,204 in December 2018, from a peak of 86,100 in July 2017. This represents a reduction of over 18% in the overall number of patients waiting for a procedure. The number of patients waiting more than 3 months fell by more than 17,700, or 31% in the same period from July 2017 to the end of December 2018.</p>  <p>  Budget 2019 announced that the Government had further increased investment in tackling waiting lists, with funding to the NTPF increasing from &euro;55 million in 2018 to &euro;75 million in 2019. The joint Department of Health, HSE, and NTPF Scheduled Care Access Plan 2019 was published in March.</p>  <p>  In terms of locations with highest numbers on waiting lists, the latest NTPF figures show that there are 15,947 patients on Saolta University Healthcare Group IPDC waiting list. This represents a 15% (-2,801) decrease when compared to the same period last year. The NTPF figures also show that there are 14,282 patients on the Ireland East Hospital Group IPDC Waiting List. This shows an 11% (1,727) decrease when compared to the same period last year. </p>  <p>  The latest NTPF figures show that there are 114,609 patients on the South/South West Hospital Group Outpatient Waiting List. The NTPF figures also show that there are 109,543 on the Ireland East Hospital Group Outpatient Waiting List. </p>  <p>  The NTPF advise that over recent months they have placed a particular focus on engaging with hospital groups and individual hospitals to identify outpatient waiting list proposals.</p>  <p>  The Sl&aacute;intecare Action Plan 2019 which was published by my Department, includes a specific workstream on Access and Waiting Lists. Sl&aacute;intecare emphasises the need to invest in increased capacity while also shifting the balance of care from hospitals to community services for better health outcomes and a more sustainable health service. In addition, many of the other service reforms and enhancements included in Slaintecare will support timely access to care for patients in the coming years.</p>  <p>  In line with Sl&aacute;intecare objectives, my Department is working with the HSE and the NTPF, to develop medium-long term improvement initiatives for patient access to hospital procedures.</p></reply>

During the fiscal crisis, as with most areas of public spending, significant reductions in health funding were experienced. Including 2014, the budget provided for health was less than that provided in the previous years, with significant targeted savings through pay reductions and efficiency.</p>  <p>  From 2015 onwards, funding began to be increased on a gradual basis to meet existing costs within the system. In recognition of the difficulties facing the system, in 2016 a further &euro;500m was approved for health in the REV, this sum remaining in the base for 2017. This allowed for services for older people to be maintained at the previous years&rsquo; levels, met shortfalls in the State Claims Agency (SCA) and in PCRS, and provided for a Winter Initiative.</p>  <p>  Additional funding was provided for health from 2017 onwards, including supplementary estimates, to cover pay and pension costs, and the SCA. Overall, since 2017, increased funding has been allocated to these and other demand-led areas, and for service-led developments.  During the period 2014 to 2018, therefore, supplementary funding was provided for the areas outlined above, and to meet demographic and demand-led requirements in acute hospitals, disability emergency placement and regulation, home supports, local demand led schemes and other areas. </p>  <p>  The HSE National Service Plan (NSP) sets out annually the services to be provided by the Executive and the budget provided for that purpose across all health programme areas. The NSP is finalised following an extensive process of engagement between the HSE and my Department. The annual health budget is set within the parameters set out by the Government in its approach to planning for the annual budget. The improving economy has enabled the health service to achieve much needed budget increases in the last three years.</p>  <p>  It is clear that there are areas where further improvements are required and my Department continues to work closely with the HSE to optimise service provision within the constraints of available funding. In this regard, the Department provides oversight of the performance of the HSE in relation to the delivery of services set out in the NSP, including ongoing monthly performance management against agreed targets set out in the NSP. In 2019, significant savings are profiled to be achieved in line with these targets. On present trends, taking account of the pressure in certain areas, the HSE would have a deficit at the end of 2019. This is a matter of concern for the Government and my Department is working closely with the HSE to gain further clarity on the position and to mitigate the deficit is so far as is possible, in co-operation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p></reply>

The first of these building blocks is a clear governance and accountability framework. In that respect, I was pleased to meet the new HSE Board last week prior to their inaugural meeting, who will assist in improving oversight and governance of our health service</p>  <p>  In addition to this, the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy commits to the development of regional care organisations that will enable the delivery of integrated care at a local level. As a first step in this process, it is necessary to align the CHOs and Hospital Groups geographically. My Department undertook a public consultation on this matter in 2018 and has engaged in significant internal analysis on the optimal size and number of future regional areas. I hope to bring proposals on geographical alignment to Government very shortly.</p>  <p>  The development of regional care organisations is a critical enabler of the Sl&aacute;intecare reform programme.  These organisations will be designed to facilitate the efficient and effective delivery of services as outlined in the Sl&aacute;intecare programme, which focuses on how and where services are delivered to provide a more integrated and person-centred service and on improving financial control, governance, accountability, and performance across the health service.  This will ultimately allow us to develop a more population-based approach to service planning and care delivery, with the aim,over time, for greater equity in the allocation of resources within and across regions.</p></reply>

Notwithstanding this fact, progress continues to be made in attracting and retaining consultants and in addressing improvements in the training, working environment and career pathways for Non Consultant Hospital Doctors in Ireland to encourage the supply of future consultant candidates.</p>  <p>  The issue of new entrant pay is being addressed in general terms under the terms of the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020.  The issue has also been examined by the Public Sector Pay Commission in relation to consultants. Given its analysis, the Commission proposed that the parties to the Public Service Stability Agreement jointly consider what further measures could be taken over time to address the pay differential. The proposal of the Commission does need to be addressed. The next step is to engage with the representative organisations of consultants. However, brokering an affordable solution will be a significant challenge, in particular within the context of budgetary pressures and broader public sector policy.</p>  <p>  It should also be noted that while pay has an impact in recruitment and retention of consultants, a number of other factors are also important, including, inter alia, opportunities for career development, training opportunities and location. The Commission stated it was strongly supportive of the full implementation of the recommendations of the Strategic Review of Medical Training and Career Structures, the 'MacCraith' recommendations, on the basis they have the potential to resolve many of the issues raised with the Commission relating to recruitment and retention. My Department continues to monitor progress on implementation of these recommendations.</p>  <p>  Concerning Nurses, the recent nursing agreement and the new Enhanced Practice Nurse/Midwife contract will see the financial position of nurses and midwives improve and should help to both recruit and retain nurses in the public health service. In relation to pay, the new Enhanced Practice Nurse and Midwife contract will deliver salary improvements for those that migrate to this new role range from between 2% - 11%. The Enhanced Nurse / Midwife Practice salary scale ranges between &euro;35,806 to &euro;47,201. The agreement will see improvements to a range of allowances, their extension to additional nurses and midwives, and a new allowance for those in medical surgical wards up to the maximum full year cost of &euro;10m. It also includes a commitment to increase the number of Advanced Nurse Practitioners to a minimum of 2% of the nursing workforce. The HSE are currently working on a plan to deliver the implementation of the agreement.</p></reply>

The derogation is an important facility for more intensive farmers and almost 7,000 intensively stocked farmers availed of the derogation in 2018. </p>  <p>  Derogation farmers make up 6% of bovine farmers, 11% of the land area but have 20% of the bovine livestock herd. There has been a significant expansion in land area covered by the derogation of almost 35% since 2014.</p>  <p>  In addition, a further 5,000 farmers with 13% of the national bovine herd farm above the 170 kg N/ha limit but export slurry to comply with the limit rather than applying for a derogation. </p>  <p>  Recent EPA reports have highlighted deterioration in water quality and increasing green house gas and ammonia emissions. There are also significant issues around the decline of EU protected habitats in Ireland. However, we know that there opportunities to reduce the impact of these farms on the environment.</p>  <p>  In light of continuing expansion of the dairy herd, increasing land area being farmed under derogation and the environmental pressures outlined, it was considered opportune to review the conditions of the Nitrates derogation. Ireland's current derogation concludes in 2021, and failing to address the environmental pressures above, would negatively impact on any negotiations to renew this important facility. As part of this review, a public consultation was held with 75 submissions received.</p>  <p>  The Nitrates expert group which is composed of officials from the EPA, Teagasc, Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and my Department is currently considering these submissions. Recommendations for measures which will improve efficiencies and reduce the environmental footprint of these intensive farms will be submitted by the group within the coming months.</p></reply>

In addition, the sector will also deliver an additional 26.8 Mt CO<sub>2</sub>eq through better land use management such as afforestation and improved management of peaty grasslands.  </p><p>The plan identifies 34 actions for the sector that will contribute to our transition to a low carbon economy and society across abatement measures, carbon sequestration measures and displacement of fossil fuels and reflects our three pillar policy approach to achieving carbon neutrality without comprising sustainable food production of: </p><p>1. Reducing agricultural emissions;</p><p>2. Increasing carbon sequestration; and</p><p>3. Displacing and substituting fossil fuel and energy intensive materials. </p><p>These actions in this plan are informed by the recent Teagasc Marginal Cost Abatement Curve report (MACC) - <i>An Analysis of Abatement Potential of Greenhouse Gas Emissions in Irish Agriculture 2021-2030</i>as an identifiable suite of actions for delivery. These actions include both efficiency measures such as the Dairy EBI programme and technical measures such as changes in fertiliser type or low emissions slurry spreading as well as a series of forestry and bio economy measures.</p><p>Marginal Abatement Cost Curves (MACCs) are very beneficial in terms of identifying the most cost-effective ways of meeting the targets both within and between sectors and also in identifying options that cost less than the marginal benefit from abatement. MACCs provide a useful framework to engage stakeholders on opportunities to reduce emissions. </p><p>While the target for the agriculture sector in the All-of-Government Plan to tackle climate breakdown is challenging, immediate action and early adoption is key and there are three important actions that can be advanced immediately.</p><p>- Deepening engagement with farmers and other stakeholders to promote the necessary deployment of new technologies and changes in farming practices. </p><p>- Improving nitrogen use efficiency such as widespread adoption of low emissions slurry spreading or introduction of clover in grassland swards; and</p><p>- Continuing our support for research and innovation such as the potential of novel feed additives in grass based production systems. </p><p>I will work to ensure that the next Common Agriculture Policy (CAP) is aligned with this ambition and that climate action is main streamed in the development of our CAP strategic plan to ensure the delivery of this target. While the mitigation potential for agriculture is limited, agriculture can and must play a key role in contributing to Ireland&rsquo;s climate change and energy targets in the years ahead.</p></reply>

My Department is aware of the need to encourage the utilisation of farm manure as an alternative source of energy and fully recognises the wider environmental benefits of using agricultural residues in the production of bio gas/bio methane and, in particular, the potential for a significant role in the heat and transport sectors. However, the cost efficiency of this technology remains challenging due to the low energy content of farm manure.</p><p>The Support Scheme for Renewable Heat (SSRH) aims to bridge this economic gap will support farms and businesses to adopt renewable heating systems, including biogas heating systems.  The SSRH has been developed to financially support the adoption of renewable heating systems by agricultural, commercial, industrial, district heating operators and other non-domestic heat users not covered by the EU Emissions Trading System. Under Project Ireland 2040, the National Development Plan sets out an allocation of &euro;300 million for the roll out of the SSRH for the period of up to 2027.</p><p>Earlier this month, my colleague Richard Bruton, Minister for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment opened the second phase of the SSRH, an operational support for biomass boilers and anaerobic digestion heating systems for applications. Details of this scheme including the tariffs that apply are available on the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland's website at the following link: .</p><p>In addition, the Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Schemes (TAMS) supports capital investment in a number of target areas which will promote, among other things, sustainability (e.g. low emissions slurry spreading equipment, farm nutrient storage, and renewable energy and energy efficiency).  I recently made &euro;10 million available for energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies, following a comprehensive review of TAMS designed to increase its focus on sustainability.  Eligible investments include extension of support for Solar PV Installation to all sectors and support for LED Lighting as the only form of lighting to be grant aided.  In addition, other energy efficiency measures such as biomass boilers and water heating continue to be eligible investment items under TAMS.</p></reply>

A young farmer is clearly defined as a person who commenced their farming activity no more than five years prior to submitting their first Basic Payment Scheme application and who is no more than 40 years of age in the year of submission of such an application.  My Department has no discretion in the implementation of this aspect of EU Regulation 1307/2013 and in this regard farmers who commenced their agricultural activity prior to 1 January 2010 are not eligible for the Young Farmers Scheme.</p><p>In respect of the Forgotten Farmer issue, the Regulations governing the operation of the National Reserve include an optional provision whereby Member States may use the National Reserve to allocate new entitlements at the national average level of approximately &euro;185 or give a top-up on the value of existing entitlements to the national average value for persons who suffer from a specific disadvantage.</p><p>In the context of the discussions with the EU Commission in early 2015 regarding the inclusion of the group referred to as Old Young Farmers under the 2015 National Reserve, the Commission advised that the inclusion of groups under &lsquo;Specific Disadvantage&rsquo; category  of the National Reserve would require individual approval at EU level.</p><p>The National Reserve in 2017 was established using funding derived from a linear cut to the value of all farmers&rsquo; entitlements. EU Regulations pertaining to the National Reserve provide that the two categories of &lsquo;young farmer&rsquo; and &lsquo;new entrant to farming&rsquo; must receive priority access to the Reserve.  In the context of the commitment in the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i>, Ireland consulted with the EU Commission regarding the possibility of including the group commonly referred to as Forgotten Farmers under the specific disadvantage category of the 2017 National Reserve. The EU Commission confirmed that Member States could not use the proceeds of a linear cut to fund a specific disadvantage category of the National Reserve.  </p><p>The Commission confirmed at the time that the only funding option for the specific disadvantage category was natural replenishment of the Reserve, such as from unused entitlements or the proceeds of clawback, but only after the two priority categories of &lsquo;young farmer&rsquo; and &lsquo;new entrant to farming&rsquo; had been catered for.</p><p>EU Regulation 2393/2017 (Omnibus Regulation) came into effect in January 2018 and introduced a new possibility for the inclusion of &lsquo;Specific Disadvantage&rsquo; categories such as Forgotten Farmers into the National Reserve. From 2018, Member States may use the proceeds of a linear cut to fund &lsquo;Specific Disadvantage&rsquo; categories of the Reserve, but only if a linear cut is required to fund the two priority categories of &lsquo;young farmer&rsquo; and &lsquo;new entrant to farming&rsquo; in that particular year.  As there was sufficient funding available in the National Reserve in 2018 and 2019 from natural replenishment of the fund in order to cater for the two priority categories, the issue of a linear cut did not arise.</p><p>All entitlements held under the Basic Payment Scheme are subject to convergence.  Farmers who hold entitlements that have an Initial Unit Value that is below 90% of the Basic Payment Scheme national average have seen the value of their entitlements increase gradually over the five years of the scheme.  By 2019, all entitlements for all farmers in Ireland are at least 60% of the national average value.  In this regard, the group of farmers referred to as Forgotten Farmers will have benefitted from an increase in the value of their entitlements through convergence to 2019.</p><p>Decisions in relation to the National Reserve, including the basis of funding the Reserve, are made in consultation with the Direct Payments Advisory Committee which comprises members of the main farming organisations, farm advisory and education services.</p><p>With regard to eligibility for the Young Farmers Capital Investment Scheme, I am aware that there is a group of young farmers who established their holdings prior to 2008.  A person in this category does not qualify under EU rules for the increased rate-of-aid of 60% available under the scheme.  However, where possible priority is given to these affected farmers within the general stream of applicants for TAMS II, with grant-aid payable at 40%.</p></reply>

We have made concerted efforts over the full twenty-year history of these negotiations, working closely with other Member States and by engaging directly with the European Commission, in order to minimise the EU offer in terms of beef, and, while evidence of these efforts appears to have been reflected in the final offer, I am, nonetheless, deeply concerned at the potential impact on the Irish beef sector.  There may be some opportunity for other agri food sectors such as dairy and for the drinks industry, but we will need to examine the text carefully to assess the full impact. </p>  <p>  It is also worth noting that this agreement will not come fully into effect for some years. It will first go through a process of legal scrubbing, which could take up to two years, before being put before the European Trade Council for ratification by Qualified Majority Vote, and the European Parliament. </p>  <p>  If the agreement passes those hurdles, it is expected that the trade elements which fall under the EU Commission's competence, will be phased in over 6 years.</p></reply>

The aim of the schemes is to improve the energy efficiency of our built environment, in a way which represents the best possible use of Exchequer funding. This involves making difficult decisions and targeting supports in particular ways such as by limiting certain grants to homes built before 2006.   As new homes are already required to meet specific energy performance standards and to incorporate renewables under Building Regulations, grant support is currently focussed on improving the condition of existing dwellings. Grant funding further works in more recently built homes that already meet certain levels of energy performance would not represent a cost-effective use of Exchequer funds. </p>  <p>  However, grant funding for renewable measures under the Better Energy Homes Scheme is available to homes built before 2011. Additionally, the year of build is not considered as part of the application process for the Deep Retrofit Pilot Programme. This pilot, which provides 50% funding for deep energy upgrades, instead assess the energy uplift that can be achieved.</p>  <p>  The recently published Climate Action Plan commits Government to developing a new retrofitting delivery model, which will group retrofits together to achieve economies of scale, leverage private finance, and ensure easy pay-back methods. The area based retrofit programme will seek to capitalise on critical mass that will benefit both householders and the supply chain. This programme will focus on designated areas in both rural and urban environments and could be designed and delivered to include local authorities, approved housing bodies or other strategic delivery partners. </p></reply>

Following a public consultation process, it was further extended in 2012, and now applies in 26 urban areas nationwide. The ban has proved very effective in reducing particulate matter and sulphur dioxide levels and has had the effect of significantly improving public health. Research indicates, for example, that the ban has resulted in over 350 fewer annual deaths in Dublin alone.</p>  <p>  I am disappointed that a number of coal firms have indicated that they would challenge the decision of two former Ministers to expand the smoky coal ban nationwide. Banning the use of smoky coal would have a positive impact on air quality and public health, particularly in built up areas. </p>  <p>  I am working with the Attorney General to finalise a legally robust plan which will improve air quality by reducing particulate matter in the air. High levels of particulate matter arise from a number of sources, including the burning of smoky coal. </p>  <p>  In the meantime Local Authorities are primarily responsible for the enforcement of legislation on solid fuel, including the &lsquo;smoky coal&rsquo; regulations, within their functional areas. The powers that Local Authorities have in this area are extensive. For example:</p>  <p>  - Local Authority staff may undertake inspections of premises and vehicles being used for the sale and distribution of solid fuel as well as collect samples</p>  <p>  - A Local Authority may bring a prosecution under the Air Pollution Act for breaches of the Regulations.</p>  <p>  - The maximum fine amounts for breaches of the Regulations is &euro;5,000 on summary conviction</p>  <p>  - Fixed payment notices (or &lsquo;on the spot fines&rsquo;) applied by the Local Authority are in operation for alleged offences relating to the marketing, sale and distribution of prohibited fuels in Low Smoke Zones (LSZs)</p>  <p>  Complaints regarding the sale of prohibited fuels, smoky emissions or other breaches of the regulations should, in the first instance, be reported to the relevant Local Authority. </p>  <p>  In addition to the measures available to Local Authorities outlined above, my officials are currently examining other enforcement options to ensure the success of the ban, including the establishment of multiagency teams. This is in line with other areas of environmental enforcement such as waste, where such an approach has proved successful.</p></reply>

The current Directive applies to linear broadcasting services - i.e. traditional television, and in a limited way to non-linear services, i.e. on-demand services such as the RT&Eacute; Player.  The Broadcasting Act 2009 established the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland as the independent regulator for linear broadcasting services, both television and radio in Ireland. On-demand services are currently subject to a co-regulatory Code of Conduct overseen by the On-Demand Audiovisual Services Group (ODAS), which was established under the auspices of IBEC. The Code of Conduct applies to all on-demand audiovisual service providers operating in the state and provides for a complaints mechanism in relation to content on on-demand services.</p>  <p>  In terms of the Code&rsquo;s operation, the BAI&rsquo;s only role is that its statutory Compliance Committee acts as an appeals body, where a complainant is not satisfied with the decision of the on-demand service provider, on complaints relating to content. In this regard, a Memorandum of Understanding is in place between the BAI&rsquo;s Compliance Committee and ODAS. The BAI does not have a role in relation to any complaints appeals in respect of commercial communications. This appeals function is carried out by the Advertising Standards Authority of Ireland (ASAI).</p>  <p>  In May 2016, the European Commission published its proposal to revise the AVMSD. The text of the revised Directive has been adopted by the EU and was officially published on 27 November 2018. The revision of the AVMSD will require an increase in the level of oversight by Member States of on-demand audiovisual media services. In early March, I announced that Government would address harmful online content through the development of new legislation, an Online Safety &amp;amp; Media Regulation Bill, which will also transpose the revised AVMSD. I launched a public consultation on these proposals which concluded last month. The submissions received in respect of this consultation have been published on my Department's website and will inform the preparation of legislation, including in respect of on-demand services. </p></reply>

A screening for appropriate assessment for the works contained in the project was carried out in 2016.</p>  <p>  IFI have also confirmed that projects C1551 and SCF-17-0006 are two separate projects. Both are projects on the Owenmore River in Altnabrocky in Co. Mayo. Project C1551 was completed in 2016. Following this, the developers sought funding to carry out a separate project to enhance the spawning opportunities for Salmon in the Owenmore River. SCF-17-0006 was approved for funding and the works were completed in 2018.</p>  <p>  For clarification, the reference number of the Ray River project, located in Falcarragh, Co.

A modernised post office network will provide a better range of financial services and e-commerce services for shoppers and small businesses. </p>  <p>  Reflecting our commitment to sustaining a nationwide post office network and daily mails service, the Government made &euro;30m available in State funding to An Post which is being used to support the renewal of the post office network (&euro;15m) and the continued fulfilment of a 5 day per week mails delivery service (&euro;15m). As An Post is a commercial State body, this support was provided by way of a loan. </p>  <p>  The past financial challenges facing An Post have been well documented primarily due to the impact of email and other forms of online communication on mail volumes. Mail volumes have decreased some 40% since 2007. In 2018 alone mail volumes declined by 7.6%. In response, the An Post Board have put in place a strategic plan setting out a transformation of the company in both the mails and retail business.</p>  <p>  An Post recorded an operating profit of &euro;41.2m for 2018 compared to &euro;8.4m for 2017. This represents the second year of significant financial improvement bringing the Group out of its loss making position of &euro;12.4m in 2016. This reflects the significant amount of work that has gone into restructuring the company and modernising its network. </p>  <p>  On 17 January 2019 the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection renewed her Department&rsquo;s contract with An Post to provide pensions, Child Benefit and other social welfare payments in cash at Post Offices. The current terms of the contract between the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and An Post were agreed in 2013 for an initial two year period, with an option to extend annually up to the end of 2019. Further contracts are a matter for the Department for Employment Affairs and Social Protection and An Post. </p>  <p>  The Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill 2017 includes an amendment to allow for the tendering of TV Licence fee collection. The Bill is currently at an advanced drafting stage. In the meantime, there will be no change to the existing TV licence fee arrangements and An Post continues to work as my issuing agent in accordance with Section 145 of the Act. </p>  <p>  As part of its consideration of the financial position of An Post, the Government agreed that further opportunities for Government business through the Post Office Network should be explored. The first practical step that the Government took was the launch of the Digital Assist pilot initiative. Government funding of &euro;80,000 was allocated to the scheme which has seen 10 post offices kitted out to assist citizens with online Government interactions. The pilot will provide data and insight in relation to the provision of offline Government services to citizens. A review of the initiative will be carried out shortly. </p>  <p>  On 4 September 2018, the Government approved the establishment of an interdepartmental group to identify options, including procurement frameworks, for delivering services to those citizens who do not wish to use, or are unable to use, digital services. </p></reply>

The report, published in 2016 and entitled<i>&ldquo;Electromagnetic Fields in the Irish Context&rdquo;, </i>reaffirms the overall conclusion of an earlier 2007 report, <i>&ldquo;Health Effects of Electromagnetic Fields&rdquo;</i>, that there is insufficient evidence to establish a causal relationship between exposure to low-frequency electromagnetic fields and adverse health effects.</p><p>Irish policy in this area continues to be informed by a substantial volume of internationally recognised scientific research and evidence. This includes the guidelines set down by the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). These guidelines provide scientifically-based limits that are applicable to both public and occupational exposure from electromagnetic fields (EMF), including 5G. ICNIRP guidelines apply up to a frequency of 300 gigahertz (GHz), well above the maximum frequencies being considered for 5G. ICNIRP guidelines are based on evidence gathered from all peer-reviewed scientific literature and not on the conclusions of any single scientific paper, event, or other source. </p><p>In this regard, I have recently assigned a new statutory function to the Environmental Protection Agency to provide general information to the public on matters pertaining to public exposure to non-ionising radiation, to monitor international scientific developments, and to provide independent advice to my Department in this area.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-07-02a.1512.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019070200080#WRX00800"><p>The Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme is funded by my Department and administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI). The scheme delivers a range of energy efficiency measures free of charge to low income households vulnerable to energy poverty. To date over 135,000 homes have received free upgrades under the scheme, leaving the occupants better able to afford to heat their homes to an adequate level. </p>  <p>  The aim of the scheme is to deliver a range of energy efficiency measures in a way which represents the best possible use of Exchequer funding. The rules of the Scheme stipulate that repeat upgrade visits are not provided. This rule is in place to ensure that the available Exchequer funding provides upgrades to as many eligible homes as possible and to prioritise eligible homes that have never had any work done under the scheme. </p>  <p>  Last year, the scheme was expanded. Subject to a survey by SEAI and an assessment of potential for improved energy performance, the scheme can now, in certain circumstances, include internal or external wall insulation. This will permit the upgrade of more property types such as homes with solid walls, and also increase the energy savings and emissions reductions that the scheme can achieve. In addition, it will enable future fuel switching. Demand for the scheme is extremely high, reflecting the shift to deeper measures, and is impacted by longer delivery times associated with these type of works and the delivery capacity of SEAI&rsquo;s contractor panel.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently working with the SEAI to determine whether further changes to the scheme are required. It is expected that this review will be completed in the coming months.</p></reply>

OPW uses an environmental guidance procedure, agreed with IFI, to ensure habitat retention and to implement value-added works that are consistent with the OPW&rsquo;s compliance requirement with the Water Framework Directive and with fisheries issues. </p><p>In the overall planning process, the two organisations under their joint agreement, have also examined the rationale for experimental strategies in respect of:</p><p>- reconnection of old channel meanders cut off in drainage works;</p><p>- mitigating for gravel traps on OPW channels, constructed as part of the original schemes, that may be impeding fish passage and sediment transport; and</p><p>- mitigations for fish passage at bridge structures etc. that can be addressed in OPW work programmes </p><p>As previously confirmed the agreement between IFI and OPW was signed in mid-2018 and provides that &ldquo;proposals from 3<sup>rd</sup>parties to undertake in-stream and/or riparian works should be tested in advance to assess appropriateness of interventions and the most relevant measures, if the works are to proceed&rdquo;. The agreement envisages IFI undertaking surveys in this context on an agreed small number of cases annually. </p><p>The four sites referred to are all third party projects proposed in 2017 but not progressed by the third party applicants. IFI has advanced matters by organising that these sites are surveyed to facilitate progression of the projects. IFI will, therefore, conduct pre-fishery enhancement surveys on four locations in 2019, in line with agreement with OPW. IFI envisages that further such surveying will be undertaken in 2020 as part of the on-going IFI-OPW programme.</p><p>The previous questions, Nos. 592 and 593, referenced by the Deputy do no appear to relate to uptake on fishery enhancement funding schemes. In that regard, I assume the Deputy is referring to the Salmon and Sea Trout Conservation Fund. </p><p>If this is the case I can advise the Deputy that uptake in the most recent call, following the expansion of the scheme, has been as expected, with 32 expressions of interest received by IFI, for this scheme alone, with an investment value in excess of &euro;1 million.</p><p>I have already offered the Deputy a briefing from IFI on all these matters and, in view of the questions tabled by her in relation to fisheries schemes, I extend that offer again. </p></reply>

The Climate Action Plan sets a target to improve the energy efficiency of public sector buildings by 50%.</p>  <p>  The public sector has already made a strong contribution in this regard with the sector improving its energy efficiency by 24% to end 2017. Cumulatively, the energy efficiency improvements achieved by public sector bodies have resulted in an avoided energy spend of more than &euro;1 billion and a carbon emissions saving of over 3.5 million tonnes. The achievements to date result from a combination of improved energy management as well as equipment and building fabric improvements. A combination of approaches will continue to be necessary in the future to meet our targets including targeted energy efficiency investment in the retrofitting of buildings. </p>  <p>  My Department is providing leadership and guidance to other Government departments and public sector bodies to help them to achieve their efficiency targets as part of the process of implementing the Public Sector Energy Efficiency Strategy. This includes the SEAI engaging with Public Sector Bodies to assess the range and nature of project opportunities (project pipeline) including building fabric upgrades. This ongoing exercise will help to inform the assessment of the costs to achieve the targets for 2030 and beyond. It is also important to note that the achievement of public sector targets will require initiatives beyond those targeted at the building stock. This would include initiatives relating to public transport fleets, water and waste facilities, public lighting and other energy users across the public sector.</p>  <p>  My Department is working with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to avail of expertise under the EU Structural Reform Support Service (SRSS) to inform the development of a comprehensive building upgrade programme for the Public Sector. It is intended that this will incorporate an assessment of the total level of investment required to achieve the 2030 targets and recommendations for the optimal mix of funding options to reach the necessary objectives. This exercise, which is included as an action in the Climate Action Plan, will commence in Q3 this year and report in 2020.</p>  <p>  Project Ireland 2040 has made significant funding available in pursuit of our public sector targets. This includes funding of &euro;800 million for public building energy retrofit, along with further funding for school energy retrofits, third level building renovations, and public transport fleet replacement. The potential for this investment to be supported by non-exchequer sources of funding such as Energy Performance Contracting (EPC) will be also be explored as part of the SRSS exercise.</p></reply>

For ease of reference, I include the full SFILT steady state estimates in Table 1. </p><p>Table 1: Estimated annual steady state expenditure requirement, 2014-2016 and post-2016 (&euro;m)<table><tr><th></th><th>Average Annual Cost 2014-2016</th><th>Average Annual Cost Attributable to DTTaS   2014-2016</th><th>Average Annual Cost post-2016</th><th>Average Annual Cost Attributable to DTTaS   post-2016</th></tr><tr><td>National Roads</td><td>585</td><td>481</td><td>573</td><td>469</td></tr><tr><td>RLR Roads</td><td>580</td><td>480</td><td>580</td><td>480</td></tr><tr><td>Heavy Rail</td><td>291</td><td>195</td><td>291</td><td>195</td></tr><tr><td>Luas</td><td>81</td><td>60</td><td>49</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>Buses</td><td>61</td><td>61</td><td>61</td><td>61</td></tr><tr><td>Integration</td><td>15</td><td>15</td><td>15</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>1,613</td><td>1,292</td><td>1,569</td><td>1,241</td></tr></table></p><p>Isolating steady state investment from other types of transport expenditure can be difficult but, on the basis of available information, I include in Table 2 my Department&rsquo;s best estimate of steady state investment in the regional and local road network and public transport from 2017 to 2020.</p><p>Table 2: Departmental steady state expenditure, 2017-2020 (&euro;m)<table><tr><th></th><th>2017</th><th>2018</th><th>2019*</th><th>2020**</th></tr><tr><td>RLR Roads</td><td>300</td><td>384</td><td>418</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Heavy Rail</td><td>158.8</td><td>160.0</td><td>197.0</td><td>199.7</td></tr><tr><td>Buses</td><td>60.7</td><td>92.1***</td><td>100.6***</td><td>122.7***</td></tr><tr><td>Integration</td><td>4.3</td><td>6.9</td><td>11.4</td><td>13.0</td></tr></table></p><p>*Allocated</p><p>**Projected</p><p>***Includes some additional capacity provision</p><p>Finally, I include in Table 3 the difference between the estimated steady state requirement and investment in regional and local roads and public transport from 2017 to 2020.  As steady state expenditure on the regional and local road network includes current and capital expenditure, and current allocations are determined annually as part of the Budget process, a 2020 figure is not available at this point.</p><p>Table 3: Estimated difference between steady state requirement and investment, 2017-2020 (&euro;m)<table><tr><th></th><th>2017</th><th>2018</th><th>2019*</th><th>2020**</th></tr><tr><td>RLR Roads</td><td>(180)</td><td>(96)</td><td>(62)</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Heavy Rail</td><td>(36.1)</td><td>(43.2)</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Buses</td><td>(0.3)</td><td>31.1</td><td>39.6</td><td>61.7</td></tr><tr><td>Integration</td><td>(11.7)</td><td>(8.1)</td><td>(3.6)</td><td>(2.0)</td></tr></table></p><p>In a constrained fiscal context, Departmental spending fell short of the estimated steady state requirement over a number of years. However, with the increased capital allocations for my Department announced in Budget 2018 we will be investing more into our existing infrastructure in the years ahead. The steady state funding requirement for heavy rail, through the Infrastructure Manager Multi-Annual Contract, and buses has been met in 2019, while we will be investing the required level of funding into national, regional and local roads by 2021.</p><p>I have referred your question to TII and the NTA for a direct reply in relation to steady state expenditure on national roads and Luas in the period 2017 to 2020.

The intention behind Baby Boxes is to welcome a new arrival to a family, acknowledging this very significant moment for parents. </p>  <p>  As indicated in the Implementation Plan, an oversight group will be established later this year to lead the development of the pilot and scope the project to prepare for implementation and evaluation.  </p>  <p>  While resourcing has been secured through the Dormant Accounts Fund to progress the pilot, the pilot has not yet begun so no results are yet available.  As indicated in the Implementation Plan, it is intended that the pilot design will be agreed in 2020 and underway, along with the evaluation, in 2021. </p>  <p>  The pilot will consult to determine items for inclusion in the pack. Baby Boxes offer the opportunity to communicate important child development and safety messages and is an early opportunity to link with parents in need of support services. </p>  <p>  The results of the evaluation will inform any plans about wider roll-out.</p></reply>

This level of funding will be maintained this year. Tusla does not commission this particular service for the provision of support services to victims of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence and has never done so.</p><p>Tusla currently provides funding to two domestic violence services in the Donegal area, (1) Donegal Women&rsquo;s Domestic Violence Service and (2) Donegal Women&rsquo;s Centre. Donegal Women&rsquo;s Domestic Violence Service is the primary organisation delivering domestic violence support services across Co. Donegal, including Inishowen.</p><p>In 2018, Tusla provided over &euro;650,000 for the provision of domestic violence services in Donegal. Tusla has advised my Department that it is not seeking to commission additional domestic violence services in Co. Donegal at this time. Tusla believes that funding additional organisations in Donegal would lead to duplication of service provision and a risk of fragmentation of services, particularly where organisations provide similar services in the same geographical area.</p><p>I appreciate the concerns of service users of Lifeline Inishowen. I have been assured by Tusla that services for children and families in Inishowen that are affected by domestic violence will continue to be provided by other funded service providers in County Donegal, including counselling.</p><p>Tusla acknowledges that accessibility is an issue for many service users in rural areas, and supports organisations to develop and enhance outreach services in order to improve service access. </p><p>Many organisations have moved from a clinic-based response to more flexible responses where arrangements are made to meet service users at times and locations that are safe and convenient for them. Tusla has advised that both Tusla-funded domestic violence support services in Donegal are flexible in their approach in order to ensure services are accessible to service users throughout the county. </p><p>Sexual violence services in Donegal are provided by Donegal Sexual Abuse &amp;amp; Rape Crisis Centre. In 2018, Tusla provided &euro;230,000 to Donegal Sexual Abuse &amp;amp; Rape Crisis Centre. With the additional 10% funding allocation to Rape Crisis Centres nationally, 2019 funding to the organisation is expected to be &euro;251,500.</p><p>At all times, the key priority of Tusla is to ensure the needs of victims and survivors are met in the best way possible, with due attention to the quality, accessibility, and outcome of services.</p></reply>

AIM is a child-centred model, involving seven levels of progressive support, moving from the universal to the targeted, based on the needs of the child and the pre-school service. It offers tailored, practical supports based on need and does not require a formal diagnosis of disability.</p>  <p>  Level 7 of AIM provides additional assistance in the pre-school room where this is critical to ensuring a child&rsquo;s participation in the ECCE programme. In line with emerging best practice to support the integration and independence of children with a disability, AIM does not fund Special Needs Assistants (SNAs). Rather, it provides financial support to the pre-school provider, which can be used by the pre-school provider either to reduce the adult to child ratio in the pre-school room (enabling the provider to reduce the number of children in the room without impacting on the provider's total income) or to buy in additional assistance to the pre-school room. Accordingly, Level 7 assistance is a shared resource for the pre-school setting.</p>  <p>  The funding is disbursed to the pre-school provider, through Pobal, who are charged with administration of DCYA programmes.  There are restrictions on the use to which AIM funding can be put, as is only right and appropriate to guidelines on grant funding and use of public money.  Pre-school providers are awarded AIM Level 7 funding as a result of an assessment carried out by an Early Years Specialist, and guidance and support on how best to utilise the funding may be provided. However, as with all DCYA Early Learning and Care funding programmes, the pre-school provider is the employer of the staff who work in the setting. It is therefore for the pre-school provider to take all necessary steps to ensure they are meeting their legal obligations as an employer.</p>  <p>  First 5, the Whole of Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families, includes a commitment to review the funding model for the Early Learning and Care sector, under which employers will be supported to provide more favourable working conditions to attract and retain staff. The new funding model will leverage additional investment for certain criteria, for example, better pay, or full implementation of the curriculum. It is envisaged that this may open alternative mechanisms by which the State could incentivise services to meet national standards in relation to wages and/or working conditions.</p></reply>

The figures reflect the published Revised Estimates Volume for the years in question.</p><p>In addition to its Exchequer allocation, the WDC manages the Western Investment Fund (WIF) which provides loans and equity to businesses and local communities in the West. The WDC currently has &euro;48 million available for investment and lending under this Fund.</p><p>An additional &euro;500,000 was allocated to the WDC this year to enable the Commission to appoint extra resources to maximize the use of the WIF and to support the co-ordination of the Atlantic Economic Corridor initiative.  This additional allocation reflects the important and expanding role of the WDC in contributing to the Government's regional policy objectives under Project Ireland 2040, and in progressing the economic and social development of the Western region in particular.</p><p>Table 1 &ndash; REV allocations 2016-2018, Western Development Commission<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Current<br /><br />&euro;000</th><th>Capital<br /><br />&euro;000</th><th>Total&euro;000</th></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>1,488</td><td>1,000</td><td>2,488</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>1,495</td><td>1,000</td><td>2,495</td></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>1,516</td><td>-</td><td>1,516</td></tr><tr><td>2019</td><td>2,028</td><td>-</td><td>2,028</td></tr></table></p></reply>

This is the group of jobseekers facing the most significant barriers to secure and sustain full-time employment.</p>  <p>  Between July 2015 and May 2019, some 227,590 jobseekers had commenced their engagement period with the JobPath service.  Of this number, 52% were unemployed for over three years.  These groups face significant barriers when seeking to enter or return to employment in the open labour market.</p>  <p>  To date, some 51,818 jobseekers have commenced employment during their engagement period with JobPath.  Of this number, 46,155 had commenced full-time employment and 5,663 had commenced part-time employment.  Many clients who are currently engaged with JobPath are still in the first phase of the service and have not had sufficient time with the service to have gained employment.  Performance will improve as more clients complete their engagement with the service.</p>  <p>  My Department does not maintain statistics on the specific types of employment commenced through JobPath.  However the recent econometric review of JobPath noted that the weekly employment earnings of people who secured employment with the JobPath service are 17% higher than the weekly employment earnings of people who secured employment without the support of JobPath in 2018. Taken with the 26% improvement in employment outcomes in the same period, it means the overall positive employment/earnings impact is 37% in 2018 for those who are supported by the JobPath service.  These findings indicate that jobseekers who engage with JobPath are more likely to get a positive employment outcome than those jobseekers who aren't supported by the service.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies matters for the Deputy.</p></reply>

A key element is the increased focus by Social Welfare Inspectors on the enforcement of PRSI compliance obligations.  Inspectors nationwide have commenced a campaign of employer inspections and a new unit is being established to focus specifically on the area of false self-employment.</p><p>Deliberate mis-classification of employment status is an offence with penalties on prosecution of up to three years imprisonment and/or fines up to &euro;13,000 or twice the amount denied to the Social Insurance Fund as a result of the mis-classification, whichever amount is greater.  The new unit will ensure that cases of fraudulent mis-classification of employment status are prosecuted and that the full force of penalties are applied.  To this end, led by my Department, the 2007 Code of Practice on Employment Status will reach the end of a comprehensive revision process next month.  This Code will be a vital tool for employers and employees alike so they can be clear when a worker is genuinely self-employed.  This document will be circulated to ICTU and IBEC for their input before it is published.  In addition, Heads of Bill have already been drafted in order to place the revised Code on a statutory footing later this year.</p><p>The question of whether a worker is employed or self-employed is not always a simple one.  The Courts have repeatedly stated that a decision must be made based on the specific facts of each case, having regard to key tests such as the level of control a would-be employer has over the worker and the level of obligation they have towards each other.</p><p>My strong view is that this is a far better mechanism than trying to capture in legislation a definition that can never be black and white.</p><p>I have instructed my officials to also explore a range of legislative proposals to complement the increased inspection work that will be key to the long term success of this project.  These proposals include anti-penalisation provisions for workers who will be able to take a claim to the WRC if they are victimised by an employer for raising a query regarding their status; and an increase in penalties for employers who deliberately mis-classify employees as being self-employed.</p><p>Most of the cases referred to Scope Section cover matters such as modified classes of PRSI for civil and public servants, family employments and the insurability of Directors.  However, I understand the Deputy&rsquo;s questions refer primarily to cases where the insurability of a worker as being either employed or self-employed is to be determined and, in particular, where false self-employment has been found.</p><p>Of all the cases referred to Scope, the number involving the mis-classification of an employee as self-employed constitute a small proportion.  A breakdown of cases is not available pre 2018 as the historic database in use in Scope did not allow this categorisation.</p><p>Number of all cases referred for Scope decision<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>All cases referred</th><th>All cases decisions made</th><th>Employed/self-employeddecisions made</th></tr><tr><td>2017 </td><td>1,473</td><td>1,065</td><td>Not available</td></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>2,067</td><td>1,339</td><td>73</td></tr><tr><td>2019 (to end May)</td><td>879</td><td>575</td><td>59</td></tr></table></p><p>The following statistics show the number of such decisions made and the length of time within which the decisions were made:</p><p>Number of cases in sub-category of Employed/Self-Employed (Decision Made)<table><tr><th>Decision made within</th><th>2018</th><th>2019 (to end May)</th></tr><tr><td>Under 3 months</td><td>33</td><td>31</td></tr><tr><td>3-6 months</td><td>14</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>6-12 months</td><td>23</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>Over 12 months</td><td>3</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Total decisions made</td><td>73</td><td>59</td></tr></table></p><p>These cases do not always involve a deliberate fraudulent mis-classification of a worker as self-employed. Sometimes it happens that both employer and employee are genuinely mistaken in their approach and are happy to correct the position once the Department&rsquo;s officials make a determination.</p><p>There are currently approximately 142 cases on hands in Scope Section that involve employee/self-employed investigations.  The duration of these investigations is will very from case to case, depending on the issues involved.  Most of these cases are complex and require referral to a Social Welfare Inspector who will interview the relevant parties at local level and send his/her report on the matter back to Scope Section.</p><p>I hope this clarifies matters for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The scheme assists by enhancing and developing a person&rsquo;s technical and personal skills which can then be used in the workplace.  The very significant improvement in the number of people in employment and concomitant reduction in unemployment is a strong testament to the Government's job creation and pathways to work strategies which is ensuring employment opportunities across all age groups and in all regions.</p>  <p>  All CE participants age 55 and over can avail of 3 consecutive years on a CE scheme.  As CE is intended to be a stepping stone to employment for participants rather than a long-term placement, there is an overall lifetime limit of participation on CE of 6 years from 1st January 2007 (7 years if on a disability payment).</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Government agreed to establish an Interdepartmental Group (IDG) to explore how social inclusion schemes might best be organised into the future including which Department should hold lead responsibility for sponsoring CE schemes focused on social Inclusion.

In any year about 85% of all claims are awarded by the Department and just 1% are appealed.  Nevertheless, the Department is concerned that these cases are dealt with as quickly as possible.</p><p>The time taken to process an appeal reflects a number of factors including that the appeals process is a quasi-judicial process with Appeals Officers being required to decide all appeals on a &lsquo;de-novo&rsquo; basis.  In addition, appeals decisions are themselves subject to review by the High Court and decisions have to be formally written up to quasi-judicial standards.  Other factors that influence appeals processing times include the quality of the initial decision &ndash; in this respect the Department has changed the decisions process in respect of medical schemes, in order to provide more information to the claimant.  I expect that this will help to reduce the number of appeals over time.</p><p>In addition, a considerable number of new Appeals Officers have joined the Appeals Office over the past 12-18 months, to replace staff leaving on retirement.  Given the complexity of the appeals process it takes some time for new staff to be trained up and develop expertise and this has led to somewhat longer processing times during this period.  The Chief Appeals Officer has advised me that appeal processing times continue to be a priority for her Office. </p><p>Accordingly, significant efforts and resources have been devoted to reforming the appeal process in recent years.  As a result, appeal processing times in respect of all schemes improved between 2011 and 2017 from 52.5 weeks for an oral hearing in 2011 to 26.4 weeks in 2017 and from 25.1 weeks for a summary decision in 2011 to 19.8 weeks in 2017.  The corresponding processing times for the year 2018 were 30 weeks for an oral hearing and 24.8 weeks for a summary decision.  There has been some improvement to date in 2019 with an oral hearing decision taking on average 28.2 weeks and a summary decision taking 23.3 weeks. </p><p>Finally, where a claimant has been refused a social welfare payment, regardless of the scheme involved, and is appealing that decision, if their means are insufficient to meet their needs it is open to them to apply for supplementary welfare allowance in the interim.  </p><p>If their application for supplementary welfare allowance is refused, they can also appeal that decision.  The supplementary welfare allowance appeal will be prioritised for attention within the Appeals Office as soon as the appeal file and submission is received from my Department.</p><p>The following table sets out the appeal processing times (for summary and oral hearing cases) for the various schemes for the first five months of 2019.  </p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p><p><b>Appeal Processing Times by Scheme 1 January 2019&ndash; 31 May 2019</b><table><tr><th></th><th>Average processing times (weeks) Summary Decisions</th><th>Average   processing times (weeks) Oral Hearings</th></tr><tr><td>Adoptive Benefit</td><td>Nil</td><td>33.7</td></tr><tr><td>Blind Person&rsquo;s Pension</td><td>19.6</td><td>30.0</td></tr><tr><td>Carer&rsquo;s Allowance</td><td>26.5</td><td>29.2</td></tr><tr><td>Carer&rsquo;s Benefit</td><td>26.2</td><td>22.9</td></tr><tr><td>Child Benefit</td><td>33.0</td><td>35.0</td></tr><tr><td>Disability Allowance</td><td>15.8</td><td>20.9</td></tr><tr><td>Illness Benefit</td><td>32.6</td><td>32.3</td></tr><tr><td>Partial Capacity Benefit</td><td>34.5</td><td>46.9</td></tr><tr><td>Domiciliary Care Allowance</td><td>29.1</td><td>33.0</td></tr><tr><td>Deserted Wife&rsquo;s Allowance</td><td>20.4</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><td>Deserted Wife&rsquo;s Benefit</td><td>91.7 (1 case)</td><td>33.6</td></tr><tr><td>Farm Assist</td><td>29.2</td><td>33.2</td></tr><tr><td>Bereavement Grant</td><td>39.7</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><td>Working Family Payment </td><td>22.7</td><td>29.6</td></tr><tr><td>Invalidity Pension</td><td>26.6</td><td>28.2</td></tr><tr><td>Liable Relatives</td><td>25.9</td><td>14.2</td></tr><tr><td>Maternity Benefit</td><td>33.5</td><td>31.6</td></tr><tr><td>Paternity Benefit</td><td>34.5</td><td>17.7</td></tr><tr><td>One Parent Family Payment</td><td>32.3</td><td>37.0</td></tr><tr><td>State Pension (Contributory)</td><td>34.9</td><td>47.0</td></tr><tr><td>State Pension (Non-Contributory)</td><td>36.1</td><td>39.3</td></tr><tr><td>Occupational Injury Benefit</td><td>32.3</td><td>56.6 (3 cases)</td></tr><tr><td>Disablement Pension</td><td>26.5</td><td>32.4</td></tr><tr><td>Incapacity Supplement</td><td>Nil</td><td>32.5</td></tr><tr><td>Guardian's Payment (Contributory)</td><td>20.9</td><td>30.1</td></tr><tr><td>Guardian's Payment (Non-Con)</td><td>22.2</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Allowance (Means)</td><td>28.1</td><td>35.8</td></tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Allowance (Payments)</td><td>25.0</td><td>30.1</td></tr><tr><td>Back To Work Family Dividend</td><td>28.3</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Transitional</td><td>27.7</td><td>37.3</td></tr><tr><td>Recoverable Benefits &amp;amp; Assistance</td><td>37.3</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Benefit</td><td>26.2</td><td>26.9</td></tr><tr><td>Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant </td><td>26.9</td><td>26.7</td></tr><tr><td>Insurability of Employment</td><td>63.7</td><td>72.4</td></tr><tr><td>Supplementary Welfare Allowance</td><td>19.2</td><td>26.9</td></tr><tr><td>Widow/Widower's Pension (Contributory)</td><td>35.9</td><td>31.0</td></tr><tr><td>Widow/Widower's Pension (Non-Contributory)</td><td>37.6</td><td>42.1</td></tr><tr><td>Widowed Parent Grant</td><td>34.7</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><td>All Appeals</td><td>23.3</td><td>28.2</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The income and gains of such funds are exempt from tax within the fund. Any amounts withdrawn from an ARF are referred to as a distribution. A distribution is treated as income from an employment. It is subject to income tax and the fund manager must operate the PAYE system on it.</p>  <p>  Under social welfare legislation any payments received by way of pension are not regarded as reckonable emoluments for the purposes of self-employed pay related social insurance (PRSI).

A person may be eligible for Carer's Benefit if they have enough PRSI contributions.  This and other care-related supports, such as the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance payment and the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant, provide recognition and support for the valuable role of carers.</p>  <p>  Carer&rsquo;s Benefit is payable for a maximum period of 104 weeks for each person being cared for.  It can be taken in one block or in separate periods as long as the combined total does not exceed 104 weeks.  The current weekly rate is &euro;220.00.  Where a person is caring for two or more care recipients, the rate of payment is increased by 50%.   </p>  <p>  At the end of May 2019, there were 2,724 carers in receipt of Carer&rsquo;s Benefit.  An Increase for a Qualified Child was being made in respect of 824 children, 302 of whom are aged 12 years or more.  Estimated expenditure on Carer&rsquo;s Benefit in 2019 is &euro;37.83m</p>  <p>  A person in receipt of Carer's Benefit may not take part in employment, self-employment, training or education courses outside the home for more than 15 hours a week.  The maximum amount a person can earn is &euro;332.50 per week.  (&euro;332.50 is the net income after deducting income tax, Universal Social Charge, PRSI, superannuation (pension payments), pension levy, union dues, subscriptions to Friendly Societies and any health insurance contract premium from total wages.)</p>  <p>  With regard to Carer's Benefit the means/income of a spouse, civil partner or co-habitant of a carer would only be taken into account if claiming an increase for a child dependant (IQC).  Therefore it is not possible to estimate the cost of increasing the income disregard for Carer&rsquo;s Benefit from &euro;332.50 for a single person and &euro;665 for a married couple to &euro;450 and &euro;900 per week respectively.</p>  <p>  Carer's Allowance is a means tested payment, made to people who are providing full-time care and attention to elderly people or to people with disabilities and whose income falls below certain limits. The principal conditions for receipt of the allowance are that full time care and attention is required and being provided and that the means test which applies is satisfied. </p>  <p>  The conditions attached to payment of Carer's Allowance are consistent with the overall conditions that apply to social assistance payments generally.  This system of social assistance supports provides payments based on an income need with the means test playing the critical role in determining whether or not an income need arises as a consequence of a particular contingency - be that illness/disability, unemployment or caring.  </p>  <p>  The means test for Carer's Allowance is one of the most generous in the social protection system in that &euro;332.50 of gross weekly income is disregarded in the calculation of means for a single person; the equivalent for someone who is married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting is &euro;665 of combined gross weekly income.</p>  <p>  As of end of May 2019, there were 81,131 people in receipt of Carer's Allowance.  The projected expenditure on Carer's Allowance in 2019 is almost &euro;840 million.</p>  <p>  With regard to Carer's Allowance, it is not possible to make a robust estimate of the costs requested on the level of additional programme costs using available administrative data, particularly as such a change would be highly sensitive to the income distribution in households at the time of implementation.  However, analysis based on the SWITCH model (Simulating Welfare and Income Tax Changes) predicted an estimated cost in the region of &euro;73 million, which, when income tax and Working Family Payment offsets are taken into account, produces an estimated net expenditure of &euro;55 million.   </p>  <p>  Any changes to qualifying criteria for these schemes, including income disregards, would have to be considered in an overall budgetary context.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, as well as Luas and services provided by over 80 private transport operators.  There are currently approx. 948,000 customers with direct eligibility.  Following recent announcements in Budget 2019 the funding for the free travel scheme was increased by &euro;5 million to a total of &euro;95 million.</p>  <p>  In general access to a free travel pass for those aged under 66 is linked to a person being in receipt of certain primary Social Protection payments such as disability allowance, invalidity pension, carer&rsquo;s allowance, blind pension and partial capacity benefit.  In 1997 the free travel pass was extended to all registered blind people regardless of whether they qualify for the Department's blind person's pension or any other Social Protection payment. Blind people remain one of the only cohorts of people aged under 66 who can qualify for a free travel pass while not in receipt of a qualifying Social Protection payment.</p>  <p>  Any possible extension to the eligibility criteria for free travel would have significant costs implications for the free travel scheme and would also require additional administrative processes to be put in place to adjudicate eligibility.  Any decision to do so could only be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations.</p>  <p>  Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme (SWA) the Department of  Employment Affairs and Social Protection may award a travel supplement in any case where the circumstances of the case so warrant.  The supplement is intended to assist with ongoing or recurring travel costs that cannot be met from the client&rsquo;s own resources and are deemed to be necessary.  Every decision is based on consideration of the circumstances of the case, taking account of the nature and extent of the need and of the resources of the person concerned. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The personal rate of payment is based on the assessment of the person's restriction on capacity for work i.e. moderate, severe or profound, where the person retains 50%, 75%, or 100% of their payment respectively.</p>  <p>  An application for Partial Capacity Benefit was received from the person concerned on the 13th December 2018. She was assessed as having a mild incapacity for work and therefore did not qualify for Partial Capacity Payment. She was notified of the decision on the 15th February 2019.</p>  <p>  On request,  the Department reviewed this decision and a second medical assessment resulted in her being considered as having a moderate incapacity for work which would satisfy the medical criteria for entitlement to Partial Capacity Benefit. A notification issued to her on the 29th May 2019 informing her of this. </p>  <p>  However, as entitlement to Partial Capacity Benefit is dependent on a person having an underlying entitlement to either Illness Benefit or Invalidity Pension and as the entitlement of the person concerned to Invalidity Pension is currently being reviewed,  a decision on her Partial Capacity Benefit application cannot be made until this review is completed.</p>  <p>   I trust that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, as well as Luas and services provided by over 80 private transport operators.  There are currently approx. 948,000 customers with direct eligibility.  Following recent announcements in Budget 2019 the funding for the free travel scheme was increased by &euro;5 million to a total of &euro;95 million.</p>  <p>  In general, access to a free travel pass for those aged under 66 is linked to a person being in receipt of certain primary Social Protection payments such as disability allowance, invalidity pension, carer&rsquo;s allowance, blind pension and partial capacity benefit.  In 1997 the free travel pass was extended to all registered blind people regardless of whether they qualify for the Department's blind person's pension or any other Social Protection payment.  Blind people remain one of the only cohorts of people aged under 66 who can qualify for a free travel pass while not in receipt of a qualifying Social Protection payment.</p>  <p>  Any possible extension to the eligibility criteria for free travel would have significant costs implications for the free travel scheme and would also require additional administrative processes to be put in place to adjudicate eligibility.  Any decision to do so could only be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations.</p>  <p>  Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme (SWA) the Department of  Employment Affairs and Social Protection may award a travel supplement in any case where the circumstances of the case so warrant.  The supplement is intended to assist with ongoing or recurring travel costs that cannot be met from the client&rsquo;s own resources and are deemed to be necessary.  Every decision is based on consideration of the circumstances of the case, taking account of the nature and extent of the need and of the resources of the person concerned. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

These include the:</p><p>- Disability Awareness Support Scheme (DASS)</p><p>- Reasonable Accommodation Fund (RAF), which encompasses:</p><blockquote>- Employee Retention Grant <br /><br />- Workplace Equipment / Adaptation Grant<br /><br />- Personal Reader Grant <br /><br />- Job Interview Interpreter Grant  </blockquote><p>The purpose of the Workplace Equipment/Adaptation Grant (WEAG) is to increase the job opportunities for people with a disability by supporting any additional costs, related to the disability, incurred by private sector employers employing or retaining an employee with a disability or self-employed people with a disability.</p><p>The general principles of the scheme are that it:</p><p>- applies only to the additional costs of adapting workplace equipment or of provision of equipment arising from the individual&rsquo;s disability.  It should not be used to provide support usually provided by employers or supports required under legislation for employees who do not have a disability;</p><p>- is a contribution towards the cost of an adaptation or of equipment up to a current limit of &euro;6,350.  It can also be used to upgrade adaptive equipment which may have been funded previously.  Application in excess of this sum will be considered on an individual basis up to a maximum of &euro;9,523 if specialist training for the assistive technology is required;</p><p>- is not intended to meet the usual costs of setting up and running a business either for an employer or a self-employed person;</p><p>- will be treated as a grant; and</p><p>- may be used in part for training in the use of the grant-aided equipment.</p><p>Those eligible for receipt include:</p><p>- Any person with a disability who is about to take up employment with a private sector employer, change job as a result of redeployment or promotion, or become self-employed, and who requires assistive technology or an adaptation to the workplace in order to undertake the duties required.</p><p>- Any person employed by a private sector employer who acquires a disability whilst in employment, whose employer is participating in the Employee Retention Grant Scheme (ERGS), and who requires assistive technology or an adaptation to the workplace in order to retain his/her employment.</p><p>- Any person with a disability who is employed by a private sector employer, whose condition deteriorates so that he/she requires new assistive technology or a further adaptation to the workplace in order to retain his/her employment.</p><p>The Community Employment (CE) scheme provides part-time employment and training opportunities in local communities for people in receipt of a long term Social Welfare payment as a stepping stone back to employment.  It is important to note that community employment, does not, nor is it intended to, provide full-time sustainable employment.  As CE projects are funded by the Exchequer, participation on a CE scheme is not considered as private sector employment for the purpose of eligibility for WEAG. </p><p>The Department intends to commence a focused policy review of the Reasonable Accommodation Fund (RAF) in 2019.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The CSO is responsible for determining the employment and unemployment rates for the State, and the Labour Force Survey (LFS) is the official source of employment estimates in the State. </p><p>The CSO publishes detailed tables on the LFS on a quarterly basis, and these tables include a gender breakdown.  The releases from the CSO are closely monitored by my Department, including the gender breakdowns of employment and unemployment. </p><p>Examples of breakdowns produced by the CSO include the Labour Market Participation Rates and the Unemployment Rates for men and women; the results from the last five LFS releases are shown in the following table.<table><tr><th></th><th></th><th>Q1 2018 </th><th>Q2 2018  </th><th>Q3 2018 </th><th>Q4 2018 </th><th>Q1 2019 </th></tr><tr><td>Male </td><td>Participation Rate </td><td>68.2</td><td>68.6 </td><td>69.0 </td><td>68.3 </td><td>68.1 </td></tr><tr><td>Female</td><td>Participation Rate</td><td>55.1</td><td>56.4 </td><td>56.4 </td><td>56.2 </td><td>56.1 </td></tr><tr><td>Male</td><td>Unemployment Rate</td><td>5.8</td><td>6.2 </td><td>5.9 </td><td>5.4 </td><td>5.1 </td></tr><tr><td>Female</td><td>Unemployment Rate</td><td>5.5</td><td>5.8 </td><td>6.1 </td><td>5.4 </td><td>4.4 </td></tr></table></p><p>The latest LFS results show that over the year to Q1 2019, female labour market participation increased by 1%, while the female unemployment rate decreased by 1.1%.  These are both positive developments and highlight the increasing participation of women in the labour market. </p><p>The LFS is also used to monitor gender equality in the Labour Market at an EU level.  This includes the overall unemployment rates of men and women, as well as analysis of the long-term unemployment rates of men and women.  These are illustrated in the following table for the year 2018.<table><tr><th></th><th>EU average </th><th>Ireland </th></tr><tr><td>Male Unemployment</td><td>6.6</td><td>5.8</td></tr><tr><td>Female Unemployment</td><td>7.1</td><td>5.7</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Male Long Term Unemployment</td><td>2.8</td><td>2.3</td></tr><tr><td>Female Long Term Unemployment</td><td>3.0</td><td>1.8 </td></tr></table></p><p>The CSO's Monthly Unemployment release also details the unemployment rate for men and women; in June 2019, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for women was  4.3% and 4.7% for men.  This compares to June 2018, when the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 5.7% for women and 6.0% for men.</p><p>Female labour market participation is below that of males, but has increased year-on-year.  The unemployment rate for females has fallen year-on-year, and at a faster rate than for men.  The detail reported by the CSO in this regard provides great depth, breadth, and regularity of the statistics produced by CSO on gender participation and outcomes in the Labour Market. </p></reply>

It should be noted that a landlord or an agent acting on behalf of a landlord is not legally obliged to enter into a tenancy agreement with a HAP recipient.  However, on 1 January 2016, the Equality (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2015 introduced &ldquo;housing assistance&rdquo; as a new discriminatory ground.  This means that discrimination in the provision of accommodation or related service and amenities against people in receipt of rent supplement, HAP or other social welfare payments is prohibited.  If a person feels that they have been discriminated against by a landlord or their agent, they can make a complaint under the Equal Status Acts to the Workplace Relations Commission.  </p>  <p>  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) 2018 Annual Report states that it dealt with 1,711 queries from the public last year relating to the Equal Status Acts.  22% of these related to &ldquo;housing assistance&rdquo;, which equates to approximately 376 complaints.</p>  <p>  Misunderstanding of the scheme is often to blame for such discrimination and it highlights the need for the State to continue to explain and outline the many benefits of HAP to landlords.  My Department and local authorities have been involved in a range of national and local communications actions to clarify the operational benefits of HAP to landlords and agents. </p>  <p>  At the end of Quarter 1 2019, over 45,900 eligible households were being supported through HAP, with over 27,100 individual landlords and agents providing accommodation via the scheme.

Considerable work has been carried out by my Department in developing a draft of such a framework, which has as its main aim the harmonisation of local authority rents, to ensure that rent schemes are fair and sustainable, prioritise those on lowest incomes and avoid creating social welfare traps that may prevent people from either returning to work or to the private housing market.  The general over-arching principle that rents should be related to incomes will be maintained.</p>  <p>  This work is now being examined further in the light of the broader commitment given in the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, to review the disparate systems of differential rent for social housing in place across local authorities.  I expect that the review will be completed in the near future, at which point I will consider what proposals might be brought to Government as part of a wider social housing reform package of measures, that would continue to ensure that housing support goes to those who need it most within a system that is responsive to people&rsquo;s changing needs and circumstances.</p></reply>

Commercial rates income is critical to meet the cost of services provided by local authorities in supporting local communities and businesses. </p>  <p>  The Commissioner of Valuation is independent in setting of valuations for rating and the Valuation Office is currently engaged in a national revaluation programme, the first such revaluation in over 160 years.  Up to date valuations are important to ensure that the levying of rates is on a fair, equitable and consistent basis across all economic sectors and parts of the country.</p>  <p>  Local authorities levy rates on commercial properties in accordance with the Commissioner&rsquo;s valuation.  The annual rate on valuation (ARV) is a reserved function decided by elected members in the annual budget.  My Department has, in recent years, requested local authorities to exercise restraint in setting ARVs and they have responded positively. </p>  <p>  In overall terms, while economic activity has been expanding significantly in recent years, the overall rates income of local authorities nationally has remained relatively unchanged.  Furthermore, I understand that of the revaluations conducted to date, under the revaluation programme, approximately 60% of ratepayers have had their liability for rates reduced and approximately 40% have experienced an increase.  </p>  <p>  In order to ensure that the revaluation promotes equity across sectors and areas, but is also a revenue neutral exercise in overall terms, the Minister may limit the total amount of rates collectable within a local authority in the year following a revaluation to that collected in the previous year, subject to minor adjustments. </p>  <p>  In terms of specific reliefs, the Local Government (Rates) Act 1970 allows rating authorities to make waiver schemes in respect of specified classes of property, subject to the consent of the Minister.  Furthermore, the Local Government (Rates) Bill 2018, which passed Committee stage in the D&aacute;il last week, contains a provision, for the introduction of rates alleviation (waiver) schemes by local authorities to support important policy objectives contained in local, economic, community and land use plans.  The Bill is a key legislative priority of my Department. </p></reply>

In 2016, the Government published the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan on Housing and Homelessness.  Rebuilding Ireland is designed to significantly increase the supply of social housing by 50,000 homes in the period to 2021, double the output of overall housing to at least 25,000 homes per annum by 2020, support all tenure types (social, private and rental), and tackle homelessness comprehensively.  The Plan is underpinned by over &euro;6 billion in funding.  By the end of Quarter 1 2019, 78,000 households had been supported under Rebuilding Ireland and this figure is expected to reach 100,000 by the end of 2019. </p>  <p>  The Government has increased the budget available to local authorities to deliver homeless services to &euro;146m in 2019, an increase of over 25% on the 2018 allocation.  Local authorities and their service delivery partners work with households experiencing homelessness to identify and secure exits from emergency accommodation to independent tenancies, within the shortest possible timeframe.  Rebuilding Ireland is delivering very significant results in supporting exits from homelessness.  In 2018, 5,135 adults exited homelessness into independent tenancies, an 8.6% increase on 2017.  Securing housing solutions for all households experiencing homelessness will continue to be a priority for my Department.</p></reply>

With this in mind, guidelines on inter authority movement were introduced in 2017 to allow for local authorities to facilitate movement of HAP households from one local authority area to another in cases where a HAP tenant, currently on a local authority waiting list, wishes to access rented accommodation with HAP support in another local authority area.  Inter authority movement is subject to certain conditions. </p>  <p>  Additional guidance issued in April 2019.  Households eligible for social housing support are now provided with the opportunity to avail of HAP in any local authority area, subject, of course, to the current Social Housing Income Eligibility Bands or confirmation that the applicant's income is below the threshold in the new local authority. </p>  <p>  Given that such flexibility facilitates better utilisation of all private rental stock for social housing purposes and supports the maximum activation potential of HAP households by removing geographical barriers to employment (such as loss of housing support or time on a transfer list), all local authorities have been requested to give appropriate consideration to these requests.</p>  <p>  HAP tenants continue to be dealt with by their originating local authority.  However, the rent limits will be those that apply in the local authority where the property is situated.  The originating local authority will engage with the relevant new local authority to facilitate eligible requests for inter-authority movement.</p></reply>

The making or amending of a rent scheme is an executive function and is subject to broad principles set out by my Department including that &ndash; </p>  <p>  - the rent payable should be related to income and a smaller proportion of income should be required from low income households; </p>  <p>  - provision should be included for the acceptance of a lower rent than that required under the terms of the scheme in exceptional cases where payment of the normal rent would give rise to hardship;</p>  <p>  - appropriate local factors should be taken into account including the costs of the maintenance and management of the stock of rented dwellings and the adequacy of the rental income to meet such costs.</p>  <p>  Since 1986 when rent setting was devolved to individual local authorities, different approaches have been taken to rent charging and setting across the country.  While local authorities generally follow the Household Means Policy (which applies for assessment of eligibility for social housing) there is variation in the extent to which they apply the income disregards set out in that policy in their Differential Rent Schemes and differing approaches are taken to income sources such as the Working Family Payment or the Carer's Allowance.  My Department does not hold data on the exact approaches taken by individual local authorities as the methodology for calculating rents is a matter for individual housing authorities in the first instance.  </p>  <p>  Considerable work has been carried out by my Department in developing a draft national differential rents framework for the purposes of section 31 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009.  Such a framework has as its main aim the harmonisation of local authority rents, including a set of standardised income disregards, whilst retaining the general principle of rents related to household income. </p>  <p>  This work is now being examined further in the light of the broader commitment given in the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, to review the disparate systems of differential rent for social housing in place across local authorities.  The overall objective is to ensure that housing supports are fair and sustainable and prioritise those on lowest incomes.  I expect that the review will be completed in the near future.</p></reply>

The Commissioner is independent in the performance of his functions including the selection of rating authority areas for revaluation.</p><p>The Valuation Office is currently engaged in a national revaluation programme, the first revaluation of all rating authority areas in over 160 years. The revaluation activity, on a local authority by local authority basis, is set out in the following table. Overall, the Programme involves the valuation of some 150,000 properties. When a Local Authority area is revalued it must be revalued again within a minimum of 5 years and a maximum of 10 years.  Moving to the 5-10 year cycle represents a significant step forward for the rateable valuation system. </p><p>In terms of the process, the Commissioner makes a valuation order, to formally commence the process in each area, a valuation date is set, and the new rateable valuations are then assessed and set by reference to the market conditions and business environment that prevailed on this date.

My Department and the bodies under its aegis have taken practical steps to provide such opportunitie to children and young people.</p><p>My Department recently supported Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g which took place on the 15 June 2019.  Now in its second year, this national day of creativity for children and young people included free access to over 700 events across the country such as workshops, exhibitions and performances, with a special focus on starter workshops to encourage young people to try something new.  Further information is available at <i></i>.</p><p>Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g is part of the Creative Ireland Programme which seeks to ensure that every child in Ireland has practical access to tuition, experience and participation in music, drama, art and coding by 2022.  Another element of the Programme is the Creative Youth Plan which was launched in December 2017 and includes the Creative Schools pilot project, currently underway, and which is a partnership between my Department, the Department of Education and Science, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Arts Council. Creative Schools, which  will have 300 schools participating from September this year, will see each school developing a bespoke school plan to embed arts and creativity and explore new links with artists and cultural organisations, both locally and nationally. To assist this, each participating school is being awarded &euro;2,000. </p><p>In addition, a pilot group of Education and Training Boards are developing new Creative Youth Partnerships to extend the reach of the Creative Youth plan to the non-formal sector.  The ETBs in question are Laois/Offaly, Limerick/Clare and Kerry. </p><p>The Deputy should also note that the National Cultural Institutions have a general policy of free admission for children while access to all our National Parks is free. The OPW additionally provides free educational visits to heritage sites for schools provided certain conditions are met, while children under the age of 12 have free access to a huge number of OPW managed sites.

The Review concluded that Ireland could more effectively achieve conservation of threatened raised bog habitat through focused protection and restoration of a reconfigured network which entails:</p>  <p>  i. The cessation of turf-cutting on 36 existing natural heritage areas, which will remain designated - this includes 7 sites to be divided, with part to be conserved and part de-designated; </p>  <p>  ii. The complete de-designation of 46 natural heritage areas - including the relevant areas of the 7 sites to be divided - where it has been judged that their conservation potential is expected to be marginal and/or that restoration would be prohibitively expensive for the conservation benefits achieved. Domestic turf-cutting may continue on these sites, while larger scale or commercial turf cutting will continue to be regulated through other consent systems; and</p>  <p>  iii. The designation as natural heritage areas of 25 currently undesignated raised bogs, which are in public ownership or where there is reduced turf cutting pressure. These sites are to be proposed for designation to make up for the loss of habitat within the natural heritage area sites where turf cutting is to continue.</p>  <p>  The Wildlife (Amendment) Bill 2016, to give effect to the outcome of the 2014 Review, was presented to the D&aacute;il on 21 July 2016 and was passed by that House on 13 December 2018.</p>  <p>  The Bill, as passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, provides for me, as Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, to complete the 2014 Review of Raised Bog Natural Heritage Area Network and for a Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht to conduct a review or reviews of blanket bog natural heritage areas, at his or her discretion.</p>  <p>  The Wildlife (Amendment) Bill 2016 has passed Committee Stage in Seanad &Eacute;ireann and is now to be scheduled for Report Stage in that House.</p></reply>
