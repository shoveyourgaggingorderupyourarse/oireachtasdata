The staff numbers have been reduced by 4.  </p><p>In further alignment with the Secretary General's report, the reformed GIS team now incorporates the Government Press Office, giving a total of 17 on the newly combined team.</p><p>The civil servants in the reformed Government Information Service come under the management of the Assistant Secretary for Corporate Affairs, while respecting the role of the Government Press Secretary and the Deputy and Assistant Government Press Secretaries in day-to-day management of press and communications.</p><p>The work of the reformed Government Information Service includes; the work of the Government Press Office, the digital team/merrionstreet.ie, central support services for other Departments, providing services to the media, managing media events and producing communications material across all platforms. </p><p>GIS is supporting the development of the single Government identity, the single web portal project, gov.ie and capacity building in communications across Government. GIS continues to have a co-ordinating and supporting role for national, cross-Government communications, as has always been the case, but such campaigns are being led and funded by the relevant line Department. </p></reply>

This was one of a series of Summits relating to the Future of Europe. </p><p>On this occasion, our focus was on migration and internal security. We also took the opportunity to discuss progress in the negotiations on Brexit.</p><p>On migration, we had a useful exchange on how best to progress the comprehensive approach we agreed at the June European Council. This involves working to secure our external borders and to strengthen cooperation with countries of origin and transit; and dealing with the management of migrants within the EU.  </p><p>On internal security, the issues we discussed included the increasing complexity of the cyber threats we face, including to the integrity of our electoral systems.</p><p>There were no formal Conclusions adopted, but the outcome of our discussions will feed into the next meeting of the European Council, which takes place in Brussels later this week, on 17 and 18 October </p><p>Our discussions on Brexit, which took place in Article 50 format, provided an opportunity to review progress in the negotiations and discuss next steps.  I reiterated the need for a legally operable version of the backstop in the Withdrawal Agreement, and thanked EU partners for their ongoing support and solidarity on this issue. I emphasised my hope that the future relationship between the EU and the UK will be as close and comprehensive as possible, but reiterated that the Withdrawal Agreement, including the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, with a robust and legally watertight backstop, must be agreed first.  </p><p>I had a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister May in the margins of the Summit on Thursday, 20 September, in which we discussed the state of play in the Brexit negotiations, as well as developments in relation to Northern Ireland. </p><p>I also took the opportunity to engage informally with the other EU Heads of State or Government in the margins of the meeting. </p><p>I look forward to meeting with my EU counterparts again at the European Council in Brussels this week.</p></reply>

All four funds were launched in May this year, with the application deadlines now closed for the first round of proposals. The relevant Departments are reviewing all applications received, with decisions on successful applications for the first round of funding expected over the coming months and the first projects to commence in early 2019. </p>  <p>  The Land Development Agency, another cornerstone initiative of Project Ireland 2040, has also been set up and is working to ensure the optimum management of State land through strategic development and regeneration, with an immediate focus on delivering homes, including social and affordable homes.  </p>  <p>  Housing remains a central priority for the Government. We are seeing an increase in the number of new and refurbished houses available year on year &ndash; however, we are very aware that a huge challenge remains in meeting demand and tackling the ongoing issues in the housing market. </p>  <p>  We are continuing to focus on increasing housing supply, tackling homelessness and increasing the availability of affordable and social housing. In addition to the work underway through Project Ireland 2040 and Rebuilding Ireland, Budget 2019 provides for an increase of 25% in the housing budget for next year. </p>  <p>  Climate action objectives are also at the heart of Project Ireland 2040 and, building on the National Mitigation Plan, an investment of &euro;22 billion in Exchequer and non-Exchequer funding will ensure a step change in climate action policy.  </p>  <p>  In Budget 2019, a number of additional new measures were introduced to help lower carbon emissions including, a new accelerated capital allowances scheme for gas-propelled vehicles and refuelling equipment.</p></reply>

Unfortunately, to date, it has not proved possible to reach an agreement on the formation of an Executive, despite intensive engagement.  The absence of the Executive also means that that North South Ministerial Council cannot meet.</p>  <p>  I am currently engaging with the Secretary of State, Karen Bradley on how both Governments can most effectively secure the effective operation of all of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement.  </p>  <p>  In the period ahead, I believe a new political process is required to get beyond the current impasse and secure the necessary agreement between the parties on operating the devolved institutions again.  I do not underestimate the way to go in achieving that, but I firmly believe that a resolution is possible and that the calls from across all sections of the community in Northern Ireland for the devolved institutions to operate will be heeded.</p>  <p>  A meeting of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference took place on 25 July to discuss issues of mutual interest to the Irish and British Governments, in accordance with the Good Friday Agreement.  The conference discussed legacy issues, security co-operation, east-west bilateral issues and political stability in Northern Ireland.  A date for the next meeting of the conference is currently being considered.</p>  <p>  Regarding the UK decision to leave the European Union, the Government is determined to ensure that the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, and the gains and benefits of the peace process, are protected for people on the island of Ireland, North and South.  The Government appreciates the solidarity and support which has been shown by all of our EU partners in respect of Ireland&rsquo;s unique issues and concerns and is continuing to engage intensively in the article 50 process, to ensure the protection of the Good Friday Agreement.</p>  <p>  In terms of outstanding commitments, the Government continues to support a statutory basis for the Irish language in Northern Ireland, as envisaged under the St Andrews Agreement.  Respect for linguistic diversity and the Irish language are important elements of the Good Friday Agreement. </p>  <p>  As reflected in the programme for partnership Government, the Government also remains supportive of, and continues to advocate for, the advancement of a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland.  The continued value of a bill of rights in the context of Brexit was one of the themes which emerged from the all island civic dialogue sectoral on human rights under the Good Friday Agreement which the Government convened in February 2017.</p>  <p>  A North South consultative forum is a further important outstanding element envisaged under the Good Friday Agreement, and the Government has continued to pursue this, including by maintaining the issue on the North South Ministerial Council in recent years.</p>  <p>  The Government views as a solemn responsibility our role and mandate as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.  We will spare no effort to fulfil our duty as co-guarantor, including to seek the effective operation of all of its institutions, ensure that the agreement is protected in the context of the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU, and working for the implementation of outstanding commitments.  The Government will continue this work, in co-operation with the British Government and engaging with all of the political parties in Northern Ireland.</p></reply>

For 2019, the Government has allocated almost &euro;817 million for Official Development Assistance, ODA.  This level of allocation represents an increase of approximately &euro;110 million &ndash; or 16% on the revised 2018 budget allocation.</p>  <p>  The total amount of ODA which Ireland will invest during 2019 is now the highest since the financial crisis, a mark of the restoration of the economy.  2019 is the fifth consecutive year the Government has increased allocations to ODA.  By comparison, in 2015 the ODA allocation amounted to just under &euro;650 million.</p>  <p>  In his budget speech, the Minister for Finance said that "at 0.31 per cent of GNI*, this level of assistance represents a clear statement that this Government and the Irish people will not be found wanting in addressing some of the major humanitarian crises and development challenges our planet faces".  The ODA/GNI* % depends on the allocation to total ODA and forecasted GNI*.  Despite the increase in ODA allocation over the last few years, the strong performance of the Irish economy and the resulting growth in GNI levels can have a significant dampening effect on the ODA/GNI %.</p></reply>

Having already posted additional senior personnel to Berlin, Paris, London and Brussels, this will enable us to continue to strengthen our teams in other key EU capitals including The Hague, Warsaw, Madrid and Rome, as well as other parts of our European network.</p>  <p>  Further funding is being earmarked for the Passport Service, which has seen a notable increase in demand for Irish passports from Irish citizens in Northern Ireland and Great Britain since the UK voted to leave the EU.  Over 20% of total passport applications for 2017 came from these jurisdictions with more than 82,000 applications being received from Northern Ireland and almost 81,000 from Great Britain.  This represented increases of 20% and 28% respectively on 2016 applications.</p>  <p>  Additional funding is also being made available to support essential reconciliation work being carried out by civil society in Northern Ireland and across the island of Ireland &ndash; work that is more urgent because of Brexit and the continuing absence of a Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly.</p>  <p>  Our Vote 28 allocation will also help us to begin delivering on our &lsquo;Global Ireland&rsquo; vision of an expanded international footprint for the post-Brexit world.  This expanded presence will extend our support to Irish businesses in search of new markets. </p>  <p>  That&rsquo;s why we will be opening offices in Mumbai, Frankfurt and LA, and new embassies in Chile and Colombia in 2019.  It will also help us sustain close relations across the UK after Brexit, with a new Consulate in Cardiff next year.</p>  <p>  In 2019 we will also take forward work on a new Embassy and Ireland House in Tokyo that will project the very best Ireland has to offer in one location.  This is a major development, one of the most complex that we have ever undertaken overseas and a signal of the potential and opportunities that we can tap into in the Irish-Japanese relationship.</p>  <p>  This strengthened support for trade diversification is a crucial component to our Brexit response.  In 2019, this will also include stepped-up preparations for Expo 2020 in Dubai - a major platform for Ireland internationally in a region with huge trade and investment potential for Ireland.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Government&rsquo;s Getting Ireland Brexit public information campaign is an important ongoing whole of Government initiative in helping prepare citizens and businesses for Brexit.  As part of this wider campaign, the Government is organising &ldquo;Getting Ireland Brexit Ready&rdquo; public outreach events around Ireland.</p>  <p>  The inaugural event was held in Cork on Friday, 5 October, with last Friday&rsquo;s event held in Galway.

This level of allocation represents an increase of approximately &euro;110 million &ndash; or 16% on the revised 2018 budget allocation.</p>  <p>  Of this, &euro;544.9 million will be managed by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, whose Vote 27 &ndash; International Co-operation &ndash; is known publicly as Irish Aid.  The allocation to Vote 27 has been increased by &euro;44 million, or almost 9% on last year&rsquo;s allocation.  This will be taken into account in the detailed programme budget planning cycle for Irish Aid in 2019 that will take place before year end.  Part of this allocation will be used to meet recent commitments made at the UN General Assembly including increased allocations to education in development, to humanitarian assistance and to peace building.</p>  <p>  A further estimated &euro;272 million will be managed through other Government Departments and Ireland&rsquo;s share of the EU Development Co-operation Budget.  This represents an increase of &euro;65 million on 2018. </p>  <p>  By far the largest component of this element of ODA is our share of the EU development cooperation budget which has grown significantly over the past few years and will continue to do so in 2019.  In addition the Department of Finance will oversee Ireland joining the African Development Bank in 2019.  </p>  <p>  There are also increased allocations to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine who manage Ireland&rsquo;s partnerships with the World Food Programme and the Food and Agriculture Organisation.  Other programmes receiving increases are managed by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment, and the Revenue Commissioners.</p></reply>

While the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade leads on Ireland&rsquo;s bilateral development programme at least one third of Ireland&rsquo;s ODA is provided by other Government Departments.</p>  <p>  A comprehensive internal and external consultation process to help develop the new policy, in line with the public consultation guidelines published by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, has now concluded.  This process included a preliminary consultation paper, following which submissions were received from across Government and the Embassy network.  A series of workshops took place involving invited external experts and the support of consultants to facilitate detailed discussions.</p>  <p>  Building on this input, a public consultation element was launched on 12 July.  Over 185 substantive written submissions were received in response to a public consultation paper.  Another 14,000 emails expressing support for the aid programme were received. "Townhall" meetings were held in Cork, Galway, Sligo and Limerick, with the public consultation phase ending on 2 October with the final public meeting in Dublin. </p>  <p>  The various inputs received are now being synthesised and together with research, analysis and assessments of the wider global environment will be used to develop the new policy.</p></reply>

The majority of food supplements, however, are charged at the 23% standard VAT rate.  </p>  <p>  The expansion and diversification of the food supplement market since 1972, has led to a significant growth in the number and variety of food supplement products which do not qualify for the Revenue concession.  The Revenue Commissioners have received a large volume of requests for confirmation of the VAT treatment on a broad range of food supplements in recent years, leading to compliance concerns and calls for fiscal neutrality.</p>  <p>  The Revenue Commissioners has engaged with industry representatives on the matter and one solution would be to legislate to apply a reduced VAT rate to all food supplements as the VAT Directive does not permit the application of the zero rate to food supplements.</p></reply>

During September, Minister of State Pat Breen TD travelled to Brazil as part of a trade mission.  Minister Breen raised the question of Ireland&rsquo;s tax listing, with the Undersecretary General for Trade Promotion, Investment &amp;amp; International Cooperation who assured the Minister that the Brazilian Foreign Ministry were aware of Ireland&rsquo;s concerns on this issue and would again raise the question within their system.</p>  <p>  The Brazilian authorities have made clear Ireland has been included on the Brazilian list solely due to having a standard corporate tax rate below 17%.</p>  <p>  We have continued to make the case that it is inappropriate to include Ireland on the list on the basis of our longstanding 12.5% corporation tax rate.

The Report contains an Action Plan, setting out the agreed timelines for implementation, and also a commitment that the Working Group will prepare quarterly updates on its progress.  The Working Group has published six such updates to date, most recently on 30 August.  It shows that, in total, of the 56 separate applicable deadlines within the Action Plan set to the end of Q2 2018, 44 relate to actions which have now been completed. Substantial work has also been undertaken in respect of the nine action points categorised as &ldquo;ongoing&rdquo;.  Officials in the Department of Finance are now working to collate the progress updates for the Seventh Progress Update Report and it is expected that this work will be finalised in the coming weeks. </p>  <p>  It is envisaged that the implementation of all the recommendations cumulatively, with the appropriate levels of commitment and cooperation from all relevant stakeholders, should achieve the objectives of delivering fairer premiums for consumers and a more stable and competitive insurance market.</p>  <p>  In this regard, it should be noted that the most recent CSO data (for September 2018) indicates that private motor insurance premiums have decreased by almost 22% since peaking in July 2016.  I appreciate that these figures represent a broad average however we have to recognise that these are the same figures that showed the large increase that many commentators regularly reference.  Therefore, I think it has to be recognised that the overall trend currently is downward, which is  to be welcomed.</p></reply>

The ATAD exit tax regime will tax unrealised capital gains at a rate of 12.5% where companies migrate or transfer assets offshore such that they leave the scope of Irish tax.  The tax operates by deeming a disposal of the asset to take place at the time of exit and applying the exit tax charge on any unrealised gain.</p><p>This new exit tax replaces a previous, more narrowly-focused exit tax charge which was introduced in 1997 as a proportionate anti-avoidance measure to counter a number of identified tax avoidance transactions that were used to take chargeable assets outside the charge to Irish tax prior to disposal. The provisions were designed to influence behaviour, i.e. to prevent the avoidance behaviour identified, rather than to serve as a tax raising measure and I understand from Revenue that they have been effective in this regard.  <b></b></p><p>The new ATAD-compliant exit tax is a broad-based measure and it is expected that in time it will give rise to Exchequer revenue.  However, as this will only arise in cases where an asset, which has increased in value while held by a company in the State, is transferred out of the charge to Irish tax without an actual disposal, an estimation of the future yield would require predicting changing asset values, in addition to projections as to future restructuring of companies.  As any such estimate at this point would be highly theoretical, no specific provision was made in the Budgetary arithmetic for future exit tax yield, and equally it would not be possible to estimate the change in revenue if an alternate tax rate were to be applied. </p><p>Payments in respect of the new ATAD-compliant exit charge will be separately identified in the relevant tax returns so it will be possible to monitor receipts from the new charge in future.</p></reply>

I highlighted this in the Summer Economic Statement and I note that the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, in its pre-Budget statement, also highlighted this issue.  </p>  <p>  Essentially, the problem boils down to the fact that full allocation of 'fiscal space' would lead to a repeat of pro-cyclical budgetary policies that would threaten the living standards of Irish people.  Pro-cyclical budgetary policies should be avoided; this is especially true when we are facing serious issues such as the exit of the UK from the European Union (and a non-negligible possibility of a 'disorderly' exit).  </p>  <p>  With this in mind, the more important framework for guiding fiscal policy is 'fiscal stance' - what is right for the economy at a particular point in time, so as to support sustainable, incremental improvements in public services and living standards.</p>  <p>  The correct 'fiscal stance' can only be ascertained once account is taken of the position in the economic cycle.  If the economy is operating at full capacity, then it would be incorrect to adopt an expansionary budgetary policy.  On the other hand, if there is spare capacity in the economy, then it may be appropriate to use tax and expenditure policy to help absorb the spare capacity.  </p>  <p>  Given the many issues facing the economy and the heightened level of uncertainty (such as what form the UK's exit from the EU will take), it is only possible to assess the appropriate fiscal stance on a year-to-year basis at present.</p></reply>

This realignment has a particular focus on ensuring that appropriate resources are applied to tax and duty risk in line with Revenue&rsquo;s Statement of Strategy 2017 &ndash; 2019.</p>  <p>  The staffing of the original Large Cases Division which was focused on large corporates and high wealth individuals had a total of 253 wholetime equivalent (wte) staff.  Following realignment the two Divisions will have over 320 wte staff by the end of 2018.</p>  <p>  The staffing of the element of the original Large Cases Division which was focused on high wealth individuals had a total of 64 wte staff.  Following realignment the Division will have c. 100 wte staff by the end of 2018.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that it has also established a new Medium Enterprises Division to deal with the tier of cases, both corporate and high wealth individuals, just below Large Cases.  This Division will have c. 380 wte staff by the end of 2018.</p>  <p>  The Large Cases High Wealth Individuals Division, in addition to the work on high wealth individuals is responsible for pensions and tax avoidance work.  I am advised by Revenue that it is anticipated that the approximately 25 staff currently tasked with profiling high wealth individuals and related entities and carrying out a programme of risk-based compliance interventions which include audits will increase to approximately 55 by the end of 2018.</p></reply>

The pay increases involved are those covering the 2018 to 2020 period under the Public Service Stability Agreement (PSSA), as legislated for in the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017. The pay increase of 1% of salary on 1 October 2018 is the second such increase, the first, also 1%, having come into effect on 1 January 2018. </p>  <p>  The principle of pay parity underlies the pension increases sanctioned in the Circular. This means that pay increases agreed as part of the PSSA are to be passed on to pension recipients to bring the salary on which their pension is based up to the current salary of those still serving after the pay increases are applied. It is important to note that not all pension recipients will be due these increases. This is because of protections in place (known as &lsquo;grace periods&rsquo;) for public servants retiring after the application of pay cuts under the FEMPI legislation, whereby their pensions were calculated using the higher pay rates that were in effect prior to the application of the pay cuts. </p>  <p>  It is a matter for the large number of public service pension payroll managers in the various sectors of the public service to implement Circular 02/2018. I understand that work is underway to apply the pay increases I have mentioned to those qualifying pensions in payment that have not yet benefitted from such increases, and that this will include the calculation and payment of arrears as appropriate. </p></reply>

I am therefore not entitled to comment on the manner in which the OIC has exercised its functions in any particular set of circumstances.</p>  <p>  Section 52 of the 2014 Act creates a criminal offence in relation to the deliberate destruction or alteration of records with an intent to deceive while these same records are the subject of an FOI request.  </p>  <p>  It may be appropriate in the first instance to raise an alleged breach of section 52 with the organisation concerned, and to provide any evidence to support the allegation.  The body itself may be best placed to initiate an investigation into relevant matters, if there is a sufficient evidential basis for it to do so.  Depending on the outcome of the investigation, the organisation may be entitled to take actions including appropriate disciplinary steps, or if warranted to refer the matter to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for further investigation.</p>  <p>  Alternatively, were the OIC to find evidence of a breach of section 52 in the course of a review, it would be entitled to refer the matter to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for further investigation.  However, I should again emphasise that owing to its statutory independence the question of whether or not it is appropriate to take this step in a particular case is a matter solely for the OIC to determine.  The 2014 Act does not confer a role on the OIC to bring or prosecute criminal proceedings in relation to a breach of section 52.</p>  <p>  Finally, given that a contravention of section 52 is a criminal matter, it could be raised directly with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

In order to ensure the effective operation of the FOI system, it is important that the OIC must be entitled to bring finality to its reviews when satisfied that it is appropriate to do so.  Where a party to a review is dissatisfied with the outcome, they may appeal to the High Court on a point of law, which is the appropriate means by which to challenge a decision of the OIC.

The objective of the Scheme is to allow participating schools to seek to achieve Gaeltacht School Recognition over a 5 year period on the basis of the implementation of specific language-based criteria, including the implementation of a total-immersion approach and the development of action plans by schools.</p>  <p>  In April 2017, all primary and post-primary schools in Gaeltacht language-planning areas were invited to participate in the Scheme. The Scheme has been welcomed by Gaeltacht communities and well-received in Gaeltacht schools. This is evident from the high participation rates in the Scheme. 106 or 80% of primary schools and 28 or 96% of post-primary schools in the Gaeltacht have opted to participate in the Scheme. </p>  <p>  To encourage participation in the Scheme by schools, a comprehensive information pack outlining the benefits of immersion education and bilingualism was sent to schools for dissemination to school communities, including parents and teachers. The information pack was developed by the Gaeltacht Education Unit in my Department in collaboration with An Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscola&iacute;ochta (COGG), Gaeloideachas, the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta. </p>  <p>  Following the submission and review of each participating school&rsquo;s action plans for improvement by An tAonad um Oideachas Gaeltachta, schools participating in the Scheme were eligible to access a number of additional resources from September 2018. These resources include access to a grant to purchase Irish-medium teaching resources, additional language teaching hours, additional continuing professional development delivered by COGG and additional Inspectorate support.</p>  <p>  The number of additional language support hours allocated to schools participating in the Scheme from September 2018 was based on the enrolment figures recorded in the previous year, which is in line with Department norms. Schools at primary level were given the option to combine their additional language support hours with other schools to form clusters, which would allow for the creation of a temporary part-time teaching post that would be shared by the schools in the cluster. Initially schools were advised that the combined hours must equal 25 hours to create the shared teaching post, however, a number of schools applied to form clusters with a combined total of less than 25 hours. Having reviewed all applications received on a case by case basis my Department made the decision to approve these clusters also. This decision was made in the context of the challenges relating to the recruitment of teachers by schools in remote Gaeltacht areas and in the interests of the implementation of the Scheme and the Policy on Gaeltacht Education in general. </p>  <p>  Circular 0021/2018 also highlights that the allocation of additional language support hours will be reviewed in 2019.</p></reply>

The non-adjacent rate of maintenance grant is payable in all other cases.</p>  <p>  In the assessment of the application from the student in question, the awarding authority assessed the distance from her normal residence to the relevant higher education institution as under 45km and awarded the applicant the special rate of maintenance grant (adjacent rate). </p>  <p>  The student appealed the decision to the SUSI appeals officer and subsequently to the statutorily independent Student Grants Appeals Board who both upheld the decision of the awarding authority. The student has exhausted the appeals process provided for in the Student Support Act 2011. </p>  <p>  On a general point, the student grant scheme is published annually and the terms of each scheme, including enhancements which improve the efficiency of the scheme in terms of accuracy and reduced processing times, can change over time. While some students who were assessed under older schemes may have benefitted from the application of rules that applied at a particular point in time, this should not been seen as an indicator that similar outcomes will be arrived at for students assessed under more recent schemes.</p></reply>

In 2015 my Department engaged with the Unions representing school secretaries on negotiations and agreed to enter an independent arbitration process on the issue. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for school secretaries comprehended by the terms of the arbitration process and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 for such staff be phased in over the period 2016 to 2019.

There are currently no plans to re-establish a dedicated training organisation for the sector but rather to deliver the required education and training through the mainstream higher and further education and training sectors. </p>  <p>  In 2015 the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN) carried out a study on the future skills needs of the hospitality sector including skill needs for chefs and cooks. The objective was to assess demand arising within the sector in Ireland including hotels, restaurants, bars, canteens and catering over the period to 2020. The aim was to ensure that there will be the right supply of skills to help drive domestic hospitality sector business and employment growth. Key findings within the report related to the high replacement/exit rates in the sector which has implications for the ongoing skill requirements of the sector and also with regards to staff retention, including education and training, and workplace conditions and remuneration.  </p>  <p>  The Study assessed skills demand at all NFQ levels, with a particular focus on career progression opportunities for those at lower skilled levels to help fill anticipated job openings. The report provides a set of recommendations designed to address the skills requirements of the sector over the period to 2020, including the need to establish a National Oversight and Advisory Group, comprising of key hospitality stakeholders, to provide a forum for on-going collaboration to support the needs of the sector and oversee implementation of the EGFSN recommendations.</p>  <p>  The oversight group was established in 2016, and was mandated for two year period.  The group was chaired by the Irish Hotels Federation and identified five priority areas for progress on which significant progress has been made:-</p>  <p>  - Promoting careers in the sector</p>  <p>  - Audit of hospitality related courses and facilities in both HE and FET</p>  <p>  - Development of apprenticeship and traineeship programmes</p>  <p>  - Launch of a dedicated skillnet for the hospitality industry</p>  <p>  - Making employment connections &ndash; DEASP/Jobsbridge etc</p>  <p>  The group has published its report on the audit of both higher and further education courses providing a high level of analysis of the data available that shows the numbers of courses, enrolments and awards in the Hospitality sector to enable the Group to determine how it might address the skill sets required by the sector and to aid it in identifying gaps in the provision of courses.</p>  <p>  Arising from this Government&rsquo;s commitment to expand apprenticeship and traineeship education, there are now two apprenticeships in the hospitality sector operational, a Commis Chef Apprenticeship and a Chef de Partie Apprenticeship with industry leadership from the Restaurants Association of Ireland and the Irish Hotels Federation. A further two apprenticeships in the culinary area are in development, a Sous Chef apprenticeship which is expected to get underway later this year and an Executive Chef apprenticeship which will be rolled out in 2019. A Bar Manager apprenticeship is also in the early stages of development.</p>  <p>  In 2015 a new Career Traineeship initiative was initiated by SOLAS in collaboration with the Education and Training Boards (ETBs) and enterprise to develop a more effective model of work-based learning, primarily at NFQ levels 4 and 5, incorporating best national and international research and practice. Networks have been created to facilitate partnerships between ETBs and employers to identify training needs, design training programmes, recruit learners and deliver training on and off the job. There are currently three hospitality traineeships available with further traineeships in development.</p>  <p>  A Restaurant and Hospitality Skillnet was established in 2017 and, along with the Taste 4 Success Skillnet, will address skill needs in the sector.  There were also almost 5,500 beneficiaries in 2017 of further education and training in the food and beverage and tourism areas. </p></reply>

Arising from our two calls for apprenticeship proposals in 2015 and 2017 sixteen new apprenticeships have now been developed in a range of new occupations, including financial services, engineering, ICT, hospitality, logistics and accounting.  Further new apprenticeships will get underway later this year and throughout 2019 in a variety of sectors including construction, engineering, horticulture and agriculture.</p>  <p>  As well as developments in new apprenticeships, as the employment and economic situation continues to improve, we have seen strong growth in registrations across the craft trades nationally also with 4,508 new registrations in 2017, which represents a 20% increase on 2016.  The upward trend continues this year with 3,504 new registrations recorded at the end of September, 7% ahead of the same period last year. </p>  <p>  In addition, as set out in the Action Plan to Expand Apprenticeship and Traineeship in Ireland, SOLAS is currently reviewing pathways to participation in apprenticeship in a range of underrepresented groups, including the groups referred to by the Deputy.  The review will identify any barriers that may exist to participation in an apprenticeship programme.  The purpose of the review is to ensure that our national apprenticeship system is more reflective of the range and diversity of our population, more inclusive of diverse backgrounds and abilities and that apprenticeship opportunities are more readily accessible to all.  The review will result in the publication of actions in this area in the coming weeks, along with the background research.</p></reply>

This announcement followed nationwide demographic exercises carried out by my Department into the current and future need for primary and post-primary school places across the country.  This announcement included a new primary school for Donabate and two new primary schools for Swords: one in North Swords and one in South Swords.</p>  <p>  The current focus for my Department is to prioritise the 17 schools opening in 2019 so that patrons can be appointed and accommodation solutions put in place as soon as possible.  My Department has appointed a Project Manager to assist with this work and potential interim accommodation solution options have been identified for the majority of the 17 schools.</p>  <p>  My Department's Design and Build Programme will be the main delivery mechanism for providing permanent accommodation for the 42 new schools.  A procurement process is currently underway to facilitate the appointment of a Project Manager who will assist my Department in the provision of permanent accommodation for the new schools to be established from 2020 onwards.</p>  <p>  A patronage process is ongoing in respect of the four post primary schools due to open in 2019 and I expect to make an announcement shortly in this regard.  A patronage process for the primary schools due to open in 2019 will commence shortly thereafter.</p>  <p>  I wish to advise the Deputy that a site currently in my ownership in Mooretown, Swords has recently been granted planning permission in respect of the provision of permanent accommodation for Swords Community College.  This planning permission also provides for a primary school on this site and it is intended to locate the new primary school announced for North Swords on this property.  </p>  <p>  A site identification process in respect of the new primary schools announced for South Swords and Donabate are currently underway.  In line with the policy on the use of State assets (Department of Public Expenditure and Reform Circulars 11/15 and 17/16), my Department will be seeking to maximize the use of sites already in my ownership and of available properties in the ownership of other State bodies, where these are considered suitable.  In addition as part of my Department's ongoing engagement with Local Authorities in respect of statutory planning processes and under the MoU on school site acquisitions, my Department is examining all potential suitable site options, including appropriately zoned sites, to serve the relevant area. </p>  <p>  A decision regarding the location of the schools in South Swords and Donabate will be made at the earliest possible date.</p></reply>

In 2019, the budget for the Department of Education and Skills will increase by &euro;674 million, a 6.7% increase on last year.  In total, the Education budget will have increased by &euro;1.7 billion compared to 2016.</p>  <p>  Budget 2019 will see numbers employed in our schools reach the highest ever level.  Over 1,300 additional posts in schools will be funded, including more than 370 teaching posts to cater for growth in student population and additional special classes.  This builds on the Budget 2018 measure which provided a one-point improvement in the staffing schedule in primary schools which brings the position to the most favourable ever seen at primary level.  </p>  <p>  The latest figures in relation to pupil teacher ratios show an improved ratio of teachers to students from 16:1 to 15.3:1 at primary level when comparing the 2015/16 school year to the 2017/18 school year.

My Department has no role in relation to processing applications for enrolment to schools and it does not maintain details of waiting lists in schools.</p><p>Accordingly, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) advises parents to seek to enrol their child by applying in writing to the school/s of their choice as early as possible.  Where parents have been unsuccessful in enrolling their child in a school for the 2018/19 school year, they should update their local SENO to inform the planning process.</p><p>The greater proportion of children with special educational needs attend mainstream class, where they may access additional supports if required. </p><p>Some students with special educational needs, although academically able to access the curriculum in mainstream, may find it too difficult to manage full-time placement there and placement in a special class is an option for them.  Special classes are resourced to cater for six pupils with complex educational needs arising from their diagnosis and as such are staffed with a reduced PTR and Special Needs Assistant support.</p><p>Special school placements are provided for other students with very complex special needs who wouldn&rsquo;t manage in a mainstream school even for part of the week.</p><p>The NCSE is responsible, through its network of Special Needs Organisers, for the development and delivery and co-ordination of education services to children with Special Educational Needs, including the establishment of special class and special school placements.</p><p>Since 2011, the NCSE has increased the number of special classes from 548 in 2011 to 1,459 across the country now which includes 1,196 Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) special classes.  160 of the special classes are new classes for 2018/19 school year.  The network of ASD classes includes 131 ASD early intervention classes, 743 primary ASD classes and 322 post-primary ASD classes in mainstream schools.</p><p>Details of all special classes for children with special educational needs are available on <i>www.ncse.ie</i>in county order.</p><p>The NCSE is aware of emerging need from year to year, and where special provision is required it is planned and provided for. </p><p>The National Council for Special Education has published Guidelines for Boards of Management and Principals of Primary and Post Primary schools which contain information on setting up and organising special classes, including information on resources which may be provided to schools to establish special classes and are available to download from <i>www.ncse.ie</i>. </p><p>My Department has acknowledged that in recent years the establishment of special class provision in some schools and communities has been challenging.</p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, I signed a Commencement Order on the 4th of October bringing a number of sections of the Education (Admission to Schools) Act, 2018 into operation. </p><p>The commencement order will provide the Minister for Education and Skills with a power, after a process of consultation with the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), the board of management and the patron of the school, to compel a school to make additional provision for the education of children with special educational needs.  This power will come into effect on Monday 3rd December 2018. </p><p>I have asked the NCSE to engage with the education partners and finalise the procedures in advance of this date.  This new power will build on the work which has been done in recent years to facilitate schools to open special classes. </p><p>My Department will continue to support the NCSE in opening special classes in areas where there is an identified need.</p></reply>

Each of the 16 Education and Training Boards (ETBs) has selected an initial pilot area within its functional area, in which it considers, based on census data and local knowledge, that there exists a demand for more diversity in educational provision.  Surveys of parents of pre-school children have been carried out in these areas by the relevant City/County Childcare Committee on behalf of the ETBs.  ETBs, having analysed the survey results, draw up comprehensive reports on the position in relation to each of the 16 pilot areas.  This forms the basis of discussions with the most prevalent patron/landowner in the area (the Catholic Bishop in most cases) concerning the transfer of patronage of an existing school(s) to meet that demand.  The response by the landowner/patron to any identified demand for greater diversity is included in the report prepared by the ETB for submission to my Department, which will subsequently publish the reports.  </p>  <p>  Following the publication of the first round of reports, the Schools Reconfiguration process will move into the Implementation Phase.  This Phase involves consultation with local school communities on accommodating demand for diversity by transferring patronage of an existing school to a new multi-/non-denominational patron.  Draft protocols for the Implementation Phase are at an advanced stage of development and consultation with Catholic Church representatives is ongoing.</p>  <p>  In relation to Kildare specifically, a town/area in County Kildare has not been identified for survey as Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board has chosen to survey Bray in Co. Wicklow as part of this initial roll-out.  A second round of town selections and surveys of pre-school parents will be organised by ETBs when the outcomes of the initial round of pilot surveys have been assessed and any necessary adjustments made in the Schools Reconfiguration process.</p>  <p>  I believe that this new Schools Reconfiguration process, which involves the transfer of live schools, has the potential to significantly increase patronage diversity in our school system. </p></reply>

The Higher Education System Performance Framework articulates the expectations from the system across all areas of activity and from across Government. The HEA engages with HEIs on their performance against these domains through a process of strategic dialogue and through the use of performance funding.  The new Framework covers the period 2018 - 2020. The promotion of &lsquo;excellence in teaching and learning to underpin a high-quality student experience&rsquo; is one of the 7 &lsquo;key system objectives&rsquo; in the System Performance Framework, and the National Forum for the Enhancement of Teaching and Learning supports the implementation of best international practice ensuring that opportunities for better practice are identified, mainstreamed and shared under the guidance of the Higher Education Authority and sectoral representative bodies.  </p>  <p>  Quality assurance procedures are in place within HEIs in accordance with Guidelines as set out by Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI).  An Annual Institutional Quality Assurance Report is submitted to QQI which outlines the institutions cycle of internal reviews along with links to published review reports.  These internal reviews comprise of any or all of regular periodic reviews of study programmes; quality reviews of academic, administrative and service departments; unit-based reviews of schools, faculties and colleges and thematic reviews of institution-wide issues.  QQI has also established a Policy for the Cyclical Review of Higher Education Institutions, which takes place on a periodic scheduled basis.</p>  <p>  Ireland is in the top 5 positions in Europe in terms of participation and in the top 10 positions in terms of educational attainment. The participation rate of 18-20 year olds in higher education has grown from 20% in 1980 to a current level of 58%. Ireland has one of the highest rates of 30-34 year olds with higher education attainment in the OECD with over half of 25-34 year olds having completed higher education. </p>  <p>  Budget 2019 continues the Government&rsquo;s process of reinvestment in Higher Education, building on the progress made in Budgets 2017 &amp;amp; 2018.  Budgets 2018 &amp;amp; 2019 have made provision for 5,600 additional Higher education student places.  The Government has secured a total package which provides for &euro;57.4 million of additional expenditure in Higher Education in 2019.As part of Budget 2019, the Government committed to increasing the National Training Fund levy by a further 0.1% in 2019 to 0.9%, and by a further 0.1% in 2020. Additionally a new Human Capital Initiative has been announced as part of budget 2019. This will involve investment of &euro;300m over the 5 year period 2020-2024, with &euro;60m being made available in each of those years. This investment will be funded by the NTF surplus.  There is also a significant ramping up of Government investment on the capital side of the higher education sector and over a 10 year period, investment of some &euro;2.2 billion is envisaged. To complement and underpin the additional investment in Higher Education a number of strategic reforms measures are also being undertaken by my Department. </p>  <p>  Technological universities will provide an opportunity to drive regional development and provide more opportunities for students, staff, enterprise and local and regional communities. They will have a significant reach, impact and influence regionally, nationally and internationally. Ireland has a strong track record, too, in research and innovation, and Irish researchers have been very successful under Horizon 2020&rsquo;s highly competitive international funding stream.</p>  <p>  Ireland is 11th in global scientific ranking for overall quality of scientific research. This is an impressive trajectory from a position of 48th just 13 years ago. Our global rankings for individual subject areas further demonstrate that we continue to play an important role in global R&amp;D. Ireland is now 1st in Animal and Dairy, 1st in Immunology, 2nd in Nanotechnology and Agricultural Sciences. Ireland remains 1st in the world for knowledge diffusion and 10th in the Global Innovation Index.</p></reply>

However, it is the case that airline carriers in many instances require their passengers to have a passport in possession before allowing them to board the aircraft. As such, this is not an immigration requirement. </p>  <p>  Unlike the operational practices at some UK airports, there is generally no segregation of arriving passengers at Irish ports of entry to the State. Consequently, Immigration Officers performing immigration control duties at airports in the State do not know where passengers have travelled from when such passengers present at immigration control desks. </p>  <p>  It is therefore necessary for Immigration Officers to establish where passengers have arrived from, and in order to do this, an Immigration Officer may ask passengers questions with a view to establishing their nationality and port of embarkation. Once satisfied that a person is a citizen of the CTA and that such person has travelled from the United Kingdom, the Immigration Officer will make no further requirement of that person.</p>  <p>  The organisation of the infrastructure for arrival of aircraft at Dublin Airport has developed over many years and any changes to it is a matter for the Dublin Airport Authority.  My officials are not aware of any such plans in this regard.</p></reply>

I, as Minister have no function in such matters.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware under the Modernisation and Renewal Programme for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, 2016-2021<i></i>Divisional units of Garda National Protective Services Bureau are being rolled-out in two phases, supported by the Garda National Protective Services Bureau. Phase One has now been completed, with Divisional Protective Services Units established in three Divisions, in the DMR West, Cork City, and Louth Division, where 2 Sergeants and 10 Garda&iacute; were identified for allocation to the Divisional Unit. </p><p>Following a review of the Pilot, additional Divisional Protective Services Bureaus are now in the process of being established in DMR South Central; Waterford; Kerry; Kilkenny/Carlow; Limerick and Galway Garda Divisions before the end of Q4, 2018. It is intended that Divisional Protective Services Bureaus will be established in all remaining Garda Divisions before the end of 2019.</p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that this initiative is being managed collaboratively between the Garda National Protective Services Bureau and each Divisional Officer. The pilot will inform the full roll-out to each Garda Division, by assessing and evaluating the Units initially selected including with reference to for example geographical size and population profile. </p><p>The Commissioner has further informed me that all Garda personnel receive training in the investigation of incidents considered domestic abuse, in all it&rsquo;s forms, with additional training provided to Garda&iacute; selected for duties as detectives. Similarly, additional and more specific training has been developed by the Director of Training with the senior management team at the Garda National Protective Services Bureau for the training to be provided to personnel selected for duty with the Divisional Protective Services Units, which have commenced in the three Garda divisions, DMR West, Cork City and Louth. Induction training has been provided for the personnel selected for these Units, with a briefing being provided to all relevant State Agencies and NGOs.</p><p>The Policing Authority submitted their Fifth Progress Report to me in June. This report was partly focused on providing an update on the implementation of the recommendations contained within the Garda Inspectorate&rsquo;s report Changing Policing in Ireland, including the roll out of the pilot Divisional Protective Services Units. It is positive to note that the Policing Authority&rsquo;s engagement with organisations that work with victims, as well as the recent Garda Inspectorate Report on Child Sexual Abuse, evidence the anticipated improvement in services for victims arising from the roll out of the Protective Services Units. In addition, it is to be welcomed that the Policing Authority has received positive feedback that the pilot PSUs have resulted in improved levels of service to victims and increased operational effectiveness in dealing with crimes of that nature.</p><p>The Deputy will also be aware that the recently published Commission on the Future of Policing report sees the establishment of Divisional Protective Services Units as a significant move in the right direction towards ensuring that services to victims&rsquo; rights are further embedded in the organisation&rsquo;s processes.</p><p>Budget 2019 provides an unprecedented level of public funding of &euro;1.76 billion for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2019.  This includes an in crease in the Garda capital allocation from &euro;61 million to &euro;92 million in 2019, a 50% increase. This will facilitate investment of around &euro;65 million in ICT, a further &euro;10 million investment in the Transport Fleet and &euro;17 million in the Building Programme. This clearly  demonstrates the Government&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.</p></reply>

This excludes another 6 staff who have been recruited on secondment. Some of these civilian staff were recruited to backfill existing vacancies, some were to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; to frontline duties and others were to fill newly created civilian posts to fill skill gaps across the organisation. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that as part of the Five Year Reform and High-level Workforce Plan for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Government has agreed an overall vision for a Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 to include 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Garda Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. The projected 4,000 civilians represents a medium-term target of 20% of the Garda full-time workforce comprised of civilians. This target will be achieved through a twin-track approach of firstly, a &ldquo;civilian by default&rdquo; policy to be adopted in relation to the filling of all new posts other than operational policing posts and for non-operational policing posts that become vacant and, secondly, the redeployment of Garda&iacute; to policing roles where their skills can be used to best effect with the backfilling of these roles by suitably qualified civilians where necessary.  The Garda Inspectorate identified some 1,500 posts held by Garda&iacute; that could be examined for suitability for civilian staff.</p>  <p>  Progress is being made in relation to civilianisation. Since the beginning of 2017 approximately 300 new civilian posts have been sanctioned by the Policing Authority with the consent of my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. The bulk were to address critical skills gaps and capacity issues with a proportion sanctioned to make a start on the redeployment of Garda&iacute; to policing duties. </p>  <p>  The most recent overall figure provided to me by the Commissioner indicates that, as at 31 August 2018 approximately 2,330 civilians were employed in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. I am encouraged that the number of civilians working in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to advance however it is clear that the pace of civilianisation needs to increase.  I note that the Report of the  Commission for the Future of Policing in Ireland recommends the return of Garda&iacute; to front line policing and the need for visible policing.  My Department has consulted with the Garda Commissioner with regard the recommendations within the Report and I await his proposals including how he will increase the pace of civilianisation and the redeployment of Garda&iacute; to main stream policing duties.</p></reply>

The Department has commenced the process of identifying additional capacity both by way of the public procurement competition referenced above and an advertisement placed in the national press seeking expressions of interest in providing accommodation on an emergency basis for persons in the protection process.  </p>  <p>  My aim is to limit, to the greatest extent possible, the disruption to families and to residents relying on Dublin-based services.  The Reception and Integration Agency is working on contingency plans to facilitate school going children, currently living in the centre in question, to continue in their current schools for the current school year.   However, the Reception and Integration Agency is very constrained by the current demands for its accommodation and by the absence of bed capacity within its system.  </p>  <p>  Considerable work has been done to support residents with status to move out of accommodation centres and to secure permanent accommodation.  </p>  <p>  My Department also provides funding to NGOs on accommodation issues affecting those who have been granted permission to remain, including the approximately 60 such persons affected in this instance.  In particular, funding was granted to the Jesuit Refugee Service and the Peter McVerry Trust  under the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund Ireland 2017 - 2019 for the PATHS project (Providing Asylum-seekers in Transition with Housing and Support). In addition, funding has been granted to South Dublin County Partnership for a two year housing and integration programme, a key part of which is to assist residents who have received permission to remain, to access housing supports. Officials from my Department have been liaising with South Dublin County Council in relation to the particular situation arising in Clondalkin.</p></reply>

An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is committed to supporting this strategy, and in March 2015 a number of Garda units were brought together to leverage their experience and expertise in investigating serious crimes against the person including sexual offences to form the Garda National Protective Services Bureau (GNPSB) led by a Chief Superintendent.  </p>  <p>  The GNPSB is a specialist team dedicated to making sure each and every complaint relating to child protection, human trafficking, domestic and sexual violence is thoroughly investigated and handled correctly.  In addition, the GNPSB is responsible for working with other agencies to manage sex offenders in the interest of community safety.  </p>  <p>  As part of the Garda Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 Protective Services Units (PSUs) are to be established in every Garda Division with specially trained staff on a phased basis.  I am advised by the Commissioner that Phase 1 involved the establishment of Units in three Divisions the Dublin Metropolitan Region West, Cork City, and the Louth Division over a 12-month period on a pilot basis.  These units mirror the responsibilities held by the GNPSB and ensure a consistent approach to domestic abuse and sexual crime.  The PSUs work with the Garda Victim Service Offices in their area to ensure that the needs of victims are adequately catered for.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Commissioner that there is one Sergeant and five Garda&iacute; assigned to the Louth Divisional PSU which is based in Castlebellingham Garda Station.  I am further informed that it is expected that additional resources will be allocated to this unit shortly.</p></reply>

The Government is committed to supporting the work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and to ensuring that the organisation is properly resourced to carry out its important role in protecting our communities.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, it is the Garda Commissioner who is responsible for carrying on and managing and controlling generally the administration and business of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na including the provision of employee welfare supports.  </p>  <p>  I am assured by the Garda Commissioner that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is committed to ensuring that members exposed to workplace stress receive the appropriate organisational response and in that regard there are a variety of supports in place for Garda members.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Commissioner that following on from traumatic incidents at work, the interventions and counselling provided are not mandatory for members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na however there is support available and offered in the aftermath of such incidents.</p>  <p>  The Garda Employee Assistance Service is available to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and supports them in managing and resolving personal and work-related difficulties.  All employee assistance officers, and in the region of 250 of the peer supporters, are trained in critical incident stress management which is an intervention designed to prevent or mitigate psychological reactions to a critical incident.  This intervention is delivered with the support of a mental health professional when required.  Where necessary the services of the Occupational Health Department, headed by the Chief Medical Officer of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, are made available to assist Garda personnel deal with stressful and extremely difficult situations in the workplace.  This Service is staffed by a team of specialist occupational healthcare professionals supported by an administration team.  The Service is dedicated to supporting the employees of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to maintain their health and well-being in order to carry out their duties safely and effectively.</p>  <p>  A 24/7, 365 day Independent Helpline and Counselling Service is available to all staff within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This service is available for both work and personal difficulties.  The service is not mandatory and is self-referral.  Each member of the organisation may avail of six free sessions of counselling per year and an additional two will be provided if clinically approved.  All appointments and consultants are arranged directly between the Service Provider and the staff member.</p>  <p>  Since 1994 a Peer Supporter Programme has been in operation within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to help Garda&iacute; cope with the effect of a traumatic incident in the workplace.  I am informed that the programme has been found to be very helpful in assisting Garda members in the aftermath of a traumatic incident.  The programme is delivered by over 850 Garda who are trained as peer supporters and are available in all Garda Districts to assist colleagues in the immediate aftermath of a traumatic incident.  Following a traumatic incident, a peer supporter will contact the members concerned and offer support.  In the event that the peer supporter deems it appropriate, they may refer the member to the Garda Employee Assistance Service.  </p>  <p>  The recently published Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland report recognises that policing is an unusually stressful job and recommends that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na requires mandatory counselling for Garda&iacute; following a traumatic incident such as attending a bad traffic accident or crime scene.</p>  <p>   My Department is currently analysing the Report and my officials are engaging in consultations with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the policing oversight bodies and the relevant Departments, in order to inform my substantive response and high-level implementation plan that I intend to bring to Government by December.  </p></reply>

In addition, the question relates primarily to consumer or contract law and, as such, does not fall within my area of responsibility.</p><p>In relation to the conveyancing of property,  by way of general information, the position is that the payment by a purchaser of a deposit on entering into a contract for sale of a property is normally required by the conditions of sale.  The deposit is usually regarded both as a part payment of the purchase price of the property and as a security for or a guarantee of performance of the contract by the purchaser.</p><p>As a general rule it has been well settled in case law that the vendor may retain (or forfeit) the deposit if the purchaser defaults on the contract (<i>Doyle v.  Ryan [1981] ILRM 375; Draisey v.  Fitzpatrick [1981] ILRM 219</i>).  Equally, case law provides that the purchaser may recover the amount of the deposit, with interest, plus the cost of investigating the title of the property if the vendor defaults on the terms of the contract (<i>Dickie v.  Wright (1901) NIJR 128</i>).</p><p>I understand that Condition 41 of the Law Society's General Conditions of Sale - which, invariably, form the basis for the contract under which a property is sold and purchased - contains express provisions regarding the issue of the retention of a deposit by a vendor.  </p><p>The Deputy may also wish to know that, with regard to the overall issue of house purchase contracts, my Department has been informed by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation that such contracts are subject to the Regulations that give effect to Directive 93/13/EEC on unfair terms in consumer contracts, principally the European Communities (Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts) Regulations 1995 (S.I.  No.  27 of 1995).  Contract terms are assessable for unfairness under the Regulations unless they are individually negotiated between the seller and the consumer, or they relate to the definition of the main subject matter of the contract or the adequacy of the price as against the goods or services supplied insofar as these terms are in plain, intelligible language.</p><p>Given the possible implications for purchasers of not being able to meet the terms of any contract for sale, it is clear that prudent prospective purchasers should seek expert and independent legal advice before signing a binding contract for the purchase of a property.</p></reply>

It is also my understanding that subject to the payment of all outstanding fees by a client and the discharge of any undertakings relating to a file, the file is generally regarded as the property of the client.

The competence to prevent, detect, investigate and prosecute corruption is spread across An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and a number of other agencies with a mandate to tackle corruption.  These include tribunals of inquiry, commissions of investigation, inspectors, the Central Bank of Ireland, the Standards in Public Office Commission (SIPO), local authorities, the Ombudsman, Parliamentary Committees on Members' Interests, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and it's newly established Anti-Corruption Unit, the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB), the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement (ODCE), the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Public Accounts Committee and the Director of Public Prosecutions.</p><p>Equally, legislative provisions to prevent corruption are manifold and not exclusive to my Department.  For example, the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995, as amended by the Standards in Public Office Act 2001, addresses the ethical conduct of public officials and the lobbying of public officials is covered by the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015.  The Standards in Public Office Commission is responsible for regulatory functions in relation to these statutes.  Likewise, transparency and whistleblowing provisions are provided for via the Freedom of Information Act 2014 and the Protected Disclosures Act 2014.  Additionally, policy and procedures relating to public procurement are primarily the responsibility of the Office of Government Procurement.  There are many further features to effective anti-corruption policy framework, including anti money laundering provisions, tax transparency, and the enforcement of company law.</p><p><b>International Commitments</b></p><p>I can reassure the Deputy that Ireland remains firmly committed to the fight against corruption, both domestically and internationally.  Ireland is a party to a number of international agreements, including the Council of Europe's Group of States against Corruption (GRECO), the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC) and the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Public Officials in International Business Transactions.  </p><p>As a party to these international agreements, Ireland has undergone numerous evaluations and remains subject to peer reviews under the review mechanisms associated with these international standards.  Ireland has recently completed a review of its implementation of Chapters II and V of the UNCAC Convention.  </p><p><b>Review of Anti-Corruption Structures</b></p><p>Mr James Hamilton, former DPP and Anti-Corruption expert, is chairing a Review of Ireland&rsquo;s Anti-Fraud and Anti-Corruption structures.  This review is an Action Point, assigned to the Department of Justice &amp;amp; Equality, contained in the Government&rsquo;s plan to tackle White Collar Crime, which was launched last November.  The first meeting of the group took place on Monday, 24 September and is due to meet again next week.</p><p>Attendees included all bodies identified in the Terms of Reference as critical for this review, including all State bodies involved in the detection, prevention, investigation and prosecution of White Collar Crime.  The Review Group includes officials from the Departments of Justice &amp;amp; Equality; Business, Enterprise &amp;amp; Innovation; Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the DPP, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, the Banking and Payments Federation, the Revenue Commissioners and the Central Bank.</p><p>At the first meeting the group discussed their working methods, defined the scope of the Review and the Chair sought position papers from a number of Members outlining their own areas of responsibility.  The group also discussed the possibility of opening a public consultation, allowing individuals to make submissions to the group in writing, and in person, at a possible public meeting in early 2019.</p><p>The Review Group is due to report in June 2019.</p><p><b>Legislation</b></p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Criminal Justice (Corruption Offences) Act became law on 5 June 2018.  This Act repeals the previous seven prevention of Corruption Acts dating back as far as 1889.  However it is more than a consolidation, it represents a complete overhaul of the criminal law in this area and introduces a range of new offences.  Most offences apply to both the public and private sector.  An offence of trading in influence is introduced for the first time.  The offence contained in section 7 is directed solely at the public sector and it relates to Irish officials doing certain acts in relation to their office or using confidential information for the purpose of corruptly obtaining a gift, consideration or advantage.  Similarly, the new offence in section 18 is directed solely at the private sector and introduces a strict liability offence whereby a body corporate will be guilty if anyone directly connected with the body corporate commits a corruption offence with the intention of benefitting the body corporate.  This offence is rebuttable but it will be up to the body corporate to prove it took all reasonable steps to avoid the commission of the offence.  </p><p>The Act includes strong penalties to reflect the seriousness of the offence.  Penalties include up to ten years imprisonment and a possible unlimited fine in the case of  bodies corporate.The Act is a comprehensive, modern piece of legislation that responds to various recommendations made by the Mahon Tribunal, the OECD, the United Nations and from GRECO, the Council of Europe anti-corruption body.</p><p><b>Transparency International</b></p><p>The Deputy refers to Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index 2017.  The index, which ranks 180 countries and territories by their perceived levels of public sector corruption according to experts and businesspeople, uses a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 is highly corrupt and 100 is very clean.  Ireland's score in 2017 was 74 out of 100 and, as the Deputy notes, this indicates little appreciable difference since 2016 in the perception of corruption in Ireland, according to this survey instrument.</p><p>It is important to note, however, that Ireland's score has improved significantly since 2012, having risen 5 points on the Index's scale from 69 to 74.  Further, Ireland ranks well above the global average of 43 and that of Western Europe &ndash; the highest ranking region in the index with an average score of 66.</p></reply>

In September 2018, Dublin City Councillors voted against that particular commercial development. </p>  <p>  The issue of memorialisation was also considered at the &lsquo;Dublin Honours Magdalenes&rsquo; event in June 2018.  Over 200 former residents of Magdalen institutions attended this event at the Mansion House, with The President of Ireland also hosting the women at his official residence.  Although the event was organised by a voluntary group, funding and logistical support were provided by my Department. </p>  <p>  The event was in line with another of the recommendations of Mr. Justice Quirke. It provided an opportunity for the women to meet and exchange contact details and make known their views on a suitable memorial.  I have asked the event organisers to provide a report on the outcome of those consultations and I will give careful consideration to the views of the Magdalen women when received.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p><p>Community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. It provides a means of recognising that every community &ndash; both urban and rural &ndash; has its own concerns and expectations. That is why it is important to recognise that the role of a community Garda is not a specialist role in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; rather it is the case that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in community policing in carrying out their duties.

It is a matter for the Divisional Chief Superintendent to determine the optimum distribution of duties among the personnel available to him or her having regard to the profile of the area and its specific needs.</p><p>The information requested by the Deputy in relation to the population served by each Garda District is not readily available in my Department as the recording of the population by area is a matter for the Central Statistics Office.</p><p>The material is not compiled in such a manner as to allow me to provide you with the number of Community Garda&iacute; in each district. By way of assistance the information in relation to the number of Community Garda&iacute; by Division in each of the years from 2008 to 31 August 2018, the latest date for which figures are currently available as provided by the Garda Commissioner, is available on my Department&rsquo;s website through the link:</p><p><i>www.justice.ie/en/JELR/005_Community_Garda_Strength_2008_to_31_August_2018.xlsx/Files/005_Community_Garda_Strength_2008_to_31_August_2018.xlsx.</i></p><p>For more general information on Garda Facts and Figures please see <i>www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Pages/An_Garda_Siochana_facts_and_figures.</i></p></reply>

The Director is working in a very determined way to get the necessary staff resources, processes, IT system, expert panels, codes of practice and regulations in place in order that the Decision Support Service can be up and running as quickly as possible. There are many complex strands to this work, including involvement of multiple organisations. </p>  <p>  Every effort is underway to ensure that the Decision Support Service has all necessary capacity to open for business as soon as possible.  While the DSS has been working towards being operational and ready for the commencement of the main provisions of the ADMC Act in early 2020, the situation will be kept under review as the preparatory work on implementation moves forward.  </p>  <p>  The commencement of Part 8 of the Act, which provides for a legislative framework for advance healthcare directives, is a matter for the Minister for Health.</p></reply>

This funding is guided by Research, Development and Innovation (RDI) being an essential component in a company&rsquo;s ability to maintain a competitive edge in the market. </p>  <p>  Companies and researchers that receive RDI grant support generate intellectual property and technical know-how in Ireland.  Many of these RDI projects lead to manufacturing of new products, which further embed the companies in Ireland and, where relevant, increase the strategic importance of the Irish facility within the Global entity. This, in turn, contributes to the potential to increase employment in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Information across the three agencies referenced above is not available in a format that allows for a definitive figure to be provided on "medicines research and development". However, the information provided below indicates that medical and pharma-related R&amp;D forms a significant part of the R&amp;D supported in each agency. </p>  <p>  In 2017, IDA Ireland paid a total of &euro;54,251,000 in RDI grants to its clients to undertake RDI across a variety of sectors, including Technology, Life Sciences, Medical Technologies and Engineering.  Included in the above total is a figure of &euro;13,900,000 which was paid to IDA Ireland clients in the pharma sector. Whilst some of this funding may be for drug research, it is not possible to confirm that all the funding is used exclusively for that purpose.</p>  <p>  For the most part, Science Foundation Ireland does not ring-fence or pre-allocate funds for specific areas of research.  SFI funds oriented basic research and applied research in all areas of science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM).  All of the research funded by SFI undergoes rigorous international peer review.  From time to time, the agency may run a competitive call in a defined research area where it has been identified that there is a specific gap in Ireland&rsquo;s capabilities or an identified opportunity or challenge which Ireland can and should address.</p>  <p>  In 2017, SFI invested over &euro;33,720,000 in research related to medicines research and development. The awards cover areas directly, and more remotely, relevant to medicines research including drug/medicines discovery, but mostly synthesis, formulation, processing technologies, delivery. Significant awards in the medicine research and development areas include the SFI Research Centres, SSPC and C&Uacute;RAM.</p>  <p>  The Synthesis and Solid State Pharmaceutical Centre (SSPC) SFI Research Centre led by University of Limerick, is a global hub of pharmaceutical process innovation and advanced manufacturing. SSPC leads the way for next generation drug manufacture and spans the entire pharmaceutical production chain from synthesis of the molecule, to the isolation of the material, and formulation of the medicine. </p>  <p>  C&Uacute;RAM, SFI&rsquo;s Research Centre led by National University of Ireland in Galway, aims to radically improve health outcomes for patients by developing &lsquo;smart&rsquo; medical devices and implants. C&Uacute;RAM&rsquo;s research programme focuses on innovative design, assessment and manufacture of medical devices and is driven by specialist researchers, clinicians and industry partners, ultimately translating research into clinical settings.</p>  <p>  Finally, in 2017, Enterprise Ireland paid &euro;5,000,000 in financial support to client companies to support medicine research and development. Enterprise Ireland also has a range of supports for collaborative projects with the Higher Education Sector.  However, further analysis would be required to determine what share of this funding was allocated to medicines research and development. </p></reply>

SFI undertook a pre-planned international review process at the four-year stage of these centres. As part of this, the seven Research Centres were invited to submit proposals for probable future funding. </p><p>The review process involved three key stages: </p><p>Firstly, a detailed written review was undertaken by different teams of international experts on the progress the individual SFI Research Centres had made and the proposals for future research outlined in the applications. </p><p>Secondly, the same international reviewers conducted an on-site review, and subsequently wrote a report with recommendations and scores.</p><p>Thirdly, and following the above, a separate International Oversight Review Panel was put in place to consider the individual reviews from the first two stages. The remit of the Oversight Panel was to ensure: </p><p>- Quality assurance;</p><p>- Fairness and consistency;</p><p>- Parity of practice across the seven Site Review Panels;</p><p>- Normalisation of the scoring;</p><p>- Ranking of the fundable applications.</p><p>This additional panel was put in place as a quality assurance measure, to ensure parity of practice across the seven Site Reviews.  This was important, as the on-site panels reviewing the various Research Centres were comprised of different reviewers. The Oversight Panel was also requested to make a recommendation to the SFI Executive and Board on whether each centre should either receive additional new term funding, should not be funded for a new term, or should progress to an open competition, to be reviewed against other potential centre applicants in 2020. </p><p>Oversight Panel members of the highest calibre were selected. Each panel member was required to have strategic leadership roles within prestigious organisations such as national funding agencies and world leading universities.</p><p>The panel was made up of seven members, chaired by the Chancellor of a prestigious US university.  The remaining six members were leaders from a number of UK and US universities and funding agencies. The Chair of the Oversight Panel also attended the SFI Board meeting in June 2018 when the Board discussed the Research Centre funding recommendations.</p></reply>

In May 2018, the figure had increased to 85% of all client companies surveyed. The survey reported that client companies are taking action in areas such as market diversification; developing strategic partnerships; improving operational competitiveness, improving financial management, and strengthening business in the UK. This is a substantial increase, and demonstrates the effectiveness of EI&rsquo;s efforts to communicate the importance of preparing for Brexit. </p>  <p>  To drive the building of resilience, EI has put an increased emphasis on market diversification, driving innovation, and improving competitiveness. In delivering on this, new supports have been introduced, others streamlined, and a Global Ambition campaign launched.  In addition, EI has commenced national awareness and preparedness initiatives. </p>  <p>  EI will continue to roll out Brexit Advisory Clinics. A clinic was held earlier this month, with three more scheduled to take place in Dundalk, Waterford and Limerick before the end of the year.</p>  <p>  My Department, through EI, will continue to work with client companies to help them to scale, improve resilience and succeed in world markets. EI will also work with Government and non-Governmental stakeholders to support clients to overcome the challenges of Brexit and build on their ambitious strategies to sustain and create jobs throughout the country.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s commitment to preparing the business community for Brexit can also be seen in the series of four &ldquo;Getting Ireland Brexit Ready&rdquo; seminars, which are being held this month around the country.</p></reply>

With less than 6 months to go, I was determined to deliver a budget with Brexit at its core, building on the many measures we have already introduced, and responding to the evolving needs of business.</p><p>The agencies under my remit have an extensive range of supports available to enable companies to both consolidate market share and continue to pursue new opportunities to grow their market presence within the UK. For 2019, I am allocating an extra &euro;8m to the enterprise agencies and regulatory bodies under my Department, who work with firms at the coalface to develop their supports for business.</p><p>I also announced a longer term loan facility of up to &euro;300m to support capital investment by business. </p><p>Enterprise Ireland (EI) supports include:</p><p>- A new Online customs Training Programme to be launched shortly to demystify customs procedures. This will be available to all exporters and importers.  </p><p>- Brexit Advisory Clinics: The purpose of these clinics is to encourage companies to examine their potential exposure to Brexit, to complete the Brexit SME Scorecard and use the Be Prepared Grant to plan their strategic response to Brexit.  </p><p>- Brexit Scorecard: An interactive online platform to self-assess exposure to Brexit under six business pillars. </p><p>- Be Prepared Grant: This grant offers SME clients a grant of up to &euro;5,000 to assist them in preparing an action plan for economic shocks such as Brexit. </p><p>- The Agile Innovation Fund: giving companies rapid fast-track access to innovation funding, and up to 50% in support for product, process or service development projects with a total cost of up to &euro;300,000.  </p><p>- Market Discovery Fund - supports Enterprise Ireland clients research new markets for products and services.  </p><p>- &ldquo;Prepare to Export Scorecard&rdquo;: The Scorecard helps Irish companies with global ambition to self-assess how prepared they are to start exporting.</p><p>- Brexit 'Act On' Programme: This funding is to support the engagement of a consultant to draw up a report with tailored recommendations to help clients address weaknesses and become more resilient.  </p><p>- Strategic Consultancy Grant: This helps client companies to hire a strategic consultant for a set period to assist the company to develop and implement significant strategic initiatives.  </p><p>- Operational Excellence Offer: Enables Irish companies trading internationally to develop or transform their wider business in order to compete more effectively.</p><p>- Irish Advantage Campaign: The aim of the #Irish Advantage export promotion campaign, is to stimulate awareness of Irish products and services and encourage buyers to source from Ireland. </p><p>In Budget 2019, I have allocated &euro;1.25m for a Retail Online Scheme which will be launched by Enterprise Ireland shortly.  The main objective of the Pilot scheme will be to support SMEs in the retail sector with a pre-existing online presence to develop and implement a more sophisticated and strategic online trading offer with a view to increasing online business and customers both domestically and internationally.</p><p>I have also earmarked an additional &euro;1.8m for the Design and Crafts Council of Ireland over the next 3 years. The proposed investment, again via Enterprise Ireland is intended to expand marketing and development programmes, which are currently being delivered on a smaller scale by DCCOI for Irish designers and makers. This will support enterprises to exhibit at international trade fairs, to develop partnerships with flagship retailers, and to develop e-commerce capacity. The aim is to assist the sector to develop and generate additional export sales and online revenue opportunities, increasing market diversification by client companies and underpinning sustainable growth.</p><p>The 31 Local Enterprise Offices play a pivotal role in supporting micro-enterprises, as they prepare for Brexit. I have allocated an additional &euro;5m to enhance their programme of supports in 2019, up 22% on 2018. </p><p>I have also allocated an additional &euro;1m in capital funding to InterTrade Ireland, an increase of 17.5%. This will allow them to step up their support for companies in the border region, North and South, who are particularly exposed to Brexit. </p><p>The Government&rsquo;s commitment to preparing the business community for Brexit can also be seen in the series of four &ldquo;Getting Ireland Brexit Ready&rdquo; seminars, which are being held this month around the country.</p></reply>

The LEOs are the first port of call for anyone who wishes to start or expand a business, in terms of advice, training, sign posting to other support providers and, in certain circumstances, grant support. The LEOs undertake a number of activities to encourage businesses to build their online presence and compete in the online market place.</p>  <p>  The LEOs nationwide actively promote the Trading Online Voucher Scheme (TOVS) on behalf of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment. The TOVS offers matched financial assistance of up to &euro;2,500, along with training and advice, to micro companies (10 or less employees) who want to establish an online presence for the first time, or who wish to expand a basic existing website to incorporate a more substantive online trading capacity. Since the start of the scheme in July 2014 to 30 June this year, over 4,100 micro enterprises have availed of TOVs. </p>  <p>  The LEOs also offer a wide range of short training programmes to support their clients in building their online presence and to compete in the online marketplace. These programmes are focused on different elements which aim at maximizing outputs from investment in online trading such as: </p>  <p>  -  Marketing, focused mainly on development of an online/mobile marketing strategy;</p>  <p>  -  Social Media, with the majority of programmes focused on educating the client base on how to use the different social media platforms to support their business;</p>  <p>  -  eCommerce Sales Strategy, including how to convert website visits into sales; and</p>  <p>  -  Search Engine Optimization, including web analytics and video optimization for web.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland (EI) works with 5,000 manufacturing and internationally traded services companies, and building an online presence is part of the range of supports offered to those clients. EI has supported projects focused on developing innovative products on new product platforms for international markets. However, EI cannot support companies whose only function is in the area of sales/distribution.</p>  <p>  Working closely with the Irish Internet Association, EI delivers a range of funded and advisory eCommerce supports for its clients to develop their online marketing capabilities, for example:</p>  <p>  -  &lsquo;Marketing Funding Support&rsquo;: under a Business Process Improvement Grant client companies can apply for grant support to plan and implement significant strategic e-marketing projects.</p>  <p>  -  &lsquo;Measuring your Internet Marketing Maturity&rsquo;: to help clients develop an understanding of their web presence and activity.</p>  <p>  EI regularly organizes events which can connect clients with leading experts and inform them on best practice. Topics covered include Developing an Online Strategy; Online Localization for International Markets; Search Engine Optimization; Pay Per Click Marketing; Branding and Getting the Web Content Right. </p>  <p>  EI also offers an Excel @ Export Selling Workshop Series which includes creating a digital marketing strategy. This workshop is aimed at senior management executives with responsibility for selling high value products and services into business-to-business markets. </p>  <p>  In Budget 2019, I have allocated &euro;1.25m for a Retail Online Scheme which will be launched by EI shortly.  The main objective of the Pilot scheme will be to support SMEs in the retail sector with a pre-existing online presence to develop and implement a more sophisticated and strategic online trading offer with a view to increasing online business and customers both domestically and internationally.</p>  <p>  I have also earmarked an additional &euro;1.8m for the Design and Crafts Council of Ireland over the next 3 years.

The &euro;23 million exchequer funding announced in the 2018 Budget (&euro;14 million from my Department and &euro;9 million from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine) has been leveraged to provide a fund of up to &euro;300 million over the lifetime of the scheme. </p><p>The scheme features a two-stage application process. First, businesses must apply to the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) to confirm their eligibility for the scheme. Businesses can use guidelines provided on the SBCI website to determine if they are eligible, and if so, to complete the eligibility form.  As part of the process, businesses must submit a business plan, demonstrating the means by which they intend to innovate, change or adapt to meet their Brexit challenges. The SBCI assesses the applications and successful applicants receive an eligibility reference number.</p><p>Successful applicants can then apply for a loan under the scheme with one of the participating finance providers using their eligibility reference number. Participating finance providers are the Bank of Ireland, Ulster Bank and Allied Irish Bank.  Approval of loans is subject to the finance providers' own credit policies and procedures.  </p><p>The figures in the following table are those up to 2 October 2018.

The current public hospital statutory in-patient charge is &euro;80 per day, subject to a maximum of &euro;800 in any period of 12 consecutive months.  All persons accessing public in-patient services in a public hospital are liable for the statutory public-inpatient charge, subject to a number of exemptions, including where a person is a medical cardholder.  There are currently no plans to exempt further categories of patients from the public in-patient charge.</p>  <p>  Hospital charges represent a nominal yet important contribution towards the cost of providing public hospital services.

The introduction of legislation in relation to AHR and associated research is a priority for me and officials in my Department are engaging with the Office of the Attorney General in relation to the process of drafting this Bill. </p>  <p>  In order to support the commencement of the legislation, officials in my Department are working with the HSE over the course of this year in developing a model of care for infertility to ensure the provision of safe, effective and accessible services through the public health system as part of the full range of services available in obstetrics and gynaecology. </p>  <p>  Part of this work includes identifying policy options for a public funding model for AHR treatment.  Once I have had the opportunity to consider these policy options I will bring a Memorandum to Government in relation to a model of care for infertility, including public funding for AHR treatment, for the Government's consideration.  As such no specific decision has been made at this time in relation the parameters of any potential public funding model.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that any funding model that may ultimately be introduced would need to operate within the broader regulatory framework set out in the AHR Bill and a model of care for infertility.</p>  <p>  Currently, patients who access IVF treatment privately may claim tax relief on the costs involved under the tax relief for medical expenses scheme.  In addition, a defined list of fertility medicines needed for fertility treatment is covered under the High Tech Scheme administered by the HSE.  Medicines covered by the High Tech Scheme must be prescribed by a consultant/specialist and approved by the HSE &lsquo;High Tech Liaison Officers&rsquo;.  The cost of the medicines is then covered, as appropriate, under the Medical Card or Drugs Payment Scheme.  There is also a limited specialist AHR service available through the HSE, which provides funding for fertility preservation for cancer patients whose treatment is likely to impact on their future fertility.</p></reply>

HIHI is a joint initiative between my Department and the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  </p>  <p>  HIHI is a consortium led by University College Cork and comprising Cork Institute of Technology, National University of Ireland Galway &amp;amp; Trinity College Dublin.  I officially launched HIHI in University College Cork in September 2016.  </p>  <p>  The aim of the initiative is to drive collaboration between the health service and the enterprise sector and the development and commercialisation of new healthcare technologies, products and services emerging from within the health service, and/or the enterprise sector.  HIHI is built on the recognition that collaboration with enterprise can benefit patient care, patient pathways and outcomes. </p>  <p>  The objectives behind the development of a Health Innovation Hub are:</p>  <p>  -  to allow healthcare companies to deliver commercial products and services more quickly by giving them appropriate access to the health service in order to test and validate and refine products in a real life environment.</p>  <p>  -  to allow the health service to find efficiencies and improvements (including to services and patient outcomes) by facilitating the HSE and hospitals to engage with innovative companies creating solutions to problems they face, and</p>  <p>  -  to support the adoption/commercialisation of new innovations developed by healthcare practitioners inside the healthcare service </p>  <p>  HIHI has issued two calls, the first in 2016 and a second once which just closed in August 2018.  I recently opened the second office of HIHI in St James Hospital, Dublin.  Since its establishment HIHI has managed 200 company engagements, ran 25 studies in Irish healthcare settings, 72 companies receiving follow up support through HIHI.  The recent HIHI call has shown a 46 % increase in applications to the HIHI national call aimed at companies, start-ups, SMEs compared with 2016.    </p>  <p>  A core part of HIHI in Dublin is the design and delivery of an education programmes for those working in Irish healthcare that will build a sustainable culture of improvement and innovation.  It is hoped that people who participate in these programmes then become catalysts for innovation within the health system </p>  <p>  HIHI was awarded &euro;5 million in funding by Enterprise Ireland for five years IN 2016.  In addition the HSE is receiving &euro;0.260m annually since 2017 to support the provision of 3.9 FTE to HIHI.  Importantly the HSE also provides significant in-kind support to the Hub.</p>  <p>  eHealth Ireland, the body tasked with the promotion and implementation of the eHealth agenda in Ireland, supports innovation in eHealth through a series of events including the eHealth ecosystem, the annual 'Health Innovation Week' and hosting 'Innovation Challenges' across Ireland to encourage entrepreneurs, technologists and health care innovators both within the HSE and externally the opportunity and environment to develop their ideas and concepts further. </p>  <p>  My Department, in co-operation with the HSE and eHealth Ireland, has made considerable progress to introduce technological improvements to our health services with the aim of improving patient safety and efficiencies.  eHealth Ireland trial new ICT technology through their Quality Innovation Corridor (QIC) technology programme which has a maximum funding application amount of &euro;25k each.  The programme is primarily aimed at the assessment of the application of new technology, rather than for the innovation of new products.  I have been advised that each QIC application is appraised on its merits and as such, expenditure is made on a case-by-case basis.  Since it is not readily available, I have asked the HSE to collate the expenditure information and to forward it to the Deputy.</p>  <p>  I also understand that my Department does not provide funding directly to the European Union for innovation.</p></reply>

Lyme borreliosis is diagnosed by medical history and a physical examination.  The infection is confirmed by blood tests which look for antibodies to <i>Borrelia burgdorferi </i>produced by an infected person's body in response to the infection.  These normally take several weeks to develop and may not be present in the early stages of the disease.  </p><p>Laboratories in Ireland generally follow the laboratory testing recommendations of the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, the Infectious Disease Society of America, the European Federation of Neurological Societies, and the British Infection Association.  Whereas Irish laboratories have their own quality assurance methods to make sure the tests are working correctly and are also accredited by the Irish National Accreditation Body to perform the relevant tests correctly, testing which is performed abroad may be performed in laboratories which have not met National or International Accreditation (Quality Standards) to a similar degree, giving rise to a greater degree of risk of diagnosis of a &ldquo;false positive&rdquo; result or interpreting equivocal results in a manner that is more likely to give rise to verification bias. </p><p>Best practice dictates that if a patient presents themselves in front of a GP or consultant in Ireland with a report/test from another EU member state and they are seeking ongoing treatment for a particular illness, the GP or consultant would examine the patient using both clinical and laboratory diagnostics confirmed before they would be in a position to prescribe a course of treatment for them.  The same protocol would apply across most other EU member states as the GP or consultant would need to be totally satisfied that the patient is correctly diagnosed while getting the right course of treatment for their illness.  </p><p>Patients can seek to access health care in another EU/EEA member state via two different schemes.  Where a service is provided in Ireland but a patient wishes to access care in another EU/EEA Member State, this can be possible by seeking treatment under the Directive on Patients' Rights in Cross Border Healthcare, otherwise known as the Cross Border Directive (CBD).  The HSE operates the CBD in Ireland.  Referral for care under the CBD may be made by a GP, a hospital consultant and certain other clinicians.  In line with practice in other EU Member States, the HSE through the National Contact Point (NCP) provides information for patients on the CBD on its website which can be accessed at: <i>hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/schemes/cbd/ </i>and also by phone at (056) 7784551. </p><p>The HSE advises where a patient is in any doubt as to the need to seek prior authorisation before availing of a consultation or treatment abroad to contact the NCP. </p><p>The HSE also operates the Treatment Abroad Scheme (TAS) for persons entitled to treatment in another EU/EEA Member State or Switzerland under EU Regulation (EC) No. 883/2004, as per the procedures set out in EU Regulations (EC) No. 987/2009.  The TAS provides for the cost of approved treatments in another EU/EEA member state or Switzerland through the issue of form E112 (IE) where the treatment is:</p><p>-  Among the benefits provided for by Irish legislation;</p><p>-  Not available in Ireland; and</p><p>-  Not available within the time normally necessary for obtaining it in Ireland, taking account of the patient's current state of health and the probable course of the disease. </p><p>GPs refer patients to consultants for acute care and it is the treating consultant who, having exhausted all treatment options including tertiary care within the country, refers the patient abroad under the terms of the TAS.  The consultant must specify the specific treatment and in making the referral accepts clinical responsibility in relation to the physician and facility abroad where the patient will attend.  Applications to the TAS are processed and a determination given in accordance with the statutory framework prior to a patient travelling to avail of treatment.  The statutory framework stipulates the patient must be a public patient and is required to have followed public patient pathways.  Information on the TAS can be accessed on the HSE website at: <i>hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/schemes/treatmentabroad/ </i>and also by phone at (056) 7784551.</p></reply>

The current legislation, the European Communities (Clinical Trials on Medicinal Products for Human Use) Regulations 2004, transposed EU Directive 2001/20/EC on clinical trials into Irish law. A new EU Clinical Trials Regulation, EU Regulation 536/2014, was adopted in May 2014 and is scheduled to be implemented in 2020.  The new Regulation aims to create an environment that is favourable for conducting clinical trials, with the highest standards of patient safety, across the EU. </p>  <p>  The benefits of the new Clinical Trials Regulation will include:</p>  <p>  -  Harmonised electronic submission and assessment process for clinical trials conducted in multiple Member States.</p>  <p>  -  Improved collaboration, information-sharing and decision-making between and within Member States.</p>  <p>  -  Increased transparency, with information on the authorisation, conduct and results of each clinical trial carried out in the EU to be made publicly available. </p>  <p>  At national level the Health Research Board (HRB) is the lead agency in Ireland supporting and funding health research. It is important to note that the HRB  funds a great deal of research which is not directly aimed at the development of products. This includes most of its health services and population health research portfolio. Within the clinical trials space the HRB funds testing of medicinal products, medical devices as well as processes and therapies such as physical or psychotherapy without an associated product. It needs to be understood that great public benefit can arise from understanding how things can be done better outside of the development of products.</p>  <p>  The HRB, in funding health research projects is committed to the highest standards and principles such as integrity, transparency, fairness and accountability; collaboration and co-operation and a focus on outcomes and impact. Examples of how they work to achieve these aims include the following:</p>  <p>  -  The HRB has been at the forefront of developing public and patient involvement (PPI) in research in Ireland. This aims to drive the relevance and improve the conduct of research.</p>  <p>  -  HRB allocation of research funding is made following international peer review to ensure that only those proposals of the highest quality are funded.   </p>  <p>  -  Considerable investment has been made by the HRB, with funding from my Department, in developing a clinical research landscape in Ireland that can provide the supports and infrastructure to facilitate clinical trials of medicinal products, diagnostics and medical devices, such that they can be robustly evaluated to ensure their safety and efficacy.  </p>  <p>  -  As part of its funding criteria, the HRB  requires the registration of all regulated clinical trials and the publication of trial outcomes. Through its Open Publishing Platform (HRB Open Research), the HRB facilitates the publication of protocols and results. HRB Clinical Research Co-Ordination Ireland (HRB-CRCI) co-ordinates multi-site clinical trials activity in Ireland as well as collaborative and multi-disciplinary projects.  </p>  <p>  -  The HRB terms and conditions for its funded research set out a number of clauses that cover oversight, accountability, transparency and protection of intellectual property of grant funding.  </p>  <p>  -  The terms and conditions accepted by host institutions for HRB funding cover publication and broader public dissemination of results, and appropriate protection of Intellectual Property (IP) in line with the National Intellectual Property Protocol, "Inspiring Partnership - the National IP Protocol 2016: Policies and Resources to help industry make good use of public research in Ireland".  This protocol encourages the use of non-exclusive licensing. Information on all HRB-funded awards is publicly available on its website.</p>  <p>  The HRB monitor adherence to their terms and conditions of grants. They do this through annual and interim review and the collection of detailed evaluation data.  </p></reply>

The Strategy contains 35 priority and additional actions and its implementation is being led by the National Dementia Office in the HSE.  The office has made substantial progress towards developing evidence-based care pathways for people with dementia and progress to date, as well as future plans, is recorded in the mid-term review of the Strategy's implementation, which was published in May this year.  The Strategy emphasises the need for a "whole community response" to dementia, as the majority of people with dementia live in their own communities and wish to avail of services in their local area.</p>  <p>  In 2014 the HSE introduced Dementia-Specific Intensive Homecare Packages (IHCPs) to test the feasibility of providing a high level of support to people with dementia with complex needs to facilitate them to remain living at home.  These were initially co-funded by the HSE and the Atlantic Philanthropies and now fully funded by the HSE, which has committed to continue to provide approximately 120 packages at any one time beyond 2018.  As of the end of July this year, 361 people with dementia had benefitted from an IHCP.  In addition to the IHCPs, people with dementia are also able to avail of standard home care services on the basis of need and within the resources available.</p>  <p>  The approach from the Government on Budget day is to announce the significant investment in health services for 2019 as a whole.  On foot of this, the Department of Health and the HSE will commence a process of developing and agreeing the HSE National Service Plan 2019, which will set out, in detail, the type and quantum of services to be delivered in 2019.</p></reply>

Approximately 60% of the country was already providing weekend services prior to the implementation of the seven-day-a-week project.  Since June 2017 considerable work has been done to assign resources to those remaining areas which were without weekend services.  The further development of 24-hour Mental Health Service is being considered in light of the evidence coming from the implementation of the seven-day-a-week service in relation to demand for out-of-hours services and staffing needs for this.  It is envisaged that all CHOs will have some level of a seven-day-a-week cover by Quarter 1, 2019.</p>  <p>  Budget 2019 allocated an additional &euro;84 million to mental health services, bringing the Mental Health budget to almost &euro;1 billion, an increase of 40% on 2012. &euro;35 million is apportioned for new developments, while &euro;20 million is for the further growth of projects commenced in 2018.  It must be noted however that the new developments will be progressed in the context of both the overall HSE Service Plan 2018, and the more detailed regional Operational Plan for Mental Health.

One is the Scoping Inquiry led by Dr Gabriel Scally, and one is an Independent Clinical Expert Review led by the Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynaecology with expertise from the British Society for Colposcopy and Cytopathology. The scope of these reviews includes the labs contracted to provide services for CervicalCheck, and review of the slides of women diagnosed with cervical cancer who participated in the CervicalCheck programme. Together, these two strands of investigation provide the independent external expertise required to address the issues raised in relation to CervicalCheck.  </p>  <p>  The Scoping Inquiry into CervicalCheck was led by Dr Gabriel Scally. The Terms of Reference of the Inquiry were developed following cross-party engagement and included an examination of the tendering, contracting, operation, conflict of interest arrangements, performance information and performance management, accreditation and quality assurance of contracted cytology laboratory services by CervicalCheck from initiation of the programme. Dr Scally's expert team, which included cytopathology expertise, visited the labs as part of his report. He has confirmed he is satisfied with the quality management processes in the current laboratory sites. </p>  <p>  Crucially, he has confirmed that he finds no reason why the existing contracts for laboratory services should not continue until the new HPV regime is introduced. This is very welcome reassurance for women in Ireland. Dr Scally will now be carrying out further work in relation to the laboratories. </p>  <p>  Separately, the scope of the Independent Clinical Expert Review, to be led by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, includes all cases of cervical cancer in Ireland since CervicalCheck was established, to include the 1,482 cases notified to CervicalCheck since then and a further 1,630 cases registered by the National Cancer Registry of Ireland which had not been notified to CervicalCheck. It will examine the slides of those women within this cohort who were screened by the programme, approximately 1,856 women from within the total.  All preceding slides taken within the CervicalCheck programme will be reviewed and will be read according to the protocol for the review, which is published on the website of my Department. This process will offer independent clinical assurance to women about their screening history. </p></reply>

An internal review was also conducted. The final Report combines the two review findings.</p>  <p>  I am aware that this final Report was produced on foot of concerns raised under Protected Disclosures procedures and also concern by the University of Limerick Hospitals Group about the increase in detection of the 'superbug' CPE in University Hospital Limerick (UHL) in recent years. </p>  <p>  I note that the Report found that out of a final group of 73 patients in which CPE was detected from February 2009 to May 2017, 8 patient deaths were identified in whom CPE was considered to be a contributory factor.  The conclusion of the external review, however, which ULHG has accepted, was that no deaths were a direct result of CPE acquisition. All 8 patients had serious underlying diseases and co-morbidity factors</p>  <p>  In addition, of the remaining 65 deceased patients, the external reviewer concluded that CPE was found not to have been an associative factor in their deaths.</p>  <p>  This is an important finding and will inform the work already ongoing in my Department and the HSE to tackle healthcare associated infections and antimicrobial resistance (HCAI/AMR). </p>  <p>  My Department has provided funding to expand the HSE HCAI/AMR National Team and Implementation Leads to progress work on HCAIs/AMR across the HSE, including Hospital Groups and Community Healthcare Organisations. My Department has also provided funding for additional capacity in Infection Prevention and Control and laboratory services. This includes posts for University Hospital Limerick. </p>  <p>  I have been assured that ULHG have measures in place to appropriately support and manage patient care needs in line with national and international best practice.</p>  <p>  Internationally, AMR is recognised as a world wide challenge. The World Health Organisation and European Union are supporting countries in taking a 'One Health' or cross sectoral approach to addressing AMR, including the spread of organisms such as CPE.</p>  <p>  Last October, I launched Ireland's National Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance 2017-2020, known as iNAP, with Minister Michael Creed, Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  </p>  <p>  The HSE continues to address the management and prevention of healthcare associated infections, including these so-called superbugs, and Ireland is fully engaged in proactively addressing this world-wide challenge.</p></reply>

However, the Medicinal Products (Prescription and Control of Supply) Regulations 2003, as amended (S.I. No. 540 of 2003) allow certain prescription-only medicines, including naloxone for known or suspected narcotic overdose, to be administered by trained members of the public in emergency situations. Listed organisations are enabled to access an emergency medicine without the need for a prescription. Members of that organisation must first complete an approved course of training regarding the administration of such medicines and the management of any adverse reaction. The Pre Hospital Emergency Care Council (PHECC) has established a framework for the education and training of persons to safely and competently administer these medicines to those urgently requiring care. </p><p>In order for an organisation to avail of an emergency medicine without the need for a prescription, they must also register with the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA). The HPRA&rsquo;s Emergency Medicines Portal is an online system that allows organisations to notify the HPRA of their intention to purchase a specified medicine from a pharmacy or other supplier for supply and administration in an emergency situation.</p><p>The Emergency Medicines Portal and the publicly available register of listed organisations is accessible on the HPRA website and can be found at: <i>www.hpra.ie/homepage/medicines/emergency-medicines</i>.</p><p>It is important to note that these regulations do not in any way change the existing &lsquo;good Samaritan&rsquo; provisions, which allow any member of the public to assist a person in distress to administer a medicine which has been prescribed to that person.</p></reply>

At my request, the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) is preparing a report which will make recommendations in relation to the clinical and technical issues involved. I am informed that the CMO&rsquo;s Report is anticipated to be completed in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  Pending finalisation of the report, a number of significant system actions in relation to mesh implants have already been advanced.</p>  <p>  The CMO wrote to the Acting Director General of the Health Service Executive on 20 July 2018 to request that the Executive put immediate measures in place to:</p>  <p>  - Pause the use of all procedures involving uro-gynaecological/transvaginal mesh implants for the management of Stress Urinary Incontinence (SUI) or Pelvic Organ Prolapse POP) in HSE funded hospitals, in cases where it is clinically appropriate and safe to do so.</p>  <p>  - Ensure that in situations where expert clinical judgment is that there is an urgency to carry out the procedure and no suitable alternative exists, surgery should proceed only if a delay would risk harm to the patient and should be based on multidisciplinary team decision and fully informed consent.</p>  <p>  This pause is to remain in place pending confirmation of implementation by the Health Service Executive, working in conjunction with the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (IOG) and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI), of three urgent recommendations relating to:</p>  <p>  (i) Surgical Training,</p>  <p>  (ii) Informed Consent and</p>  <p>  (iii) the Development of an agreed Dataset of Mesh Procedures.</p>  <p>  The Department also wrote to the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland and the Continence Foundation of Ireland on requesting that they assist the HSE in progressing these recommendations on an urgent basis.</p>  <p>  It is anticipated that the Executive will be in a position to indicate to the Department that these recommendations have been implemented within a number of months. The HSE has published information concerning the pause on its website for patients affected.</p>  <p>  The provision of appropriate aftercare for women suffering from mesh complications, including appropriate diagnostic facilities, has also been identified as a priority recommendation for immediate advancement by the Executive in the course of preparation of the CMO&rsquo;s report.  The CMO wrote to the Acting Director General of the HSE, and to the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (IOG), the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI), and the Continence Foundation of Ireland (CFI) on May 28 2018,  requesting that the Executive commence work on (i) the development of appropriate patient information resources and consent materials and (ii) clarification and development of treatment pathways and appropriate referral services for women suffering from mesh-related complications, in conjunction with the IOG, the RCSI and the CFI.</p>  <p>  The HSE has confirmed that work has commenced by the National Women and Infants Health Programme (NWIHP) in the HSE to progress all the recommendations above.  A Learning Notice concerning mesh devices in uro-gynaecological procedures was circulated by the NWIHP on 26 June 2018 to all maternity hospitals and acute hospitals with gynaecological services to highlight the importance of appropriate patient selection, adequate information and consent and also to inform the service providers that a Response Group has been convened to propose remedies for and address the provision of aftercare for complications. This learning notice has been posted on the NWIHP website.</p>  <p>  The HSE has informed the Department of Health that a Synthetic Mesh Devices Advisory Group has been convened by the NWIHP which includes three patient representatives, as well as representatives of the HPRA, the IOG, the RCSI, the CFI and all Hospital Groups to advise on and action all of the recommendations above. </p>  <p>  The HSE has advised that it is unable to facilitate membership on the Advisory Group to every patient or patient group who has a mesh experience. The NWIHP has sought to have a range of mesh experiences from the patient&rsquo;s perspective represented by a patient advocate on the Group &ndash; including patients who have had mesh with post-operative problems, patients who have had successful mesh surgery and patients who are on the waiting list for a mesh procedure.  The HSE advises that women who wish to submit views or submissions to the overall work of the Group should contact the National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme at smi.nwihp@hse.ie.</p>  <p>  The HSE advice is that all patients who have experienced complications due to mesh devices are advised to contact their consultant&rsquo;s clinic in the first instance.  Each hospital group has nominated an individual to coordinate a response to this group of patients.  If patients are having trouble accessing information they can contact the National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme at smi.nwihp@hse.ie.for help.</p></reply>

I published a three year Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy in August 2018, based on the eight principle in the Sl&aacute;intecare Report. </p><p>I have been clear since the report was published that I am fully committed to the vision and policy direction which it sets out. I have also been clear however, that I believe that some of the timelines outlined in the report were ambitious given the inter-dependencies involved in a large scale reform programme of this nature. For this reason the Implementation Strategy  has re-prioritised or proposed to phase some recommendations over a different time frame than that envisaged in the report. </p><p>It is noted that the original Sl&aacute;intecare Report envisaged that &euro;350 - &euro;400 million would be needed annually in the initial years of the reform programme. I understand that the team of academics that supported the Committee&rsquo;s work recently presented revised timelines and annual costings to the Oireachtas Committee on Health and now estimate an annual funding requirement of &euro;200m - &euro;250 million. I am pleased that the revised costings support my own view that the initial timelines and costings in the report were ambitious.</p><p>It should also be noted that many of the items in Table 3 are funded under the National Development Plan announced earlier this year which commits &euro;10.4bn to health infrastructure including a number of priority Sl&aacute;intecare actions. This includes capital funding for:</p><p>- 2,600 acute hospital beds;</p><p>- 4,500 additional long and short-term beds;</p><p>- Elective only hospitals in Cork, Dublin and Galway;</p><p>- A modern ehealth and ICT infrastructure;</p><p>- Additional Primary Care facilities with greater access to diagnostics; and</p><p>- Additional facilities for mental health services and for people with disabilities.</p><p>I am delighted that the recent Budget provided an increase of &euro;1.05 billion in Health funding. This brings the health budget for 2019 to &euro;17 billion.  This is the highest level of Health investment in the history of the State. This will allow the health service to meet additional demands due to the demographic pressure of a growing and aging population. </p><p>The Budget features over &euro;200m additional funding which  will directly support a range of additional services including initiatives proposed in the Sl&aacute;intecare Report and committed to in the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy. The Deputy will appreciate that as some of these are subject to negotiation, I am not in a position to provide a detailed breakdown. However it includes:</p><p>- Ringfenced funding for the Sl&aacute;intecare Programme Office;</p><p>- &euro;20m for the establishment of a new ring-fenced Sl&aacute;intecare Integration Fund to drive improvements in the way we deliver care across the system;</p><p>- Funding for a new GP contract;</p><p>- Expansion of free GP care, by increase in the weekly income threshold for GP Visit card by &euro;25 which could benefit up to 100,000 people;</p><p>- Additional funding for 100 new therapy posts to address assessment of need waiting lists for children with disabilities and funding to ensure that the needs of all those leaving school in 2019 will be addressed;</p><p>- &euro;55m in new development funding aimed at further enhancing community mental health teams for adults and children;</p><p>- Reducing user charges and out of pocket payments by further reductions in prescription charges - 50 cent reduction in prescription charges from &euro;2.00 to &euro;1.50 for all medical card holders over the age of 70 and by a &euro;10 reduction in the monthly Drugs Payment Scheme threshold from &euro;134 to &euro;124;</p><p>- Increased investment of &euro;20m in the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  This funding will be used to treat 70,000 patients on waiting lists in 2019; and</p><p>- Additional funding for  care redesign and the National Children's Hospital.</p><p>The Executive Director is currently preparing a detailed action plan, as mandated by Government,  for 2019 which will be published before the end of the year. </p><p>I believe that this budget provided an excellent basis for progressing the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation Strategy in 2019 and I  look forward to being able to report positive progress throughout 2019.</p></reply>

It is the commonest cause of tick-borne infection in Europe.  Lyme neuroborreliosis was made statutorily notifiable in Ireland by the Infectious Diseases (Amendment) Regulations 2011 (S.I. no 452 of 2011).</p><p>Testing and treatment for Lyme borreliosis is widely available in Ireland in all major hospitals.  Lyme borreliosis is diagnosed by medical history and a physical examination.  Lyme disease may be treated by infectious diseases specialists (of which there are 12 nationally) or by general internal medicine available in all acute hospitals. Medical training programmes at undergraduate or postgraduate level in Ireland provide specialist training in infectious diseases, including Lyme disease.</p><p>The Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC) of the HPSC established a Lyme Borreliosis Subcommittee, the aim of which is to develop strategies to undertake primary prevention with a view to minimising the harm caused by Lyme Borreliosis in Ireland.</p><p>The Subcommittee will shortly be meeting to consider its final report to the SAC.  During the report&rsquo;s preparation, the HPSC learned that the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the UK was undertaking a systematic review of Lyme disease which resulted in the NICE Lyme disease guidelines. These guidelines are based on the most exhaustive systematic review yet undertaken of the evidence around Lyme disease and focused on producing recommendations based on best available evidence relating to diagnosis, management and public awareness of Lyme disease.</p><p>The HPSC delayed the final production of the Subcommittee report to ensure that the findings of these guidelines could be considered for inclusion into the final report.  The report is in the final stages of preparation and it is planned to circulate the report to members of the Lyme Subcommittee with a view to having a final sign-off meeting of the Subcommittee in November, at which point it will be sent for consideration to the SAC.

This represents a 16% reduction in the overall number of patients waiting for an inpatient or day case procedure.</p>  <p>  In addition, the waiting list figures show that since July 2017, the number of patients waiting for a hip/knee replacement has reduced from 3,500 to 2,800 at the end of September 2018 equating to a reduction of 21% while the number of patients waiting over 9 months has more than halved from 1,019 to 444 in the same period.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2019 the Government has further increased investment in this area, with funding to the NTPF to increase from &euro;55m in 2018 to &euro;75m in 2019.  My Department is working closely with the National Treatment Purchase Fund and the HSE to finalise the 2019 Waiting List Initiatives before the end of this year.

GPs are remunerated for these services primarily on a capitation basis, with a range of additional support payments and fees for specific items of service. GPs are also remunerated for services they provide on behalf of the HSE under other public health schemes, such as the Maternity and Infant Care Scheme, Primary Childhood Immunisation Scheme, etc.</p>  <p>  The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (FEMPI) Act 2009 imposed a range of adjustments to health contractor payments.  This specific adjustments made in July 2013 resulted in savings in the region of &euro;36 million.</p>  <p>  Despite reductions to the payment rates of health contractors made under FEMPI legislation, the total fees paid to GPs under the GMS scheme have increased from just over &euro;472 million in 2009 to approximately &euro;525 million in 2017. This increase in fees is largely due to significant developments and investment in GP services introduced in recent years, with more services being made available to our citizens and additional financial support provided by the HSE.</p>  <p>  The Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 now allows the setting and varying of contractor payments on a non-emergency statutory basis. It is my intention to put in place a new multiannual approach to fees in return for service improvements and contractual reforms based upon health policy considerations and engagement with representative bodies.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department and the HSE recently re-engaged with the Irish Medical Organisation to set out the State's position in relation to reform of the GMS contract. Agreement on the delivery of service improvements and contractual reform has the potential to facilitate a substantial increase in the resourcing of general practice on a multiannual basis. </p></reply>

This increase is primarily the additional funding for the SlainteCare Integration Fund as announced in the budget. The remainder will be used for essential health care projects as required during 2019.</p><p>A data entry error occurred which resulted in &euro;10m of NTPF funding being included in error in the subhead E1, instead of E3.  The NTPF allocation for 2019 is &euro;75m.  The full allocation to the NTPF is now reflected in the published Expenditure Report 2019 available on <i>www.budget.gov.ie</i>and will be reflected in the Revised Estimates for Public Services 2019 published before year end.</p><p>Up to 2018 the H subhead reflected funding for statutory pension lump payments only.  All other pension funding was held in the Health Service Executive subheads I1 to I5.  To improve transparency and the linkage between the Health Vote subheads and the Health Service Executives National Service Plan in 2019 subhead H was amended to reflect all HSE pension funding including lump sums.  From 2019 this subhead will now reflect the full pension costs as set out in the National Service Plan for 2019.</p><p>The 2018 Health Vote for net exchequer pension costs was &euro;649.476m. Pension related deductions (PRD) were netted against pay.  In 2019, as part of the Public Service Stability Agreement, PRD will convert to Additional Superannuation Contributions (ASC), and therefore, are also netted off pensions costs for the 2019 Health Vote.  It is the presentation of these additional superannuation contributions that is driving the perceived 24% reduction in exchequer pension costs. </p><p>It was determined that the format of subheads for I1 to I5 causes confusion as they do not align with how HSE performance is reported.  The HSE reports performance against their annual service plan which is set out by service division.  The HSE does not plan or report on services delivery by HSE region or on a statutory/voluntary basis as indicated by the previous subheads I1 to I5.To improve the linkage between the estimates presentation and the NSP the following adjustments were made.</p><p>Subhead I now represents the funding allocated to HSE service areas set out in the National Service Plan with the exception of PCRS/Local Demand Led Schemes and Long Term Residential Care which are funded from Subheads K1 and K2 respectively.  It includes funding for new operational services developments for 2019 and excludes all pension related costs.  Pension costs are now reported in total in subhead H.</p><p>The 10% increase in subhead I arises due to the increase in health  funding for 2019 of &euro;1.5 billion as set out in the budget book, less the funds applicable to subheads E, H, K.1 and K.2 as above.</p><p>An actuarial assessment for potential claims under the CIS is prepared annually by the State Claims Agency and a determination is taken with regard to the level of funding that will be required by year end, under subhead J4.</p><p>Regarding subhead K1; Medicines play a vital role in improving the health of Irish patients. Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key objective of the health service. However, the challenge is to do this in an affordable and sustainable manner. The allocation provided under K1 for 2019 is arrived at following considerable consideration and analysis of a range of factors.  The detailed allocation of the funding will be finalised as part of the preparation by the HSE of their 2019 National Service Plan.</p><p>Under EU regulations, where a person is employed in or a pensioner of one member state but residing or staying in another, the member state of employment or paying the pension must in general bear the responsibility for the cost of health services. As the number of Irish people living here who worked previously in the United Kingdom holding British pensions is considerable, a reimbursement agreement has been agreed between the two countries. The Appropriations-in-Aid receipt represents the U.K.'s net liability to this country.  Following detailed engagement with UK officials it has been indicated that the net position due from the UK for 2018 will be &euro;55m below planned on an ongoing basis giving rise to the 12% reduction in receipts reflected for 2019.</p></reply>

As I announced on Budget day, this is the Scheme for which I had provided &euro;25 million in funding in 2018. This is a key Government Brexit response that has been under consideration and development throughout 2018.</p>  <p>  The Scheme, which will be administered by the SBCI and backed by a European Investment Fund counter-guarantee, will bring previously unavailable 8 to 10 year unsecured investment finance to the Irish market at competitive interest rates. I am working with colleagues the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Heather Humphreys TD, and Minister Donohoe, to bring up to &euro;300 million of loans to the market.</p>  <p>  My Department is providing 40% of the funding so an overall agri-food package of up to &euro;120 million will be available. However, unlike previous similar Schemes, this can be reviewed and adjusted according to demand.</p>  <p>  Loans will be available to farmers, the seafood sector and to agri-food businesses.  This will be a long-awaited source of finance for young and new entrant farmers, especially the cohort who do not have high levels of security. It will also serve smaller-scale farmers, who often do not have the leverage to negotiate for more favourable terms with their banking institution. Along with the likes of Milk Flex, this Scheme will form part of a comprehensive investment package for farmers. </p>  <p>  Food companies have identified long term investment finance of up to ten years as a critical need which is currently unavailable in Ireland. I am pleased that the Government have been able to deliver this product and its effects will be felt all along the food production chain.</p>  <p>  Further details will be provided in the coming months.  The Scheme is expected to be in place in early 2019 and will run for three years from its launch date.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-10-16a.1215.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018101600078#WRZ03500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 535 and 546 together.</p><p>The majority of the existing network of publicly accessible charge points was rolled out by the ESB through its eCars programme. This network includes circa 80 fast chargers, mainly on national routes. A map showing the charge points, including the status and availability of the charge points, is available on the ESB's website at <i>www.esb.ie/ecars</i>. </p><p>The maintenance and repair of these charge points is an operational matter for the ESB. In relation to the out-of-service charge point in Killarney, the ESB has informed my Department that the manufacturer is due to come to Ireland in the coming weeks to visit the charge point. At this point it is expected that the issue will be resolved. I am also informed that the fast charge point in Tralee is located at a car dealership and not operated by the ESB.</p><p>The provision of charging infrastructure is a necessity for the uptake of electric vehicles. In this regard, last month's publication by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities of their approval of ESB Networks' proposal on the future operation and maintenance of the charging network is a welcome development. This ensures the continued operation and maintenance of the public charging network by the ESB and provides the certainty electric vehicle users need when purchasing an electric vehicle. </p><p>I understand that the ESB has commenced work to resolve the maintenance issues with the public charging network. This includes upgrades and, in the case of those with the highest reliability issues, replacement of public chargers. I am informed that it has replaced 15 standard chargers, constituting 30 charge points as well upgrading seven older fast chargers with newer chargers that can accommodate all three charging types that are in active use in Ireland. The ESB advises me that the uptime of the fleet of fast chargers is in excess of 98% which is very high by international standards.</p><p>A key aspect of the work of the Low Emission Vehicle Taskforce, co-chaired by my Department and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, involves examining how best to support the development of the public charging network. The first phase of the Taskforce's work, which focuses on electric vehicles, is nearing completion and will focus on an expanded range of supports for the provision of effective and efficient electric vehicle charging.</p><p>In this regard, my Department, in conjunction with the SEAI, is working on how best to support the provision of greater levels of on-street public charging.</p><p>It is also important to note the role of the Climate Action Fund. The first Call for Applications, which was launched in July, includes provision for supporting electric vehicle charging networks along with a range of other project types. The deadline for applications has now passed and I can confirm that 97 applications have been received. An assessment process of these applications is currently underway.</p></reply>

This included non-commercial state bodies, commercial state bodies (including Coillte and Bord na Mona) and Local Authorities.</p>  <p>  The launch of the call for applications was by way of a general press release with a reference to documentation on my Department's website.  All terms and conditions, including eligibility criteria, were included in that documentation. In addition, to the press release, the call for applications for the Climate Action Fund was displayed on the front page of my Department's website. The publication of the call for applications was also communicated  via email, including notifying the Departmental Energy Performance Officer in each Government department suggesting they relay it to the Energy Performance Officer in organisations in their group under the Public Sector Energy Efficiency Strategy.  The deadline for applications under the First Call for Applications was 1 October 2018 and I can confirm that 97 applications were received by this date.</p>  <p>  The Advisory Board that will oversee the assessment process is in the process of being established. A common template is being followed for the four funds and the Advisory Board will be chaired by my Department and will include representatives from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, and independent experts.</p>  <p>  Further information on the Climate Action Fund, including detail of the assessment process, is available on my Department&rsquo;s website. The assessment includes consideration of the contribution to Ireland's climate and energy targets, and wider Government policy priorities (which would encompass health benefits).</p>  <p>  Support provided under the first call for applications is subject to European Union state aid rules - specifically the terms and conditions of the General Block Exemption Regulation. There are likely to be projects (such as using peatlands to abate greenhouse gas emissions) that do not conform to the types of support provided for under the relevant state aid rules. </p>  <p>  My Department is therefore engaging with Bord na Mona to identify potential peatland projects that could be supported by the Climate Action Fund outside of the current call for applications process.</p></reply>

Following on from a public consultation in November 2017, the CRU published its decision in March 2018 on a revised set of grid connection rules, the Enduring Connection Policy Stage 1 (ECP-1).  ECP-1 constitutes the first step in revising the existing connection policy, allowing the first of a set of more regular batches of connection offers. As the system cannot, at present, accommodate all the projects seeking to connect, this decision first allows those &lsquo;shovel ready&rsquo; projects (i.e. with planning permission) to get a connection offer, ahead of less mature projects.  ECP 1 also prioritises connection of new, more flexible technologies able to provide specific system services currently required by the system operator and makes a number of other changes including a revised schedule of application fees.   </p>  <p>  On 31 August 2018 EirGrid and ESB Networks published the final list of applicants that meet the criteria to be processed as part of the first &lsquo;batch&rsquo; of offers under ECP 1. It is expected that any future changes to connection rules will be consulted on by the CRU before any decisions are made.</p></reply>

This was done to support the introduction of a new compliance scheme for tyres and waste tyres from 1 October 2017. The new full compliance scheme to deal with Ireland's chronic waste tyres problem, which is operated by Repak ELT with a registration and reporting role for the Producer Register Limited (PRL), is funded by a visible Environmental Management Cost (vEMC) on the sale of new tyres. The new compliance scheme provides the assurance to drivers and consumers that their old tyres will be disposed of responsibly by the retailer when they buy new tyres.</p>  <p>  At that time, the Minister also indicated that he would look at the issue of old tyres on farms and &euro;700,000 was recently allocated to remove tyres from farms. Irish Farm Film Producers Group (IFFPG), the national farm plastics recycling compliance scheme, agreed to undertake the removal of tyres from farms through 4 bring centres around the country. The collections, which were chosen because they represent a good geographical spread, began on Saturday 29th September at Cootehill Mart, Co. Cavan. Collections also took place in New Ross Mart, Co. Wexford on Tuesday 9th October and Athenry Mart, Co Galway on Saturday 13th October. The 4th bring centre collection will take place in Gort Drum Mines, Monard, Co. Tipperary on Saturday 20th October next.</p></reply>

The Better Energy Communities (BEC) Scheme funds community based partnerships to improve the energy efficiency of the building stock in their area. Upgrades can take place across building types to reduce energy use and costs, Partnerships can be between the public and private sectors, domestic and non-domestic sectors, commercial and not-for-profit organisations and energy suppliers, and leverage considerable additional private investment. The BEC supports renewable energy projects as well as energy efficiency projects.  In 2018, 37 projects have been approved funding totalling &euro;22m.</p><p>The Sustainable Energy Communities (SEC) Programme provides the first step for communities in learning how to develop local partnerships to manage and conserve their energy before they apply to the Better Energy Communities Scheme.  A SEC aims to be energy efficient, to use renewable energy where feasible and to develop decentralised energy supplies. The community can include all the different energy users in the area including; homes, sports clubs, community centres, churches and businesses. Over 200 community groups have signed up to the SEC network since it was launched in 2015 and are availing of technical support and mentoring from SEAI. In 2018, 17 Sustainable Energy Community projects have been offered grants totalling &euro;2.44million, to enable them to carry out smaller energy projects as identified in their Energy Master Plans.</p><p>Turning to offshore renewable energy there are a range of supports available to developers in bringing their devices from prototype to full scale commercial viability.  Exchequer support for ocean research, development and demonstration has been provided to the sector in recent years and was increased under the Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan (OREDP).  The Department&rsquo;s multi-annual ocean energy development budget was increased by &euro;21.3 million, covering the period 2013 to 2017, which brought the total cumulative funding to &euro;31.05 million.  This funding supports the development of the test facilities in counties Mayo, Galway and Cork, and the Prototype Development Fund (PDF). The PDF supports innovation by providing funding to offshore renewable energy development projects. </p><p>Since 2009, the Fund has supported 110 projects. 18 projects are currently being funded, with a further 6 being evaluated by SEAI and 10 that have already been completed in 2018. A further &euro;4.75 million has been allocated to Ocean Energy development in 2018. </p><p>Finally, the SEAI Research, Development &amp;amp; Demonstration Fund invests in innovative energy projects which contribute to Ireland's transition to a clean and secure energy future. The SEAI RD&amp;amp;D Funding Programme aims to: </p><p>- Accelerate the development and deployment in the Irish marketplace of competitive energy-related products, processes and systems </p><p>- Support solutions that enable technical and other barriers to market uptake to be overcome </p><p>- Grow Ireland's national capacity to access, develop and apply international class RD&amp;amp;D </p><p>- Provide guidance and support to policy makers and public bodies through results, outcomes and learning from supported energy projects.</p><p>The 2019 Call is expected to open for applications from late Q4 2018. Further details of the RD&amp;amp;D Programme can be found at:</p><p>In relation to renewable energy, the 2009 EU Renewable Energy Directive sets Ireland a target of meeting 16% of our energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020, and we have committed to achieve this  through meeting 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heat and 10% of transport from renewable sources of energy, with the latter target also being legally binding. </p><p>The most recent annual data from the SEAI indicates that 30.1% of electricity, 6.9% of heat and 7.2% of transport energy requirements were met from renewable sources at end 2017. Overall, SEAI analysis shows that 10.6% of Ireland&rsquo;s energy requirements in 2017 were met from renewable sources. </p><p>Electricity production from wind energy has increased to the point that it accounted for 84% of the renewable electricity generated in 2017. The following table sets out the contributions from the different renewable energy sources in 2017.<table><tr><th>Renewables Electricity %</th><th>2017</th></tr><tr><td>Hydro (normalised)</td><td>2.4</td></tr><tr><td>Wind (normalised)</td><td>25.2</td></tr><tr><td>Biomass</td><td>1.8</td></tr><tr><td>Landfill Gas</td><td>0.5</td></tr><tr><td>Biogas</td><td>0.1</td></tr><tr><td>Solar</td><td>0.04</td></tr><tr><td>Renewables Electricity (overall)</td><td>30.1</td></tr></table></p><p>Electricity generated from biomass accounted for 6% of renewable electricity in 2017. Provisional figures for 2018 up to the end of August show that wind generation has increased by 6.6% while overall electricity demand increased by 2.4%.  </p><p>The Government has adopted a range of policy measures and schemes to incentivise the use of renewable energy including the Renewable Energy Feed-In-Tariff (REFIT) schemes. In addition, the Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS), approved by Government in July, is designed to assist Ireland in meeting its renewable energy contributions out to 2030. It is expected that the first renewable electricity auctions will take place under the RESS in 2019.</p><p>The Support Scheme for Renewable Heat (SSRH) also launched this year, is open to all non-domestic heat users not operating in the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS). The purpose of the scheme is to reduce the use of fossil fuels within the heating sector.  </p><p>Turning finally to energy infrastructure, Ireland&rsquo;s statutory National Transmission System Operator (TSO), EirGrid, has a key role in planning for the development of renewable energy infrastructure and the electricity transmission system to meet the future needs of society. This involves detailed analysis of electricity demand, electricity supply, electricity storage and interconnection, and locations of electricity demand and supply. A process is currently underway to consider a range of possible ways that energy usage may change in the future, and a series of scenarios are  central to an extensive consultation that is being undertaken, covering four scenarios;  Steady Evolution, Low Carbon Living, Slow Change, and Consumer Action. Details of this process are contained within Eirgrid&rsquo;s Tomorrow&rsquo;s Energy Scenarios available at <i></i></p></reply>

Evaluation of the final tender submission is ongoing and will be allowed the time required.  On conclusion of the evaluation, my Department will make a recommendation to me on whether to appoint the bidder as preferred bidder and I will bring the matter to Government for decision.</p><p>Under a Commitment Agreement signed with my Department in April 2017, eir is in the process of passing 300,000 predominantly rural homes with high speed broadband. Approximately 175,000 of the committed premises have been passed as of Q2 2018.</p><p>For those premises currently awaiting access to high speed broadband, practical initiatives will continue to be addressed through the work of the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce to address obstacles and improve connectivity in respect of existing and future mobile phone and broadband services. </p><p>Under this Taskforce, engagement between telecommunications operators and local authorities through the Broadband Officers is continuing to strengthen.  These Broadband Officers are acting as single points of contact in local authorities for their communities.  The appointment of these officers is already reaping rewards in terms of ensuring a much greater degree of consistency in engagements with operators and clearing obstacles to developing infrastructure.

The creation of a NECP is one of the key provisions of the proposed Governance of the Energy Union Regulation, part of the European Clean Energy Package published in November 2016.  This is an overarching, consolidating regulation that will consolidate the existing patchwork of national energy and climate planning and reporting obligations.  The NECP will include trajectories for renewable energy (including renewable electricity), energy efficiency, and national emissions, as well as the measures required to achieve these trajectories.</p>  <p>  The Plan, which will cover all five dimensions of the Energy Union, will contain the policies and measures proposed to reach our 2030 energy and climate goals, and will be based on a common EU template to allow for comparability.  The first draft is due for submission to the European Commission by 31 December 2018, with the final version due by 31 December 2019. Energy and Climate Change modelling work to look at energy and climate policy options out to 2030 has already started under the auspices of the Technical Research and Modelling (TRAM) Group.  The outcomes of this modelling work will underpin the development of the draft NECP, in particular on identifying cost effective, yet realistic solutions that will contribute to compliance with our binding 2021-2030 national greenhouse gas emissions target and underpin the development of our renewable energy and energy efficiency ambitions.</p>  <p>  The high level design of the new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) was approved by Government in July 2018 and it is expected that the first renewable electricity auctions will take place under RESS in 2019.  The RESS has been designed to deliver Ireland&rsquo;s contribution towards an EU-wide renewable energy target of 32% out to 2030, within a competitive auction-based, cost effective framework.  The scheme will provide for a renewable electricity (RES-E) ambition of up to a maximum of 55% by 2030 subject to determining the cost effective level which will be set out in Ireland's first draft National Energy and Climate Plan.</p></reply>

The Manual sets out design guidance and standards for constructing new and reconfiguring existing urban roads and streets in Ireland. It aims to end the practice of designing streets as traffic corridors and instead focuses on the needs of pedestrians, cyclists and public transport users. DMURS emphasises the role of streets as social spaces, where people come first and uses practical examples from Irish cities and towns to show how these issues can be designed for and managed successfully. Among other things, the Manual acknowledges issues that can arise for impaired users, in particular visually impaired users, where shared spaces are involved and suggests some remedial measures in that regard.</p>  <p>  Supplementary material is currently being prepared for inclusion in the Manual towards providing additional clarity. The National Disability Authority has been consulted in the matter and has advocated a universal design approach for incorporation therein including for shared spaces. It is intended to publish the supplementary material early next year.  Further updates to the Manual will occur from time to time.</p></reply>

The aim is to have Greenways that have community support, minimise the impact on landowners, particularly those whose businesses would be affected, and that provide access to scenery and things to see and do for Greenway users. Where the use of private land is necessary it is incumbent on project promoters to engage with stakeholders as early as possible in the process, engage agronomists to ascertain the impact on farming of the proposed route corridor, avoid severance as far as possible and to make all attempts to achieve agreement on routes.</p></reply>

This is on an ex-gratia basis as a temporary measure to address immediate individual cases while the overall indemnification issues are being resolved.</p>  <p>  As I have stated previously, I fully support extending the State Indemnity Scheme under the State Claims Agency to foster parents.  Unfortunately, this has taken longer than expected due to technical issues associated with the approvals and statutory process involved, but I can assure the Deputy that work is continuing to address these matters. My Department has been in discussion with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the matter, and my intention is to include foster carers under the General Indemnity Scheme operated by the State Claims Agency as soon as possible. In this regard, work is ongoing with the Office of Parliamentary Counsel to draft the necessary Order for Government.</p>  <p>  My Department has written to the Irish Foster Carers Association (IFCA) outlining the position and, through the Association, foster carers have been informed as to the current position. IFCA have been kept up to date on a continuous basis. In addition, I understand that Tusla has also made publicly available the information provided to IFCA so as to communicate the position to those foster carers who are not members of that association.</p></reply>

ECI represents 3,800 childcare members, who support over 100,000 children and their families through preschool, after-school, and full day-care provision nationwide. They provide a broad range of training, mentoring, information and advocacy supports to better shape the systems, policies and practices that impact on the lives of young children.</p>  <p>  ECI is one of seven National Voluntary Childcare Organisations (NVCOs) formerly funded under the Quality Sub Measure of the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 (EOCP) and the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 and continue to receive annual exchequer funding.</p>  <p>  In 2018, ECI received funding of &euro;1,190,000 from my Department. This funding remains unchanged from both 2017 and 2016. This funding is provided to ECI:</p>  <p>1. To support the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in the delivery of the national childcare programmes;</p>  <p>2. To provide support to all childcare service providers (community, private, childminders, parent and toddler groups, after-schools) in accordance with all statutory regulations, national policy and quality standards;</p>  <p>3.

These included raising the level of childcare subsidy available for families that need it most by up to 50% (from a maximum of &euro;95 to &euro;145 per week for children up to the age of fifteen). I also introduced a brand new universal subsidy of up to &euro;1,040 per annum for children under three in registered childcare. Over the past year these measures have reached the families of more than 84,000 children.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2019, rather than adjusting the existing schemes, which will continue to be available until the Affordable Childcare Scheme is in place, I announced changes to the income thresholds that will operate as part of the Affordable Childcare Scheme when it is introduced later next year.</p>  <p>  Under the scheme&rsquo;s original policy proposals, income-based subsidies would have been available to all families with a net annual income of up to &euro;47,500.  This threshold will now increase by 26% to cover all families with a net annual income of up to &euro;60,000.  The scheme&rsquo;s lower income thresholds have also been adjusted, meaning that maximum subsidy rates will now be paid to all families with a net annual income of up to &euro;26,000 (the previous proposed threshold stood at &euro;22,700).  These increased thresholds will mean that thousands more families will benefit from the new Affordable Childcare Scheme once launched at the end of 2019 and will see their childcare costs tangibly reduce.</p>  <p>  It is my view that making these changes is a more progressive use of available resources than merely adjusting the universal element of the scheme. Because of these changes, an estimated additional 8,000 children will be eligible for the scheme for the first time. Another 8,000 will move from a universal subsidy to a higher targeted subsidy. 44,000 other children will continue to access a subsidy, 34,000 of whom will see increases to their subsidies.</p>  <p>  The new measures ensure that families with, in some cases, a gross income of &euro;100,000 will benefit from subsidies.</p>  <p>  The increase in the lower net income threshold to &euro;26,000 from &euro;22,700 is important in terms of benefitting people at the lower end of the income spectrum. The measure &lsquo;poverty proofs&rsquo; the scheme by ensuring that families at, or below, the relative income poverty line will benefit from the very highest subsidy rates under the scheme.</p>  <p>  For those above the net income threshold of &euro;60,000, but with a child under 3 in regulated childcare, the scheme will continue to make up to &euro;1,040 per annum available.</p></reply>

Tusla's priority is to achieve the best outcomes for victims of domestic violence from the use of its available resources.</p>  <p>  Tusla recognises that the provision of emergency refuge accommodation for victims of domestic violence is a core element of the response to domestic violence. While there is no domestic violence refuge located in the D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown area, there are currently four units of emergency Safe Home accommodation provided in the area, which are supported by Tusla. Safe Homes provide services to those affected by domestic violence that may require lower levels of support. Safe Home accommodation comprises independent housing units with additional safety measures, where victims and families receive intensive support to achieve long term safety and well-being.</p>  <p>  Victims of domestic violence and their children can also access emergency refuge accommodation in refuges across Dublin or in adjacent areas.</p></reply>

It provided up to 85% of the total cost of a vehicle/fit out up to a maximum of &euro;50,000 for a wheelchair accessible vehicle or &euro;100,000 for a bus. </p>  <p>  The closing date for applications from qualifying voluntary organisations was 31st August.  In the normal course, CL&Aacute;R eligibility is based on facilities being physically located within a designated CL&Aacute;R DED.  Given the need to travel considerable distances, in some cases, to hospitals and other specialist facilities located in non CL&Aacute;R areas, eligibility in this instance was based on the 'catchment area' being served by the vehicles i.e., that at least 80% of the vehicle's need is attributable to CL&Aacute;R areas. </p>  <p>  I intend carrying out a full review of qualifying CL&Aacute;R areas later this year on the basis of the 2016 Census data.  The level of depopulation will continue to be a primary factor in the designation of any area as a CL&Aacute;R area.  The review will involve a detailed examination of all areas of the country, as well as stakeholder consultation. </p>  <p>  The findings of the review will inform future launches of the CL&Aacute;R programme into 2019 and beyond.</p></reply>

Self-employed persons, who earn &euro;5,000 or more in a contribution year, are liable for PRSI at the Class S rate of 4%, subject to a minimum annual payment of &euro;500.  The payment of Class S contributions entitles self-employed workers to a range of benefits including State pension (contributory).</p>  <p>  The regulations governing the award of Class S social insurance prescribe that where a self-employed person is assessed as being liable for a compulsory insurance charge, the person is granted a full annual complement of 52 &lsquo;Class-S&rsquo; contributions for that tax year once the liability is discharged (irrespective of whether their self-employment was pursued throughout the year, or if it was just for a portion of the year).  Therefore, in a self-employed person&rsquo;s initial year of assessment of having an insurance liability, on payment of the due amount, the person will be recorded as having paid 52 weekly contributions for that year.</p>  <p>  Where the self-employed discharge their combined Income Tax, USC and PRSI liability through Revenue&rsquo;s self-assessed system of collection, a single payment is made in respect of their combined liability for all complete tax years up to and including the year in which the self-employed worker reaches their 65th year. </p>  <p>  Such additional (66th year) S Class contributions may be used, where necessary, to satisfy the &lsquo;minimum 520 paid contributions&rsquo; condition for State pension (contributory) eligibility, but cannot be used in the yearly-averaging assessment of pension rate entitlement, for which the cut-off point in totalling contributions is the end date of the immediately preceding (full) tax year.  This is exactly the same &lsquo;66th year&rsquo; approach that is facilitated in the case of standard employees (rather than self-employed) who may require some additional contributions to satisfy the &ldquo;520 contribution&rdquo; condition.</p>  <p>  I hope this information is helpful to the Deputy. </p></reply>

This scheme aims to enhance the employability and mobility of disadvantaged and unemployed persons by providing work experience and training opportunities for them within their communities.  In addition, it helps long-term unemployed people to re-enter the active workforce by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to a regular work routine.</p>  <p>  Working Family Payment (WFP) provides an income support for employees on low earnings with families.  This is a weekly tax-free payment for families, including one-parent families, at work on low pay.</p>  <p>  In general a person must be engaged in full-time remunerative employment as an employee, have at least one qualified child, who normally resides with them or is part of a family wholly or mainly supported by them and the weekly family Income is less than a set limit for their family size.</p>  <p>  A person on a Work Scheme such as CE is not considered to be in full-time employment and is therefore excluded from claiming WFP while participating on the programme.</p></reply>

This change is part of a programme of modernisation in the Department which is aimed at improving the certification process and at making claim and payment procedures more efficient for everyone involved &ndash; GPs, patients and the Department. </p>  <p>  The Department has a contract with GPs on the DEASP panel in respect of medical certification for Illness and Injury Benefit and we wrote to just under 3,500 contracting GPs in July setting out the changes. We will continue to communicate with all panel holders as the new process beds in. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Department consulted with the Irish Medical Organisation (IMO) - a longstanding representative body with a broad range of GPs in its membership.  The Department will continue to consult with the IMO under the Framework Agreement on a range of issues, including e-certification, closed certification and changes to forms.  </p>  <p>  The IMO is the representative GP body which is affiliated with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and has been for many years. The Department will continue to hold substantive discussions with the IMO and I would hope they will conclude over the coming weeks.  </p>  <p>  The Department wants to reassure all customers that they will be paid the correct amount of Illness Benefit up to the end of their certified illness, as certified by their GP.  No customer will lose out on their payments.  Any customer with an urgent financial need can apply to the Department's Community Welfare Service to receive an interim payment.

I expect that this research, when complete, will provide a roadmap to inform policy direction in the future &ndash; from a whole-of-Government perspective &ndash; in relation to the adequate provision of support to meet the needs of people with disabilities. The Government recognises that those with a disability face additional financial costs. This research will help us to quantify those costs and start to provide for them in future Budgets.</p>  <p>  There are considerable issues to be addressed in both defining and measuring the cost of disability.  These include defining the scope of the research, deciding on the best approach and engaging in any procurement work.  It is my intention to engage with other relevant Departments to address this before procuring independent external research.  I have asked my officials to consider and assess the scope, governance and potential timelines for this research.    </p></reply>

The objective of the scheme is to provide regular, nutritious food to children who are unable, due to lack of good quality food, to take full advantage of the education provided to them.  The programme is an important component of policies to encourage school attendance and extra educational achievement.</p>  <p>  Budget 2019 announced a further extension to  the scheme and additional funding of &euro;1m for 2019. The additional funding is to provide a hot school meals pilot programme to commence in the 2019/2020 academic year.</p>  <p>  Research shows us the value of the provision of adequate and nutritious meals for a child&rsquo;s health, learning, attention and educational achievement.  That is why I am providing funds to establish a pilot programme for a hot meals scheme in DEIS schools.  Hot dinners will be provided on a pilot basis in up to some 7,200 children.  If successful, I would hope to work with the Department of Education and Skills (DES) in extending the scheme on a much wider basis in future years and establish the scheme on a permanent basis.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department will now engage with officials in DES to identify suitable DEIS schools for the pilot and thereafter a consultation with the schools involved will begin.</p></reply>

This Action Plan provides a comprehensive framework for addressing the range of complex issues which need to be addressed across the housing sector.  The Plan is underpinned by over &euro;6 billion in funding to support the delivery of 50,000 new social housing homes and 87,000 other housing supports over the 6 years 2016 to 2021.</p><p>Significant progress has been made in 2016 and 2017, in partnership with local authorities, Approved Housing Bodies and a range of other delivery partners, with over 45,000 individuals and families having their housing needs met during those 2 years, and a further 25,500 households expected to be supported this year. The level of progress being made is reflected in social housing waiting lists, which have reduced by 22%, from 91,600 households to 71,858, between 2016 and 2018. </p><p>The Government has made tackling homelessness a key priority under Rebuilding Ireland and while the numbers experiencing homelessness continue to increase and additional measures are required to address emergency accommodation needs, records levels of individuals and families are being supported out of homelessness. 4,729 adults exited homelessness into independent tenancies in 2017 and a further 2,332 in the first half of 2018. A Homeless HAP Place finder service has been made available nationally to support households experiencing homelessness to identify and secure independent tenancies and family hubs have also been introduced to provide more appropriate emergency accommodation to better cater for the needs of families and now provide accommodation for over 500 families. </p><p>The number of rough sleepers recorded in April 2018 had reduced by 40%, following the delivery of over 300 additional emergency beds, and a further 150 emergency beds are to be delivered by end-2018. The recent launch of the first national Housing First Strategy provides a strong framework for homeless individuals with the most complex needs to move into independent supported living.  </p><p>The recent establishment of the new Land Development Agency under Project Ireland 2040 demonstrates the whole-of-Government response needed to maximise the value and use of lands in public control and to drive a more active land management role by the State. This new Agency will be crucial in supporting the delivery of affordable homes on public lands, through the new affordability requirement whereby a minimum of 30% of all publicly owned lands will be reserved for affordable housing purposes, building on the work that local authorities are initiating to deliver affordable housing on their lands, supported by the &euro;310m Serviced Sites Fund. </p><p>New planning guidelines have also been introduced to support increased and more varied delivery of apartments in our main urban centres, where rental pressures are strongest, and a range of measures have been introduced to provide better protections for both tenants and landlords in the rental sector, including longer notice periods and the introduction of an annual limit of 4% on rent increases in areas designated as Rent Pressure Zones. Further measures will be brought forward shortly in new legislation to strengthen the role of the Residential Tenancies Board in enforcing the RPZ provisions, as part of a wider multi-annual change management programme to more proactively enforce tenancy law and have the RTB assume more the role of a regulator within the rental sector.</p><p>Recent Central Bank statistics on mortgage arrears show that the level of arrears is declining. There remains, however, a significant number of borrowers in long-term mortgage distress. The Government is committed to building on recent reforms and creating a framework that removes fear and brings predictability to a difficult process.  Through a range of actions, Government Departments and Agencies are working together to find ways to encourage those who have not been able to engage, to reach a suitable long-term debt resolution, and avoid repossession if possible.</p><p>Progress is also being made under the following services in relation to Mortgage Arrears:</p><p>- Take up of the Abhaile service has been high, with 13,342 vouchers for consultations issued between the start of the scheme in July 2016 to 3 September 2018;</p><p>- The Insolvency Service of Ireland (ISI) has returned over 6,000 debtors to solvency with over 2,000 of those cases being Personal Insolvency Arrangements (PIAs), which deal with mortgage debt; and</p><p>- At the end of August, 380 families had been supported to remain in their home through the Mortgage to Rent scheme and 845 further cases  were being actively progressed. </p><p>In relation to the wider housing sector, the measures undertaken under Rebuilding Ireland are underpinning a strong increase in activity, with planning permissions for 26,752 homes granted in the year to end-June 2018, up 39%; commencement notices submitted for almost 19,500 new homes in the year to end-July, up 17%; and 19,650 new homes becoming available for use in the year to end June 2018, up 24%. </p><p>The most recent Rebuilding Ireland detailed Action Status report is available on the Rebuilding Ireland website at the following link:</p><p><i>.</i></p></reply>

The NPPR charge, which has since been discontinued, applied in the years 2009 to 2013 to any residential property in which the owner did not reside as their normal place of residence. The self-assessed charge is set at &euro;200 per annum. It is a matter for an owner to determine if he or she has a liability and, if so, to declare that liability and pay the charge and any late payment fees applicable. Under the Act, it is a function of a local authority to collect Non-Principal Private Residence charges and late payment fees due to it and all charges and late payment fees imposed and payable to a local authority are under the care and management of the local authority concerned.</p>  <p>  My Department has no role in relation to the collection or the enforcement of the charge. The data requested in relation to the number of persons who have paid the maximum amount of late payment fees imposed under the charge is therefore not available in my Department.

The amount of rates payable in any calendar year is a product of the valuation set by the Commissioner of Valuation, multiplied by the Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV) decided annually by the elected members of each local authority. </p>  <p>  Local authorities are under a statutory obligation to levy rates on any property used for commercial purposes in accordance with the details entered in the valuation lists prepared by the independent Commissioner of Valuation under the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015. The Valuation Acts provide that all buildings used or developed for any purpose, including constructions affixed thereto, are rateable unless expressly exempted under Schedule 4 of the Act. The matter of rateability of casual markets on private and/or public properties falls, in the first instance, to be determined by the rateability or otherwise of the properties on which the particular activity is conducted. If the property in question is liable to rates in its own right, the matter of holding casual markets thereon would not change that rateability. However, if the property is exempt from rates under Schedule 4 of the Act (which would include many public properties), it would be a matter of whether or not the holding of one or more casual markets thereon would constitute &ldquo;rateable occupation&rdquo;. This would be a matter of law and fact, depending on the nature, extent and frequency of the arrangements between the parties.</p>  <p>  The Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the performance of his functions under the Acts and the making of valuations for rating is his sole responsibility. I have no function in decisions made in this regard. The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority.</p></reply>

The Exchequer contribution is &euro;275 million with &euro;35 million to be contributed by local authorities. In 2019 funding of &euro;100 million will be available under the Fund with a further &euro;142 million in 2020 and &euro;68 million in 2021. The funding is available for key facilitating infrastructure, on local authority sites, to support the provision of affordable homes to purchase or rent.</p>  <p>  A first call for proposals, under the SSF, issued to local authorities in Dublin; the Greater Dublin Area; Cork City and County; and Galway City. 15 proposals were received from 9 local authorities. These are currently being assessed and I expect this process to be finalised and an announcement of the first successful bids to be made in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  I envisage a maximum amount of SSF funding of &euro;50,000 per affordable home. On the basis of this infrastructure investment, I expect that some 6,200 affordable homes could be facilitated in this way.</p>  <p>  In preparing their bids for funding, local authorities were advised to be guided by the Unit Cost Ceilings (UCCs) for social housing in determining the cost of the affordable homes to be delivered under this programme. These UCCs are based on the analysis of returned data from tendered social housing schemes over an extended period, and market tender index information. Construction cost is reflective of building costs (including VAT) and also includes normal site works and site development. All-in cost includes cost of construction, land cost, professional fees, utility connections, site investigations/surveys, archaeology where appropriate, VAT and contribution to public art. Abnormal costs are excluded from these figures.  The relevant UCC data were set out in the reply to Question No 2670 of 24 July 2018.</p>  <p>  Moreover, an important factor in the assessment of bids will be the capacity to translate the secured infrastructure funding into a discount on the affordable homes. In addition, local authorities must consider the market price of similar homes on sale in the equivalent private market and the level of discount on market price envisaged, which will be required under the Affordable Purchase Scheme terms.</p>  <p>  The objective is to maximise the benefits from public money by funding the best value for money proposals possible.</p></reply>

The pyrite remediation scheme is a scheme of &ldquo;last resort&rdquo; for affected homeowners who have no other practical option to obtain redress and is limited in its application and scope. The full conditions for eligibility under the scheme are set out in the scheme which is available on the Board&rsquo;s website, www.pyriteboard.ie. </p>  <p>  The scheme is applicable to dwellings which are subject to significant damage attributable to pyritic heave established in accordance with I.S. 398-1:2017 - Reactive pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material &ndash; Part 1: Testing and categorisation protocol.  In this regard, it is a condition of eligibility under the scheme that an application to the Board must be accompanied by a Building Condition Assessment with a Damage Condition Rating of 2.  Dwellings which do not have a Damage Condition Rating of 2 are not eligible to apply under the scheme.  This ensures that, having regard to the available resources, the focus of the scheme is on dwellings which are most severely damaged by pyritic heave.  I have no proposals to amend this eligibility criterion.</p>  <p>  Where a dwelling, otherwise not eligible for inclusion in the scheme, adjoins a dwelling already included in the scheme, such a dwelling may be considered in accordance with the exceptional circumstance provisions set out in section 17 of the Act. Section 17 provides that exceptional circumstances may apply where -</p>  <p>  - failure to include a dwelling in the scheme may result in damage to that dwelling or damage to the dwelling being remediated under the scheme, or</p>  <p>  - pyrite remediation work is causing or may cause damage to a dwelling.</p>  <p>  The Housing Agency will consider if exceptional circumstances apply when the Remedial Works Plan is being drawn up and the Board will be informed of any recommendation for a decision in the matter.  To date, one dwelling has been included in the pyrite remediation scheme under the exceptional circumstances provisions of the Act. My Department is in regular contact with the Board and the Housing Agency in relation to the implementation of the scheme and is satisfied with the arrangements that are currently in place, including in relation to appeals.</p>  <p>  The Report of the Pyrite Panel (June 2012) recommended a categorisation system as a means of prioritising pyrite remediation works in recognition of the expensive and intrusive nature of pyrite remediation and the unpredictability of pyritic heave. The independent Pyrite Panel was clear in its view that only dwellings with significant damage due to pyritic heave should be remediated and that it would be unreasonable to expect dwellings not exhibiting such damage to be remediated. </p>  <p>  Dwellings which have no significant damage but have reactive pyrite in the hardcore material should be monitored and only remediated if they display significant damage due to pyritic heave. This remains the position with regard to dwellings which do not display significant pyritic damage. </p>  <p>  The latest figures available indicate that a total of 2,179 applications have been received under the pyrite remediation scheme.  Of the 2,179 applications received so far, 1,727 dwellings have been included in the pyrite remediation scheme and the applicants notified accordingly.</p>  <p>  A further 105 applications have been validated and referred to the Housing Agency for the Assessment and Verification Process, while another 214 applications are at the initial Application and Validation Process. 133 applications under the scheme were not successful.</p>  <p>  Of the 1,727 dwellings that have been included in the pyrite remediation scheme:</p>  <p>  - 136 are at remedial works planning stage, </p>  <p>  - 106 are at tender / tender analysis,</p>  <p>  - 248 are under remediation, and  </p>  <p>  - 1,237 are complete.</p>  <p>  A sum of &euro;30 million was announced under Budget 2018 to fund the operation of the pyrite remediation scheme this year. This allocation will facilitate the remediation of some 430 additional dwellings in 2018.</p>  <p>   A sum of &euro;32 million was announced under Budget 2019 to fund the operation of the pyrite remediation scheme next year. This allocation will facilitate the remediation of some 460 additional dwellings and is a clear signal of the continuing importance attached by Government to addressing the issue of significant pyritic damage in private dwellings.</p></reply>

As a long term housing support, an assessment of housing need must be completed in order for a household to qualify for HAP. Any household with an identified housing need is eligible for HAP.   </p>  <p>  In order for a housing authority to be satisfied that a tenancy is or would be in good faith; the onus is on the applicant and landlord to prove that what is being proposed is a bona fide tenancy.  Ultimately, it is up to the local authority to make a decision in each individual case. I do not consider it appropriate to introduce HAP payments for family members to be housed in the family home.</p>  <p>  HAP support is available to tenants in rent a room scheme arrangements; however, the rental of a room to a civil partner, son or daughter are excluded from this scheme.  </p>  <p>  Budget 2018 increased the Exchequer funding for the HAP scheme to &euro;301 million. This will allow for the continued support of existing HAP households and also enable the additional 17,000 households targeted under Rebuilding Ireland to be supported by HAP in 2018. A further &euro;121m for HAP has been announced under Budget 2019. This will provide for the continued support of existing HAP households and also enable the additional 16,760 households targeted under Rebuilding Ireland to be supported by HAP in 2019, as well as supporting the roll-out of the Homeless HAP Place Finder Support Service across the country. </p>  <p>  At the end of Quarter 2, 2018 over 37,750 tenancies were being supported by the HAP scheme. I continue to keep the operation of HAP under review but I am currently satisfied with how the scheme is operating. I consider it to be a key vehicle for meeting current housing need and fulfilling the ambitious programme set out in Rebuilding Ireland. </p></reply>

The purpose of the Voids Programme is to ensure that vacant units are actively targeted, with a view to minimising the turnaround and re-let time of these units and return them to use in an energy efficient condition. Without substantial refurbishment, these social homes would have been left vacant and in turn would not be part of the active social housing stock.  </p><p>Section 58 of the Housing Act 1966, provides that the management and maintenance of local authority housing stock, including the implementation of planned maintenance programmes and carrying out of responsive repairs and pre-letting repairs, is a matter for each individual local authority. </p><p>Earlier this year, local authorities, including Limerick City and County Council, submitted to my Department details of their work proposals and related funding requirements for this programme in 2018.

The Government has committed &euro;310 million to support this programme of work, under the Serviced Sites Fund (SSF), as part of Budget 2019. The Exchequer contribution is &euro;275 million with &euro;35 million to be contributed by local authorities. In 2019 funding of &euro;100 million will be available under the Fund with a further &euro;142 million in 2020 and &euro;68 million in 2021. The funding is available for key facilitating infrastructure, on local authority sites, to support the provision of affordable homes to purchase or rent.</p>  <p>  A first call for proposals, under the SSF, issued to local authorities in Dublin; the Greater Dublin Area; Cork and Galway on 29 June 2018. The closing date for applications was 31 August and 15 proposals were received from 9 local authorities. These are currently being assessed and I expect this process to be finalised and an announcement of the first successful bids to be made in the coming weeks.  Further calls for proposals will be made thereafter.</p>  <p>  Once the funding is awarded and the infrastructure is provided I expect delivery of affordable homes from 2019 onwards. Separately, all local authorities will now carry out an economic assessment of the requirement for affordable housing in their area, and the authorities capacity to deliver housing at affordable prices from their sites. Based on this analysis further local authorities may be considered for funding under the SSF.</p>  <p>  I envisage a maximum amount of SSF funding of &euro;50,000 per affordable home and on this basis some 6,200 affordable homes could be facilitated. </p>  <p>  In terms of the type of affordable housing that will be delivered on local authority sites it may be affordable housing for purchase, under the recently commenced provisions of Part V of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, or cost rental, which is being advanced on a number of pilot sites before being rolled out more generally. Under the 2009 Act, the maximum discount is 40% of the market value of the home and the local authority takes a charge, equivalent to the discount, against the property. The scheme applies to new homes, and is targeted at single applicants earning up to &euro;50,000 per annum or &euro;75,000 for dual applicants.</p>  <p>  This new scheme replaces the time-limited claw-back which applied under the various previous affordable housing schemes.  The local authority will retain a charge equivalent to the discount and the household must recoup the charge at re-sale or during the charge period. The funding repaid by the purchaser is paid into a new Affordable Dwellings Fund which can then be used to fund more affordable housing.</p></reply>

Where the Board does not consider it possible or appropriate to reach a decision within 18 weeks (e.g. because of the particular complexities of a case or the requirement to hold an oral hearing), it will inform the parties of the reasons for this, and will indicate when it intends to make its decision. </p>  <p>  The compliance rate with the statutory objective period has been reduced over the past year due to a number of factors. Firstly, there was a reduction in Board capacity in mid-2017, arising from a time interval between the departure of five outgoing Board members, whose terms of office had expired in April and May, and the five new replacement Board members taking up their posts.  While, by September 2017, the Board complement had been fully replenished, this time interval significantly impacted on the Board&rsquo;s case work output over the whole year.</p>  <p>  In addition, An Bord Plean&aacute;la is also implementing a major ICT strategy which will facilitate the introduction of on-line planning services as part of a complete upgrade and replacement of core systems.  In this regard, a new case management system was installed and became operational in Q4 2017.  As is to be expected with such a fundamental and integrated project, the transition to the new system has caused some initial disruption to the processing of cases, resulting in a further increase in the backlog of cases on hand. However, measures have been put in place to ensure that the new system is bedded down and becomes operational at an optimal level as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  Furthermore there has been a general increase in cases received by the Board.  For example, there was an increase of almost 12% on normal planning appeals received in 2017 compared to 2016; this upward trend has continued into 2018. The intake of normal planning appeals in the eight months to end-August 2018 was 11% greater than the intake over the corresponding period to end-August 2017.</p>  <p>  Now that the Board's full complement has been restored, combined with the measures that are being put in place in relation to the new ICT systems, it is expected that the backlog of cases will begin to reduce over the coming months, with an associated improvement in the compliance rate with the statutory objective period for the determination of cases.</p>  <p>  My Department liaises closely with the Board to ensure that it has appropriate resources in relation to the performance of its functions. In mid 2017, the Board acquired additional functions in determining planning applications for strategic housing developments.  A new Strategic Housing Division of the Board was established to decide on these applications, involving the recruitment of an additional dedicated 10 professional and administrative staff members in 2017.  Two additional Board members have also been sanctioned to serve this Division, with the appointments being made in February and June this year.  </p>  <p>  The Board now has a complement of 10 members and has over 150 staff employed.  I am satisfied that the Board has sufficient and necessary resources to deliver effectively and efficiently on its important statutory mandate and functions.</p></reply>

The cost of the schemes in future years is therefore dependent on the number of new social housing homes and tenancies falling to be funded within each of the schemes and the rental or lease payments involved.</p><p>The Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP) is a funding programme that supports the delivery of social housing by providing financial support to local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) for the long term leasing of houses and apartments from private owners and developers. </p><p>The SHCEP budget funds the ongoing current costs of homes delivered using a variety of different delivery mechanisms, including properties built or acquired by AHBs using funding under the Capital Advance Leasing Facility (CALF) and leased to local authorities; properties leased on a longterm basis from private property owners by AHBs or local authorities, including properties secured through specific programmes such as the Repair and Leasing Scheme (RLS) and the Enhanced Leasing Scheme. Therefore, SHCEP is a complementary funding stream to a range of capital expenditure programmes like RLS, CALF and the Mortgage to Rent Scheme.</p><p>The 2019 budgetary provision for the SHCEP is &euro;155 million which represents an increase of &euro;40 million on the 2018 provision. This is expected to fund the ongoing cost of the existing social housing homes secured with support of the Programme at the end of 2018 which will amount to almost 14,000. In addition, over 4,800 new social housing homes, targeted for delivery across the build, acquisitions and leasing streams in 2019 are to be funded under the Programme.</p><p>The breakdown of the new social housing homes, by delivery stream, to be funded by SHCEP 2019 is set out in the following table.<table><tr><th>Delivery Type </th><th>2019   (Target)</th></tr><tr><td>Build</td><td>1,988</td></tr><tr><td>Acquisition</td><td>700 </td></tr><tr><td>Leasing</td><td>2,130 </td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>4,818 </td></tr></table></p><p>The Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) introduced in 2005 placed responsibility on local authorities to meet the accommodation needs of people in receipt of Rent Supplement for 18 months or longer, and who are assessed as having a long-term housing need. RAS has provided a more structured, accommodation-based approach to the use of the private rented sector to meet long-term housing need, thereby eliminating dependence on temporary income support payments through Rent Supplement.</p><p>&euro;134.3 million is being provided to support RAS in 2019, and this funding will go towards supporting 600 additional RAS tenancies targeted to be achieved by local authorities in 2019, and the ongoing cost of supporting approximately 19,200 continuing RAS contracts expected to be in place at the end of 2018.</p><p>Funding of &euro;422m is being made available for HAP under Budget 2019. This will provide for the continued support of existing HAP households and also enable the additional 16,760 households targeted under Rebuilding Ireland to be supported by HAP in 2019, as well as supporting the roll-out of the Homeless HAP Place Finder Support Service across the country. </p><p>The Homeless HAP Place Finder Service is now available to each of the 31 local authorities, with the options to pay deposits and advance rental payments for any households in emergency homeless accommodation, in order to secure accommodation via the HAP Scheme.</p></reply>

For the purpose of the Act, &lsquo;area&rsquo; is defined as either the administrative area of a housing authority or a local electoral area within the meaning of section 2 of the Local Government Act 2001.

This review was announced in April 2015 and an Open Policy Seminar on Building Control was hosted later that month. Written submissions were invited by May 2015. The scope and objectives of the review were: </p><p>(a)  To review the operation of the Regulations in consultation with industry and local authority stakeholders and members of the public;</p><p>(b)  To consider in particular the impact of the Regulations on single dwellings and extensions to existing dwellings having regard to specific concerns which have been raised in relation to the cost burden of the regulations and the level of certification required for this sector;</p><p>(c)  To consider more generally the impact of the Regulations on owners, occupiers and users of buildings having regard to the statutory purposes for which building regulations may be made (i.e. public safety, accessibility, energy efficiency, efficient use of resources and good building practice);</p><p>(d)  To make recommendations that will strengthen and improve the arrangements in place for the control of building activity in keeping with the principles of good and fair administration; and</p><p>(e)  To report with recommendations to the Minister as soon as possible, but in any event no later than 30 June 2015. </p><p>The final Report on the Building Control Regulations Review 2015 is available on my Department's website at the following link: .</p><p>A key outcome of this review was the introduction of amending regulations which contain a provision for a single dwelling or single unit development to opt out of statutory certification.</p><p>On 13 June 2017, the report of the Expert Panel on Concrete Blocks was published and included eight recommendations, which my Department is advancing.  The Panel expressed the view that the introduction of the opt out for new single dwellings, on a single development, as provided for in the Building Control (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 2015, was a retrograde step that may contribute to further building failures such as those experienced in counties Donegal and Mayo. The Panel recommended that the opt-out facility under the 2015 Regulations should be reviewed with a view to removing that provision. My Department will be undertaking this review shortly.</p></reply>

The care, maintenance and presentation of national monuments in State care is undertaken by the Office of Public Works in consultation and with the advice of the Department&rsquo;s National Monuments Service. Such monuments already number some one thousand sites at over 760 locations around the country and they require very considerable resource commitments both in terms of funding and personnel.  Any proposals for further acquisitions must therefore be carefully considered against that background and in the context of the immediate capital cost of the acquisition.</p>  <p>  The site referred to in this case contains a national monument that is already in my ownership, as Minister, and which is managed in all respects by the Office of Public Works. It benefits from the full protections of the National Monuments Acts 1930-2014 as do a number of other recorded monuments on the property. </p>  <p>  My Department's examination of the case will be concluded as quickly as possible and I will ensure that the Deputy is informed of the outcome as soon as any decision is made.</p></reply>

The Council's Strategy document entitled Making Great Art Work, which is being delivered through its Three-Year Plan 2017-2019, sets out its response to the changing nature of artistic practice and engagement with the arts including artists' support which is a defined category under its strategic investment plan.  The Arts Council provides a range of schemes and initiatives for the development of young artists including the Next Generation artists award which aims to support promising artists across all disciplines at an early but pivotal stage in their career.  Recipients can receive &euro;20,000 and take part in a collective week-long residential programme in spring 2018.  The Arts Council also funds bursary awards to artists.  Bursaries support professional artists to develop their art practice and provide them with the time and resources to think, research, reflect and critically engage with their art.</p>  <p>  In addition to this support my Department is leading the Creative Ireland Programme which is a cross-Government culture based programme designed to promote individual, community and national wellbeing.  Participation and citizen engagement in creative activity is at the heart of the Programme.  My Department provides funding of &euro;2m across 31 local authorities to drive the Creative Ireland Programme at local level. The Department of Housing Planning and Local Government also provide funding of &euro;1m towards this element of the Programme.  This has led to increased opportunities for artists in communities across Ireland.  In addition to this over &euro;2m has been provided by my Department and the Department of Education and Skills to implement the measures set out in Creative Youth &ndash; the plan to enable the creative potential of every child and young person.  One of the flagship projects is Creative Schools which will see 50 creative associates working with 150 schools across the country to develop to explore the potential impact of the arts and creativity on school life. </p>  <p>  I recently announced funding of &euro;1.2m for the National Creativity Fund 2018/2019 which will see 30 new creative partnerships developed with a range of organisations covering various types of projects including film visual art, architecture, heritage and others.</p>  <p>  All of these measures support engagement and participation in creative activities and also support the development of young creatives and artists across the country.</p></reply>

Every year, as part of this on-going management of deer populations within the Park, deer numbers may need to be reduced. Culls in Killarney are undertaken following consideration of a number of reports, population surveys and scientific advise. The cull in Killarney is carried out by trained, experienced and dedicated NPWS staff in a professional manner and is based upon scientific research. As part of this managed process, some 120 deer have culled since January 2018. It is not possible to estimate how many more deer will be culled in 2018 due to weather and other factors. The following points should be noted:</p>  <p>  - The 2018 cull was decided upon following consultation with NPWS professional staff, including scientific input as required.</p>  <p>  - Shooting of deer in the Park is carried out only by NPWS professional staff members, who are fully trained, competent, expert and licenced in the use of firearms.</p>  <p>  - The selection of deer shot is in accordance with normal deer management protocols. The deer are shot humanely by qualified NPWS marksmen.</p>  <p>  - The remains are processed and disposed of in full compliance with the applicable Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine guidelines, and with the involvement, as appropriate, of officials from that Department.</p>  <p>  There is a significant challenge in attempting to balance the demands of agriculture, forestry and conservation with the need to ensure that deer populations occupying the same land resources are managed at sustainable levels, and in a responsible and ethical manner.  Ultimately, however, where deer species are increasing in range and numbers, depending on the annual count and instances of damage caused by deer to habitats (especially woodland), culls need to be carried out to ensure that deer populations do not reach levels that would have negative ecological consequences.</p></reply>

There is an annual open season during which deer can be legally shot under licence. The open season for deer operates generally from 1 September to the last day of February, depending on the species and gender of deer.  I have no current plans to adjust this season.</p>  <p>  My Department carries out localised annual deer counts on State lands such as National Parks and I am aware that deer species are increasing in range and numbers.  Where appropriate, and depending on the annual count and instances of damage caused by deer to habitats, especially woodland, culls may be carried out to ensure that deer populations do not reach levels that would have negative ecological consequences.  </p>  <p>  Control of deer on private property is the responsibility of landowners who may apply to my Department for a permission under section 42 of the Wildlife Acts to cull deer where this is necessary outside the annual open seasons.  These permissions offer a facility whereby a person can obtain a permit, on a case by case basis, to prevent serious damage caused by individual deer on specific lands. Permissions are only issued where there is evidence of such damage.</p>  <p>  In relation to illegal deer hunting, officials of the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department and an Garda Siochana have powers under the Wildlife Acts to bring prosecutions for illegal deer hunting.  Some 19 prosecution cases have been taken by my Department for illegal deer hunting since 2010 to date which have included cases of hunting deer out of season, hunting at night and hunting on lands without landowner permission.</p>  <p>  I have not received an invitation for a meeting from the organisation in question but I would consider any such invitation in the context of on my diary schedule.  Finally, if the Deputy has evidence of suspected crimes against deer, my Department would be very grateful for that information.</p></reply>
