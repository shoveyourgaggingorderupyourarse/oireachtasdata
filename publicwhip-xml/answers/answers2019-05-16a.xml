Considerable investment is also being made in the Garda estate, to address its deficiencies and provide fit-for-purpose facilities for Garda members and staff, as well as the public interacting with them.  This is a significant undertaking, as there are currently 565 stations nationwide. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the programme of replacement and refurbishment of Garda accommodation is progressed by the Garda authorities working in close cooperation with the Office of Public Works (OPW), which has the responsibility for the provision and maintenance of Garda accommodation. </p>  <p>  The Garda Building and Refurbishment Programme 2016-2021 includes the development of new Garda stations in Macroom, Clonmel and Sligo. These stations will be delivered by way of a Public Private Partnership (PPP) arrangement. </p>  <p>  The development of PPP projects is progressed under the auspices of the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA).   The Department of Justice and Equality and the Garda authorities are working with the OPW to progress this matter, with the input and assistance of the NDFA.   </p>  <p>  Discussions with the OPW have included direct engagement between the Secretary General of my Department and the Chair of the OPW, as well as ongoing working level contacts. I can confirm that the OPW has agreed to provide its expert services in the design of the three stations included in this PPP. </p>  <p>  The establishment of PPP projects can be complex and it is vital to get the projects right at the planning and design stage. I can assure the Deputy that delivery of the new Garda stations in Clonmel, Macroom and Sligo through this PPP arrangement is being pursued as a priority.</p>  <p>  Pending delivery of the new stations, I am informed that Garda management and the OPW have been working to improve conditions and facilities at the existing stations.</p></reply>

I intend to bring forward a number of Government amendments to strengthen the provisions of the Bill and to ensure that it will be as effective as possible. I have worked closely with Deputy Howlin on these amendments and I look forward to introducing them at Committee Stage as soon as they are drafted. </p>  <p>  The aim of the Bill is to tackle certain behaviours that have become more prevalent online in the last number of years. The Bill will introduce two new offences for the first time to tackle the distribution of intimate images without consent, commonly referred to as "revenge pornography" and "upskirting". The Bill will also extend the offence of sending a threatening, false, indecent or obscene message to cover messages sent by any means of communication. </p>  <p>  In relation to harassment, the Bill will extend the current offence of harassment contained in section 10 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 to include all forms of communication to or about another person. I also intend to introduce a distinct offence of stalking, which will cover stalking online and offline. </p>  <p>  I appreciate the significant impact that harassment, both online and offline, can have on the mental health of a victim. That is why I am committed to working with my cabinet colleagues to address online harm through the National Action Plan for Online Safety, 2018-2019, a whole of Government approach that sets out in a coherent way the actions that are being undertaken across all Departments and Agencies to protect children and adults in their online engagement.</p></reply>

These allegations are the subject of an investigation carried out by the Inspector of Prisons on my behalf.</p>  <p>  The affidavit, brought in connection with a proposed temporary transfer of the officer concerned, was brought to my officials' attention on 19 November 2018. The allegations were subsequently reported on in the media on 22 November 2018. </p>  <p>  These allegations raised serious issues of public concern and I therefore asked the independent Inspector of Prisons, Patricia Gilheaney, to carry out an urgent investigation to determine as far as possible the facts of the matter.  </p>  <p>  The Inspector has furnished me with a copy of the report of her investigation, carried out under section 31 of the Prisons Act 2007, and I am considering the report in the light of advice from the Attorney General.  When that consideration is completed, I will make a decision in relation to the publication of the report under section 31 of the 2007 Act.</p>  <p>  The allegations which are the subject of the Inspector's investigation are not those raised by the person whose details are supplied by the Deputy. That person left the prison service in 1989 and subsequently raised a number of issues about activities in the prison service. In 2016 issues raised by him were the subject of an assessment in accordance with my Department&rsquo;s Protected Disclosures Policy.  This assessment concluded that there was insufficient detail to enable further investigation to take place.  Concerns raised by the person were also considered by the Independent Review Mechanism (IRM) established to review certain allegations of Garda misconduct and the outcome of that process was communicated to the person concerned.</p></reply>

As the Deputy will be aware, last year sanction was secured from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for an additional 42 staff members for GSOC.  This included 5 additional staff for the protected disclosures unit within GSOC.  </p>  <p>  In her response to the sanctioning of these additional posts, the Chair of GSOC said that this demonstrated real political support for Garda oversight and the additional staff would allow GSOC the ability to fulfil and expand its statutory remit and meet the needs of the community. </p>  <p>  In addition to the sanction of new staff, GSOC's budget for 2019 has been increased to &euro;10.7 million which is an increase in core funding of &euro;1.6 million (15%).  This increase has enabled GSOC to meet the costs associated with the recruitment of the additional staff that have been sanctioned and I am assured that the overall budget allocation to GSOC for 2019 will ensure that it has the necessary resources to fulfil its mandate.  </p>  <p>  As well as providing the resources required, last December, the Government endorsed the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing including its proposals for a new, coherent governance and oversight framework for policing in the State.  My Department is working as a matter of priority on a Policing and Community Safety Bill which will provide for this new framework including very substantial reform of GSOC and an expansion of their remit.  </p>  <p>  These reforms, developed in consultation with relevant stakeholders including the oversight bodies, will no doubt require a further strengthening of the resources required to carry out this essential work.  Both my Department and this Government are entirely committed to ensuring that the resourcing and governance needs of the new complaints body are met fully. </p>  <p>  I believe that these measures demonstrate my commitment to ensuring that GSOC has the necessary resources to effectively fulfil its remit.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-05-16a.22.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019051600032#WRA02100"><p>I recognise the concerns raised in the Deputy&rsquo;s question with regard to Garda&iacute; investigating other Garda&iacute;. I know that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission have raised this matter on a number of occasions including more recently.</p>  <p>  The House will be aware that last year I secured sanction to increase the number of staff of GSOC by 42 full time equivalents.  These additional staff, when fully deployed, will allow GSOC to reduce the time taken for investigations as well as enable it to carry out more investigations without referring complaints to the Garda&iacute; themselves.  We all recognise that it is not ideal for Garda&iacute; to be investigating complaints against other Garda&iacute;.  My understanding is that GSOC investigates the most serious complaints against Garda&iacute;.  However, I am informed that circumstances may arise in which An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na takes the lead in an investigation not arising from a complaint.   </p>  <p>  I see no particular issue with Garda&iacute; investigating lower level complaints against other members.  I am talking here about complaints that would probably be categorised as discourtesy where the person making the complaint merely wants an acknowledgement that the service which they received was not up to the proper standard.  Some years ago the Chairperson of GSOC cited a case which fell within this category which took over a year to complete and took up a considerable amount of GSOC time.  She said that these cases should be handled in a timely manner at local level.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, last December, the Government endorsed the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland including its package of proposals for the reform of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission. A key element of this package is that all serious issues of concern about standards of policing or police integrity itself should be the subject of an independent investigation even where no member of the public has made a complaint. Examples of the types of conduct cited by the Commission include potential breaches of law, violations of human rights or corruption, or which appear to indicate a widespread or systemic problem within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  Work is underway as a matter of priority in my Department on the preparation of the General Scheme of the Policing and Community Safety Bill to provide for these proposals and other elements of the Commission&rsquo;s report.  I believe that the Bill will provide the appropriate mechanisms for the independent investigation of alleged criminal offences by members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  As part of that work, my officials have met with relevant stakeholders including GSOC and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and are considering their submissions. It is my intention to bring the General Scheme to Government for approval later this year.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-05-16a.25.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019051600032#WRA02400"><p>On 20<sup>th</sup>November 2018 the Government approved a new national survey on the prevalence of sexual violence in Ireland. Following this, the Department of Justice and Equality and the Central Statistics Office signed a Memorandum of Understanding on 10<sup>th</sup>January 2019 regarding the undertaking of the survey.</p><p>The CSO have now begun the work on the large scale survey, called the Sexual Violence Survey (SVS), which will look in detail at the experience of sexual violence and abuse for both women and men in Ireland, with repeat surveys every decade.</p><p>This is a large and complex survey. The Government&rsquo;s expert Scoping Group report made clear that delivering a survey that met the highest standards would be a significant undertaking and a multi-annual project.</p><p>I am aware that some concern has been expressed about how long it will take to complete the survey.  A priority of mine is that it be done right.  We want to ensure that the State undertakes an ongoing programme of research of the highest quality in a sensitive and ethical way to ensure a robust set of data to inform Government policy.  The complexities and timeframes involved have been acknowledged by some of the NGOs involved in the sector.</p><p>The CSO has provided an estimated timeline of up to five years for completion including a full first year of technical research, design, specialist training and preparation. The preparatory phase will also involve a stakeholder consultation process, consideration of best international practice and the conducting of a full pilot survey in the field in 2020.</p><p>The CSO has indicated it will be in a position to give further certainty on completion date, timelines and costs after it finalises its preliminary work in 2019. The provision of reliable, robust, objective and internationally comparable information requires that the planning and execution of this survey is undertaken in a professional and comprehensive manner and to do otherwise may compromise the quality of the resulting data. Therefore, the planned duration of the new Sexual Violence Survey (SVS) is to ensure that all aspects of the survey are undertaken and completed to the highest possible standard.</p><p>Funding of &euro;150,000 has been provided for the work in 2019 and there is agreement in principle to fund the rest of the project.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-05-16a.28.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019051600032#WRA02700"><p>There are few who would argue that Ireland's membership of the European Union has not been of enormous benefit to Ireland's citizens, both economically and in terms of the progressive social development of this State. The freedoms enjoyed by EU citizens and the real and genuine protections afforded to their fundamental rights are the envy of many throughout the world. This commitment to protecting fundamental rights is not some empty aspiration but rather a reality backed up by formal structures such as the European Court of Justice and the European Parliament.   </p>  <p>  The freedom of movement of EU citizens is one very clear benefit of membership of this Union. Our people are now true Europeans, who identify themselves as such and who cross borders freely, engaging on an equal basis with their fellow EU citizens. Our own society, once insular and inward looking, has benefitted enormously from the arrival of people from many parts of Europe who wish to make a valued contribution to the vibrancy and welfare of this cosmopolitan State. </p>  <p>  Of course there are always those who will seek to exploit privileges such as freedom of movement for their own nefarious ends and much recent EU law in the criminal justice sphere has been aimed at trying to counter the abuse of these freedoms, while also protecting them. The European Arrest Warrant is one such example. </p>  <p>  Another example is that of Eurojust.  Eurojust has been operational for the past 17 years and Ireland has been a member of the agency since its inception. Eurojust was set up to stimulate and improve the coordination of serious criminal investigations, prosecutions and cooperation between competent authorities in the Member States, where such investigations involve two or more Member States. </p>  <p>  Eurojust provides Ireland with access to a network of European public prosecutors and law enforcement agencies that provide essential assistance to each other in the investigation of serious offences including murders, rapes, drug trafficking, people trafficking, child sexual exploitation, international money laundering and terrorism. Eurojust also benefits from a much valued Irish involvement in the organisation. Members of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions provide Irish representation at Eurojust, which operates a 24/7 on call service to Member States.</p>  <p>  Regulation (EU) 2018/1727 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 November 2018 on the European Union Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation (Eurojust), replaces and repeals Council Decision 2002/187/JHA, its predecessor. </p>  <p>  The purpose of the new Regulation is to provide a modern and updated framework for the management of the agency. For example, a key innovation in the new Regulation makes Eurojust subject to the EU's updated data protection framework, thereby providing the protection of the world's most advanced data protection regime to data held by Eurojust. This includes supervision of Eurojust data related operations by the European Data Protection Supervisor. Eurojust will also be required to report on its operational activities to the European Parliament, the Council and national parliaments.</p>  <p>  The approval of the Oireachtas in accordance with Article 29.4.7 of the Constitution is required for Ireland to opt in to the new Regulation, a process which arises as a result of Article 4 of Protocol 21 to the Lisbon Treaty. Opting into the new Eurojust Regulation is necessary in order to continue to participate in Eurojust. If we do not opt in, Ireland will cease to be a member of Eurojust from December 2019.  </p>  <p>  As Minister for Justice and Equality, I do not believe it would be desirable to lose access to this network. International serious crime is an issue which affects all member states and their citizens and it has countless victims.  Coordination of measures to disrupt this activity, and ongoing communication between states in relation to such measures, is essential. Eurojust provides an efficient and effective way of ensuring this cooperation occurs.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, from an overarching perspective, there is a general obligation upon Ireland as a Member State to make a tangible contribution to the welfare of this Union and it is important that Ireland demonstrates a real commitment to assisting in combatting serious crime which affects the Union</p>  <p>  The solidarity with Ireland displayed by the other member States  in the context of Brexit must also not be forgotten.  A withdrawal from Eurojust membership would send a negative message and be reputationally damaging for the country. Ireland would be left in a position where, if it wished to maintain an involvement, it would have to negotiate associate membership of the agency, leading to a much-diminished status. </p>  <p>  Therefore, the rationale for seeking to maintain membership of Eurojust is derived from an understanding that being part of a union of democratic states carries with it responsibilities to protect the fundamental principles of democracy that underpin that union and an obligation to protect its citizens from those who would seek to harm them.</p>  <p>  Finally, the funding arrangements for Eurojust are set out at Chapter VI of the Regulation and, as can be seen, the agency is resourced centrally from the EU budget. Eurojust's budget is also subject to the scrutiny of the EU Commission, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union (the Member States). There is no expectation of a budgetary contribution required from Ireland in the context of the running of the agency. Ireland's national member is of course remunerated by the State in the same manner as any official of the State who is assigned to duties overseas.</p></reply>

However I&rsquo;m sure the House will appreciate that it is the Garda Commissioner who is responsible for the control and direction of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. I, as Minister, have no direct role in these matters.  The House would be rightly critical of me if I sought to interfere with the role of the Commissioner in this regard.</p>  <p>  Decisions taken with regard to the establishment of specialised units in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are matters for the Commissioner himself.  I do recognise, however, the concerns implied in the Deputy&rsquo;s question with regard to Garda&iacute; investigating other Garda&iacute;.  This new unit will look at potential inappropriate associations by Garda&iacute; with persons involved in criminality, with possible inappropriate behaviour towards vulnerable victims and possible drug use or dealing.  These are insidious activities which would undoubtedly undermine the service's integrity and undermine public confidence in the Garda&iacute;.</p>  <p>   I know that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission have expressed concerns about the setting up of this new unit.  However, I do not believe that the setting up of this new unit is in any way undermining the very important role played by GSOC in investigating alleged wrongdoing by members of the Garda&iacute;.  I believe that it can be a useful complement to their work.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, last December, the Government endorsed the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland including its package of proposals for the reform of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission. A key element of this package is that all serious issues of concern about standards of policing or police integrity itself should be the subject of an independent investigation even where no member of the public has made a complaint. Examples of the types of conduct cited by the Commission include potential breaches of law, violations of human rights or corruption, or incidents which appear to indicate a widespread or systemic problem within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p>  <p>  Work is underway as a matter of priority in my Department on the preparation of the General Scheme of the Policing and Community Safety Bill to provide for these proposals and other elements of the Commission&rsquo;s report. As part of that work, my officials have met with relevant stakeholders including GSOC and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and are considering their submissions. Specifically in relation to the proposed anti-corruption unit, my officials have sought information from the Garda Commissioner regarding its establishment, its intended functions and how they will sit with the Commission model for investigating Garda wrongdoing. A proactive approach by the Garda Commissioner to ensuring high standards of conduct can only be a positive development and I look forward to receiving further information from the Commissioner on his plans.</p></reply>

The scale of Garda activity under Operation Thor (as of 7 May 2019) has resulted in over 200,900 targeted checkpoints and more than 356,300 crime prevention patrols carried out nationwide. This concentrated policing activity has produced in the region of 10,000 arrests and 11,550 charges covering a range of offences which, in addition to burglary, have included handling stolen property, possession of firearms and drugs offences.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to bring pressure on the gangs and individuals responsible for these type of offences.  </p><p>The Deputy will also be familiar with Operation Hybrid which has been deployed as a result of an escalation in violence between organised crime gangs in the Dublin Metropolitan Region.  The strategic objective of Operation Hybrid is to have a three-pronged approach - preventative, investigative and targeted.  As of 5 May, there have been in the region of 76,700 high visibility checkpoints carried out under Operation Hybrid.  An up to date  breakdown of  arrests and charges is currently being prepared by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>The resources provided by Government to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have reached unprecedented levels, with an allocation for 2019 of &euro;1.76 billion.  This represents an increase of over 6% over the initial allocation for 2018.</p><p>With respect to tackling cross border crime, there is strong ongoing co-operation between the Garda&iacute; and the PSNI in respect of the full range of policing activities.  A joint Cross-Border Policing Strategy operates between the two services.  The Strategy covers the range of policing activities and contains a series of initiatives in which both police services are actively engaged.  </p><p>The Joint Agency Task Force established under the <i>Fresh Start Agreement</i>engages the two police services in a lead role in structured strategic and operational co-operation in combatting cross-border organised crime.  The Joint Agency Task Force is a positive example of the extensive North-South co-operation that is undertaken between the police and other law enforcement agencies aimed at tackling crime and enhancing the safety of all communities on this island.</p><p>I can assure the Deputy that the Government remains committed to ensuring An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have all the necessary resources to tackle all forms of criminality that affects our communities.</p></reply>

Any person who assaults or threatens to assault a peace officer in the execution of their duty is guilty of an offence and is liable on summary conviction to a fine or a term of imprisonment not exceeding 12 months or both or on convictions on indictment to a fine or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 7 years or both. In addition, the Act allows for judges to impose such sentences consecutively on persons found guilty of such offences.</p><p>In June 2015, following a number of serious assaults on prison staff, the State Claims Agency (SCA) commenced a review of assaults on prison staff by prisoners in accordance with Section 8 of the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act, 2000. </p><p>In November 2016, the SCA presented the report to the then T&aacute;naiste. The report noted many positive findings including that given the number of committals in 2015 the ratio of assaults to the number of prisoners in the system was very low. The role of a prison officer is a difficult and challenging one. Prison staff must deal with a wide range of complex issues and there are occasions when they are subjected to unacceptable acts of violence.</p><p>The report contains a large number of recommendations. These recommendations were accepted and are being implemented - an undertaking that was included as a Key Action in the Irish Prison Service&rsquo;s Strategic Plan 2016-2018. The Irish Prison Service is committed to creating a safer environment for all those who work or live within our prison walls. In addition, the Service is committed to ensuring that any staff member who is subject to or witnesses an assault is given the necessary supports in the aftermath of the incident. </p><p>I can further advise the Deputy that following a recommendation contained within the State Claims Agency&rsquo;s Report on &lsquo;Assaults on Operational Prison Staff by Prisoners&rsquo;, a full review of the prisoner disciplinary system has begun. </p><p>Given the substantive nature of the recommendations, the Irish Prison Service has an implementation plan in place and is in the process of implementing these recommendations.</p></reply>

At that time I updated the House on the significant progress made in the ratification process within the term of this Administration, particularly through the introduction of legislation to give effect to the key criminal law provisions of the Convention. </p>  <p>  As I outlined to the House at that time, Ireland&rsquo;s laws are in line with the Convention. This was largely achieved by the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017, which was a ground-breaking piece of legislation.  It brought in a new offence of accessing child pornography online.  It also criminalised grooming behaviour, such as communicating with a child online for the purpose of sexual exploitation.  Even prior to this Act, our legislation on child pornography included images of a person generated or modified by computer-graphics.  </p>  <p>  In relation to other elements of the Convention, my Department has been carrying out a detailed review of compliance, in consultation with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and other relevant stakeholders, such as the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Health Service Executive.

All prisoners in custody have a visitor panel and phone contact panel. It is up to each prisoner to identify the persons that they place on each panel. At this moment in time, only adult visitors (persons over 18) are logged and recorded by name and date of birth on the prison visitor system. </p>  <p>  In 2018, 239,769 visitors entered the prison estate with 50,592 categorised as children. For the first four months of 2019 the number of visitors to prisons was 78,423 of which 16,207 were recorded as children. </p>  <p>  The number of standard visits a prisoner may receive is directly linked to the regime level they have achieved under the terms of the Irish Prison Service Incentivised Regimes Policy. </p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service Incentivised Regimes Policy provides for a differentiation of privileges between prisoners according to their level of engagement with services and quality of behaviour. The main privileges offered include additional visits, additional phone calls and an increased daily gratuity depending on the regime level achieved. The objective is to provide tangible incentives to prisoners to participate in constructive activities and to encourage good behaviour, leading to a safer and more secure environment. The list of additional privileges varies between prisons and within different areas of a prison, depending on the operational and infrastructure requirements of each prison. </p>  <p>  A prisoner on basic regime level may receive 1 half-hour visit per week. A prisoner on standard regime level may receive 2 half-hour visits per week or combine both visits to have 1 hour long visit where the prison arrangements can accommodate this request. A prisoner on enhanced regime level may receive 4 half-hour visits per week or combine the visits to have 2 hour-long visits where the prison arrangements can accommodate this request.  All prisoners have the opportunity to become eligible for enhanced regime status provided they have met the required criteria for the preceding two months. A number of factors are taken into consideration and each prisoner&rsquo;s eligibility is examined on a case by case basis.</p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service is committed to supporting the family relationships of imprisoned parents, through the medium of the Governor-led Families and Imprisonment Group.

There is ongoing communication between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the respective control centres, and access to good quality CCTV can assist the Garda&iacute; when investigating serious incidents.  </p>  <p>  I welcome Irish Rail's plan to install more CCTV cameras and increase security patrols on DART carriages over the coming months, which is a positive step.

The Commissioner has now informed me that he plans to recruit a total of 600 trainee Garda&iacute; in 2019 and, in addition, it is his intention to recruit a net 600 Garda Civilian Staff. This Garda Staff recruitment will allow the Commissioner to redeploy a further 500 fully trained Garda&iacute; from administrative duties to frontline policing in 2019.</p>  <p>  The provision of these additional resources to the Commissioner is a key component in this Government's approach to improving public safety throughout the country which will undoubtedly also benefit policing of transport services in Dublin and in other areas.</p></reply>

I informed the Government of this approach and appointed retired District Court Judge Gerard Haughton to conduct a scoping exercise and to advise me in relation to the case.</p>  <p>  I met with members of the O&rsquo;Farrell family to inform them of the decision and I provided them with a copy of the terms of reference for Judge Haughton's scoping exercise.

I have also been briefed by the Commissioner about the dedicated policing operation - Operation Stratus - that is in place in Drogheda and specifically targets this ongoing, highly volatile feud. </p><p>Operation Stratus consists of high visibility patrols and checkpoints, days of action and covert policing initiatives, targeting specific parties to the feud. The operations are supplemented by personnel from the regional armed support unit, the drugs unit and the divisional roads policing unit and have resulted in the seizure of considerable amounts of cash, firearms and controlled drugs.</p><p>I am informed that a number of arrests took place last weekend as part of Operation Stratus. On Friday Garda&iacute; investigating on-going criminality in the Drogheda area attended the scene of a stolen burnt out car.  The follow up investigation led to three males being arrested and charged in relation to this incident.  On Sunday Garda&iacute; searched a house in the Hill View area of Drogheda town. During the course of the search, Garda&iacute; recovered quantities of cocaine and cannabis herb. Other paraphernalia including weighing equipment and documentation was also seized. I am informed that during the follow up operation a person was arrested and is currently detained for questioning under section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware, the distribution of Garda resources is solely a matter for the Garda Commissioner and his management team and I have no role in such matters. However, I welcome the Commissioner's recent announcement that an additional 25 Garda members will be allocated to Drogheda adding to the existing Garda strength of around 120 members.</p><p>I also want to reassure the local community in Drogheda that there are specialised regional Armed Support Units based in the Northern Region at Dundalk and Ballyshannon Garda Stations. Members of these Units are highly trained and equipped with a variety of non-lethal and lethal weapons and perform high visibility armed checkpoints and patrols throughout the region and support and supplement the national Emergency Response Unit which has also been deployed to Drogheda in recent times.  The Commissioner recently made an operational decision to establish a third Regional ASU in the Northern Region at Cavan Garda station<i>, </i>and I understand that arrangements have commenced to establish this new unit in order to further support and strengthen Garda capacities in the region.  </p><p>I am determined that the situation in Drogheda cannot be allowed to continue.

This approach is aligned with a general divisional-focused Garda model. It is the intention of the Commissioner that the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (GNECB) will guide divisions and provide training in the investigation of insurance fraud. </p>  <p>  The Cost of Insurance Working Group (CIWG) called for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to explore the potential for further cooperation between it and the insurance sector in relation to insurance fraud investigation. An insurance funded Garda Unit was one option considered.  </p>  <p>  While the Commissioner has indicated that he does not support industry funding of Garda units, he is open to considering other industry-funded proposals to combat insurance fraud, for example, IT projects and/or the appointment of analysts. The Department is currently engaging with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to this end, exploring these options and any other potential avenues for cooperation with the insurance sector. </p>  <p>  On a wider level, much constructive engagement has taken place, including the commitment by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Insurance Ireland&rsquo;s Anti-Fraud Forum to meet on a regular basis in order to discuss and act upon current and ongoing general issues which arise in the area of insurance fraud. </p>  <p>  In relation to the scale of insurance claim fraud reported to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the most recent figures available to the Department show that in the period 1 October 2018 to 28 February 2019, 22 incidents of &lsquo;insurance claim fraud&rsquo; were recorded on PULSE. Please note that this data is correct as at 4 March 2019, however it is operational and therefore subject to change.</p>  <p>  Finally, while on the topic of insurance fraud investigation, I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate AGS on its recent success under Operation Coatee, which targets insurance-related criminality. The GNECB, supported by Lucan Garda Station, CAB and the Armed Support Units, carried out searches in the west Dublin area in April 2019, with a view to submitting files to the Director of Public Prosecutions.</p></reply>

This speaks to some extent about the current climate in relation to reporting. </p>  <p>  There are a wide range of reasons why people are hesitant to report sexual crime. The time of reporting figures are, therefore, heartening. The suite of victim related legislative measures enacted in recent years along with awareness raising efforts has created a climate where people feel more comfortable to report what is happening now and what has happened in the past. </p>  <p>  This is area where we need to maintain momentum and where we need to increase our efforts to make reporting including of historical allegations of sexual violence more likely. </p>  <p>  In achieving this I can assure the Deputy that the Government is committed to addressing sexual violence and in fully supporting and assisting victims, including facilitating and enabling victims to come forward to report these horrific crimes regardless of the times such crimes were committed. </p>  <p>  Significant efforts and resources are being directed in tackling the problem of sexual violence including the following measures. </p>  <p>  - The Government&rsquo;s Second National Strategy in tackling domestic, sexual and gender-based violence 2016-2021, which is in place as our overall policy framework in tackling these issues.</p>  <p>  - Our laws in supporting victims of crime have also been significantly reformed and strengthened in recent years. </p>  <p>  - Major structural and  cultural reform is also being seen within our overall policing response to  sexual crime and in how An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is dealing with such crime and in supporting victims of such offences.</p>  <p>  - The Government has also approved a significant new national survey approach to the collection of  data on the prevalence of sexual violence by the Central Statistics Office in Ireland and work is underway on this project. </p>  <p>  - Work is also well advanced on the review, being chaired by Tom O&rsquo;Malley, which is examining the  protections for vulnerable witnesses in the investigation and prosecution of sexual offences. </p>  <p>  - Significant financial resources continue to be made available by the State in addressing sexual violence. As an example of this, Tusla, the Child and Family Agency is allocating funding in 2019 of &euro;25.3 million to Domestic Sexual and Gender Based Violence Services, this represents an increase of &euro;4.9 million since 2015. </p>  <p>  - &euro;1.712m is also  being made available by the Victims of Crime Office in my Department in 2019 to 57 community and voluntary sector organisations providing victim support services including to projects which directly support victims of sexual crimes. </p>  <p>  Raising public awareness on these issues is also a key feature of our overall response in this area. As the Deputy will be aware, only last week I launched a major national awareness raising campaign on sexual harassment and sexual violence, the No Excuses campaign, on which we are set to spend in excess of &euro;1m this year on the first year of the campaign. The aim of the campaign is to increase the awareness of sexual violence and to bring about changes in societal attitudes with the aim of decreasing and preventing this violence.</p>  <p>  In concluding I would once again urge victims of sexual violence to continue to come forward to the Garda&iacute; in reporting such violence including where this involves any historical allegations of such crimes.</p></reply>

The Civil Defence Officer who is an employee of the Local Authority is responsible for the day-to-day management of Civil Defence in their Local Authority area. </p>  <p>  The Pre Hospital Emergency Care Council (PHECC) is the regulator for emergency medical services in Ireland and their role is to protect the public. The Pre Hospital Emergency Care Council require organisations who wish to be operational, to apply to them, for an annual licence to operate.</p>  <p>  When Civil Defence&rsquo;s current operating licence was up for renewal in November 2018, my officials reviewed the current statutory declaration. That review identified that some assurances and details required as part of the licensing process are not within the control or remit of the Department of Defence as responsibility for operations rests with local authorities.</p>  <p>  The Pre Hospital Emergency Care Council extended Civil Defence&rsquo;s current licence to 30 July 2019 to address issues identified as a result of the review.  </p>  <p>  I fully appreciate the excellent services provided by Civil Defence volunteers.  In that context, my officials have been working to resolve the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council licensing issue. My officials have been and continue to engage with Local Authority management through the Environment, Climate Change and Emergency Planning subcommittee of the City and County Managers Association and with senior management of the Pre Hospital Emergency Care Council. </p>  <p>  I have asked my officials to continue to engage constructively to ensure there is no diminution in the level of care and first aid cover that Civil Defence volunteers provide beyond 30 July 2019.   </p></reply>

I and EU colleagues reiterated our support for the EU's International Contact Group for Venezuela and its continuing efforts towards achieving a peaceful and democratic solution.</p>  <p>  A Ministerial level meeting of the International Contact Group took place in Costa Rica on 6 and 7 May, and it has been working to create the conditions for the holding of free and fair presidential elections as soon as possible.  </p>  <p>  The ICG recognises that the priority now is to avoid further escalation of an already extremely tense situation, and that to achieve this it is imperative to reinstate democracy, rule of law and separation of powers. I fully support the ICG's statement that no actions of a repressive, judicial or political nature should be taken that would make this possibility more remote.  </p>  <p>  I welcome the Group's engagement with regional and international partners, including the Lima Group and CARICOM.  </p>  <p>  I also fully support the ICG's efforts to enable the urgent delivery of humanitarian aid to Venezuela in line with humanitarian principles, and welcome its recent announcement that it will establish a humanitarian working group in Caracas. Ireland is fully supportive of the &euro;117 million in assistance that has been provided to Venezuela since 2018. </p>  <p>  The United Nations continues to work to establish an effective humanitarian response system and to deliver assistance to those most in need. It is important and urgent that humanitarian organisations have unimpeded access and can effectively deliver and significantly scale up assistance swiftly, without constraints, free from any political interference. Needs are acute and the situation has been exacerbated by widespread interruptions to electricity and water supply.  </p>  <p>  Ireland, together with our EU partners, stands firmly with the Venezuelan people and their legitimate democratic aspirations. I continue to strongly believe that there can only be a political and democratic solution to the multiple crises facing the country. Officials in my Department will continue to monitor the situation closely and I will continue to engage with EU colleagues on this important issue.</p></reply>

Since 2011, the Syria conflict has cost the lives of well over 400,000 people. As the conflict enters its ninth year, nearly 12 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance inside Syria, and more than 80 per cent of people live below the poverty line. Over 6 million people are displaced inside Syria, and a further 5.6 million have fled to neighbouring countries and the wider region. The Assad regime and its allies have repeatedly targeted civilians, through deliberate attacks, including chemical attacks, on civilian infrastructure such as homes, hospitals and schools, the use of &ldquo;starve or surrender&rdquo; techniques and the denial of humanitarian assistance, and forced displacement in the interest of demographic engineering. Other groups, most notably ISIS, have also perpetrated atrocities. </p>  <p>  While the conflict had been less intense in recent months, in recent weeks there has been an escalation of the conflict in the north-west of Syria, in the area around Idlib. Conflict there between the regime and other armed groups has displaced 180,000 people, killing up to 120 civilians, and injuring hundreds. I condemn in particular the airstrikes that are reported to have targeted medical facilities and schools. </p>  <p>  All parties must uphold their ceasefire commitments and cease military activities in the Idlib region. Any attempt at a purely military approach to the situation there risks endangering hundreds of thousands of others. Those with influence on the Syrian regime have a responsibility to exert pressure to ensure that civilians are protected, and to encourage the Syrian Government to engage fully with the UN-led peace process. </p>  <p>  Ireland and the EU firmly believe that eight years of war have shown that military action cannot bring lasting peace to Syria. We support the UN-led efforts to bring about a political resolution to the conflict, in accordance with the 2012 Geneva Communiqu&eacute; and UN Security Council Resolution 2254. What is needed to bring a sustainable end to the violence is a Syrian-owned and Syrian-led process. The EU provides direct assistance to the Geneva peace talks and has launched, in coordination with the UN, an initiative to develop political dialogue with key actors from the region to identify common ground. </p>  <p>  The UN Special Envoy&rsquo;s efforts are currently focused on establishing a constitutional committee, made up of Syrians of different political views, to chart the way forward for the country and unlock a broader political process. The UN Special Envoy has been engaging directly with Russia, Turkey and Iran on this, and we believe that they have a responsibility to support and assist his efforts. </p>  <p>  At the EU-League of Arab States Ministerial meeting in February, I raised the ongoing conflict in Syria with my EU and Arab counterparts. At the EU-League of Arab States Summit in Egypt later that month, which the Taoiseach attended, EU and Arab countries reaffirmed their commitment to the UN-led process in Syria, and agreed that any sustainable solution to the Syrian conflict requires a genuine political transition. </p>  <p>  Ireland is a strong and consistent donor to the Syria crisis response and our overall funding supports those in need inside Syria as well as Syrian refugees and vulnerable host communities in the region. In March 2019, Ireland pledged a further &euro;25 million to the crisis, bringing the total amount of humanitarian assistance committed to the Syria crisis to over &euro;143 million since 2012 &ndash; our largest ever response to any single crisis. To date, Ireland has disbursed &euro;138m of this funding. Through its annual contributions to the EU Institutions, Ireland also supports the EU&rsquo;s humanitarian response in Syria.</p></reply>

We are committed to promoting freedom of thought, conscience and religion, as well as the rights of persons belonging to religious minorities.  This commitment to promoting freedom of religion and belief is reaffirmed in the Global Island: Ireland&rsquo;s Foreign Policy for a Changing World. </p>  <p>  Within the EU, Ireland works with partners to address the persecution of Christians and other religious minorities. The EU's policy in this area is led by the Guidelines on Freedom of Religion or Belief, which were adopted during our Presidency  in 2013.  The EU Action Plan for Human Rights and Democracy 2015-2019  also includes an express reference to the promotion of freedom of religion or belief.  </p>  <p>  The EU's engagement and actions to promote and protect human rights across the globe is summarised in the EU's Annual Report on Human Rights and Democracy in the World 2018 which was adopted by the Foreign Affairs Council at its meeting on 13 May.  It found that freedom of religion or belief continued to be under attack throughout the world in 2018 and that therefore the promotion and protection of Freedom of Religion or Belief remained a key priority in the EU's external human rights policy.</p>  <p>  During  2018, the EU consistently raised concerns about violations of freedom of religion and belief in the course of political dialogues with partner countries, including during more than 20 human rights dialogues and consultations.  The EU continued to be a strong advocate for Freedom of Religion or Belief in UN Multilateral fora, including at the Human Rights Council and the UN General Assembly as well as in other international organisations including the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the Council of Europe.  </p>  <p>  Finally the EU is providing financial support of over &euro;5m in the period 2018-2022  to three interfaith projects in the Middle East and Africa which aim to enhance cultural pluralism and intercultural understanding related to religion or belief.  It has also increased its support to civil society projects on freedom of religion or belief under the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights up to &euro;5.18m.  </p></reply>

On 7 May, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and I convened these talks in Belfast. The objective of this short, focussed process is to seek to quickly re-establish to full operation the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement - the Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive and the North-South Ministerial Council. </p>  <p>  There has been constructive engagement by party leaders and party representatives and this will need to be maintained over the coming weeks, to rise to the challenge of finding an agreement.</p>  <p>  The Secretary of State and I participated in a further meeting with party leaders at Stormont House on Tuesday 14 May, and we will meet with the party leaders again next week, to seek progress on the issues which need to be resolved in order to get an agreement on operating the devolved power-sharing institutions again.</p>  <p>  The awful killing of Lyra McKee and the outpouring of public feeling that followed demands a serious response at political level. People want to see real progress made. There is no patience for anything except urgent and determined progress.</p>  <p>  Ultimately the challenge is for the parties to find an agreement. This will be difficult, but the two Governments believe that this can, and must, be achieved. </p>  <p>  The Prime Minister and the Taoiseach will review progress in the talks by the end of May and consider any necessary further steps.</p>  <p>  The devolved institutions of the Agreement are urgently needed so that the Assembly and power-sharing Executive can represent the interests of all of the people of Northern Ireland and address issues of concern. There are pressing decisions and issues across a range of areas, which require a functioning Executive and Assembly. The North South Ministerial Council is also essential to oversee and develop North South cooperation on matters of mutual interest, as provided for under the Good Friday Agreement.</p>  <p>  The Government will continue to do everything in its power, in accordance with its responsibilities as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, to secure the effective operation of all of its institutions.</p></reply>

We will continue our efforts in this regard until we secure progress &ndash; both in terms of future legal immigration opportunities for Irish citizens, and also in securing a pathway for those Irish who are undocumented in order to regularise their status.  Special Envoy to the US Congress on the Undocumented, John Deasy T.D., has also worked closely on these issues with my Department.  </p>  <p>  I visited the US in early February, for a series of engagements with the US Administration and Congressional leaders.  I raised immigration issues in these meetings, as I have done in all my interactions with the US Administration and US political leaders since taking office.  Additionally, the Taoiseach had a range of engagements at the highest levels of the US Administration and with Congressional leaders over the St Patrick's Day period.  John Deasy T.D. accompanied the Taoiseach on this visit, and the issue of the undocumented Irish was raised with the US Administration. </p>  <p>  In April, I was delighted to host events to mark the visit of the Speaker of the US House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and to have the opportunity to discuss with her and the Congressional delegation a range of topics of mutual concern.  Deputy Deasy also participated in the programme, as did officials from my Department.  Through those events and meetings with the Taoiseach and Minister Donohoe, I believe the Speaker and delegation were fully briefed on Irish interests, including on immigration issues and our concerns for those Irish who are undocumented in the US.</p>  <p>  These engagements have already borne fruit.  I was pleased to note that an E3 Bill, which if passed, would offer new opportunities for Irish citizens to live and work in the US, was recently reintroduced into the US Congress. Much work still needs to be done for this Bill to become a reality, and we are under no illusions as to the challenging path ahead. Special Envoy Deasy is currently in Washington D.C. in connection with these latest developments, and is supported in his work by the Americas Unit of my Department, and Ireland&rsquo;s Embassy in Washington, DC.</p>  <p>  In addition to this work, my Department, including through our Embassy and Consulates in the US, work alongside the Irish Immigration Centres across the US on an ongoing basis to provide support to those Irish who are undocumented. Each Irish Centre receives significant Government funding through the Emigrant Support Programme for its work, including support for vulnerable Irish and the undocumented. In 2018, over &euro;3 million was allocated to 76 organisations across the US, including the Irish Centres.</p></reply>

The UAE authorities have strongly denied these claims.</p>  <p>  The Irish Embassy in Abu Dhabi is monitoring this case, in coordination with other EU Member States.

Insurance Ireland has however advised my officials that they do not collate, publish or communicate any data relating to claims information at a granular level from their members. However their 2017 Factfile will be published shortly. It will include details on:</p><p>- Gross Written Premium;</p><p>- Net Written Premium;</p><p>- Net Earned Premium;</p><p>- Net Incurred Claims;</p><p>- Number of Claims Reported; </p><p>- Net Underwriting Result;</p><p>- Estimated Investment Income; and, </p><p>- Estimated Net Operating Result.</p><p>The Insurance Ireland 2016 Factfile is available on their website at www.insuranceireland.eu/media/Factfile%202016-Final.pdf.</p><p>Insurance Ireland has previously advised that property insurance policies cover a range of perils such as fire, storm, theft, water damage, and that it is not possible for them to isolate the number of burst pipes, fluvial or coastal flooding claim figures. It has however collated figures on severe weather events (storm and flood) in an aggregated form in relation to the number of claims occurred and the gross cost of claims occurred for all property claims. According to the latest data available from Insurance Ireland, the aggregate cost to insurers of adverse weather events for the period 2013-March 2018 is approximately &euro;311 million.  </p><p>In conclusion, the Government is satisfied that its existing policy and investment in relation to flooding which is focused on the development of a sustainable, planned and risk-based approach to dealing with flooding problems is the best way forward. This commitment is underpinned by a significant capital works investment programme by the OPW and Local Authorities, complemented by the exchange of information with the insurance industry on completed flood defence schemes. This approach should lead to the increased availability of and lower cost for flood insurance and further improve the already high level of coverage in this country compared with many other jurisdictions.</p></reply>

Prior to its launch, a tranche of &euro;200 million of long-term fixed-rate finance was borrowed by the Housing Finance Agency (HFA) to provide funds for the scheme to local authorities. </p>  <p>  The amount of &euro;200 million initially provided for the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan (RIHL) was based on the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government&rsquo;s estimates of expected drawdown of loans under the scheme over a three year period. From the data collected on the scheme to date, it is clear a further tranche of funds would need to be borrowed by the HFA for the scheme to continue to operate as there has been a greater than anticipated demand for the RIHL. As the HFA is on the state&rsquo;s balance sheet any borrowings it makes are part of General Government Debt. </p>  <p>  I understand the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government is presently carrying out an internal review and the future of the scheme is being discussed by that Department with the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform. Upon conclusion of the review a decision will be made on the future of the RIHL and the relevant Ministers will be in a position to make a statement on the scheme. </p></reply>

A pension will qualify for an increase if the pay rate on which it is based does not exceed the pay rate of a serving member of staff with the same grade and scale point, after the pay increase has been applied. Assuming it qualifies, the pension is increased to the extent that this will ensure alignment with the pay of the serving staff member.

Since 1 January 2018, the majority of public service pensions have not been subject to PSPR.</p>  <p>  The matter of identifying and processing any pension increase and/or PSPR reduction or removal due to any individual pension recipient falls to the Department/Office or public service body that administers the relevant pension scheme. I understand that the individual in the case referred by the Deputy retired from a body that comes under the aegis of the Department of Education and Skills. Accordingly, any request for more detailed information regarding the status of the pension in question by reference to the policies I have outlined should be directed to my colleague the Minister for Education and Skills.</p></reply>

However, this may result in some pupils' not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice. As schools may not have a place for every applicant, a selection process may be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory, and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. </p>  <p>  Under section 15 (2) (d) of the Education Act, 1998, each school is legally obliged to disclose its enrolment policy and to ensure that, as regards that policy, principles of equality and the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents' choice are respected. </p>  <p>  Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 provides for an appeal by a parent or guardian to the Secretary General of my Department where a Board of Management of a school, refuses to enrol a student in a school. I understand that an appeal has been taken in respect of this child and that this appeal was not upheld. My Department has no authority to compel a school to admit a pupil, except in the case of an appeal under Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 being upheld.</p>  <p>  The Educational Welfare Service (EWS) of the Child and Family Agency (Tusla) is the statutory body which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school placement for their child. The EWS can be contacted at 01-7718815 or 01 7718500</p>  <p>  In relation to the role of religion in school admission, the Deputy will be aware that Section 11 of Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018 has amended the Equal Status Act 2000 to remove, in the case of recognised denominational primary schools, the provision in that Act that previously permitted such schools to use religion as a selection criterion in school admissions.  Under this provision, which was commenced in October 2018, there is a protection to ensure that a child of a minority faith, can still access a school of their faith.  In that regard, the provision provides that a recognised primary school does not discriminate where it admits as a priority a student from a minority religion who is seeking admission to a school that provides a programme of religious instruction or religious education which is of the same religious ethos or a similar religious ethos to the ethos of the student seeking admission.  </p>  <p>  The Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) is the authority which deals with all complaints of discrimination under equality legislation.</p></reply>

I have spoken to a number of school secretaries about their employment conditions and understand the issues they have raised.</p>  <p>  I have recently relaxed the moratorium for those C&amp;C and ETB schools with enrolments of 700 and more which allow them to employ an additional School Secretaries up to a maximum of two per school. There are 91 schools in the C&amp;C and ETB Sector who meet this criteria, based on the information currently available to this Department. This is an initial step and has taken immediate effect.</p>  <p>  Schemes were initiated in 1978 and 1979 for the employment of Clerical Officers and Caretakers in schools.  The schemes were withdrawn completely in 2008.  </p>  <p>  These schemes have been superseded by the more extensive capitation grant schemes.  The current grant scheme was agreed in the context of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, published in 1991.  </p>  <p>  The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools now receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under these grant schemes.  It is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs. Where a school uses the grant funding for caretaking or secretarial purposes, any staff taken on to support those functions are employees of individual schools.  Specific responsibility for the pay and conditions rests with the school. </p>  <p>  On foot of a Chairman&rsquo;s Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department engaged with the Unions representing school secretaries and caretakers, including through an independent arbitration process in 2015. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for staff and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period.  This arbitration agreement covers the period up to 31 December 2019.  </p>  <p>  The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a Secretary or Caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration has from 1 January 2019, been paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay. </p>  <p>Officials from my Department attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills on the 9th   of April to discuss the status of non-teaching staff.</p>  <p>  The F&Oacute;RSA trade union have requested a meeting with the Department to discuss pay arrangements for grant-funded Secretaries and Caretakers from 2020 onwards. The Department has agreed to arrange a meeting with the Union and is currently making arrangements for this meeting to take place in late May/early June.</p></reply>

The Irish Prison Service provides a wide range of rehabilitative programmes that include education, vocational training, healthcare, psychiatric, psychological, counselling, welfare and spiritual services.  Access to these services is a critical feature for offenders in addressing their offending behaviour.</p>  <p>  While specific statistics are not available, evidence shows that addressing such factors as education, employment, housing, drug and alcohol misuse, attitudes and self control, institutionalisation and life skills contributes to reduced reoffending. </p>  <p>  The latest data in relation to recidivism rates for offenders who were given a custodial sentence or community sanction is contained in the fourth set of recidivism studies published by the Central Statistics Office in November 2016.  </p>  <p>  There has been a continued reduction in the recidivism level for the cohort of prisoners released in 2010, these are the latest figures available on the Central Statistics Office website. The Prison Recidivism Studies for 2007, 2008 and 2009 showed a recidivism rate of 55%, 51% and 47.5% respectively. The overall figure for 2010 is 45.1% which represents a reduction of 10% since these studies commenced.   </p>  <p>  The Central Statistics Office are currently working on the studies for the cohort of people released in 2011 and 2012 and it is anticipated that these reports will be published in the next 6 months.</p></reply>

There is also a Constitutional presumption in favour of the grant of bail as, under Irish Law, a person is presumed innocent until proven guilty.</p>  <p>  The Criminal Justice Act 2017 strengthens the operation of the bail system with the aim of making the law as effective as possible in protecting the public against crimes committed by persons on bail.   </p>  <p>  Under the Act, a Court, in considering an application for bail, is required to have regard to persistent serious offending by an applicant for bail and the nature and seriousness of any danger presented by the grant of bail to a person charged with an offence that carries a penalty of 10 years&rsquo; imprisonment or more.  The Court will also have the power, in certain cases, to hear evidence from the victim of an offence before a decision on bail is taken.  </p>  <p>  Where an accused person is granted bail, the Act provides for stricter bail terms for repeat serious offenders, strengthens Garda powers to deal with breaches of bail, increases the use of curfews, and, where requested by Garda&iacute;, allows for the introduction of electronic tagging for those on bail in certain circumstances.</p></reply>

The resources provided by Government to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have reached unprecedented levels, with an allocation for 2019 of &euro;1.76 billion, an increase of over &euro;100 million on the 2018 allocation. </p>  <p>  The Commissioner plans to recruit a total of 600 trainee Garda&iacute; in 2019 in addition to 600 civilians.  This recruitment will facilitate the Commissioner in redeploying a further 500 fully trained Garda&iacute; from administrative duties to frontline policing in 2019.  The Government's commitment to increase the overall strength of the force to 15,000 Garda&iacute; will be achieved by 2021.</p>  <p>  The manner in which the resources of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are deployed, including personnel, is a matter for the Garda Commissioner and his management team. I am informed by the Commissioner that the additional resources have enabled him to assign extra staff to specialist units involved in tackling organised crime, including the Armed Support Unit, Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau, the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, and the Criminal Assets Bureau.</p>  <p>  There are a number of successful Garda operations in place to disrupt the activities of criminal gangs. Operation Thor, launched in November 2015, focuses on burglary and related crime.  Up to May 2019, it has resulted in over 200,900 targeted checkpoints and more than 356,300 crime prevention patrols carried out nationwide. It has led to approximately 10,000 arrests and 11,550 charges covering a range of offences which, in addition to burglary, have included handling stolen property, possession of firearms and drugs offences.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to exert pressure on the gangs and individuals responsible for these type of offences.  </p>  <p>  Operation Hybrid was deployed in response to the escalation in violence between organised crime gangs in the Dublin Metropolitan Region. Up to May 2019, it has resulted in almost 77,000 high visibility checkpoints.  It is based on a three-pronged approach - prevention, investigation and targeting.

Most significant is the fact that a criminal gang is unlikely to have the permanency of organisation and structure that a subversive organisation has traditionally had.  Relationships in criminal gangs tend to be more fluid, with shifting memberships and alliances. New splinter groups and new gangs can form overnight. </p>  <p>  Part 7 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 (as amended by the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009) establishes a number of offences targeting the activities of those involved in organised crime.  These offences include participation in a criminal organisation and directing a criminal organisation.  The latter offence specifically targets those in criminal organisations who give the orders without requiring their direct participation in the commission of criminal offences.  On conviction, this offence carries a penalty up to life imprisonment. </p>  <p>  The Criminal Justice Act 2006 also makes it an offence to conspire with one or more persons to do an act that constitutes a serious offence, irrespective of whether such act actually takes place or not. Evidential provisions as to the existence of a criminal organisation were introduced aiding prosecution for the offences under the Act.  Provision was also introduced so that where a serious offence is committed as part of or in furtherance of a criminal organisation, it shall be treated as an aggravating factor for the purpose of determining sentence. </p>  <p>  In recent years a number of other legislative measures have been introduced to tackle gang-related and associated crime. The Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Act 2016 provides additional powers for Garda&iacute;, in particular, powers to allow for the immediate seizure of assets suspected of being the proceeds of crime. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and in particular the Criminal Assets Bureau are already making use of these provisions. </p>  <p>  Overall I believe that sufficient legislation already exists for the prosecution of offences relating to organised crime and to target the proceeds of crime. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, with the support of  significant additional resources provided to it by this Government, is determined to address gangland violence in our communities. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-05-16a.248.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019051600036#WRE03500"><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) is a multi-agency statutory body established under the Criminal Assets Bureau Act, 1996. The Bureau&rsquo;s remit is to target a person's assets, wherever situated, which derive, or are suspected to derive, directly or indirectly, from criminal conduct. Since its inception, the Bureau has been at the forefront of fighting organised crime in this jurisdiction and disrupting the activities of criminal gangs by depriving them of ill-gotten assets.</p>  <p>  The Bureau is widely regarded as a best practice model in the context of combatting organised crime. Its structure and powers have been modelled by other jurisdictions. It works closely with law enforcement bodies at national and international levels and continues to relentlessly pursue the illicit proceeds of organised crime activity. The actions of the Bureau send a strong message to criminals and to local communities that profiting from crime won't be tolerated.</p>  <p>  Reflecting the Government's commitment to ensure that the Bureau is adequately resourced, the CAB&rsquo;s staffing and budgetary allocation has increased significantly in recent years. Since 2016, the Bureau's staffing resources have increased from 71 to its current level of 84, with staff numbers due to rise to 91 during this year. Similarly, the Bureau's budgetary allocation has gone up from &euro;7.042 million in 2016 to &euro;8.603m in 2019.</p>  <p>  The increased resources of the CAB have given rise to substantially increased levels of Bureau activity and its successful operations have become a regular feature in media reports. In 2018, the Bureau brought 30 new Proceeds of Crime proceedings before the High Court, up from 28 in 2017 and 13 in 2016. This is the largest number of new cases ever commenced by the Bureau in a single year. Likewise, the money returned to the State as a result of CAB actions increased from &euro;3.8 million in 2016 to &euro;4.3 million in 2017.  The provisional figure for 2018 is in excess of &euro;5.6 million.</p>  <p>  CAB is supported in its work by a nationwide network of trained Asset Profilers. Asset profilers work hand-in-hand with local Garda Management and communities towards the objective of denying and depriving criminals of assets. The number of asset profiles submitted to the Bureau, by the nationwide network, increased from 66 in 2016 to 184 in 2018, a 178 per cent increase. This increase has been driven by the growth in the number of Garda, Revenue and Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection personnel who have been trained as Asset Profilers.  There is now a national network of almost 380 trained asset profilers compared with 279 at the end of 2017.</p></reply>

However I can assure the Deputy that investing in the capacity of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to tackle criminals and enforce the law effectively is a key objective of this Government's response to tackling crime.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to develop and implement operations and strategies to target, dismantle and disrupt organised criminal networks, utilising advanced analytical and intelligence methodologies. </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Commissioner that the additional resources coming on stream have enabled him to assign extra resources to specialist units involved in tackling organised crime, including the Emergency Response Unit (ERU), Armed Support Unit (ASU), Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau, the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, and the Criminal Assets Bureau.</p>  <p>  The ERU is a highly-trained and well-equipped special intervention capability that is supported by a number of regional Armed Support Units and range of other resources across the Garda organisation. ASUs have been established in each of the six Garda Regions to provide an armed response capacity and capability on a Regional basis which support and supplement the national ERU. Members of the ASUs are also highly trained and equipped with a variety of non-lethal and lethal weapons and perform high visibility armed checkpoints and patrols throughout their respective Regions. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that there are also a number of successful Garda operations in place to disrupt the activities of criminal gangs.  </p>  <p>  Operation Thor was officially launched in November 2015 and focuses on burglary and burglary related crime.  The scale of Garda activity under Operation Thor  (as of 7 May 2019) has resulted in over 200,900 targeted checkpoints and more than 356,300 crime prevention patrols carried out nationwide. This concentrated policing activity has produced in the region of 10,000 arrests and 11,550 charges covering a range of offences which, in addition to burglary, have included handling stolen property, possession of firearms and drugs offences.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to bring pressure on the gangs and individuals responsible for these type of offences.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be familiar with Operation Hybrid which has been deployed as a result of an escalation in violence between organised crime gangs in the Dublin Metropolitan Region.  The strategic objective of Operation Hybrid is to have a three-pronged approach - preventative, investigative and targeted.  As of 5 May, there have been in the region of 76,700 high visibility checkpoints carried out under Operation Hybrid.  An up to date  breakdown of  arrests and charges is currently being prepared by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  The resources provided by Government to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have reached unprecedented levels, with an allocation for 2019 of &euro;1.76 billion.  This represents an increase of over 6% over the initial allocation for 2018.</p>  <p>  With respect to tackling cross border crime, there is strong ongoing co-operation between the Garda&iacute; and the PSNI in respect of the full range of policing activities.  A joint Cross-Border Policing Strategy operates between the two services.  The Strategy covers the range of policing activities and contains a series of initiatives in which both police services are actively engaged.  </p>  <p>  The Joint Agency Task Force established under the Fresh Start Agreement engages the two police services in a lead role in structured strategic and operational co-operation in combatting cross-border organised crime.  The Joint Agency Task Force is a positive example of the extensive North-South co-operation that is undertaken between the police and other law enforcement agencies aimed at tackling crime and enhancing the safety of all communities on this island.  </p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a structured training delivery infrastructure nationally with facilities throughout the country.  The organisation is expanding its training infrastructure and has engaged in procurement processes which allow the use of external training facilities. The organisation is moving towards a blended learning approach, and is presently using e-learning and collaborating with the National Digital Learning Centre at DCU to develop further in this area. </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that the Government remains committed to ensuring An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have all the necessary resources to tackle all forms of criminality that affects our communities. </p></reply>

This year alone, the Health Service Executive has allocated &euro;1.9 billion to its Disability Services Programme.</p><p>My primary concern is to ensure the continuity of appropriate person-centred disability services is maintained and delivered in an equitable manner consistent with the care and support needs of individuals. I want to acknowledge the important services provided by Rehab and the commitment of the staff of Rehab to people with a disability and their families.</p><p>I am informed by the HSE that the total revenue allocation provided by the HSE to Rehab for social services has increased by &euro;8.1 million to &euro;56.1 million in 2019 when compared with the allocation in 2016.</p><p>Rehab provides a range of services to young people and adults with physical, sensory and intellectual disabilities, mental health difficulties, autism, or acquired brain injury. Services are co-ordinated through Rehab&rsquo;s three service delivery divisions, RehabCare, the National Learning Network and Rehab Enterprises.</p><p>Rehab and the HSE have committed to working intensively together with a view to making substantive progress in reaching a solution to the issues. </p><p>Rehab have agreed not to issue a notice of termination, pending the conclusion of this intensive work with the HSE. Both I and Minister Harris had a further meeting with Rehab and the HSE yesterday, Wednesday, 15<sup>th</sup>May.</p></reply>

Such a licence, if granted, enables them to legally import, possess, prescribe, supply, and administer the Schedule 1 controlled drug - cannabis - for the patient named on the licence. </p>  <p>  Licence holders can nominate a representative to collect the patients prescribed cannabis product on their behalf if, for example, the patient is not able to do this personally. At the time of applying for the Ministerial licence the applicant must provide the details of the nominated person who will be collecting the prescribed product on the patient&rsquo;s behalf. That nominated person's name will then be included on the licence for this purpose. This is a matter for the patient and their prescriber.</p>  <p>  We are aware that a UK company may provide a service which involves it collecting cannabis products from the Netherlands for persons authorised to use it under the UK medical cannabis regime.</p>  <p>  While this company can import medical cannabis products into the UK from the Netherlands, the UK authorities do not currently allow re-export from the UK to other countries, which includes Ireland.  </p>  <p>  I have been informed that this UK company may be acting as the patient&rsquo;s &ldquo;nominated representative&rdquo; in the collection of their personally prescribed medical cannabis products. No similar Irish entity is known to provide this service, but it is certainly open to any patient to engage a representative on their behalf in this regard, including a limited company.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that the Irish Revenue and Customs Authorities have the final say in all such matters. </p></reply>

However, these cases relate to a purported linkage between the Pandemrix vaccine and narcolepsy rather than Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.</p>  <p>  The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is responsible for monitoring the safety and quality of all medicines including vaccines that are licensed in Ireland.  The HPRA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) continually monitor adverse events to vaccination.  The HPRA operates a national adverse reaction reporting system, which members of the public and healthcare professionals are encouraged to submit any suspected adverse reactions to.  All Reports received by the HPRA are routinely transmitted to the EMA's adverse reaction database for inclusion in global signal detection and monitoring activities.    </p>  <p>  All medicines, including vaccines are subject to on-going review and evaluation of all available data from a range of sources, including systematic scientific literature review, to consider any impact that their data may have on the overall assessment of the benefits and risks of a medicinal product.  The safety of these vaccines continues to be monitored at EU level through the EMA and its expert committees, which includes representatives from member state competent authorities such as the HPRA.   </p>  <p>  My main priority as Minister for Health is that individuals and families affected receive appropriate health and social care supports.  My Department continues to engage with the Health Service Executive, the Department of Education and Skills, and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to ensure the provision of a wide range of services and supports, on an ex-gratia basis for those who have received a diagnosis of narcolepsy following administration of the H1N1 pandemic vaccine.  The HSE&rsquo;s Advocacy Unit acts as liaison with other service providers and Government Departments to facilitate access to required services.  It is in regular contact with the individuals affected and their families; and regional co-ordinators have been appointed to assist by providing advice, information and access to local services.  These supports include discretionary medical cards, reimbursement of expenses associated with diagnosis and treatment, home tuition and learning supports.</p></reply>

Over the past four years we have seen a considerable increase of nearly &euro;140 million in the budget which has grown from &euro;306 million in 2015 to almost &euro;446 million this year.</p><p>This year the HSE intends to provide 17.9 million home support hours<b></b>to 53,000 people and intensive home care packages to 235 people.</p><p>Despite this significant level of service provision, the demand for home support continues to grow. The allocation of funding for home supports across the system, though significant, is finite and services must be delivered within the funding available.Preliminary data indicates that at the end of March there were 52,360 people in receipt of home support.  During the first quarter of the year 4.2 million hours were delivered nationally, 4,411 new clients commenced the service and 6,238 people have been assessed and are waiting for either new or additional home support services.</p><p>I acknowledge that in some cases access to the service may take longer than we would like. However, the HSE has assured my Department that those people who are on a waiting list are reviewed, as funding becomes available, to ensure that individual cases continue to be dealt with on a priority basis within the available resources and as determined by the local front line staff who know and understand the clients&rsquo; needs, and who undertake regular reviews of those care needs to ensure that the services being provided remain appropriate.</p><p>While the existing home support service is delivering crucial support to many people across the country, it needs to be improved to better meet the changing needs of our citizens.  We are developing plans for a new statutory scheme and system of regulation for home support services.  This will improve access to the service on an affordable and sustainable basis while also introducing a system of regulation that will ensure public confidence.  The Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy commits to the introduction of the new scheme in 2021.</p><p>In the meantime, the Department and the HSE are continuing to improve existing services, including in 2018 the introduction of a single funding stream for home support services.  This is providing significant benefits including making the services easier to understand; streamlining the application and decision-making processes; and facilitating service users to move to changed levels of service as their assessed needs change, without the need for an additional application process.</p></reply>

The award of organic status is secured by a formal certification process delegated by my Department to various Organic Control Bodies in accordance with the relevant EU regulations. The certification process involves regular inspection of all organic operators, production techniques and sampling of organic produce to ensure compliance with all EU requirements.   </p>  <p>  The inspection process for producers of organic fish is extremely detailed and includes adherence to a range of core organic principles, as well as stocking levels, feed practice, traceability and fish-welfare and husbandry amongst other things. Organic aquaculture sites are also subject to the standard inspection regime applying to conventional producers by the Marine Institute and the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority. In addition, all Organic Control Bodies are independently accredited by an external accreditation body.   </p>  <p>  With regard to the organic status of an operation, where a breach of licensing conditions is determined and an aquaculture licence is revoked, the Organic Control Body concerned in accordance with its procedures, takes the necessary action to suspend certification and remove organic certification trademarks completely from the product in question. If the organisation concerned fails to resolve the situation by a specified date, then the organic certificate for the site in question is withdrawn.   </p></reply>

However, the S.I. was annulled by Dail Eireann on 29 May 2018. </p>  <p>  Given this annulment of the Statutory Instrument that met the EU requirements and the infringement proceedings taken against Ireland by the EU Commission, I requested legal advice from the Attorney General on the matter.

These are intended to complement sanctions and promote compliance and were required to be in place on 1st of January 2012.  Both of these EU regulations went through the ordinary legislative procedures at EU level which would have included widespread consultation with interested parties including the Member States, Advisory Councils, NGOs and the fishing Industry.  The matter has also been discussed at industry liaison meetings over the years.  The EU regulations are highly prescriptive in relation to licence holders, leaving little room for further negotiation.     </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that I am fully committed to delivering on Ireland's legal obligations in this regard at the earliest possible date.  </p></reply>

The Attorney General has advised that there are significant legal risks in relation to both procurement law and state aid law, if the State was to mandate and fund directly outside a procurement process any economic undertaking, including a commercial semi-state body such as the ESB, to carry out the National Broadband Plan. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, engagement between officials of my Department and DG Competition, which is the Directorate General of the European Commission with responsibility for State Aid matters, has clearly established that it is the view of DG Competition that it would not be possible to provide a State subsidy to a commercial semi-state body, such as the ESB, to roll out the National Broadband Plan without undertaking a new public procurement process.</p>  <p>  However, the ESB pole network may still used by National Broadband Ireland where possible and more effective than using the eir pole and duct network.</p>  <p>  Regarding the purchase of eir, eir is a privately traded company whose value is not known. In March 2018, it was reported that a 64% stake in the company was sold for &euro;3.5 billion. Any purchase of the company would require negotiation with current owners and in the event the company was purchased by the State a new procurement process for the NBP State intervention would still be required under State Aid rules.</p>  <p>  In both the scenarios outlined above, any new procurement process would be required to be open to other commercial entities and would likely add at least two further years to the National Broadband Plan process. In addition, given that both eir and SIRO (the joint venture between the ESB and Vodafone) were bidders in the current process and withdrew before submitting a final tender, it is unclear if either entity would tender for the State intervention contract under any new process. </p></reply>

However, the extent of the cutbacks in grant funding during the crisis meant this grant scheme had to be curtailed from 2013 because expenditure on maintenance/renewal was falling well short of what was required to adequately maintain the regional and local road network. </p>  <p>  The current Capital Plan does provide for the gradual build-up in funding for the road network but it will take some years yet to reach the level required even for the basic maintenance and renewal of the network.  For this reason, there continues to be very limited scope for funding new or additional projects under the Specific and Strategic Grant Programmes.  </p>  <p>  Any projects proposed by local authorities for consideration under these Grant Programmes are assessed by the Department on a case-by-case basis.  It is important for local authorities to prioritise projects within their overall area of responsibility with these requirements in mind. </p>  <p>  Regarding Fintra Bridge:</p>  <p>  - The Department has committed and remains committed to assisting Donegal County Council in upgrading the R263 regional road at Fintra Bridge</p>  <p>  - The Department&rsquo;s commitment was reflected in a grant allocation of &euro;150,000 in 2018 (of which &euro;35,572 was drawn down).  An allocation of &euro;150,000 has also been provided in 2019 for this project. Further monies will be made available in future years as the project progresses</p>  <p>  - Following a tender process approval was given to Donegal County Council to appoint Engineering Technical Advisers in April 2018. Since then the Preliminary Appraisal for the project has been submitted to the Department and approved by the Department&rsquo;s Economic Evaluation Unit</p>  <p>  - It should be noted that all Departments and Local Authorities must follow the Public Spending Code (PSC).  This is to ensure that projects are properly assessed and designed before lands are acquired and construction commenced. In the case of Fintra Bridge this means that alternative options must be assessed (which is happening at this time) and an important decision will be to determine how much of the approach road to the East of Fintra Bridge should be realigned and how that can be best achieved.</p></reply>

Given the constitutional context, striking the balance between these rights is proving challenging.   </p>  <p>  I have received submissions from a range of diverse stakeholders and lobby groups regarding the Bill and both myself and my officials have met with many of these groups and individuals both specifically in relation to the Bill and on the sidelines of other fora. In recent months, in the course of deliberations over revisiting the provisions relating to privacy in the Bill, I have considered the views expressed in relevant reports and debates on this matter by advocacy groups and by members of the Oireachtas. I have also considered the many representations made to me by members of the public and by stakeholders generally. </p>  <p>  Some of these groups and individuals have expressed concerns about specific aspects of the Bill, and in particular, the requirement for adopted people to sign an undertaking declaring that they would not contact their birth parent.  Having listened to these concerns, I engaged again with the Office of the Attorney General seeking to revisit the privacy provisions and strengthen the right to identity. As the Deputy will be aware, I secured Government approval to draft amendments to seek to revise these provisions in the Bill. </p>  <p>  Once these amendments are finalised, it is my priority to progress to Committee Stage of the Bill in Seanad &Eacute;ireann as soon as possible.  This legislation will only finally succeed if members of the Oireachtas support it.  It reflects my sincere efforts to tilt the balance more strongly in favour of applicants' right to identity and access to birth information, while maintaining necessary protections for a small cohort of potentially vulnerable birth parents.</p></reply>

Community Employment Childcare Programme (CEC) is administered by Pobal on behalf of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection (DEASP) and provides childcare for children of parents who are participating in the Community Employment scheme. There are two strands within CEC, namely CEC(PS) (pre-school) and CEC(AS) (after-school).</p>  <p>  I recognise that there can be pressure in some localities and not all service providers have contracted to provide TEC. I would urge anyone experiencing difficulty securing a TEC place to contact their local City or County Childcare Committee for assistance. The new National Childcare Scheme will alleviate the issue of specific targeted scheme availability as it will replace all targeted schemes, including the TEC scheme. </p>  <p>  My Department provides other programmes which may be of interest to the person in question, namely Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE), and Community Childcare Subvention Plus (CCSP).

The conditions include progressing to a higher level of education than that already held by the applicant. </p>  <p>  An applicant who already holds a level 7 ordinary degree can only apply for the one year add-on honours degree course.  They are not eligible to commence a new three or four year level 8 degree course in a different discipline. The BTEA scheme is designed to support second chance education and not award financial support to someone with a pre-existing degree. Where a Level 7 ordinary degree is held, progression to a level 8 higher diploma may be approved as a higher diploma is normally awarded following completion of a programme of one year duration.</p>  <p>  The guidelines governing such progression under the operation of the BTEA are, in the main, in line with the mechanisms in place for student support type schemes administered by the Department of Education and Skills. Progression in education is a condition to access BTEA and it should be noted that is not a requirement unique to this scheme as other State supports for education purposes are grounded on a student progressing.</p>  <p>  Overall, it is important to note that the purpose of the BTEA is to raise educational and skill levels so as to improve a welfare recipient&rsquo;s employment prospects.  Progression in education is an important condition of the support provided. </p>  <p>  Any changes to the BTEA would have to be considered in the overall budgetary context. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the situation for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The BTEA provides people with a second chance education that will improve their prospects of securing employment The BTEA is not intended to provide a basis for a long-duration participation in extended education as long duration return to education programmes can exceed a jobseeker's 'progression effect' and reduce employment prospects.</p>  <p>  Post-graduate courses that lead to a higher diploma in any discipline are eligible for support under the BTEA.  The Professional Masters in Education (PME) and masters qualifications based solely on life experience, where the applicant holds no other third level qualification, are also eligible for support under the BTEA. </p>  <p>  It would be difficult to establish the estimated cost of making the BTEA available for all postgraduate students as it would not be possible to determine the number of people on welfare support who would be likely to pursue postgraduate studies. The average BTEA annual cost for a 3rd level student for an academic year is approximately &euro;8,500. Irish Masters degrees typically take one year to complete however some courses extend beyond this.</p>  <p>  The BTEA is not an alternative form of funding for people entering or re-entering the third level education system.  The Student Universal Support Ireland (SUSI) Grant payable by the Department of Education and Skills represents the primary support for persons pursuing education.  The eligibility rules that govern the payment of a student maintenance grant are a matter for that Department. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter.   </p></reply>

Under this principle there is a direct link between the PRSI contributions that a person has paid and entitlement to a varying range of benefits and pensions.  Where a person has sufficient PRSI contributions, then benefits and pensions may be paid as of right, where a particular contingency arises and without a means test.</p>  <p>  Secondly there is the solidarity principle.  Under this principle the benefits and pensions that are paid are not directly related to the amount of PRSI contributions paid by insured persons.  PRSI contribution income is instead redistributed to support contributors who are more vulnerable. In this regard, it should be noted that some PRSI contributors do not experience all of the contingencies during their life. For example, one contributor may never require access to Invalidity Pension whereas it may be a crucial support for another. </p>  <p>  In addition, there is a general principle of one person, one 'core' payment, which applies across the whole of the social welfare system.  Given the contingency-based nature of this system, it can happen that a person may experience more than one contingency at the same time.  For example, an unemployed person may become sick.  As a consequence, if a person experiences more than one of these contingencies at the same time, he or she can receive only one of those payments.  This principle is common to social security systems across the world.</p>  <p>  It is generally only possible to claim one personal social assistance or social insurance payment at a time in Ireland. However, in certain circumstances, a person can keep their personal payment and get half rate of another social welfare payment. A notable example is the situation whereby, if a person receives certain social welfare payments and is providing full-time care and attention to another person, they may keep their main social welfare payment and get half-rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance as well.   </p>  <p>  Not to maintain the underlying principle of entitlement to one payment only at any one time, that is, one person, one payment, could potentially involve very significant and unsustainable additional expenditure in the long-term. </p>  <p>  In terms of income support, Social welfare will always provide a safety net for those who most need it. Supplementary welfare allowance, administered by the community welfare service of the Department, is a means tested weekly payment, subject to certain terms and conditions, which provide a basic income support to eligible people whose means are insufficient to meet their needs. Every decision is based on consideration of the circumstances of each case, taking account of the nature and extent of the need and of the resources of the person concerned.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-05-16a.505.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1264" speakername="Damien English" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019051600042#WRL03400"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 180 to 183, inclusive, together.</p>  <p>  An Expert Panel on Concrete Blocks was established by my Department in 2016 and its terms of reference were limited to the investigation of the problems that have emerged in the concrete blockwork of certain dwellings in Counties Donegal and Mayo.  The report of the Expert Panel was published in 2017 and included eight recommendations, which my Department is actively progressing with the relevant stakeholders. </p>  <p>  In October 2018, the Government approved in principle the development of a grant scheme of financial assistance to support affected homeowners in the two counties to carry out the necessary remediation works to dwellings that have been damaged due to defective concrete blocks.  Earlier this week, agreement was reached with my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, to allocate &euro;20 million to a scheme for this purpose from within the &euro;2.4 billion housing budget for 2019.  Funding for future years will be agreed on an annual basis.    </p>  <p>  The extent of damage arising from mica varies significantly from house to house.  It is intended that the maximum rate of grant will be 90%, with the full terms and conditions of the scheme being finalised over the coming weeks, in consultation with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  This will take account also of the further engagement that my Department will now be having with Donegal and Mayo County Councils in relation to the arrangements for the scheme.  On completion of this work, it is intended to revert to Government for a further decision. </p>  <p>  While initial work has been carried out on the range of potential costs arising, the ultimate costs involved will be determined by the final terms and conditions of the scheme and will, of course, also depend on the number of applications made under the scheme and the extent of the damage to be remediated in each individual house ultimately approved for grant assistance. </p>  <p>  In relation to the issue of certification for families who have already had remedial work carried out on their dwellings, the issuing of such certification is a matter entirely for the homeowner and the professionals they have engaged. Similarly, the payment of mortgages and rent is a matter for individual property owners.</p>  <p>  As regards Local Property Tax (LPT), taxation policy, including matters relevant to LPT, falls within the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Finance.  The Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) provides for the administration of LPT and allows for only a limited number of exemptions from that tax.  There is no specific exemption for properties affected by mica or pyrite in the concrete blockwork However, as LPT operates on a self-assessment basis, it is a matter for the property owner, in the first instance, to calculate the tax due based on his or her assessment of the market value of their property.  When making an assessment of the value of a property, issues such as the presence of mica (or any other defects, which may adversely affect the value of the property) should be taken into account by the property owner. </p>  <p>  In relation to the issues referred to concerning social housing, the relevant legislation provides that a household is not eligible for long-term social housing support if a household member owns alternative accommodation that the household could reasonably be expected to use to meet its housing need, either by occupying it or by selling it, and using the proceeds to secure suitable accommodation.  However, in determining a household&rsquo;s need for social housing support, local authorities are required to have regard to, inter alia, the household&rsquo;s current accommodation, specifically its fitness for human habitation, having regard to the matters set out in Housing Act 1966, which include the stability of the structure. Decisions on the eligibility of individual households for social housing support are a matter for the local authority concerned.</p></reply>

My Department supports the fire authorities through the setting of overarching policy, providing a central training programme, issuing guidance on operational and other related matters and providing capital funding for priority projects.</p>  <p>  Management of the number, type and age of fire appliances is a matter for each of the local authorities who have responsibility for the assessment of their individual fire cover needs, including the provision and management of a fleet adequate to their requirements. </p>  <p>  My Department funds new fire appliances under national procurement programmes, the most recent of which ran in 2015 and 2017. In June 2018, Sligo County Council requested approval for two new &lsquo;Class B&rsquo; fire appliances, and were advised that this would be considered in future capital programmes. On 1 May 2019, the Council requested funding to purchase a pre-used &lsquo;Class B&rsquo; fire appliance. This request is currently under consideration. All requests for funding from my Department&rsquo;s Fire Services Capital Programme are considered in the context of the available resources, local authorities&rsquo; priorities, the value for money offered by proposals and the totality of requests from fire authorities.</p></reply>

This included an improved funding scheme for individual wells (more commonly known as private or household wells).</p><p>The composition of the new multi-annual programme is based on recommendations from the Working Group that I established in April 2018 to conduct a review of investment needs and rural water services. </p><p>The changes that I have approved to the individual wells grant scheme are, as follows:</p><p>- A maximum grant for rehabilitation works of &euro;3,000, which represents an increase of 47% on the current maximum grant amount,</p><p>- Where the local authority agrees that the most appropriate solution is to provide a new well, the maximum grant payable would be &euro;5,000,</p><p>- Recognising the role of the grant in improving quality, the water quality treatment element (typically filtration and UV filtration) will qualify for 100% funding up to a maximum of &euro;1,000,</p><p>- Up to 85% of other costs would be met, subject to the total combined maximum costs of &euro;3,000 for well rehabilitation or &euro;5,000 for a new well,</p><p>- For clarity, applicants would not be able to avail of both grant amounts, so they would not be able to avail of &euro;3,000 for well rehabilitation as well as the &euro;5,000 for a new well. </p><p>Work is at an advanced stage of development for the funding scheme. I expect that the process will be completed in the coming weeks when the necessary regulations dealing with the financial assistance arrangements and related administrative matters are put in place. This will enable a circular letter, terms and conditions, guidance and the application form to issue to local authorities shortly thereafter.</p><p>Two further funding measures in the new multi-annual programme are relevant to householders that are dependent on individual wells. These measures are:</p><p>- Measure 4 &ndash; New Group Water Schemes: The aim of this funding measure is to facilitate the continued expansion of the coverage of piped water supplies to the rural population through the development of new standalone, or extensions to existing, group water schemes.</p><p>- Measure 6 - Community Water Connections: This measure facilitates the continued expansion of the coverage of piped water supplies by extension off the public (Irish Water) network.</p><p>Details of these measures and the grants available for them under the Multi-annual Rural Water Programme 2019-2021 were notified to local authorities by my Department on 8 February 2019. Local authorities were invited to submit their bids for the funding of schemes or projects in their functional areas, with the deadline for receipt of proposals set as 14 March 2019.</p><p>The tables under set out the numbers of individual well grants and the amount of grant aid recouped by my Department to local authorities for 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 (up to 13 May 2019).<table><tr><th>Local Authority (County Council)</th><th>Numbers of Individual Wells Funded in 2016</th><th>Amount of Grant <br /><br />Aid in 2016 </th></tr><tr><td>Carlow CC</td><td>55</td><td>&euro;

These measures are:</p><p>- Measure 4 &ndash; New Group Water Schemes: The aim of this funding measure is to facilitate the continued expansion of the coverage of piped water supplies to the rural population through the development of new standalone, or extensions to existing, group water schemes.</p><p>- Measure 6 - Community Water and Wastewater Connections: This measure facilitates the continued expansion of the coverage of piped water supplies and wastewater by extension off the public (Irish Water) network.</p><p>Community Water and Wastewater Connections were called new public group water schemes and group sewerage schemes under previous programmes.</p><p>The following levels of grant aid will apply for schemes and projects under these two measures:  </p><p>- New Group Water Schemes and Community Water Connection Networks: Grants of up to 85% of cost are available subject to a maximum grant of &euro;7,650 per house.  This means that the effective cost limit per house is &euro;9,000. ? </p><p>- Community Wastewater Connection Networks: Grants of up to 75% of cost are available subject to a maximum grant of &euro;6,750 per house.  This means that the effective cost limit per house is &euro;9,000. </p><p>A supplemental grant in excess of these limits can be considered but only in exceptional circumstances where full justification is provided.</p><p>Where a supplemental grant is warranted, and approved, the combined basic and supplemental grant will be limited to 90% of the cost per house and subject to minimum household contributions as follows: </p><p>- New Group Water Schemes and Community Water Connection Networks: &euro;1,350. ? </p><p>- Community Wastewater Connection Networks: &euro;2,250. </p><p>Local authorities were invited to submit their bids for the funding of schemes or projects in their functional areas, with the deadline for receipt of proposals set as 14 March 2019.</p><p>My Department is currently considering local authorities' bids for funding allocations. An Expert Panel has been put in place to support the evaluation process. In addition to providing an expert perspective, the Panel brings independence, openness and transparency to the bids evaluation process which is done on a national prioritised basis. The Expert Panel&rsquo;s membership includes Departmental, stakeholder and independent representation.  Consideration of the distribution of funding across each measure under the programme forms part of the evaluation process.</p><p>The Expert Panel will examine the bids, including on the need if relevant for supplemental grants, and make recommendations to my Department on the suitability of schemes and projects for funding based on objective criteria which are set out in the framework document issued to local authorities when proposals were requested. My Department will then consider the recommendations of the Panel, and based on these, will propose allocations for my consideration as Minister. I expect this process to be completed later in the second quarter of 2019.</p></reply>

Prior to its launch, an initial tranche of &euro;200 million of long-term fixed-rate finance was borrowed by the Housing Finance Agency to provide funds for the scheme to local authorities.</p>  <p>  When the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan was initially being developed, it was estimated that the drawdown of loans under the scheme would be approximately &euro;200 million over three years. From the data collated on the scheme to date, the RIHL has proven to be more successful than initially anticipated, as a result of which, the scheme would require a further tranche of funds to be borrowed by the HFA in order to enable its continuation.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently in discussions with the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance with regard to the amount of a second tranche, which I anticipate will be finalised soon. When these discussions are concluded I will be in a position to make an announcement on the matter. However, the scheme remains open and all local authorities have been advised to continue to receive and process applications up to and including the issuing of loans. An announcement on the amount of additional funding to be provided is not inhibiting the running of the scheme in any way.</p></reply>
