The situation is of course complicated by restrictions necessitated by Covid-19. </p>  <p>  Officials from my Department are engaging with officials from Department of Health on the approach to be taken as regards the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly on drugs use, however it is important that the work currently underway in relation to the multidisciplinary response to addiction and recovery should not be delayed while consideration is being given to the correct way to proceed with the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly approach. </p>  <p>  The work of the current Citizens&rsquo; Assembly on gender equality has been delayed by the impact of Covid-19.  The Assembly has had to adapt its methods to comply with Public Health guidelines and is resuming its work with online meetings with the aim of reporting by June 2021.   The experience of the current Assembly of operating on an online basis will inform the approach to the other Citizen's Assemblies to be undertaken in line with the Programme for Government.</p></reply>

The 2020 figures include spend on all Campaigns which were commenced before June 30th  .</p><p>Since March, my Department has co-ordinated communications for the whole-of-government response to the pandemic. This necessitated expenditure on a broad range of targeted public information campaigns.</p><p>The overall communications strategy for Covid-19 is based on a coordinated response that ensures maximum clarity for citizens, businesses and our wider community.This aligns with both World Health Organisation (WHO) and European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) advice, both of which emphasise the importance of ensuring the general public is aware of the seriousness of the COVID-19 outbreak and further that a high degree of population understanding, community engagement and acceptance of the measures put in place are key in preventing further spread. </p><p>It is also recommended that communication strategies should target different audiences and provide the rationale behind the measures, also outlining the necessity to put a support system in place to provide essential services and supplies (e.g. food and medication), and to monitor vulnerable individuals. </p><p>Campaigns have included Radio, newspaper and social elements.</p><p>A number of campaigns were run as restrictions were imposed in order to explain the measures and reinforce public health messages.</p><p>At the beginning of April, a campaign was run to raise awareness of the Community Call Forum, which was established to provide important supports and services to any vulnerable person who needed them via local groups working with State agencies and community and voluntary groups. </p><p>On 1stMay last, the Government&rsquo;s Roadmap to Reopen Society and Business was published.  A communications campaign was run to explain the different phases of the Roadmap.  </p><p>It was also necessary to run campaigns at each phase of the Roadmap as restrictions were lifted. The campaigns associated with the Roadmap were aimed at giving people time to prepare, so that businesses could be ready to open.</p><p>Campaigns were developed to ensure Businesses were aware of the broad level of supports being made available by Government to them and to raise awareness of the Return to Work Safely protocol.</p><p>In all such cases, it is essential that citizens, business owners and communities are informed of the decisions being made by Government, and campaigns are developed and implemented to make the public aware of these decisions.</p><p>In 2019, the spend included &euro;12,000 on online advertising, and &euro;17,000 on video and radio ad production. My Department paid for public information campaigns relating to Budgets 2019 and 2020, for public consultation notices for draft language schemes, and for the &lsquo;Votail100  &rsquo; commemorations.  There was also expenditure for advertisements relating to the recruitment of Judges.</p><p>In 2018  , the &euro;1.6m spend was across online, print, broadcast advertising, and production costs. The spend related to major cross-Government public information campaigns that the Department funded centrally. These campaigns included Healthy Ireland, Global Ireland, Project Ireland 2040 and the Self Employed Benefits campaign, aimed at ensuring self-employed people are aware of the new and existing benefits available to them. </p><p>In 2017,the &euro;40,000 spend related to cross-Government public information campaigns on Healthy Ireland and Self-Employed benefits.</p><p>In, 2016,the &euro;10,000 spend related to the Home to Work information campaign.</p></reply>

Where such window restrictions are an integral part of the window operating gear they come under the remit of the Construction Products Regulation (Regulation (EU) No 305/2011) and fall under the responsibility of my colleague&rsquo;s Department.</p>  <p>  With regard to window restrictors that are sold as separate items, which are not covered by EU harmonised standards, these products fall under the remit of the General Product Safety Directive (Directive 2001/95/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 3 December 2001 on General Product Safety) which was transposed into Irish law by S.I. No. 199 of 2004 and thus come within the responsibility of my Department. </p>  <p>  The Standard EN 13126-5 &ldquo;Building hardware - Hardware for windows and door height windows - Requirements and test methods - Part 5: Devices that restrict the opening of windows and door height windows&rdquo;, is not a harmonised EN cited in the Official Journal of the EU and therefore the appropriate legislation dealing with these products is Directive 2001/95/EC.</p>  <p>  Directive 2001/95/EC places the onus on all economic operators &ndash; manufacturers, distributors, importers &ndash; to ensure that only safe products are placed on the market. If economic operators become aware that products on the market present a potential hazard, they must take appropriate measures, up to and including recall of the items, to ensure that the risk is removed. Any action taken by an operator must be notified to the relevant Market Surveillance Authority: in Ireland this is the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC), which is statutorily independent in the carrying out of its functions.</p>  <p>  Where the CCPC finds unsafe products on the Irish market, it will act to ensure economic operators remove the product from the market until it is in compliance with the legislation. The CCPC is part of an EU wide network (known as Safety Gate) that allows for the rapid exchange of information between national market surveillance authorities on dangerous products found on the EU market. </p>  <p>  Section 9 (5) of the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014 provides that the CCPC is independent in the performance of its functions, including carrying out investigations of unsafe products. As investigations and enforcement matters generally are part of the day-to-day operational work of the CCPC, I, as the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment have no direct function in the matter.</p>  <p>  Should the Deputy have any information in relation to unsafe window restrictors on the Irish market, he should make contact with the CCPC directly to provide any relevant information on these matters.</p></reply>

The grant could be used to defray ongoing fixed costs during closure, for example, utilities, insurance, refurbishment or for measures to ensure employee and customer safety.</p><p>In seeking to support the most exposed and at risk micro and small businesses, my Department has sought to put as few obstacles as possible in the way of eligible businesses accessing funding; under the Restart Plus Grant the criteria was raised from turnover of less than &euro;5m to less than &euro;25m.</p><p>I am not aware of this question as a widespread concern and where clarification of the eligibility criteria has been necessary the Local Authorities have engaged proactively with my officials to tease out how best to proceed. I can advise the Deputy that in a circumstance, subject to consideration of the particular application in line with the established eligibility criteria, where a firm or sector argues that its turnover is inflated by a disproportionate cost of sales (e.g., the manufacturer&rsquo;s price of a product to a retailer), a rejected applicant can appeal the case to their Local Authority for consideration by providing evidence of the net or &lsquo;real&rsquo; turnover of the local business in question. Any appeal should be made within seven days of receiving the initial decision. </p><p>In addition to the Restart Plus Grant, there are other supports available to businesses, from, for example, Enterprise Ireland, the Local Enterprise Offices, MicroFinance Ireland, and InterTrade Ireland.

We have extended the wage subsidy scheme, which will run until the end of March 2021 and will be open to firms that do not currently participate and open to workers like seasonal workers who were not previously included, and we are giving companies extra assistance through an enhanced Restart Plus grant of up to &euro;25,000. From 1st  September, the six-month reduction in the VAT came into effect, going down from 23% to 21%. </p><p>We are providing more and cheaper loan finance through MicroFinance Ireland, SBCI and the new &euro;2bn Credit Guarantee Scheme.

A company, both during normal operation and during insolvency must also of course abide by all relevant legal requirements including in relation to the treatment of employees and creditors and disclosure to Revenue.</p>  <p>  The Companies Act 2014 provides provisions which may be utilised by examiners, liquidators or creditors (which can include employees of a company) of an insolvent company in appropriate cases, including sections 557 and 608, regarding the court power to order the return of assets which have been improperly transferred; and section 599 where a related company may be required to contribute to the debts of a company being wound up.  A range of factors will be involved for examiners, liquidators or creditors in deciding whether to pursue litigation based on these provisions of the Companies Act 2014. </p>  <p>  The provisions of the Companies Act 2014 provide safeguards to prevent the abuse of the liquidation system.  These include preferential payments under section 621.  A preferential creditor is one whose debts are deemed to be more important than the debts of another creditor.  The current law is a result of careful balancing of the various rights of creditors, including employees. In terms of wage arrears, outstanding holiday pay, and pension scheme contributions, employees are always considered preferred creditors. In relation to redundancy entitlements it is the responsibility of the employer in the first instance to pay statutory redundancy and other wage related entitlements to eligible employees.  However, the Social Insurance Fund, under the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection provides a safety net for employees in situations where the employer cannot pay due to financial difficulties or insolvency.    </p>  <p>  In addition, the liquidator of an insolvent company must report to the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement (ODCE) on its demise and must also apply to the High Court for the restriction of each of the directors of the company, unless they are relieved of that obligation by the ODCE.  </p>  <p>  Such statutory provisions and associated civil and criminal penalties also provide an important deterrent effect.</p>  <p>  The Government has committed in the Programme for Government to:</p>  <p>  - Review whether the current legal provisions surrounding collective redundancies and the liquidation of companies effectively protect the rights of workers;</p>  <p>  - Review the Companies Act with a view to addressing the practice of trading entities splitting their operations between trading and property with the result being the trading business (including the jobs) go into insolvency and the assets are taken out of the original business;</p>  <p>  - Examine the legal provision that pertains to any sale to a connected party following the insolvency of a company including who can object and the allowable grounds of an objection.</p>  <p>  I have asked the Company Law Review Group to undertake an expedited review of these commitments as they relate to company law, to be completed before the end of the year.</p></reply>

This is reflected in the recent and ongoing work of my Department, and in the Programme for Government, which contains commitments aimed at facilitating remote working across Ireland. </p><p>Last December my Department published the Remote Work in Ireland report. This outlined the prevalence and types of remote working in existence in Ireland. It also identified influencing factors on the part of both employers and employees.</p><p>One of the findings of the report was the need for further guidance for employers and employees. My Department is now working to deliver guidance that will fill that need. An Interdepartmental Group, consisting of relevant departments and agencies, has been formed to steer the delivery of this guidance. </p><p>The &lsquo;Guidance for Working Remotely during COVID-19' webpage is a central access point for all of the Government guidance currently available on remote working. The allows employers and employees to navigate the existing guidance easily and helps to inform those working from home during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>In July, my Department launched a public consultation on remote working guidance to help us to understand what remote working issues are most pressing for employers and employees. Once the results of this consultation have been analysed, we will focus on the key issues arising and identify where work can be completed to address these issues. The guidance webpage will be updated following the consultation to address the noted areas of concern and provide employers and employees with additional guidance to facilitate remote working in the long term. The webpage will be regularly updated to reflect any changes made in response to the consultation.</p><p>The Programme for Government recognises that facilitating remote working and innovation opportunities is essential for addressing climate change, adapting to an evolving economy and competing internationally. It contains a number of commitments to encourage remote working across our country. This includes the commitment to develop a national remote working strategy<i>.</i>My Department is leading on this action. Work is currently underway on this under the guidance of an Interdepartmental Group and it is expected to be published in the coming months.</p></reply>

Membership of the CLRG is broad and representative of key stakeholders in the area such as ISME, IBEC, ICTU, the Revenue Commissioners, insolvency and legal practitioners and regulators, making it uniquely well positioned to provide an informed view on the matter. I expect the CLRG to report to me by the end of this month.</p>  <p>  I know that the cost of examinership is prohibitive for smaller businesses. I have asked the CLRG to conduct its review in the context of reducing the costs and administrative burden associated with rescue so as to make it more accessible to SMEs under the following terms of reference:</p>  <p>  1. Examine and make recommendation as to how the statutory scheme of arrangement provisions of the Companies Act 2014 might be adapted to provide a rescue framework for SMEs.</p>  <p>  2. Examine and make recommendation as to ways in which key elements of the examinership process, including a stay on enforcement proceedings and a cross-class cram-down, might be incorporated into a rescue framework for SMEs.</p>  <p>  3. Other EU Member States provide for voluntary restructuring processes, with a strong emphasis on creditor agreement. Examine and make recommendation as to whether such a process is desirable in an Irish context with particular emphasis on the French framework (mandate ad hoc procedure).</p>  <p>  4. Any other recommendations the CLRG consider appropriate.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the impact of any amendments in respect of corporate rescue extend far beyond a company and its directors. Consideration must also be given to the implications of any such changes for creditors, who are often other companies, and employees. There is a delicate balance to be struck between the competing needs of affected stakeholders and I will consider the CLRG's Report carefully in this regard. </p>  <p>  I remain committed to exploring ways in which we can support SMEs while also ensuring the appropriate safeguards remain in place for creditors and employees.</p></reply>

This package contained measures including:</p><p>- Restart Grant Plus 40% Top Up: Those businesses remaining closed and planning their re-opening can now receive a minimum of &euro;5,600 and a maximum of &euro;35,000 under the Restart Grant Plus. This can be used to help additional expense and adaptations associated with re-opening when the time comes. </p><p>- Waiver of court fees and associated excise and stamp duties relating to the renewal of pub and other liquor licences in 2020.</p><p>- Waiver of excise duty on on-trade liquor licences on renewal in 2020.</p><p>These measures have been implemented in addition to the existing Restart Grant Plus, Tourism Adaptation Fund, the wage subsidy scheme, commercial rates waiver, liquidity supports and tax measures (such as warehousing of tax debt and reduction in VAT).</p><p>The Restart Grant Plus provides direct grant aid to businesses with up to 250 employees to help them with the costs associated with reopening and reemploying workers following COVID-19 closures. Top-ups were previously made available for eligible businesses in Kildare, Laois, Offaly, Dublin and Donegal in respect of a further period of restrictions, for &lsquo;wet&rsquo; pubs, bars and nightclubs nationwide that re-opened on 21 September, and for &lsquo;wet&rsquo; pubs, bars and nightclubs in Dublin that remain closed. </p><p>Businesses in Dublin and Donegal were generally eligible for a grant top-up due to the restrictions imposed at that time. Donegal pubs remained partially open, so the pubs were entitled to an additional top-up in recognition of the restrictions imposed. Meanwhile, Dublin pubs that were forced to remain closed were entitled to a further enhanced top-up.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, on 6th  October 2020 all parts of the country moved to Level Three of the Government&rsquo;s Framework for Restrictive Measures for a period of three weeks. </p><p>I understand that these restrictions have a significant impact on businesses and employment around the country. In recognition of the impact of these restrictions on businesses, a 30% top-up to the Restart Plus grant is being provided to help support those affected through the three-week period. In addition, in recognising that Level 3 has been extended in Dublin and Donegal beyond the three-week period, businesses in these counties are eligible for a further top-up in addition to those made available in September. Businesses in the hospitality sector and other vulnerable sectors who have previously benefited from the Restart Grant are eligible to re-apply for this top-up.</p><p>These supports are supplementary to the wide range of existing loan and voucher schemes available to assist businesses affected by COVID-19 provided through the July Jobs Stimulus and other Government initiatives. </p><p>Further information on top-up payments and application forms for the Restart Grant Plus Scheme are available on the websites of all Local Authorities. The closing date for receipt of applications to the scheme has been extended to 31st  October 2020 to ensure the scheme is accessible to as many businesses as possible.</p><p>All COVID-19 Business Schemes are under constant review in terms of the evolving situation and will be adapted as circumstances dictate. Today, Budget 2021 will include a number of proposals to further support workers and businessess. I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to work with my colleagues across Government and all stakeholders to examine how best to further assist businesses impacted by Covid-19 as part of Budget 2021 and the National Economic Plan.</p><p>Details of the wide range of COVID-19 supports available are noted on this Department&rsquo;s website at </p></reply>

I know that some firms are concerned about how they are going to continue to pay the rent due for their business premises. Throughout this crisis, the Government has been encouraging commercial tenants and landlords to engage with each other and have asked landlords to show forbearance in these extraordinary times. Ultimately, it is in the best interest of both parties to come to a reasonable arrangement.</p><p>To date the Government has provided enhanced provisions to a value of almost &euro;20 billion including the &euro;7.4 billion July Stimulus Package. The July Stimulus Package was, as promised, a package of measures of sufficient scale that demonstrates the commitment this Government has to save enterprises, limit the damage to our economy wreaked by this pandemic and get our people back to work. Indeed, it is bigger in scale than most budgets and it is being deployed at speed. It includes:</p><p>- A new Employment Wage Support Scheme succeeding the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme;</p><p>- Restart Grants of up to &euro;25,000 available to a broad category of businesses such as hairdressers, sports clubs, cafes, restaurants, B&amp;amp;Bs, and independent hotels to help cover the costs incurred during closure and reopening costs;</p><p>- The &lsquo;Stay and Spend&rsquo; initiative will see consumers benefit by up to &euro;125 each for expenditure on hospitality activities during the traditional &lsquo;off peak&rsquo; for this sector;</p><p>- A &euro;10 million Restart Fund for the Tourism Sector;</p><p>- The new &euro;2 billion COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme to provide Irish businesses with access to low cost loans as they respond to the impacts of COVID-19. This is the biggest ever state-backed loan guarantee in Ireland;</p><p>- The recently reopened Microfinance Ireland Covid-19 Loan scheme; and</p><p>- Several other initiatives to provide vital liquidity to all impacted firms have been introduced including rates waivers, temporary VAT reductions, delayed payment of PAYE and VAT debts, in part or in full, for a set period with no interest or penalties, and the early carry back of trading losses providing immediate cash-flow support to previously profitable companies.</p><p>Recognising the economic impact of Covid-19 on pubs, bars and nightclubs, and to assist planning and adaptation for their re-opening, an additional &euro;16 million support package for this sector was announced at the end of August. This included a 40% Restart Grant Plus Top Up for pubs, bars and nightclubs that remain closed to help them to reopen, a waiver of court fees and associated excise and stamp duties relating to the renewal of pub and other liquor licences in 2020 and a waiver of excise duty on on-trade liquor licences on renewal in 2020.</p><p>On 1st October, I published a new voluntary Code of Conduct between Landlords and Tenants for Commercial Rents. The Code, which is a commitment in the Programme for Government, has been developed in consultation with relevant stakeholders, including Ibec, Retail Excellence Ireland, Chambers Ireland and Irish Institutional Property. It is based on an approach taken in other jurisdictions, including Australia, France and the UK.</p><p>The Code sets out how both parties can work together to get through these uncertain times. Landlords should be willing to do what they can to help their tenants to continue to operate rather than facing the risk of a vacant premises and inability to obtain new tenants.  Equally, tenants should pay what they can and speak with their landlord when difficulties arise.</p><p>The Code can be found on my Department&rsquo;s website here: <i></i></p></reply>

In addition, 19,000 or so business owners-managers had benefitted from advice and peer-to-peer support through their participation in the information seminars delivered by the Local Enterprise Offices under the Scheme.</p>  <p>  In response to Covid-19, funding for the Scheme in 2020 was increased from &euro;2.3m to &euro;39.8m, and new flexibilities were introduced including reducing the requirement for co-funding from 50% to 10% and allowing businesses to apply for a second voucher of up to &euro;2,500 where they have successfully utilised their first one. </p>  <p>  The primary intent of the Scheme is to assist businesses to develop their own website to deliver the longer term benefits of e-commerce. However this does not preclude a business that does not operate a website but promotes their service or product through social media platform from applying under the Scheme.</p></reply>

The primary focus of this scheme is to provide support for the installation of infrastructure which will facilitate owners of EVs, who do not have access to a private parking space but rely on parking their vehicles in public places near their homes, to charge their EVs.</p>  <p>  My Department, via the SEAI, currently provides a grant of up to &euro;5,000 to support the installation of these charge points and this support will continue into 2021. Since the launch of the scheme, the SEAI has received requests from twelve local authorities for applications under the scheme with two local authorities submitting applications, which are currently being assessed for approval, to install a total of 24 charge points within their respective jurisdictions. In addition, the four Dublin local authorities are examining their approach for a network of charging infrastructure in the metropolitan area. </p>  <p>  Local Government has been to the forefront in recent times in addressing the climate challenge and the sector will have a key role to play in helping to decarbonise our national fleet through facilitating the provision of EV charging infrastructure in appropriate locations at both the local and regional level. </p>  <p>  In this regard it should be noted that my Department is working closely with a number of key stakeholders, including Local Government, on developing a strategy to ensure electric vehicle charging infrastructure stays ahead of demand. This includes developing appropriate guidance for local authorities in line with the Programme for Government and will ensure we can continue to expand our national charging network through the relevant SEAI supports for on street chargers. </p></reply>

It sets out legislative requirements for each Local Authority to produce a Climate Action Plan, on the request of the Minister for Climate Action, within eighteen months of the enactment of the Bill, and subsequently, at least once every five years. These plans will have to be consistent with national climate plans and strategies, and Local Authorities will have to liaise with each other and their stakeholders in the preparation of these plans.</p>  <p>  Preparation is also underway to develop an effective citizen engagement model which will motivate changes in behaviour, and create structures at local, regional and national levels to support the generation of ideas and their translation into appropriate cost-effective actions. Work on stakeholder engagement is in progress across a number of sectors, and my Department is currently developing a policy paper for the future of this new engagement model which will draw together various initiatives, as well as work by the Environmental Protection Agency, and engagement activities undertaken by Local Authorities and the Climate Action Regional Offices.</p>  <p>  Given their close relationship with the community, Local Authorities are uniquely positioned to facilitate effective climate action, and provide local leadership through various community networks, including Age Friendly Ireland, the Public Participation Networks, Tidy Towns and the GAA. Under the new engagement model, Local Authorities will continue to explore options for additional strategic partnerships supporting climate action, and the roll-out of the pilot projects, community workshops and training courses, similar to &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s Talk Climate Action&rdquo; town hall meeting, the &ldquo;Community-led Climate Action&rdquo; workshop, and the free &lsquo;Communities 4 Climate Action&rsquo; training course, all of which were delivered in late 2019.</p></reply>

Ireland is a world leader at incorporating large amounts of wind-generated electricity onto the network and there is substantial future growth potential for wind power in Ireland. The Climate Action Plan included a commitment to deliver at least 3.5 GW of offshore wind by 2030 and up to 8.2 GW of onshore wind; the Programme for Government commits to a further increase in offshore wind deployment to 5 GW by 2030.</p>  <p>  To support the delivery of the national ambition to further decrease our dependence on fossil fuels my Department has developed the Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) which will assist Ireland in meeting its renewable energy contribution out to 2030 by providing supports to a range of technologies including onshore and offshore wind projects.The first RESS auction results were approved by Government in September 2020. 479MW of additional onshore wind energy projects were successful in this first RESS auction and these projects are expected to become operational by 2022. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s National Energy and Climate Plan (Table 6 of the Plan) sets out estimated trajectories by renewable energy technology in order to achieve the overall and sectoral trajectories for renewable energy from 2021 to 2030.  These technology levels are indicative and for electricity the level of each technology will be driven by technology costs and competitive auctions under the Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) as well as major private sector funding through Corporate Power Purchase Agreements.</p></reply>

As part of those engagements, I have met with senior management of ESB and SSE and discussed a wide range of issues relevant to my current portfolio. </p><p>The electricity and gas retail markets in Ireland operate within a European Union regulatory regime wherein electricity and gas markets are commercial, liberalised, and competitive. Operating within this overall EU framework, responsibility for the regulation of the electricity and gas markets is solely a matter for the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU), which was assigned responsibility for the regulation of the Irish electricity and gas markets following the enactment of the Electricity Regulation Act (ERA), 1999.The CRU is an independent statutory Regulator and is accountable for the performance of its functions to the Oireachtas, and not to me as Minister. The Deputy may wish to note that CRU provides a dedicated email address for Oireachtas members, which enables them raise questions on energy regulatory matters to CRU at oireachtas@cru.ie for timely direct reply.</p><p>  As regards CRU's role in price determination, in line with long standing policy on deregulating price setting, CRU ended its regulation of retail prices in the electricity market in 2011, and in the gas market in 2014. Given that prices are no longer regulated, they are set by all suppliers as entirely commercial and operational matters by them. Each such company has its own different approach to pricing decisions over time, in accordance with factors such as their overall company strategic direction and developments in their cost base. The position of successive Governments, for almost twenty years, has been that competitive energy markets result in greater choice for consumers and businesses, in terms of suppliers, products and prices and to support competition to drive down prices.  Data from approved price comparison sites shows that consumers can make significant savings by switching energy suppliers and this can mitigate for consumers the impact of price rises. While there have been a number of recent price increases, one supplier has frozen both electricity and gas prices until March 2021 and another has reduced its price for gas by 10%, underscoring the importance of switching to avail of the most competitive offer in the market.</p><p>  The Government is acutely aware of the financial challenges faced by families and businesses during these exceptional times and has accordingly introduced and continues to provide an unprecedented suite of supports for households, businesses and individuals including via social welfare schemes overseen by my colleague the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection. These welfare supports include specific schemes aimed at those at risk of energy poverty including the Household Benefits Package and the fuel allowance.</p><p>  Additionally, my Department provides extensive supports for household energy costs, via energy efficiency grants provided via the SEAI with specific schemes aimed at those at risk of energy poverty. In this regard the July Stimulus package commits to increasing the SEAI budget by &euro;100 million in 2021. This additional funding will be focused on community retrofit schemes, retrofit schemes supporting those in energy poverty as well as other initiatives to support the achievement of our retrofit targets. Additional detail on other new and expanded schemes as well as an increased allocation for the Warmer Homes Scheme will be announced after the Budget.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-10-13a.134.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020101300068#WRC04500"><p>The PSO levy has been in place since 2001, and is a charge on all electricity customers without exception. It consists of a set of support schemes designed to facilitate national electricity policy objectives for renewables and security of supply. From a policy standpoint, the PSO has been and will continue to be a vital policy support for the development of renewable electricity and to enable Ireland to reach EU renewable energy targets and our own national energy and climate targets as stated in Ireland's National Energy and Climate Plan, Climate Action Plan and the Programme for Government.</p>  <p>  Under the PSO legislation, the calculation of the Levy is strictly a matter for the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, the independent electricity and gas regulator. The legal basis for the PSO levy and its method of calculation are set out in regulations made under the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 and in the Public Service Obligations Order 2002 (S.I. 217 of 2002) under which the CRU is assigned responsibility for calculation of the levy each year. </p>  <p>  The CRU&rsquo;s decision on the PSO for 2020/21 will result in an increase in the PSO for households of &euro;3.68 per month. As regards impacts on electricity customers, I am acutely aware of the financial challenges faced by households during these exceptional times. Government provides extensive supports for household energy costs via welfare schemes and energy efficiency grants, with specific schemes aimed at those at risk of energy poverty. Welfare supports include the Household Benefits Package and the fuel allowance and both are matters for the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection.</p>  <p>  Energy efficiency upgrades are provided free of charge to households at risk of energy poverty mainly through the Warmer Homes scheme, operated by the Sustainable Authority of Ireland (SEAI) on behalf of my Department. In 2020 the budget allocated is &euro;52.8 million, the largest ever budget allocation for the scheme. Additional detail on other new and expanded schemes as well as an increased allocation for the Warmer Homes Scheme will be announced after the Budget.</p>  <p>  The PSO is only one part of the monthly electricity bill. Electricity customers can save on the variable part of the bill by switching electricity supplier or engaging with their suppliers. Price comparison websites, approved by the CRU, can assist consumers to switch. As of 6 October 2020, depending on the tariff they are on, consumers could save up to &euro;307 annually by switching suppliers, and thereby help mitigate the PSO increase.</p></reply>

This additional funding will be focused on community retrofit schemes, retrofit schemes supporting those in energy poverty as well as other initiatives to support the achievement of our retrofit targets.  The funding supported the first call for projects under the new National Homes Retrofit Scheme which was launched on 25 September.  This scheme is suitable for one-stop-shops, residential service providers, employers, financial institutions, Approved Housing Bodies and local authorities.  Details are available at: <i>www.seai.ie.</i></p><p>By announcing this additional funding as part of the July Stimulus, the Government provided certainty to the sector so that they can continue approved programmes of work, bid into new and expanded schemes, maintain a pipeline of retrofit activity, and sustain and create jobs.

This has the potential to support modal shift ambitions and improve air quality and public health in local communities across the country.</p><p>The <i>Strategy</i>sets out the high-level principles that prospective greenways are required to demonstrate while individual funding calls may set further specific requirements as may be determined from time to time. I would not classify the approach as &ldquo;one-size-fits-all&rdquo; and think there is appropriate flexibility provided by the existing framework, but I am happy to hear any specific suggestions the Deputy may have in that regard. Clearly any proposed greenway development in environmentally sensitive areas must comply with all necessary requirements. </p><p>Since the publication of the <i>Strategy</i>in 2018, &euro;40m was allocated to nine construction-ready projects, while in 2020 a further &euro;4.5m from the Carbon Tax Fund was allocated to support 26 pre-construction phase projects, and all details of relevant projects supported are available on my Department's website. </p><p>In Budget 2021 I am providing further future allocations available to support the greenways programme as part of Government&rsquo;s broader &euro;1.8bn commitment to support walking and cycling over the lifetime of the Government. </p><p>The Deputy may wish to be aware that urban greenways in the five cities are supported through a separate funding programme administered by the National Transport Authority.</p></reply>

There is no question about that, and it has resulted in job losses and extreme hardship across the sector on workers and on previously thriving businesses.  In recognition of this, the Government has introduced a range of financial measures to help alleviate the worst of this hardship - through wage supports, commercial rates waivers, tax deferrals, and various grants and liquidity schemes - and the Budget will seek to do more.  However, unquestionably what the industry needs is the opportunity to start trading properly again and to begin on the road to recovery.  That is what Government wants too.</p>  <p>  The international travel restrictions have been in place for much longer that we would have hoped for earlier in the year, but for so long as they are deemed an essential part of the overall effort to contain the spread of the virus then the negative impact on Irish aviation is unavoidable.  The Aviation Taskforce has set out clearly what the industry needs to recover, and whilst not all of this is possible at this stage, what can be done has been done: wage subsidy has been extended to April next year; liquidity supports have been made available through the ISIF Pandemic Stability Fund; safe air travel protocols have been finalised and published; and emergency funding has been allocated in support of Shannon Airport.</p>  <p>  In addition, every effort is being made to agree European travel standards and to develop a national framework that will allow us to adopt and apply those standards as best as possible.  The Government is committed to this, but it is also the case that introducing a workable and effective testing regime to support greater levels of international air travel is challenging.  </p>  <p>  International and regional air connectivity is highly valued by the Government.  It is the backbone of our economic model.  Protecting it remains high on the Government agenda.</p></reply>

These requirements are put in place to support road safety; in effect to ensure vehicles are roadworthy. </p>  <p>  The records on the NVDF show that the vehicle registration in question was recorded as scrapped on the system by Offaly Motor Tax Office on 19 May 19 2005.  As per the procedure outlined above, the vehicle record was &lsquo;locked down&rsquo; on that date. Where your constituent subsequently queried the matter, either with my Department or the motor tax office in question, they would have been advised of the procedure in how to have the scrapped status removed.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the above, my officials have engaged further with Offaly Motor Tax Office on the matter, and you may wish to have your constituent contact Offaly Motor Tax Office on the matter to discuss some alternative options. The records also note that the NCT on the vehicle expired on August 18 2004. A valid NCT certificate is required for the vehicle to be used on the public road.</p></reply>

There are two vacancies in the special interest or expertise categories, two vacancies in the small public service vehicle and driver interests category and one vacancy in the consumer interest category. I will shortly ask the Public Appointments Service (PAS) to launch an open process - through the State Boards facility administered by PAS - for filling these positions on the Advisory Committee.  </p>  <p>  As the centralised provider of recruitment, assessment and selection services for the Civil Service and other public bodies, PAS aims to provide an open, efficient and effective gateway and process to identify top quality people for consideration by Ministers for appointment to State Boards.

The Committee submitted a report in July with a number of recommendations and since then my Department has worked with the Committee to examine how these can be addressed. The report has been shared with other Government Departments and has served as a useful basis for engagement to ensure that SPSV operators, many of whom are self-employed, are able to access to the greatest extent possible the range of measures Government has introduced to support businesses through these difficult circumstances.</p>  <p>  The Advisory Committee, which is established under the Taxi Regulation Act 2013, enjoys a broad membership with members representing driver interests, dispatch operators, passenger interests, and official stakeholders such as local Government and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. This diversity of representation, combined with members' commitment to having a well-functioning and effective SPSV sector, is a real strength of the Committee.  It has been and will remain the central focus of engagement with the SPSV sector for my Department in relation to issues affecting the sector, including the impact of COVID-19. In addition, the National Transport Authority, as statutory regulator for the sector, will of course continue to engage with the industry and communicate regularly with individual SPSV operators in relation to the ongoing impact of COVID-19.</p></reply>

I am pleased to say, my Department has already given approval to the RSA to retain 18 driver testers on  temporary contracts due to expire in October and November, and to rehire up to 19 testers whose contracts expired in May. The authority is also examining the recruitment and training of new driver testers. However, I would  like to stress that many of the issues impacting on the delivery of service are concerned with the throughput of centres themselves in light of the restrictions, rather than on the availability of staff.</p>  <p>  The RSA are also looking at a number of other measures, including whether the number of tests a driver tester can perform each day can be increased and scheduling additional overtime tests, including testing on Saturdays to increase capacity.</p>  <p>  It is my understanding that those who had appointments cancelled due to Covid 19 are being prioritised in the first instance. Priority then will be given in order of application date.  While there is some capacity for urgent test slots, the Road Safety Authority (RSA)'s capacity to make these available in all cases will be limited. Therefore, initially those who are frontline healthcare workers will be deemed eligible for an urgent test slot. This approach for prioritising customers will be kept under review as the RSA moves through the service resumption.</p></reply>

The primary purpose of the Act was to replace the system whereby a vehicle was declared off the road retrospectively with a system under which the vehicle must be declared off the road in advance.  </p>  <p>  Under these provisions introduced in 2013, a declaration must be made in the last month of an existing motor tax disc or renewed in the last month of a previously made declaration of non-use. The declaration can be made for any number of calendar months between 3 and 12 months i.e. it cannot be made for a period of 1 or 2 months.  If a vehicle is subsequently required to be put back on the road, the declaration can be broken at any time simply by taxing the vehicle.</p>  <p>  Where a declaration is not made in advance, arrears of motor tax must be paid in full and motor tax paid for a minimum of 3 months before a declaration of non-use can then be made in the final month of the tax disc.  </p>  <p>  There are no plans to re-introduce retrospective declarations of non-use, the cost of which, at the time of introduction of the legislation, was estimated at some &euro;110m annually.</p>  <p>  Motor tax receipts are a significant contributor to Exchequer finances and form part of the means in ensuring that Covid-19 supports can continue in the short-term, in helping the re-building of the economy and in ensuring the ongoing provision of public services.   In this regard, the Deputy will be aware that the Government has channelled significant Exchequer resources towards the introduction of an extensive range of supports for Covid-impacted businesses, including rates waivers, re-start grants, lending facilities, equity injection, business advisory supports and supports for businesses impacted by restrictions.  In terms of social protections, resources have been allocated to the continuation of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment and Wage Subsidy Schemes into next year.   </p></reply>

Accordingly, when those bus priority proposals on the N11 / M11 corridor are further advanced, the  NTA  will assess the potential for park and ride locations on this route, including in the north Wexford area.</p></reply>

The cost of the scheme in 2019, excluding motor tax, was &euro;72m. </p>  <p>  The Scheme is open to severely and permanently disabled persons as a driver or as a passenger and also to certain organisations. In order to qualify for relief an organisation must be entered in the register of charitable organisations under Part 3 of the Charities Act 2009, be engaged in the transport of disabled persons and whose purpose is to provide services to persons with disabilities.</p>  <p>  In order to qualify for relief the applicant must hold a Primary Medical Certificate (PMC) issued by the relevant Senior Area Medical Officer (SAMO) or a Board Medical Certificate (BMC) issued by the Disabled Driver Medical Board of Appeal. Certain other criteria apply in relation to the vehicle and its use, including that the vehicle must be specially constructed or adapted for use by the applicant.   </p>  <p>  The terms of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994 set out the following medical criteria, and that one or more of these criteria is required to be satisfied in order to obtain a PMC:</p>  <p>  - be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs; </p>  <p>  - be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs; </p>  <p>  - be without both hands or without both arms; </p>  <p>  - be without one or both legs; </p>  <p>  - be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg; </p>  <p>  - have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.  </p>  <p>A Supreme Court decision of 18 June found in favour of two appellants against the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal's refusal to grant them a PMC. The judgement found that the medical criteria set out in the Regulations did not align with the regulation making mandate given in the primary legislation to further define criteria for &lsquo;severely and permanently disabled&rsquo; persons. </p>  <p>  The Deputies will appreciate that the complex legal and policy issues raised by the Supreme Court decision will require careful consideration. In parallel to that consideration there is a need to examine how best the Scheme can target resources to those persons who most need them. My officials are currently examining the judgement, in conjunction with the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office, and will bring forward any policy and/or legislative proposals, as necessary, for my consideration in due course.  </p>  <p>  In the interim, on foot of the legal advice received, it became clear that it was appropriate to revisit the six medical criteria set out in Regulation 3 of Statutory Instrument 353 of 1994 for these assessments. In such circumstances, it is not proposed to continue with PMC assessments until a revised basis for such assessments is established. The medical officers who are responsible for conducting PMC assessments need to have assurance that the decisions they make are based on clear criteria set out in legislation.

I have also written to the Minister for Health to request that there are no further PMC assessments until a sound legal basis for such assessments is re-established. </p>  <p>  While it is regrettable that PMC assessments are currently not taking place and I acknowledge that this will result in a growing waiting list, I anticipate that the work that is currently ongoing in relation to this matter will provide a proper basis for me to make a decision on the best pathway forward and to address the current legal uncertainty surrounding the Scheme.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-10-13a.244.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020101300070#WRE05500"><p>Let me say at the outset that I am very much aware of the problems faced by many businesses in relation to the availability and affordability of public liability insurance, including those in the tourism sector, such as walking and mountaineering guides.  However, as this is a commercial matter, neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can direct the pricing of insurance products, and neither can we compel any insurer operating in the Irish market to provide cover.  This position is reinforced by the EU Single Market framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive) which expressly prohibits Member States from doing so.  What Government can do is to make reforms designed to improve matters and this is the focus of this Government.</p>  <p>  In that regard and as the Deputy will appreciate, there is no single policy or legislative fix to remedy the cost and availability of insurance issue, however insurance reform is a key policy priority for this Government and this is reflected in the Programme for Government (PfG).  There are a number of areas that require reform and this is why making progress on these problems requires a &lsquo;whole-of-Government&rsquo; approach as recognised in the PfG. This lays out specific commitments that are aimed at addressing consumer and business concerns on the cost of insurance.  These include increasing transparency on claims; reviewing duty of care legislation; looking at how to further enhance the role of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board; minimising the scope for questionable claims; and increasing competition in the market. </p>  <p>  Implementation of this agenda will be a key issue for myself and Minister of State Fleming as well other members of Cabinet, especially those that will be working on this through the recently established Cabinet Committee on Economic Recovery and Investment&rsquo;s Sub-Group on Insurance Reform.  This Sub-Group held its inaugural meeting on 1 October and identified a number of key deliverables to be progressed before the end of 2020.  The Sub-group is chaired by the T&aacute;naiste, and also includes myself, Ministers McGrath, McEntee, and O&rsquo;Gorman, together with Ministers of State Troy and Fleming as standing members.  I believe that this Sub-Group provides the best opportunity to address the cost and availability of insurance through a cross-Governmental response.  We will build and expand upon the previous commendable work done by the Cost of Insurance Working Group. </p>  <p>  As you will be aware, a number of important reforms have already taken place, and the impact of these is reflected in the recent CSO data which indicate that the cost of private motor insurance is now almost a third cheaper than at its peak in July 2016. The Sub-Group will focus on those reforms needed to ensure that similar reductions in cost can be extended to other areas of insurance, most notably, Employer and Public Liability insurance, which are among the main concerns for businesses such as those mentioned in the question. </p>  <p>  Undoubtedly, in that regard, a necessary step is to bring the levels of personal injury damages awarded in this country more in line with those awarded in other jurisdictions. The establishment of the Judicial Council last December is very important in this regard, and it is expected that the Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee will submit draft Guidelines to the Judicial Council before the end of the year.  It is desirable that the Guidelines could play a role in the lowering of award levels and also could lead to a more consistent application of making awards in courts.  Insurance Ireland has indicated that if award levels come down so will premiums charged by its members.  I believe that this is a very important statement and this Government intends holding the insurance industry to this commitment.</p>  <p>  In conclusion, the Deputy can rest assured that in addition to all the other measures that Government has taken over recent months to support smaller businesses, such as those in the tourism sector, the issue of insurance reform is a key priority issue for this Government. In that context we will continue to seek to ensure that progress is made in this policy area.</p></reply>

The EWSS will remain in place until March 2021, thereby allowing employers to rely on the continuation of support over a longer period of 8 months while also ensuring such support is sustainable and affordable. It should be noted that while the TWSS was essentially an employee based subsidy which had to be passed on to the employees through the normal weekly / fortnightly /monthly payroll runs, the EWSS is an employer subsidy to help support viable firms and employers insofar as is possible.  </p>  <p>  A number of flexibilities have been introduced into the EWSS that are particularly relevant to the sector highlighted by the Deputy, for example, the types of worker who qualify has been broadened to include seasonal workers and new hires.  </p>  <p>In terms of the timing of the payments, as set out in the recently enacted Financial Provisions (Covid-19) (No. 2) Act 2020, the EWSS is based on the monthly PAYE/PRSI return to Revenue which is due on the 14th of the month following payment of wages.   I am advised by Revenue that the operation of the EWSS is an automated solution, designed to operate at a system level with the monthly PAYE employer returns. The PAYE system is based on the employer reporting payroll runs as they occur. Revenue then posts the monthly return by the fifth day of the following month and the employer has until the 14th of the month to make any corrections to the return. The monthly return is finalised on the 14th  .</p>  <p>  The EWSS was designed to build on the PAYE monthly system and is a subsidy calculated on the number of qualifying employees. The intention was that Revenue will make the payment into the designated bank account as soon as practicable after that date, typically within 2 days. Thus, for September the intention was that Revenue would start to initiate bank transfers on 16th October. </p>  <p>  However, in light of the concerns from some employers on the cash flow impact and acknowledging that this is an extremely challenging time for businesses and employers, on 7 October 2020, Revenue provided an update, by way of public announcement, that it has brought forward the date of payment for Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) supports to eligible employers. EWSS payments in respect of September payroll submissions, which were due to be made as soon as possible after 14 October, were paid into the designated bank accounts of eligible employers from Friday morning, 9 October. </p>  <p>  Revenue also confirmed that all future monthly EWSS payments due to eligible employers will be made as soon as possible after the fifth day of the following month. The accelerated payment date aligns with the availability of the monthly &lsquo;Employer PAYE Return Submission Statement&rsquo;, which is made available to employers in Revenue&rsquo;s Online Service, ROS, by the fifth of the following month.  </p>  <p>Thus, with this in mind Revenue further advise that it is really important that employers make timely and correct payroll submissions as they will now only have the opportunity to make any necessary corrections before the subsidy is paid instead of up until the payroll return filing date of the 14th   of the month.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to welcome Revenue&rsquo;s supportive approach to businesses by bringing the date of payment forward for EWSS supports to eligible employers during the current crisis which aims to ease any cashflow for those employers concerned. Additionally, Revenue&rsquo;s PAYE system will credit monthly employer PRSI liabilities by approximately &euro;60 million to account for the reduced rate of PRSI that applies to wages that are eligible for the EWSS.</p>  <p>   It should be recognised that the IT system to support EWSS was developed in close co-operation with the payroll software providers and that any further changes to the operation of the system at this stage, will require significant software developments which could put at risk the smooth operation of the scheme which has so far provided support to 31,700 employers.</p>  <p>  Finally, for these businesses who need further support, or who experience cash-flow difficulties arising for the timing of the subsidy payments, there are a number of options open to them &ndash; including State backed loans which may be repaid using EWSS funds as well as grants.  Particular attention is drawn to the comprehensive package of business and employer supports that have been made available as part of the July Stimulus Plan - including the Credit Guarantee Scheme, the SBCI Working Capital Scheme, Sustaining Enterprise Fund, and the Covid-19 Business Loans Scheme. </p></reply>

If mortgage applicants have any queries or concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on their mortgage application, they should contact their lender directly.</p>  <p>  Within the parameters of the regulatory framework, as set out below, the decision to grant or refuse an individual application for mortgage credit is a commercial decision to be made by the regulated entity. A loan offer may contain a condition that the lender can withdraw or vary the offer if in the lender&rsquo;s opinion there is any material change in circumstances prior to drawdown. In such cases, the decision to withdraw or vary the offer is a commercial decision for the lender.</p>  <p>  Before providing a mortgage, lenders are required to undertake thorough creditworthiness assessments to ensure a borrower will be able to repay the mortgage. This assessment must take into account the individual circumstances of the borrower, including personal circumstances and financial situation. </p>  <p>  To expand on the regulatory requirements in this regard, the European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016 (CMCAR) provide that before concluding a mortgage credit agreement, a lender must make a thorough assessment of the consumer&rsquo;s creditworthiness.  The assessment must take appropriate account of factors relevant to verifying the prospect of the consumer being able to meet his or her obligations under the credit agreement.  The CMCAR provide that a lender should only make credit available to a consumer where the result of the creditworthiness assessment indicates that the consumer&rsquo;s obligations resulting from the credit agreement are likely to be met in the manner required under that agreement.  The assessment of creditworthiness must be carried out on the basis of information on the consumer&rsquo;s income and expenses and other financial and economic circumstances which is necessary, sufficient and proportionate. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 imposes &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer and Suitability&rsquo; requirements on lenders.  Under these requirements, lenders are required to assess affordability of credit and the suitability of a product or service based on the individual circumstances of each borrower. The Code specifies that the affordability assessment must include consideration of the information gathered on the borrower&rsquo;s personal circumstances and financial situation.</p>  <p>  Where a lender refuses a mortgage application, the CMCAR requires that the lender must inform the consumer without delay of the refusal. In addition, the Code requires that the lender must clearly outline to the consumer the reasons why the credit was not approved, and provide these reasons on paper if requested.</p>  <p>  If a mortgage applicant is not satisfied with how a regulated firm is dealing with them, or they believe that the regulated firm is not following the requirements of the Central Bank&rsquo;s codes and regulations or other financial services law, they should make a complaint directly to the regulated firm. If they are still not satisfied with the response from the regulated firm, they can refer the complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.  </p></reply>

Most loan agreements include a clause that allows the loan to be sold to another firm.  When a loan is sold, the relevant Irish and EU consumer protections continue to apply.  All mortgages or loans which are sold or assigned to a new creditor will continue to be subject to the terms of the contract as entered into by the borrower. As a matter of contractual law, the new creditor will not be able to unilaterally change the terms and conditions of the contract.</p><p>I am advised by the Central Bank that under the <i>Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2018</i>, which came into effect on 21 January 2019, that if a loan is transferred, the holder of the legal title to the credit must be authorised by the Central Bank as a credit servicing firm, if it is not already regulated as a credit institution or a retail credit firm.  Such credit servicing firms must act in accordance with Irish financial services law that applies to &lsquo;regulated financial service providers&rsquo;.  This ensures that consumers, whose loans are sold to another firm, maintain the same regulatory protections that they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory Codes of Conduct issued by the Central Bank, such as the <i>Consumer Protection Code 2012</i>(Code) and the <i>Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears 2013</i>(CCMA).</p><p>The Deputy should also be aware that the Central Bank issued an industry letter in August 2019 to banks, retail credit firms and credit servicing firms, to set out its expectations in relation to Mortgage Loan Transactions, including sales of residential mortgage loans.  These expectations include, <i>inter alia</i>, that sufficient due diligence and information sharing takes place at the outset to ensure that complete customer files transfer as part of a loan sale.</p><p>However, if a borrower is not satisfied with how a regulated firm is dealing with them, or they believe that the firm is not following the requirements of the Central Bank&rsquo;s codes and regulations or other financial services law, they should make a complaint directly to the regulated firm. The relevant provisions as regards &lsquo;Complaints Resolution&rsquo; are contained in Chapter 10 of the <i>Consumer Protection Code</i>. </p><p>If they are still not satisfied with the response from the regulated firm, they can refer the complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO) to have it investigated; the FSPO is completely independent in the performance of his statutory functions. Investigations by the Ombudsman are free of charge to the complainant. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-10-13a.275.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020101300071#WRF03500"><p>At the outset, while I have an appreciation of the specific issue the Deputy raises, neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can direct the pricing of insurance products, as this is a commercial matter, nor can we compel any insurer operating in the Irish market to provide cover.  This position is reinforced by the EU Single Market framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive) which expressly prohibits Member States from doing so. </p><p>On a general level, my understanding is that insurers will use a combination of rating factors in making their individual decisions on whether to offer motor insurance cover and what terms to apply.  For example, factors may include the drivers age; relevant driving experience; the age and type of vehicle; how and where the vehicle is used; the claims record; the number of drivers; and the storage location. Insurers also price in accordance with their specific claims experience and do not use the same combination of rating factors. Accordingly, premium prices vary across the market, demonstrating why it is important for consumers to shop around on their insurance policies.</p><p>As the Deputy will appreciate, there is no single policy or legislative fix to remedy the cost and availability of insurance issue.  The Programme for Government identifies a range of issues that the Government will prioritise through the recently established Cabinet Committee on Economic Recovery and Investment&rsquo;s <i>Sub-Group on Insurance Reform</i>.  This sub-Group held its inaugural meeting on 30 September and identified a number of key deliverables to be progressed before the end of 2020.  The Sub-Group is chaired by the T&aacute;naiste, and also includes as standing members, myself, Ministers McGrath, McEntee, and O&rsquo;Gorman, together with Ministers of State Troy and Fleming.  I believe that this approach provides the best opportunity to address the cost and availability of insurance on a cross-Departmental basis.  This will build and expand upon the previous commendable work done by the Cost of Insurance Working Group. As you will be aware, a number of important reforms have already taken place, and the impact of these is reflected in the recent CSO data which indicate that the cost of private motor insurance is now almost a third cheaper than at its peak in July 2016. </p><p>In terms of addressing the affordability and accessibility of insurance generally, a necessary step is to bring the levels of personal injury damages awarded in this country more in line with those awarded in other jurisdictions. The establishment of the Judicial Council last December is very important in this regard, and it is expected that the Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee will submit draft Guidelines to the Judicial Council before the end of the year.  It is desirable that the Guidelines could play a role in the lowering of award levels and also could lead to a more consistent application of making awards in courts.  Insurance Ireland, the representative body for insurance providers in this country, has indicated that if award levels come down so will premiums charged by its members.  I believe that this is a very important statement and this Government intends holding the insurance industry to this commitment.</p><p>Finally, I think it is also worth mentioning that Insurance Ireland operates an Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to obtaining insurance, which can be accessed at: feedback@insuranceireland.eu.</p></reply>

When operational, the TWSS supported more than 66,000 employers in respect of approximately 664,000 employees at a cost of almost &euro;2.9 billion to the Exchequer.</p>  <p>  The Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid 19) Act assigned responsibility for the care and management of the TWSS to Revenue and I am advised that in exercise of this responsibility, it has over the last few months, engaged in a phased programme of compliance checks on all participating employers (66,000). In most cases the compliance checks are a relatively straight forward enquiry requiring proof of eligibility for the scheme and evidence that the funds were properly passed on to qualifying employees. Having regard to this latter aspect, Revenue has been prioritising cases with larger numbers of employees and as of last week had initiated checks in respect of some 70% of the employments subsidised through the scheme. </p>  <p>  Revenue has confirmed that the most recent tranche of compliance check letters issued on Friday 2 October, including the one referenced by the Deputy. As was the case with previous tranches, Revenue requested employers to confirm eligibility for the TWSS by reference to the decline in turnover in Quarter 2 of this year and to provide sample payslips confirming payment of the support to their qualifying employees. It is important to note that Revenue has not asked employers to provide any detailed tax information or computations in the letters, thereby facilitating a response within five days in most cases. </p>  <p>  Where Revenue identifies intentional non-compliance with the conditions of the TWSS, or where employers fail to engage with the compliance checks, it will carry out a wider review of the tax compliance position of those businesses.     </p>  <p>  Revenue has already received a significant level of response from employers to the most recent letters and as was the case with the previous tranches, the information received indicates a high-level of compliance by employers with the terms of the scheme. However, a relatively small number of cases have been identified as needing closer examination and this will be completed as quickly as possible.</p></reply>

The purpose of the Stay and Spend scheme is to provide targeted support to businesses within the hospitality sector whose operations are likely to be most affected by continued restrictions. While I appreciate the point raised by the Deputy, food and drink service providers which operate on a take-away basis are not expected to be as heavily affected by the current restrictions as service providers offering &lsquo;dine-in&rsquo; food and drink services and so would not fall within the particular objectives of the scheme.</p></reply>

At the same time, it is recognised that economic outputs are unlikely to return to normal for many businesses for much of the rest of 2020, which is why the Government remains committed to supporting employers by means of a wage subsidy.   </p>  <p>  A number of new flexibilities have been included in the EWSS, while the rates and eligibility criteria have been modified so that the support is sustainable into the more medium term.  In that regard, I would note that the level of subsidy being granted under the EWSS is commensurate with the average payment per worker under the TWSS which had been reducing since the start of June and when the TWSS ceased at the end of August was &euro;282 across all recipients and &euro;225 in the case of first-time recipients.</p>  <p>  It is important to emphasise that the adaptation from the TWSS to the levels of support in the EWSS will allow employers to rely on the continuation of support over a longer period of up to 8 months while also ensuring such support is sustainable and affordable.</p>  <p>  Finally, for those businesses who need further support, or who experience cash-flow difficulties arising for the timing of the subsidy payments, there are a number of options open to them &ndash; including State backed loans which may be repaid using EWSS funds as well as grants.  Particular attention is drawn to the comprehensive package of business and employer supports that have been made available as part of the July Stimulus Plan - including the Credit Guarantee Scheme, the SBCI Working Capital Scheme, Sustaining Enterprise Fund, and the Covid-19 Business Loans Scheme.</p></reply>

You will be aware that, as Minister for Finance, I have no statutory role in relation to the charges applied by credit institutions. Under Section 149 of the <i>Consumer Credit Act 1995 </i>(the Act), as amended, the responsibility for the regulation of bank fees lies with the Central Bank of Ireland.</p><p>I am advised by the Central Bank of Ireland that under Section 149 of the Act, a credit institution must notify the Central Bank if they wish to:</p><p>- Introduce any new customer charge for providing certain services; or</p><p>- Increase any existing customer charge for providing certain services. </p><p>Each notification received by the Central Bank is assessed and robustly challenged in accordance with the specific criteria set out in Section 149 of the Act. Having considered the proposed charge(s) under the assessment criteria as set out under the legislation, the charges are either rejected, approved at lower levels than requested by the credit institution, or approved in full.  Credit institutions are free to impose any pricing differentials for the service up to the permitted maximum and are free to waive charges at their discretion for commercial or competitive reasons. </p><p>Where a regulated entity intends to introduce new charges or increase any existing charges, under provision 6.18 of the Central Bank&rsquo;s <i>Consumer Protection Code</i>, it must give notice to affected consumers of the introduction of any new charges or of increases in charges, specifying the old and new charge, at least 30 days prior to the charge taking effect. If customers are unhappy with their current account provider for any reason, including cost, they have the right to switch to a different provider. I would encourage all bank customers, particularly those adversely affected by changes in bank charges, to shop around and compare the fees and benefits of the different current accounts available.  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) website provides useful information to assist customers to compare and switch accounts; this website can be accessed at . </p><p>Under the <i>Payment Accounts Directive</i>, all Irish banks must make available a basic bank account for people who currently do not have access to a bank account. The basic bank account is free of charge for everyday banking services for the first year. After 12 months, the credit institution may review the amounts lodged to the account over the preceding 12 months, and, where the total of those amounts exceeds the equivalent of the national minimum hourly rate of pay multiplied by 2,080, the credit institution may charge a reasonable fee for the account. The consumer must be given two months&rsquo; notice before any such reasonable fee may be imposed.</p><p>The <i>Payment Accounts Directive</i>also requires that a consumer must be provided with a Fee Information Document setting out all fees linked to an account, in good time before entering into a framework contract with a consumer. A consumer must also be provided, at least annually, with a Statement of Fees, setting out all fees incurred in respect of the account. These requirements ensure the consumer is fully informed of all fees linked to a payment account. Where a consumer wishes to switch payment accounts, the Central Bank&rsquo;s <i>Code of Conduct on the Switching of Payment Accounts with Payment Service Providers 2016</i>sets out the requirements that both the existing and new account provider must adhere to when undertaking the switching process.</p></reply>

There is also a commitment to the development of a &rdquo;<i>national remote working strategy</i>&rdquo; and to that end, a Remote Working Strategy Inter-Departmental Group has been established.  Officials from my Department are included in this group which is chaired by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  A number of issues are being considered as relevant to these commitments, the results of which will be made public in due course.</p><p>In terms of the current tax treatment of the costs associated with working from home, I would note that any such costs incurred wholly and exclusively for the purposes of the business by an employer (for example, the provision of equipment) may be deducted by the employer in the normal course of calculating the tax liability of their business.</p><p>From the perspective of the individual employee, there is no specific tax credit available to employees where they work from home.  The consideration of the introduction of any such credit would need to balance a number of factors including issues of equity, noting that not every worker is able to work remotely or from home for a variety of reasons including the nature of their work and also the nature of their home environment.  </p><p>However, I am advised by Revenue that where e-workers incur certain extra expenditure in the performance of their duties of employment remotely or from home, such as additional heating and electricity costs, there is a Revenue administrative practice in place that allows an employer to make payments up to &euro;3.20 per day to such employees, subject to certain conditions, without deducting PAYE, PRSI, or USC. Where employers avail of this facility, they are not required to advise Revenue and therefore the number of employees reimbursed in this manner is not available. Where employers choose to pay more than &euro;3.20, the excess is subject to deduction of PAYE, PRSI and USC.</p><p>Revenue have confirmed that PAYE workers using their primary residence as a workplace during Covid-19 restrictions qualify as e-workers for the purposes of this practice.  </p><p>Revenue also advise that the provision of equipment, such as computers, printers, scanners and office furniture by the employer to enable the employee work from home will not attract a Benefit-In-Kind charge, where the equipment is provided primarily for business use. The provision of a telephone line, broadband and such facilities for business use will also not give rise to a Benefit-in-Kind charge, where private use of the connection is incidental.</p><p>Where an employer does not pay &euro;3.20 per day to an e-worker, I am advised that employees retain their statutory right to claim a deduction under section 114 of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997 in respect of actual vouched expenses incurred wholly, exclusively and necessarily in the performance of the duties of their employment. PAYE employees are entitled to claim costs such as additional light and heat in respect of the number of days spent working from home, apportioned on the basis of business and private use. </p><p>PAYE workers can claim e-working expenses by completing an Income Tax return at year end.  Revenue advise that the simplest way for taxpayers to claim their e-working expenses and any other tax credit entitlements is by logging into the myAccount facility on the Revenue website.

When operational, the TWSS supported more than 66,000 employers in respect of approximately 664,000 employees at a cost of &euro;2.9 billion to the Exchequer.</p>  <p>  The TWSS was predicated on the employer wanting to keep the employees on the payroll and to retain them until business picks up.  The TWSS only operated in respect of an employee, whether full-time or part-time, who was on the payroll of the relevant employer as at 29 February 2020.  </p>  <p>  The amount of the wage subsidy for each employee was based on the average net weekly pay reported by the employer under the PAYE system for January and February 2020.  There was no distinction made regarding the wage subsidy amount based on whether the business was closed due to the Covid-19 restrictions or had continued to trade with employees working part-time or continuing to work full-time with similar hours as before the Covid-19 pandemic.  There was also no requirement for employers to pro rata the subsidy based on whether the employee was temporarily laid off or working full or part-time.  The employer was expected to make best efforts to maintain the employee&rsquo;s net income as close as possible to normal net income for the duration of the scheme.  There was, however, no minimum amount that the employer was obligated to pay as an additional payment in order to be eligible for the scheme, but for Revenue operational systems reasons the employer needed to enter at least &euro;0.01 in gross pay when running its payroll.  </p>  <p>  The Short-Time Work Support Payment, administered by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection (DEASP), provides access to social welfare support for individuals who have been placed temporarily on a shorter working week, where certification from their employer is provided.  The Short-Time Work Support scheme is not a specific Covid-19 measure and did not constitute a claim for duplicate COVID support for the purposes of the TWSS.  Thus, an individual&rsquo;s entitlements to such DEASP support for the days he or she was not working is a matter for DEASP but it had no impact on the individual&rsquo;s eligibility for the TWSS.   Therefore, Revenue will not seek to recoup an overpayment of subsidy in the case of an employee that has been placed on a short-time working week.</p></reply>

The Group was established, at that time, following severe flooding arising from exceptional weather conditions from December, 2015 to January, 2016.  </p>  <p>  The Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme and the Flood Risk Management Plans (FRMPs) have informed the work of the Group which was established to support the existing plans in place and planned to address flooding and to enhance the ongoing co-operation of all state agencies involved with the River Shannon.  </p>  <p>  On its establishment, a priority for the Group was to develop a Work Programme that was informed through public consultation days. The Programme together with local knowledge demonstrated the extensive range of activities and co-ordination by all State Agencies already underway to jointly and proactively address flood risk along the Shannon. The Group&rsquo;s Annual Work Programmes are available at www.opw.ie</p>  <p>  The Group has taken a number of significant decisions since its establishment including: </p>  <p>  - Targeted maintenance at various locations along the River Shannon.</p>  <p>  - A study to examine the benefits of removing constrictions resulting in lower summer water levels through the Shannon Callows, to help address the summer flooding in this area while maintaining the appropriate navigation requirements.</p>  <p>  - A study to examine the cause, degree and rate of restriction downstream in the Lower Shannon. </p>  <p>  - Trial on lowering of lake levels in Lough Allen to help alleviate any significant flooding event that may occur. </p>  <p>  - Preliminary assessment of the potential for strategic maintenance on the River Shannon.</p>  <p>  The ESB is responsible for managing the water levels on Lough Allen, Lough Ree and Lough Derg. The levels in between the lakes are managed by Waterways Ireland for navigation purposes.  Both organisations are members of the Group and communicate on a daily basis to ensure a co-ordinated approach to managing water levels.  </p>  <p>  In 2016, the Group took a decision to trial the lowering of the lake levels on Lough Allen during the Winter period to help mitigate potential flood risk.  A protocol was agreed between ESB, Waterways Ireland and the OPW to lower the late Autumn and Winter minimum lake levels in Lough Allen by approximately 0.7 metre subject to favourable weather conditions.  The Group has agreed to continue the trial on a temporary basis pending the completion of a flood relief scheme for Carrick on Shannon.  </p>  <p>  In October 2019, the Group agreed that the Government be advised that &euro;7m was to be provided for a  strategic programme of maintenance and the removal of constrictions or &lsquo;pinch points&rsquo; on the bed of the River Shannon at the Callows Region between Athlone and Meelick Weir.  Progression of these works will be subject to the full environmental assessments required and planning consent to proceed.  The decision to undertake these projects was noted by the Government in December 2019. Waterways Ireland has advised that it has commenced work on advancing the various interventions for these works with implementation expected to commence in 2021.</p></reply>

This comprehensive action plan was undertaken in order to further accelerate  and better coordinate the implementation of the overarching <i>20-Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-2030 </i>which represents Government policy in relation to the language and Gaeltacht regions.</p><p>The plan contains over 180 measures to be implemented over its 5-year lifespan across the nine areas of action identified in the overarching strategy. </p><p>With the publication last week of the inaugural annual progress report on the implementation of the Action Plan, it is apparent that substantial progress is being made on the part of 60 or so stakeholders to advance the implementation of all measures contained in the plan and that there is now a greater recognition than ever that the plan is cross-departmental and involves every Irish language and Gaeltacht organisation in one way or another. </p><p>While Census 2016 results in respect of Irish language usage within Gaeltacht regions point to ongoing and significant challenges facing the language, I remain confident that with the advances being made to implement the action plan, including a recast approach in support of the language within the domain of the public service as set out in the Official Languages (Amendment) Bill 2019, will yield results for the collective and ongoing efforts being made to support the Irish language into the future.</p><p>As a consequence of the additional exchequer funding being provided under Budget 2021, my Department, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and Foras na Gaeilge will further advance work programmes in support of the Action Plan to the overall benefit of the language and Gaeltacht regions. </p><p>In the interests of completeness I might also point out to the Deputy that the measures contained in the Action Plan represent a baseline and that it is envisaged that  additional initiatives and measures can be undertaken as additional resources become available.</p></reply>

Tour operators provide a vital service to the tourism industry and are important ambassadors in the tourism experience and promoting our excellent tourism product. We will need them when the recovery begins.</p>  <p>  Along with my colleagues in Government, I have taken a number of measures to help the tourism sector survive this current crisis. The July Stimulus Package introduced significant measures to help support businesses to recover following the devastating impacts of the COVID-19 crisis. Tourism enterprises will also benefit from wider horizontal supports such as the new Employment Wage Support Scheme, liquidity and enterprise investment measures, warehousing of tax liabilities and the extension for a further three months of the waiver of commercial rates.</p>  <p>  All of these measures have helped the sector. I appreciate, however, that severe challenges remain and we need to continue to examine ways to ensure that businesses survive and recover. The Tourism Recovery Taskforce appointed in May has just submitted its report to me and I am glad to say that a number of important measures have been delivered in today's Budget including: a reduction in the VAT rate for the sector,  business continuity support for strategic businesses, as well as a further extension of the rates waiver to the end of the year.  Based on today's Budget allocations F&aacute;ilte Ireland will now be working with the sector to support strategic tourism businesses.  </p></reply>

Therefore, although the budgets for 2017 to 2020 have not yet been officially approved, from 2017, the Finance Departments in both jurisdictions have agreed that all Cross-Border Institutions would operate in accordance with the budgets approved by the NSMC for the year 2016.</p>  <p>  This year, my Department will pay &euro;11,087,184 (75% of the gross budget approved by NSMC) to Foras na Gaeilge. In addition, my Department will provide additional funding to Foras na Gaeilge in relation to ring-fenced matters such as Cl&aacute;r na Leabhar Gaeilge (&euro; 1,061,165) and Colmcille  (&euro;118,519). It is also worth noting that Foras na Gaeilge is allowed to retain the additional income generated from the sale of books and other items to be spent on its activities.</p>  <p>  It is intended that NSMC meetings will be held again shortly, at which time the 2017 - 2020 budgets will be approved and that all aspects of the work of the Language Body will be discussed, including the budget for 2021.  In this regard, the Deputy will be pleased to learn that an indicative increased allocation has been included in my Department's Estimate for 2021.  This will be subject to further consultation with the Department for Communities in the north prior to a final allocation being agreed for 2021.</p></reply>

It sets out a framework on managing and living with COVID-19 and includes restrictive measures to help us to go about our daily lives as much as possible, while managing the virus.</p>  <p>  The framework sets out five levels of response, each with a number of measures designed to help us all lower COVID-19 transmission and setting out what is permitted at that moment in time.  All counties in Ireland are at Level 3 until midnight Tuesday 27 October.</p>  <p>  The Government's priority is to keep schools, early learning and childcare services open and minimise disruption in the work force. This means that a number of services should be moved online and some businesses will be closed. In order to keep people safe, we have all been asked to reduce the number of people we meet to a minimum, and stay in our own counties.  COVID-19 is highly infectious and we are asked to be extra careful when socialising and working with others.</p>  <p>  Dance classes/schools are classified as exercise and sporting events under the Plan.  Under Level 3 restrictions, indoor training is only permitted on an individual basis, therefore exercise and dance classes cannot take place. Non-contact training can take place outdoor in pods of up to 15. There are exemptions for professional/elite groups.</p></reply>

Objective 29 of the NPF &ldquo;supports the implementation of language plans in Gaeltacht Language Planning Areas, Gaeltacht Service Towns and Irish Language Networks&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  Separately, the Planning and Development Act 2000 as amended, sets out mandatory objectives for local authorities, which must be addressed in the drafting of their County Development Plan governing local development policies.  Section 10(2) of the Planning and Development Act includes a requirement that, where there is a Gaeltacht area within the planning authority&rsquo;s territory, the development plan must include provisions and objectives for &ldquo;the protection of the linguistic and cultural heritage of the Gaeltacht including the promotion of Irish as the community language&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  To provide further guidance in preparing appropriate policies, my Department produced &lsquo;Development Plans, Guidelines for Planning Authorities&rsquo;, to address this mandatory objective of the Planning and Development Act. These guidelines refer to linguistic and cultural heritage and the needs of the community in land-use terms for housing, community facilities, employment, tourism and design, including advertising and signage. </p>  <p>  Individual development plans may also oblige applicants for planning permission to submit certain particulars or information to accompany development proposals in Gaeltacht areas, such as assessments of the linguistic impact of the proposed development, in order for it to be assessed against relevant policies of the development plan.</p>  <p>  Since April 2019, the assessment of all local authority development plans and local area plans is undertaken by the Office of the Planning Regulator (OPR). The oversight role of the OPR includes ensuring consistency with relevant national or regional policies, including those set out in the NPF and addressing all relevant mandatory objectives for County Development Plans set out in the Planning and Development Act, including the provision of Gaeltacht-specific objectives, where required. </p>  <p>  This statutory functions of the OPR may ultimately include a recommendation to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage to direct a planning authority to amend or revoke a statutory plan, under procedures set out in Section 31 of the Planning and Development Act 2000.  Such circumstances include where local authorities fail to adopt policies that reflect the overall national policy position or are in breach of the statutory requirements under Section 10 of the Act. </p>  <p>  With respect to any particular case with which a planning authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la may be concerned, i.e. consideration of any planning application, I am subject to limitation in exercising any power or control, which includes commenting or making statements, under Section 30 of the Planning and Development Act 2000. This includes the competence, or otherwise, of individuals to prepare relevant documentation or plans as part of a planning process.</p>  <p>  However, I can advise that a planning authority must notify the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (currently the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts , Gaeltacht, Sports and Media) and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, to invite their views in relation to planning applications for developments which, in the opinion of the authority &ldquo;might materially affect the linguistic and cultural heritage of the Gaeltacht, including the promotion of Irish as the community language&rdquo; in accordance with Article 28 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001 (as amended).</p>  <p>  Compliance with these Regulations, including assessment of the suitability of submitted information/ plans, is a matter for the relevant local authorities, in pursuance of their functions as planning authorities.  The decision to grant or refuse planning permission in such cases, and to assign conditions to a grant of planning permission, is ultimately a matter for the relevant planning authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  This includes development proposals such as housing estates or holiday homes.</p>  <p>  I am of the view that considering the unique spatial and linguistic circumstances relating to each of our Gaeltacht areas, with local variation between communities and the contexts in which the Irish Language is spoken, that the relevant planning authorities are best placed to implement the framework of legislation, policy and guidance as set out above.  I am also satisfied that there are appropriate planning oversight mechanisms and safeguards in place, which include the Office of the Planning Regulator and An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  </p>  <p>  However, a number of Irish language groups, including Conradh na Gaeilge, have raised these matters with me and I have recently undertaken to meet with Conradh na Gaeilge to discuss this more generally in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

However, acknowledging that some households on the waiting list, who avail of HAP, have expectations that they would receive a more traditional form of social housing support, Ministerial directions have issued to ensure that, should they so choose, HAP recipients can avail of a move to other forms of social housing support through a transfer list.  Furthermore, local authorities were also directed that HAP recipients who apply to go on the transfer list should get full credit for the time they spent on the waiting list and be placed on the transfer list with no less favourable terms than if they had remained on the waiting list.</p><p>The Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 gives legislative recognition to rental accommodation availability agreements, which underpin the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS), as a form of social housing support. Consequently, since 1 April 2011, RAS tenants are now considered to be in receipt of social housing support and should not generally remain on main housing waiting lists for new applicants for social housing.</p><p>Recognising that tenants housed through RAS prior to this change might have had reasonable expectations in regard to retaining access to traditional local authority rented accommodation, guidance issued from the Housing Agency in 2011 recommended that there should be a special transfer pathway for pre-2011 RAS tenants to other forms of social housing support. The arrangement effectively allowed these households to be designated as a &lsquo;transfer&rsquo; applicant and to maintain their position for allocation as they had on the main waiting list.</p><p>All tenants allocated RAS accommodation post 1 April 2011 (and thus under the provisions of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009) were informed at the time of offer and allocation that because RAS is now a social housing support, their housing need is met and that they will no longer remain on the main social housing waiting list.  However, it is recommended that allocation schemes also provide a &lsquo;transfer pathway&rsquo; for new RAS tenants, whereby households in RAS have access to the transfer list in the same way as tenants in local authority accommodation.</p><p>Where a vacant property arises, it is a matter for individual housing authorities, in accordance with their allocation schemes, to determine whether the allocation is made to a household on the main waiting list, or to a transfer applicant, such as a household from RAS, and the method of such allocation. It is open to housing authorities to specify in their allocation schemes the proportion of allocations which will be reserved for transfers, and within this, how many may be reserved for households seeking transfers to other forms of social housing support.</p><p>The oversight and management of housing waiting lists, including the allocation and transfer of tenancies, is a matter for the relevant local authority in accordance with the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, and associated regulations.</p><p>Section 22 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, requires all local authorities, as a reserved function, to make an allocation scheme determining the order of priority to be accorded in the allocation of dwellings to households qualified for social housing support and to households approved for a transfer, the allocation of which would, in the opinion of the authority, meet the accommodation needs and requirements of the households.</p></reply>

Such exemptions are provided for when they are considered to be consistent with proper planning and sustainable development.</p>  <p>  Under Class 1 of Schedule 2 of the Regulations, an extension to an existing house up to a limit of 40 square metres is exempted development, with additional conditions and limitations set out in the Regulations.</p>  <p>  Class 3 of Schedule 2 of the Regulations provides for a further exemption in respect of the construction, erection or placing within the curtilage of a house of any tent, awning, shade or other object, greenhouse, garage, store, shed or other similar structure. Similarly, this exemption is also subject to conditions and limitations as set out in the Regulations, including that it should be for the sole purpose of being incidental to the enjoyment of the house.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that the exemptions outlined are for the sole use of the home owner and not, for example, for the purpose of facilitating the establishment of a commercial enterprise. Such development would be classed as a material change of use - i.e. a change of use of a property from residential use to commercial use - and would therefore require planning permission. An application for such permission provides an opportunity for members of the public to make submissions or observations in respect of the proposed development while also providing the planning authority with the opportunity to consider a range of potential impacts of, such as increased traffic, in the area that may result from any such proposed change of use.</p>  <p>  If a person wishes to establish whether or not planning permission is required for a specific development proposal, they can seek a declaration from their local authority under Section 5 of the Act.</p>  <p>  The exemptions provided for in the Regulations are kept under regular review and I have no plans to amend them at this time.</p></reply>

The residential potential within the available lands is for a maximum of 3,500 additional residential units at a gross residential density of up to 238 units per hectare on lands over 14.7 hectares to the south of South Bank Road. This estimated housing yield would be sufficient to support a residential population of approximately 8,000 people and, therefore, would make a significant contribution to the city&rsquo;s housing needs.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that NAMA as the responsible agency retains responsibility regarding a decision to proceed with the competitive process.

By leveraging the value of this funding and that of their land, local authorities can then develop homes and make them available to purchase or rent at below open market values. </p>  <p>  To date, a total funding of &euro;127 million from overall SSF of &euro;310 million has been approved in principle to provide infrastructural work that will support 35 projects in 14 local authorities, and facilitate the delivery of in the region of 3,200 more affordable homes</p>  <p>  The ultimate selling prices of affordable homes will obviously be influenced by a number of factors which will vary significantly from development to development. This includes the overall development cost of each particular project, the housing type/tenure mix involved, and the local housing market. </p>  <p>  Given that in the majority of cases the detailed design, planning and construction procurement processes have yet to be completed and as the open market value of homes cannot be ascertained until the homes are made available at the time of sale, it is not possible to confirm the ultimate final cost reduced purchase price in advance. However, I can confirm that applications for SSF funding were made by local authorities on the basis of being able to deliver homes for sale at discounts of between 10% and a maximum of 40% below open market prices.</p>  <p>  Under the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2009 a charge will be placed on the property equal to the percentage discount from open market value, giving the housing authority an equity stake in the property. </p>  <p>  A 10% deposit will be required from the purchaser whether he or she obtains a mortgage from a bank/financial institution or a Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan. To this end, the prospective purchaser may be eligible for Help to Buy (HTB) which helps with the deposit required to buy or build a new house or apartment as their home.  It gives a refund of Income Tax and Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) paid by the applicant in Ireland over the previous four years. The amount that can be claimed is the lesser of:</p>  <p>  - &euro;20,000 (increased to &euro;30,000 for enhanced relief);</p>  <p>  - 5% of the purchase price of a new home. For self-builds this is 5% of the completion value of the property. (This is increased to 10% for enhanced relief);</p>  <p>  - the amount of Income Tax and Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) paid for the four years before purchase or self-build.</p>  <p>  A temporary enhancement to the existing HTB scheme for the remainder of 2020 was announced in the July Stimulus plan. The enhanced HTB relief provides that where applicants satisfy certain conditions, increased relief is available up to a maximum of &euro;30,000.</p></reply>

The 2011 Regulations do not provide local authorities with any discretion to exceed the limits that apply to their administrative areas.</p><p>Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI, Universal Social Charge and Pension-Related Deductions within the meaning of Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009. The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once-off in nature.</p><p>The income bands are expressed in terms of a maximum net income threshold for a single-person household, with an allowance of 5% for each additional adult household member, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%; and 2.5% for each child, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%.</p><p>The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced at that time also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.</p><p>Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support. The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources.</p><p>However, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is underway. The review will also have regard to current initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and cost rental and will be completed when the impacts of these parallel initiatives have been considered.</p></reply>

At the end of Q2 2020, almost 79,000 HAP tenancies had been set-up since the scheme commenced, of which there were more than 56,500 households actively in receipt of HAP support and over 32,000 separate landlords and agents providing accommodation to households supported by the scheme. </p>  <p>  The responsiveness and flexibility of HAP as a social housing support is one of the scheme's key characteristics and was one of the primary benefits envisaged at the outset of the scheme. With this in mind, guidelines on inter-authority movement were issued to local authorities to facilitate movement of HAP households from one local authority area to another in cases where a HAP tenant, currently on a local authority waiting list, wishes to access rented accommodation with HAP support in another local authority area. Inter authority movement is, however, subject to certain conditions, such as the Social Housing Income Eligibility Bands and confirmation that the applicant's income is below the threshold in the new local authority.</p>  <p>  Given that such flexibility facilitates better utilisation of all private rental stock for social housing purposes and supports the maximum activation potential of HAP households by removing geographical barriers to employment, all local authorities have been requested to give appropriate consideration to these requests.</p>  <p>  HAP tenants continue to be dealt with by their originating local authority. However, the rent limits will be those that apply in the local authority where the property is situated. The "originating" local authority will engage with the relevant "new" local authority to facilitate eligible requests for inter-authority movement.</p>  <p>  At the end of Q2, 2020, over 7,200 HAP household&rsquo;s had been facilitated via the agreed approach to inter-authority movement.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to keep the operation of the HAP scheme under review and it is a key mechanism in meeting housing need across the Country.</p></reply>

By leveraging the value of this funding and that of their land, local authorities can then develop homes and make them available to purchase or rent at below open market values.  </p>  <p>  To date, a total funding of &euro;127 million from overall SSF of &euro;310 million has been approved in principle to provide infrastructural work that will support 35 projects in 14 local authorities, and facilitate the delivery of in the region of 3,200 more affordable homes.  It is my intention to issue an Open Call for proposals to local authorities under the SSF to all local authorities shortly.</p>  <p>  My Department does not fund the construction cost of affordable housing or approve the contracting and scheduling processes.  These responsibilities have been retained by each Local Authority. As such, it is not directly comparable to the existing process for quarterly reporting in respect of social housing.  Notwithstanding this, my Department will ensure it maintains close co-operation with local authorities and will make available details regarding the delivery of more affordable homes as the scheme develops.</p></reply>

Of the 30 projects, Kildare County Council has confirmed that its project on the Naas Inner Relief Road will not now progress, although an element of the housing that was associated with the project has taken place. </p><p>Details of the approvals by local authority area, budget allocation, project description and projected housing delivery are available at .</p><p>Currently, 3 LIHAF projects have completed infrastructure construction. Of the remaining 26, up to the end of September (and excluding the Naas project), 14 projects have been approved to go to, or are already at, infrastructure construction stage.  Of the remaining 12 projects, one is expected to have a tender approved in Q4 2020 and go to construction in Q1 2021.  </p><p>Eleven are not yet ready to go to infrastructure tender stage which is required in order to receive approval to proceed to construction. Of these eleven, five are advancing through the detailed design and planning stage and the remaining six projects are currently under review.  My Department while reviewing these projects will consider requests from local authorities for extensions to the funding agreements as and when they arise.</p><p>In terms of homes delivered, the table below details the number of completed homes up to Q4 2019. Figures in respect of 2020 delivery are currently being collated.</p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th>Local Authority</th>       <th>Project Name</th>       <th>Residential Units Delivered to Date</th>       <th>Social/Part V </th>       <th>Cost Reduced/More Affordable</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork County</td>       <td>Carrigaline</td>       <td>180</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Fingal</td>       <td>Oldtown/Mooretown</td>       <td>379</td>       <td>8</td>       <td>211</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare</td>       <td>Naas</td>       <td>190</td>       <td>15</td>       <td>150</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Meath</td>       <td>Ratoath</td>       <td>106</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>10</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>South Dublin</td>       <td>Adamstown SDZ</td>       <td>1,202</td>       <td>120</td>       <td>459</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork City</td>       <td>Glanmire</td>       <td>13</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>3</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Fingal</td>       <td>Donabate</td>       <td>66</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>66</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick</td>       <td>Mungret</td>       <td>26</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>26</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>-</td>       <td>Total</td>       <td>2,162</td>       <td>145</td>       <td>925</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The individual sales price of homes that are delivered following the construction of the LIHAF facilitating infrastructure is not available in my Department.  However, by way of example, in Adamstown South Dublin, over 1,500 LIHAF enabled homes are already completed or contracted and 500 more homes are under construction. Within the large-scale delivery of homes, there are 300 homes at, or below, a cost of &euro;300,000 and a further 500 at or below &euro;320,000.  These have been delivered by leveraging the LIHAF funding and the average discount applied across all 800 discounted homes will be approx. &euro;25,000 per unit.</p><p>Meath County Council has confirmed units at Ratoath will be at a discount of 10% to the relevant open market prices.  In Cork, the LIHAF project at Glanmire will see 110 homes delivered with a discount of approx. &euro;20,000 each on the open market price.</p><p>The construction of housing by developers on lands which benefit from LIHAF funding is separate from the local authority-led delivery of the infrastructure, both contractually and in terms of delivery schedules.</p><p>For the majority of LIHAF projects sites, housing construction is expected to commence after the construction of the infrastructure has begun, so the timelines for housing delivery are generally in 2021 and beyond.</p></reply>

Section 35 of the Act further provides that an application for planning permission may be refused in situations where a developer has previously left an estate unfinished under one company name and then re-applies for permission for a new development under a different company name.  </p>  <p>  Supplementary to the foregoing, section 34 of the Act, which relates to applications for development, provides that planning authorities shall, in the assessment and determination of planning applications, have specific regard to previous developments by a developer which have not been satisfactorily completed as well as any previous convictions against the developer for non-compliance with the Planning Act, the Building Control Act 2007 and the Fire Services Act 1981.  </p>  <p>  Under the Building Control Acts 1990 to 2014, primary responsibility for compliance of works with the requirements of the Building Regulations rests with the owners, designers and builders of buildings. Enforcement of the Building Regulations is a matter for the 31 local building control authorities, who have extensive powers of inspection and enforcement under the Fire Services Acts 1981 and 2003, the Building Control Acts, the Housing Acts and the Planning and Development Acts and who are independent in the use of their statutory powers.  </p>  <p>  As the foregoing legislative provisions and powers are already available to local authorities, I have no plans to issue specific guidance in this matter.</p></reply>

It is intended that this EU requirement will be transposed into Irish law by end 2020. </p>  <p>  With regard to existing developments, if a property owner or developer wishes to retrospectively install EV charging points, exemptions from planning permission for such infrastructure are available under Class 29A of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, as amended (the Regulations). This Class allows for the installation of EV charging points that do not exceed a volume of - (i) 0.5 cubic metres above ground on a public road, and (ii) 3 cubic metres above ground elsewhere. </p>  <p>  If a hazard would be created by the installation of an EV charging point so as to endanger public safety by reason of traffic hazard or obstruction of road users, including pedestrians, the planning exemption would be dis-applied under Article 9(1)(a)(iii) of the Regulations and the property owner or developer in question would be required to apply for planning permission. </p>  <p>  With regard to the installation of EV charging points on roads, both public and private, this should be undertaken in accordance with the principles contained in the Design Manual for Urban Roads and Streets (DMURS), which was jointly published in 2013 by my Department in association with the Department of Transport. Where the installation of an EV charging point is proposed specifically for public roads, the relevant local authority in its capacity as a Roads Authority under the Roads Act 1993, must be consulted and such installation may also require a road opening licence.</p>  <p>  Where a developer or individual is unsure if planning permission is required for a proposed EV charging point, they can apply for a declaration under section 5 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, where each application is considered by the relevant planning authority on a case-by-case basis.</p>  <p>  The technology behind EV charging points is evolving at a fast pace and my Department will keep the matter under review and make necessary legislative amendments or issue updated guidelines as the need arises. </p></reply>

Further orders were signed on 16 April 2020 and 9 May 2020, the last of which expired on 23 May 2020. The three Orders had the combined effect of extending the relevant planning periods and timelines, including the duration of planning permissions, by an aggregate of 56 days/8 weeks during the time period in which they have effect. Accordingly, on foot of these Orders, the validity of a planning permission due to expire in December 2020 has now been extended by a further 8 weeks. Under section 42 of the Act, the only circumstance in which the holder of a planning permission may be granted a second extension of duration is in respect of a development that relates to 20 or more houses subject to the development being completed within 5 years of the originally extended permission or by 31 December 2021, whichever first occurs.</p>  <p>  On 15 September 2020, the Government published its latest response to managing Covid-19 - Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for living with Covid-19.

An initial three-month waiver of rates for businesses forced to close business due to COVID-19, was announced in May.  In order to enhance the supports available for enterprise, and in recognition of the fact that not only were many ratepayers forced to close business due to the public health requirements, but many that remained open suffered significant reductions in turnover, the waiver was extended to six months, running until 27 September 2020.  The categories of eligible enterprise were also expanded somewhat. A 100% waiver was applied to all businesses with the exception of a small number of categories. The rationale for the exclusion of certain categories of ratepayers was that their operations were not as severely impacted by the pandemic, coupled with the need to direct resources appropriately. To support both the local government sector and the ratepayers impacted, &euro;600m has been allocated by Government to fund the cost of the waiver, which took the form of a credit in lieu of rates.</p>  <p>  By ensuring that the vast majority of businesses are eligible for the waiver, the measure supports the SME sector, including those companies that had to close and those businesses that remained open but were severely impacted by Covid-19 restrictions. </p>  <p>  When the six-month waiver was announced, I agreed that the potential for the waiver to extend beyond end September should be kept under review, regarding the continuing impact of the pandemic on businesses and the reopening of society.  The possible extension of the commercial rates waiver has been the subject of discussions between myself and the Minister of Public Expenditure and Reform in recent days. I am pleased to confirm that Government is extending the waiver for a further 3 months, to end December, an investment of a further &euro;300m to ensure local authorities have resources available while simultaneously supporting businesses impacted by this pandemic. Further details will be available from my Department in the coming days.</p></reply>

The maximum approved costs per dwelling under the scheme are significant and range from &euro;55,00 to &euro;275,000 depending on the remedial option.  A grant of 90% of the approved costs associated with the necessary remediation works, subject to a maximum for each remedial option, or 90% of the actual cost of the remedial works, whichever is the lesser, is available under the scheme. This is in line with how similar Government grant schemes operate or have operated in the past, where an applicant contribution to the costs is a key requirement. </p>  <p>  Separately, the Pyrite Resolution Act 2013 provides the statutory framework for the establishment of the Pyrite Resolution Board (PRB), and for the making of a Pyrite Remediation Scheme, to be implemented by the PRB with support from the Housing Agency.

The European Council clearly stated that there can be no military solution to the conflict, nor any external interference and called on Azerbaijan and Armenia to engage in substantive negotiations without preconditions. Leaders expressed support for the OSCE Minsk Group Co-Chairs and asked the EU High Representative to examine further EU assistance for the settlement process.</p>  <p>  The UN Security Council Members also expressed support for Secretary-General Guterres&rsquo;s call for an immediate halt to the fighting, and for the central role of the OSCE Minsk Group Co-Chairs. Ireland will continue to endorse these efforts, including when we join the United Nations Security Council in January of next year.</p>  <p>  France, the United States and Russia held talks on 8 October. However Armenia did not attend. Russian mediated talks in Moscow followed on Saturday 10th October. This resulted in an agreement for a cease-fire for humanitarian purposes that has been under pressure since coming into force, with both sides accusing each other of violating its terms. Further talks are planned led by Russia, the United States and France this week with officials from the OSCE Minsk group.</p>  <p>  Ireland joins those calling for an immediate cessation of hostilities and a return to the negotiating table, and we welcome and support the statements of the European Council and the OSCE Minsk Co-Chairs calling for this. I am deeply concerned by the recent clashes in the Nagorno-Karabakh region, in particular along the line of contact, which have regrettably led to the loss of life and severe injury, including civilian casualties. The alleged use of Cluster Munitions in any situation is deeply concerning. They pose unacceptably high risks to civilians, especially when used in populated areas. Furthermore, any indiscriminate use of, or impacts from, cluster munitions would be in contravention of International Humanitarian Law to which both Armenia and Azerbaijan must abide.</p>  <p>  Ireland urges both sides to de-escalate tensions by refraining from inflammatory rhetoric and strictly observing the ceasefire. Only through negotiation, can there be a sustainable resolution and eventual reconciliation. The road to a peaceful resolution can be long and complex, as Ireland knows well, but progress grows from dialogue. Ireland fully supports the Minsk Process and we thank both the High Representative and the Co-Chairs Group for their efforts to de-escalate tensions over recent months. </p>  <p>  We will continue to monitor this evolving situation closely.</p></reply>

In 'Our Shared Future', the Programme for Government, the Government committed to making incremental, sustainable progress towards achieving the UN target of 0.7% of Gross National Income (GNI) to ODA by 2030. In making this commitment, the Government recognised that reaching 0.7% would require a significant expansion in ODA volumes over the next decade and that, at times, difficult choices would be required between competing priorities.</p>  <p>  Progress is being made. From 2014 to 2020 Ireland's allocations to ODA grew from &euro;614 million to almost &euro;838 million, an increase of almost &euro;21 million on the 2019 budget allocation and the sixth consecutive year allocations to ODA were increased.</p></reply>

It is effective as of 1 January 2019 and is set to run through 2023. Information on the Overseas Election Observation Roster is set out in the Note prepared for the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade (JCFATD) attached to this response, as well as in the Composite Note published on the election observation pages of the Irish Aid website, also attached to this response. </p><p>As outlined in response to Parliamentary Question No. 109 of 23 September 2020, all Irish citizens are eligible to apply for inclusion on the Election Observation Roster irrespective of their place of residence, consistent with the principles of the Good Friday Agreement as well as Government policy on the diaspora. The Department of Foreign Affairs does not, as also outlined in the same response, keep any database of roster members' addresses or hold any breakdown by place of residence.  The creation of a standalone record of addresses provided would constitute additional processing and storage of roster members' data contrary to data protection considerations, given that, as outlined, there is no residency requirement for roster members and, consequently, no business need to process residency/address data in this way.  Further, it is likely that members of either roster could change address over its lifetime.</p><p>As highlighted above the Department of Foreign Affairs facilitates participation in a range of volunteering opportunities overseas. Although Ireland nominates observers, the final selection decision rests with the relevant third party organisation. Depending on the role and local context, volunteers may need to be able to operate in challenging circumstances. With regard to provisions for people with a disability in the application processes for the Election Observation Roster and the Rapid Response Corps, the Department of Foreign Affairs is committed to giving applicants' requests for reasonable accommodation at the application stage all due consideration, and to making accommodations as appropriate to ensure that applicants with a disability enjoy equal opportunity in the application process. Both rosters are currently closed to new members, both having been mustered through open, competitive processes in 2018.</p><p>Attachments:</p><p>1.</p><p>2.</p></reply>

The Member States of the EU can be most influential in addressing the increasingly complex and protracted crises the world faces today when they act and speak in unison.</p>  <p>  If the EU is to successfully promote its founding values of human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and human rights in matters of foreign policy, it needs to be able to use all the instruments at its disposal in a strategic and agile manner. This is particularly true in the current geopolitical environment, where, regrettably, these values are being challenged and undermined with ever greater frequency.</p>  <p>  In this context, consideration has been given in EU discussions to extension of the use of qualified majority voting (QMV). As stated in Article 31 (3) of the Treaty on European Union (commonly referred to as the passarelle clause), the extension of the use of QMV in matters of EU Common Foreign and Security Policy would have to be agreed unanimously by the European Council. Unanimous support for such a decision does not currently exist within the European Union. In certain limited circumstances, as outlined in Article 31 (2) of the Treaty on European Union, there is already scope for the Council to act by QMV in matters of EU Common Foreign and Security Policy.</p>  <p>  I should stress that QMV will of course never be our preference for the adoption of Common Foreign and Security Policy actions, not least to ensure that the full weight of EU Member States is behind any decisions we take. Ireland will continue to advocate for all Member States to demonstrate flexibility, solidarity and unity in the adoption of timely and appropriate measures, in order to allow for the EU to act in support of its core principles, interests and values.</p></reply>

The MoU provides a framework for developing and furthering bilateral co-operation and relations between the two states in the area of security and defence capacity, building on existing cooperation and seeking to identify new areas of cooperation with mutual benefits. It is a voluntary, non-binding arrangement and does not impact on Ireland's traditional policy of military neutrality. </p>  <p>  It is important that we maintain and develop the positive progress that has taken place so far. Any bilateral Ireland/UK cooperation on areas of mutual interest and concern in the defence and armed forces domain will remain in place post-Brexit and the MoU will continue to facilitate cooperation between Ireland and the UK in the agreed areas into the future.</p>  <p>  Areas covered by the MoU include exercises, training activities, exchange of information, knowledge and experience, shared threat analysis, staff to staff talks both civil and military and joint operations and capacity building in support of international peace and security.  </p>  <p>  Supplementary written arrangements in the form of MOUs, Technical Arrangements etc. may be concluded between Ireland and the UK for the purpose of implementing this cooperation. To this end, a Memorandum of Understanding concerning the sharing of and protection of Defence classified information was concluded between Ireland and the UK in 2019.</p></reply>

The Committee found that Ireland was not in violation of the European Social Charter in respect of the prohibition of the right of military personnel to strike. </p>  <p>  The Government is aware of the long standing desire of PDFORRA to associate with ICTU. However, association with ICTU poses complex questions for the Defence Forces from a legal, operational and management perspective. It is critically important that Defence Forces operations are not restricted and this is a key concern. </p>  <p>  The European Committee of Social Rights in arriving at its decision took into account a statement made in the complaint, which claimed that ICTU had stated that &ldquo;PDFORRA could be affiliated to ICTU with whatever conditions the Government deemed necessary&rdquo;. Defence management (civil and military) have been engaged in discussions with the Permanent Defence Force representative associations and ICTU regarding the practicalities of a Defence Forces representative association forming association/affiliation with ICTU. These discussions have encompassed matters of concern to all parties.</p>  <p>  PDFORRA initiated legal proceedings on this matter on 26 June 2020. As this matter is now subject to litigation, it would not be appropriate to comment further.</p></reply>

These unacceptable forms of behaviour are not tolerated in the Defence Forces. </p>  <p>  I am advised that there are robust measures and systems currently in place within the Defence Forces to address allegations of inappropriate behaviour in the workplace.  Defence Force Regulation A7, in the first instance, provides the regulatory framework for dealing with such matters for serving members of the Defence Forces in both a formal and informal way through a trained Designated Contact Person (DCP) network. </p>  <p>  Within this framework, Administrative Instruction A7, Chapter 1 sets out the Defence Forces policy and procedures regarding interpersonal relationships in the Defence Forces including sexual harassment, harassment and bullying, in order to deter unacceptable behaviour and promote a service environment based on mutual respect, equality and professionalism.</p>  <p>  Underpinned by a strong set of organisational values, Defence Forces personnel are additionally required to ensure that their own actions and behaviour do not cause offence to others or contribute in any way to a discriminatory working environment. Personnel are expected to support the policy on sexual harassment, harassment or bullying by bringing instances where such behaviour has occurred to attention at an early stage and co-operating with an investigation whether as a complainant, the person complained of, or as a witness.</p>  <p>  Central to the concept of an effective service environment is the commitment of the leadership and members of the Defence Forces to maintain an atmosphere in which the dignity of each individual is respected. In adopting a &lsquo;Dignity Charter&rsquo;, the Defence Forces subscribes to this commitment by seeking to create and maintain a positive working environment that recognises and protects the right of each individual to dignity at work, and to ensure that all individuals are aware of and committed to the principles set out in this Charter and the Military Authorities have advised that the Commanders of each unit/ staff section are required to ensure that copies of this Charter are widely displayed in their own areas of command responsibility.</p>  <p>  The need to care for the well-being of its members is a priority for the Defence Forces and in this regard, the Personnel Support Service (PSS) is in place for the use of members and their immediate family, The Brigade PSS Office and Occupational Social Worker network in each Brigade/Formation supports Defence Forces personnel and their families in times of crisis and general difficulty. Services include the provision of information and advice on areas including stress management, counselling and referral options.</p>  <p>  Through its various policies and strategies, I am satisfied therefore that the Defence Forces are taking all reasonable steps to provide an inclusive workplace environment, free from harassment, intimidation and bullying, and where dignity and respect are afforded to all. </p>  <p>  Unacceptable forms of behaviour are not tolerated in the Defence Forces and where there are allegations of offences having been committed, investigations will be initiated by the appropriate authorities.</p></reply>

In this regard, the full spectrum of Defence Forces personnel and equipment, commensurate with operational requirements, is available for deployments.  The Defence Forces hold a wide range of engineering and transport plant and equipment which is suitable for use in emergency situations and these are made available, within current means and capabilities, as the need arises. </p><p>At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, a Joint Task Force was established to coordinate the Defence Forces contribution to the whole-of-Government COVID-19 response. It has the authority to draw together, in a joint manner, the contribution of all of the elements of the Defence Forces &ndash; Army, Air Corps, Naval Service, Reserve, etc. This was provided for in a Defence Forces Regulation signed by and under the authority of the Minister for Defence.</p><p>The Defence Forces Joint Task Force is based in McKee Barracks and its priority from the beginning has been to provide support to the HSE, while retaining, at all times, a contingent capacity to provide Aid to the Civil Power support.  The wide range of supports that the Defence Forces have provided to the HSE, as coordinated by the Joint Task Force during the COVID-19 crisis include:</p><p>- operation of the COVID-19 testing centre at the Aviva stadium; </p><p>- support for contact tracing efforts;</p><p>- transportation by the Air Corps of COVID-19 tests to Germany;</p><p>- collection of PPE from more than 260 cargo flights and the ongoing storage and distribution of this PPE to various HSE sites;</p><p>- support for HSE testing efforts including through the deployment of Naval Service vessels to Dublin, Cork and Galway; </p><p>- PPE training to workers at Cork and Waterford harbours by Naval service personnel;</p><p>- provision of tentage and marshalling support at various HSE testing sites around the country;</p><p>- transportation of patients for testing;</p><p>- assistance with the fit out of temporary facilities for the HSE (for example, the HSE facilities at City West and the University of Limerick);</p><p>- production and assembly of PPE using 3D printing facilities; and</p><p>- the use of lands at Ballymullen Barracks as a COVID-19 testing facility and contact tracing hub. </p><p>In addition to supporting the HSE, the Defence Forces have also provided a broad range of support to other Departments and Agencies. Provision of this support was also coordinated by the Joint Task Force and examples include:</p><p>- Support has been provided to the National Ambulance Service through Defence Forces ambulance and crew supports along with tele-triage supports and Covid 19 testing supports.</p><p>- Support to the Office of Government Procurement through assistance with storage and distribution of PPE.</p><p>- Support to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government through the use of lands at Sarsfields Barracks for the location of one of the National Temporary Body Storage Facilities. The Defence Forces were also on standby to provide support if required at the Dublin based National Temporary Body Storage Facility at the Royal Hospital Kilmainham.</p></reply>

The purpose of this process was to allow as many students as possible to progress to employment, further education and training, or higher education. </p>  <p>  The system is underpinned by key principles of objectivity, equity and fairness. For the Calculated Grades system to be operated with integrity, and to ensure fairness to all students, an estimated percentage mark, based on credible, satisfactory evidence, could only be accepted from an appropriate source. </p>  <p>  There are two particular groups of students who may not have been able to receive Calculated Grades and they will already have been advised of this during August 2020:</p>  <p>  - students who were enrolled in full-time education but were studying an extra subject(s) outside the school;</p>  <p>  - external students who were not enrolled in full-time education and are regarded as out-of-school learners. These would include home-schooled students.</p>  <p>  In cases where a student was attending school, but was studying one or more subjects outside of school, school principals were asked to make every effort to provide an estimated percentage mark for that subject(s) provided there was sufficient, credible evidence available from an appropriate source. The Calculated Grades Executive Office (CGEO) undertook a review of reports received from schools to ensure that the correct procedures were followed. </p>  <p>  Out of school learners had to apply directly to the CGEO for Calculated Grades.  Of the total of 929 students in the category of out-of-school learner it was possible to provide calculated grades to some 570 students.  Some 190 students either did not engage in the application process or confirmed that they did not want to receive a calculated grade.  </p></reply>

The Strategy recognises however that schools require investment in their ICT infrastructure. Funding of &euro;210m has been committed to support the implementation of this strategy with &euro;110m issued over the last three years and a further &euro;50m issued recently in respect of the 2019-2020 school year. The remaining &euro;50m under this provision will issue to schools during the current school year (2020-2021) subject to the availability of exchequer funding.</p>  <p>  This funding can be focussed on assisting schools to address ICT needs including the purchase of devices, software and infrastructural solutions to support the provision of remote learning, including the purchase of digital devices that can be shared with students who do not have access to devices. Schools are best placed to determine the most appropriate solution to adopt in terms of supporting the learning needs of their students based on their own context and circumstances.</p>  <p>  Schools have been advised of direct drawdown mechanisms for the purchase of laptops. HEAnet operates an aggregated order process on its Single Provider Framework with Dell, while Datapac also do so through a Single Provider Framework with HP. Both of these Frameworks have been established from the OGP Framework of Providers of Laptops. This was intended to enable laptop orders from schools to be prioritised, during the current public health crisis. Schools are responsible for the procurement of any such equipment in accordance with relevant procurement requirements and according to their own needs.</p>  <p>  The Professional Development Service for Teachers Technology in Education (PDST-TIE) offers advice and supports to schools on digital learning. Advice sheets are available on digital technology in education, including on the adoption of laptops and tablets in schools. The information on their website outlines what these devices can offer schools to support teaching, learning and assessment, and facilitate students' active learning and collaboration. Specific items for consideration including software and hardware requirements and purchasing regulations, are addressed in the support information. </p>  <p>  Separately, and through the Schools Broadband Access Programme, my Department provides for improved ICT infrastructure for the supply of internet connectivity for all recognised primary and post primary schools and some 98% of schools avail of this service. The delivery of high quality internet connectivity for all schools, to support the embedding of digital technologies in teaching and learning, is a key objective of my Department. The Schools Broadband Programme is operated by my Department at an annual cost of some &euro;13m.</p>  <p>  It is recognised of course that poor access to home broadband does present challenges for the education system in the current crisis. With this in mind, schools have been asked to consider the needs of students who may not have access to online facilities and to address this in their responses. My Department will continue to work with the education partners to support schools on how best to use digital and other solutions to provide continuity of learning for students at this time. </p>  <p>  The National Traveller Roma Inclusion Strategy (NTRIS) published by the Department of Justice and Equality provides the framework and strategic direction for interventions across a range of Government Departments to support the additional needs of the Traveller and Roma communities in Ireland.  Officials of my Department participate in the national steering group and oversee the implementation of the education actions of NTRIS. </p></reply>

The Leaving Certificate results of these students will remain unchanged as they do every year in these circumstances. </p>  <p>  The CAO system operates on behalf of the higher education institutions solely on the basis of the Leaving Certificate results that candidates have been awarded. </p>  <p>  Therefore, the CAO cannot differentiate within the group of candidates with the 2020 Leaving Certificate, just as the CAO cannot treat a 2019 Leaving Certificate candidate differently from a 2020 one. The CAO process for 2020 has been undertaken on that basis and there is no scope for the CAO to re-assess the selection of students for higher education programmes on the basis of any information that does not relate to the formal results of the Leaving Certificate in 2020 or any other year.</p>  <p>  There has been an increase in the numbers of available places in colleges this year so that improved CAO offers can be made to all candidates who benefitted from upgraded Leaving Certificate results. There were also extensive additional higher education places in 2020 &ndash; the most places ever offered &ndash; and the Department of Further and Higher Education and the higher education institutions are fully committed to providing further places to accommodate all students who are entitled to improved CAO offers. </p>  <p>  Of the 485 candidates who received improved CAO offers last week, some of them will move from one course to another and this will create the potential for further offers to other candidates in succeeding rounds of the CAO. This will mean an overall increase in the numbers of students in third-level education. </p></reply>

In the absence of these examinations, every effort has been made to make the system as fair as possible for as many students as possible.</p>  <p>  The process of national standardisation, which forms a key part of the Calculated Grades process, was applied to the information provided by schools in order to ensure comparability between the standards applied by individual schools and the national standard.  In order to be fair to the class of 2020, the teacher judgements made at the level of the school had to be adjusted so that a common national standard was applied. It was inherent to the system of calculated grades that school estimates would be subject to adjustment through this standardisations process.  </p>  <p>  These adjustments resulted in the school estimates of subject percentage marks staying the same or being revised upwards or downwards. The standardisation process operated on the premise that the school estimates should only be adjusted through the standardisation process where there was credible statistical evidence to justify changing them.  </p>  <p>  A standardising process happens every year and would have happened in 2020 had the Leaving Certificate examinations been run as normal.  In the system of calculated grades, the standardisation process applied uniformly across all subject and levels and school types.  The degree to which mark changes occurred related to the degree of over or underestimation in the school estimates for each subject and each level.  This means that some students experienced mark changes from the school estimates but no changes to the grades based on the school estimates; while others will have experienced marks changes from the teacher estimates leading to grade changes in one or more of their subjects.  </p>  <p>  Following standardisation, the estimated percentage mark was converted to a calculated mark and subsequently, a calculated grade which was provided to students on 7 September. It is only at this point that students were awarded a grade.  </p>  <p>  Therefore, it is not accurate to state that student(s) were downgraded, or upgraded, through the standardisation process.  Rather the grade that was awarded following the standardisation process is the grade for the 2020 Leaving Certificate (Calculated Grades).  </p>  <p>  The overall data on school estimated marks showed that there was a very significant rise in estimated grades against what would normally be achieved nationally. This level of grade increase based on the school estimates would have been unrealistic. For example, based on the school data, there would have been 13.8% H1 grades this year when in a normal year it is approximately 5.8%. Even with the standardisation process the rate of H1s this year is over 9%.  </p>  <p>  While some students will be disappointed at the results they have achieved, this is the case every year when the Leaving Certificate results are published. It may be more difficult for students to understand when they see the estimated mark from the school. </p>  <p>  The appeals process for Calculated Grades was open to students who were disappointed with the Calculated Grades they received in one or more subjects. In addition, students had the option to register to sit the 2020 written Leaving Certificate exams due to commence on 16 November. </p></reply>

In addition, payments or submission of medical card details for Post-Primary seats completed or made after 4th August 2020 will be only considered when 50% capacity, required by new Covid19 public health guidelines, is achieved on each route. </p>  <p>  Given the health advice which my Department received from NPHET, my Department and Bus &Eacute;ireann are presently focused on achieving 50% capacity across post-primary school transport services. The timeframe for this will vary from route to route but all efforts are being made to do so as soon as possible.

In the absence of these examinations, every effort has been made to make the system as fair as possible for as many students as possible.</p>  <p>  The process of national standardisation, which forms a key part of the Calculated Grades process, was applied to the information provided by schools in order to ensure comparability between the standards applied by individual schools and the national standard.  In order to be fair to the class of 2020, the teacher judgements made at the level of the school had to be adjusted so that a common national standard was applied. It was inherent to the system of calculated grades that school estimates would be subject to adjustment through this standardisations process.  </p>  <p>  These adjustments resulted in the school estimates of subject percentage marks staying the same or being revised upwards or downwards. The standardisation process operated on the premise that the school estimates should only be adjusted through the standardisation process where there was credible statistical evidence to justify changing them.  </p>  <p>  A standardising process happens every year and would have happened in 2020 had the Leaving Certificate examinations been run as normal.  In the system of calculated grades, the standardisation process applied uniformly across all subject and levels and school types.  The degree to which mark changes occurred related to the degree of over or underestimation in the school estimates for each subject and each level.  This means that some students experienced mark changes from the school estimates but no changes to the grades based on the school estimates; while others will have experienced marks changes from the teacher estimates leading to grade changes in one or more of their subjects.  </p>  <p>  Following standardisation, the estimated percentage mark was converted to a calculated mark and subsequently, a calculated grade which was provided to students on 7 September. It is only at this point that students were awarded a grade.  </p>  <p>  Therefore, it is not accurate to state that student(s) were downgraded, or upgraded, through the standardisation process.  Rather the grade that was awarded following the standardisation process is the grade for the 2020 Leaving Certificate (Calculated Grades).  </p>  <p>  The overall data on school estimated marks showed that there was a very significant rise in estimated grades against what would normally be achieved nationally. This level of grade increase based on the school estimates would have been unrealistic. For example, based on the school data, there would have been 13.8% H1 grades this year when in a normal year it is approximately 5.8%. Even with the standardisation process the rate of H1s this year is over 9%.    </p>  <p>  While some students will be disappointed at the results they have achieved, this is the case every year when the Leaving Certificate results are published. It may be more difficult for students to understand when they see the estimated mark from the school. </p>  <p>  The appeals process for Calculated Grades was open to students who were disappointed with the Calculated Grades they received in one or more subjects. In addition, students had the option to register to sit the 2020 written Leaving Certificate exams due to commence on 16 November. </p></reply>

It is not possible to appeal the information (estimated percentage mark or rank order) provided by the school.  Due to the nature of the Calculated Grades system the professional judgement of the school is outside of the appeals process.  The design of the statistical model and the application of the national standardisation process is also outside of the scope of the appeals process.  </p>  <p>  At the time of closing the appeal application process on Wednesday 16 September, some 12,300 students had appealed almost 33,700 grades.  </p>  <p>  The appeals process is continuing as normal following the announcements on 30 September and 03 October regarding errors found in the Calculated Grades model. This applies whether or not a student received an improved grade following the rectification of the errors. This is because the appeals process is a technical appeal, focussed on looking for errors in the transmission and processing of student data through the process. </p>  <p>  The results of Stage 1 and 2 appeals will be made available in the coming days. </p>  <p>  The third stage of the appeals process, on option to have the process reviewed by independent appeal scrutineers, will commence after the release of Stage 1 and Stage 2 appeals results.  It is not possible to provide an expedited appeal for any student or group of students. All appeals will be processed and results released simultaneously to ensure fairness and equity to all.</p>  <p>  The CAO will be automatically notified by the Department of the outcomes of the appeals process.</p>  <p>  If, as a result of an upgrade, a student becomes eligible for a college place at a higher CAO preference than the one they were already offered, they will be eligible for that course.</p>  <p>  It is not possible to guarantee at this stage that, following a successful appeal, a student will be able to take up such a place offered in the academic year 2020/21. This depends on factors such as the number of appeals received, the nature of the appeal, and the higher education course being applied for. However, where possible, higher education institutions will attempt to facilitate students who are upgraded and receive a new offer.</p></reply>

Currently, almost 20% of the total Education Vote or &euro;2.0bn is invested in supporting children with special needs.  </p>  <p>  The numbers of special classes, special education teachers and special needs assistants are at unprecedented levels. </p>  <p>  Since 2011, the number of special classes in mainstream schools has increased by almost 235% from 548 to 1,836 for the 2020/2021 school year. Of these 1,321 special classes are in primary schools.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the extent of this investment, there are some parts of the country, including South Dublin, where increases in population and other issues have led to concerns regarding a shortage of school places.</p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide. NCSE is continuing its engagement with schools, patron bodies, parents and others across South Dublin to bring the required additional special class and special school placements on stream. While progress has been achieved, the NCSE has identified the need for additional special class and special school places in South Dublin for the current school-year. </p>  <p>  Normally, special class and special school places are established with the full cooperation of the schools in areas where they are required.  However there are some parts of the country where the NCSE has faced challenges in getting schools and their patrons to provide new special class or special school places.  </p>  <p>  As Minister, I have a power under Section 37A of the Education Act 1998 (as inserted by Section 8 of the Education (Admissions to Schools) Act 2018), to direct a school to provide additional provision where all reasonable efforts have failed.  The legislation contains a procedure through which the capacity of schools in an area can be tested and through which ultimately a Ministerial direction can be made requiring a school to make additional special education provision available. </p>  <p>  The legislation was used for the first time in 2019, in respect of the Dublin 15 area. Significant progress has been made in that area on foot of action taken under Section 37. A new Special School was established and six schools have agreed to open special classes thereby meeting the need for additional places in the area. The experience of Dublin 15 shows that real and practical challenges can be addressed by working together to provide additional special class and special school places.</p>  <p>  A Report from the NCSE, prepared in accordance with Section 37A (2) of the Education Act 1998 (as inserted by Section 8 of the Education (Admissions to Schools) Act 2018), confirming the need for additional special education places in South Dublin was submitted to the then Minister in April last. This Report is available on my Department&rsquo;s website. </p>  <p>  Statutory notices under the Act were subsequently issued on 26 June, 2020 to 39 schools identified by the NCSE. The issue of the notices is but the first step in a very transparent multi-step process, the purpose of which is to establish if the school has capacity to provide new places. At each stage of the process, schools are given the opportunity to make representations and there is also an option for arbitration at a later point. Statutory notices issued under the Act together with the representations received from the schools and their patrons are published on my Department&rsquo;s website. The representations received to date have all been published and are a matter of public record.</p>  <p>  It would not be appropriate for me to comment further at this stage on the legislative process which is currently underway.</p></reply>

The statistical model underpinning the system of Calculated Grades is a complex and sophisticated bespoke development.  Developing a brand-new system for providing examinations results to students in the circumstances of not being able to hold examinations was always going to be hugely challenging.  The system was developed specifically for the Irish Leaving Certificate, and within an extremely tight timeframe in order for students to get their Calculated Grades results in time. In light of the intensity of the timeframe for this work, the code was being written, developed and refined on an iterative basis.  </p><p>The code was written for the system of Calculated Grades by Polymetrika International Incorporated based in Canada.  The principal of Polymetrika, Fernando Cartwright is considered an international expert in the field of statistics and psychometrics, the science of educational testing.  This was a bespoke development in response to the inability to run the 2020 Leaving Certificate.  </p><p>Technical details of the Calculated Grades model and standardisation process were published on the date of issue of the Calculated Grades results and are available at .</p><p>The code operationalizing the algorithms in the analysis used a combination of custom-developed ECMAscript, standard numerical and statistical libraries, and SQL. The algorithm implementation used custom-developed code. In all, some 50,000 lines of code were contained within the complex statistical estimation system required to operationalise the standardisation process. </p><p>Following the discovery of errors in the way in which junior cycle data had been extracted and used within the model I (the Department) contracted with Educational Testing Services, the world-leading US-based non-profit organisation which specialises in educational measurement, to provide an independent expert opinion on the adequacy of the coding underpinning the standardization process, so as to provide a level of reassurance that students&rsquo; results are as intended by the standardization process.ETS evaluated the corrections made to the code and determined that the data extraction works as described in the technical document. It is the professional and expert opinion of ETS that the revision is now correct.</p></reply>

Currently, almost 20% of the total Education Vote or &euro;1.9bn is invested in supporting children with special needs.  </p>  <p>  The numbers of special classes, special education teachers and special needs assistants are at unprecedented levels. </p>  <p>  Since 2011, the number of special classes in mainstream schools has increased by almost 235% from 548 to 1,836 for the 2020/2021 school year. Of these 1,321 special classes are in primary schools.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the extent of this investment, there are some parts of the country, including Cork, where increases in population and other issues have led to concerns regarding a shortage of school places.</p>  <p>  It is open to any school to seek to open a special class and there is a range of supports available for schools in terms of funding, specialist advice and professional development.  As Minister, I have powers under Section 37A of the Education Act to direct a school to provide additional places but this power is only used as a last resort and where all reasonable efforts have failed.</p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide. The NCSE is working with schools, patron bodies, parents and others in Cork to bring the additional special education placements on stream. </p>  <p>  I am pleased to report that progress has been made with regard to the provision of additional special class places.  However, the NCSE has identified the need for additional special school places in Cork for the current school-year. In this regard, I can confirm that my Department and the NCSE are working with the Patron and management of an existing special school on expanding its provision.</p>  <p>  Planning is also underway to ensure that children in the Cork area are provided with a suitable placement in the next school-year.  Through better planning at both national and local level, it is my objective that specialist education places should come on stream to meet emerging demand on a timely basis. However, the active collaboration of school communities is essential in this regard.  </p></reply>

In the 2019/20 school year over 120,000 children, including over 14,200 children with special educational needs, were transported in over 5,000 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country covering over 100 million kilometres at a cost of over &euro;219m in 2019. </p>  <p>  The purpose of my Department's School Transport Scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school.</p>  <p>  Under the terms of the Post Primary School Transport Scheme, children are eligible for school transport where they reside not less than 4.8kms from and are attending their nearest Post Primary School/Education Centre as determined by the Department/Bus &Eacute;ireann, having regard to ethos and language. </p>  <p>  All children who are eligible for school transport and who completed the application and payment process on time have been accommodated on school transport services for the 2020/21 school year where such services are in operation.

A stable, secure learning environment is an essential requirement to achieve this goal.  Schools have autonomy in choosing the resources and programmes that best support the work within their own classrooms.  </p>  <p>  While respecting schools' autonomy, my Department has introduced a number of measures to assist schools as they become more inclusive of all cultures and ethnicities, celebrate diversity and challenge racism and discrimination.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to address the areas of anti-racism, identity-based bullying and cultural awareness through a suite of supports including the recently revised &lsquo;Stay Safe Programme&rsquo; and within Continuing Professional Development (CPD) to teachers at Primary and Post-Primary level and in initial teacher education. It will ensure that such programmes enable teachers to deal with teaching and learning needs of all students from all cultural backgrounds and provide support for pedagogical practices that promote inclusion.</p>  <p>  In addition to the supports already available to teachers through current CPD programmes, the Junior Cycle for Teachers (JCT) History team are planning a number of continuous professional development opportunities for teachers in the school year 2020-21, to support them in teaching topics that include race/overcoming diversity. Work is underway to develop webinars and podcasts that support teachers in exploring diverse human histories with students and to develop resources on controversial issues such as racism and privilege in History.</p>  <p>  My Department's &lsquo;Wellbeing Policy Statement and Framework for Practice (2019)' acknowledges that schools provide opportunities to develop friendships and to respectfully encounter diversity and access support structures.  The policy promotes the provision of a whole-school approach at both primary and post-primary level to supporting wellbeing, an approach that has been found internationally to produce a wide range of educational and social benefits for individual children and young people, including increased inclusion, greater social cohesion, increased social capital and improvements to mental health.  </p>  <p>  The Action Plan on Bullying, published in January 2013, sets out my Department's approach to tackling bullying and promoting an anti-bullying culture in schools. It recommended 12 actions that focus on support for schools, teacher training, research and awareness raising and aims to ensure that all forms of bullying including identity based bullying are addressed.  National Anti-Bullying Procedures for Primary and Post Primary schools, were published in September 2013 and are being implemented in all 4,000 primary and post primary schools throughout the country. The procedures are designed to give direction and guidance to school authorities and school personnel in preventing and tackling school-based bullying behaviour including identity based bullying amongst their pupils.  The procedures make clear that the definition of bullying behaviour includes identity-based bullying such as racist bullying. The procedures require that the prevention of bullying must be an integral part of a school&rsquo;s anti-bullying policy. </p>  <p>  In addition, curriculum at both primary and post-primary aims to foster inclusivity where equality and diversity are promoted.  The Primary Curriculum acknowledges the importance of a balanced and informed awareness of the diversity of peoples and environments in the world. Such an awareness helps children to understand the world and contributes to their personal and social development as citizens of a global community. The curriculum promotes tolerance and respect for diversity in both the school and the community.   The Social Personal and Health Education Curriculum (SPHE) supports students learning in the areas of inclusion, diversity and counter racism. The SPHE content is complemented by the work carried out in social, environmental and scientific education (SESE) at primary SESE enables the child to live as an informed and caring member of local and wider communities.</p>  <p>  The Junior Cycle curriculum is designed in terms of learning outcomes, so it allows the flexibility and room for innovative approaches to content to suit the context of a given classroom. Learning outcomes from the junior cycle can be related to many topical issues. In addition, there are twenty four statements of learning which should inform the programme designed by all schools.  One of these statements is: (The student) appreciates and respects how diverse values, beliefs and traditions have contributed to the communities and culture in which she/he lives</p>  <p>  As a result of the learning outcomes approach, teachers can facilitate discussion around diversity, prejudice, discrimination and racism, as well as the many other topical issues which might arise during the course of a class. For example, in Learning Outcome 1.2 (JC History) students are asked to consider contentious or controversial issues in history from more than one perspective and discuss the historical roots of a contentious or controversial issue or theme in the contemporary world</p>  <p>  The two Classroom-Based Assessments (CBAs) in the junior cycle specification allows students to explore topics that are interesting and relevant to their own lives. There are often opportunities for these projects to be exhibited or shared with classmates or with the school, so that there is greater awareness and understanding of the issues discussed.</p>  <p>  As part of the Department&rsquo;s ongoing curricular reform consideration of issues in relation to inclusivity/diversity etc. will be considered as part of the ongoing reviews in relation to the primary curriculum and senior cycle at post-primary.</p>  <p>  In terms of textbooks used within a classroom setting, the Department has no role in promoting any particular text or resource used in the delivery of the curriculum, apart from a list of prescribed texts for Junior and Senior Cycle. A diverse range of authors, including poets and playwrights, is included in the prescribed lists of texts and schools have the autonomy to choose any text from these lists, in order to best serve the needs of their learners.</p>  <p>  A variety of factors influence the selection of prescribed texts, including the aspiration to achieve social and cultural diversity and inclusivity, the age appropriateness of texts, the merit of the text on grounds of excellence, as well as practical factors, such as availability and cost.  </p>  <p>  As prescribed lists are developed from year to year, additional factors come to the fore and influence the choices made. In addition, newly published authors are considered for inclusion.

The purpose of this process was to allow as many students as possible to progress to employment, further education and training, or higher education. </p><p>The Calculated Grades system was designed to use estimates of students&rsquo; likely performance in the Leaving Certificate examinations (collected from schools following an alignment process overseen by the school&rsquo;s principal) and a national standardisation process to produce Leaving Certificate results. </p><p>Circular letter 0037/2020 included &lsquo;Calculated Grades for Leaving Certificate 2020 - Guide for Schools on Providing Estimated Percentage Marks and Class Rank Orderings&rsquo;, which was published on 21 May, set out the detailed guidance for schools on the operation of the calculated grades process. The document provided detailed information on the process of estimating marks for students to receive calculated grades.  Additional guidance to schools on the avoidance of unconscious bias and interpreting evidence of achievement in the case of students with disabilities was issued to schools on 28 May. </p><p>Under the process schools provided an estimated percentage mark and a rank order for each student&rsquo;s subjects. In line with the guidance, teachers were firstly asked to use their professional judgement to arrive at an estimated subject percentage mark and class ranking for each student. The guidance required teachers to utilise a number of records in assessing a student&rsquo;s performance and progress; for example, classwork and homework; class assessments; examinations in school at Christmas or summer, mock exams and also coursework.  The teacher estimation stage was followed by an in-school alignment process. The main purpose of the alignment process was to ensure that all teachers who were providing estimated percentage marks in respect of the same subject in the school were applying standards that were appropriate and were consistent with each other when doing so. </p><p>The process of national standardisation was subsequently applied to the school information in order to ensure comparability between the standards applied by individual schools and the national standard. It is known from research that teachers are very good at making judgements about their students in the local context of the school.  It was inherent to the system of calculated grades that school estimates would be subject to adjustment through this standardisation process.  The adjustments that occurred through standardisation resulted in the school estimates staying the same or being revised upwards or downwards. The standardisation process operated on the premise that the school estimates should only be adjusted through the standardisation process where there was credible statistical evidence to justify changing them.  </p><p>Individual Junior Cycle results were not used to determine any individual&rsquo;s Calculated Grades. Rather, the Calculated Grades process took account of the overall Junior Cycle performance of the Leaving Certificate class of 2020 in each school and used this aggregate level data to help in predicting the likely range of Leaving Certificate performance of that group using related information about the relationship between performance at Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate based on national data over time for that subject at that level.  </p></reply>

In the 2019/20 school year over 120,000 children, including over 14,200 children with special educational needs, were transported in over 5,000 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country covering over 100 million kilometres at a cost of over &euro;219m in 2019. </p>  <p>  The purpose of my Department's School Transport Scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school. </p>  <p>  All children who are eligible for school transport and who completed the application and payment process on time have been accommodated on school transport services for the 2020/2021 school year where such services are in operation.   </p>  <p>  My Department has been engaging intensively with Bus &Eacute;ireann in regard to the logistics for the safe operation of School Transport Scheme services for the 2020/2021 school year. My Department has also been engaging with Bus &Eacute;ireann on the logistics involved with the rolling implementation of measures on post-primary services as required to provide physical distancing, in line with those required on public transport, aligned to the public health advice received shortly before schools reopened which advised that the post-primary scheme should run at 50% capacity.   </p>  <p>  My Department is engaging with Bus &Eacute;ireann in respect of these plans, in order to implement measures so that any post-primary services that could operate from the start of the school year at 50% capacity are doing so and over the coming period all other post-primary transport services will be re-organised and additional services will be provided as required to allow for physical distancing</p>  <p>  I am pleased to advise that Government has agreed to provide the necessary funding to ensure that full implementation of the public health recommendation of running buses for post-primary children is achieved as quickly as possible on the post-primary scheme and on the special educational needs scheme for post-primary children.  As well as additional funding, significant numbers of additional vehicles, drivers and bus escorts will be required.  Bus &Eacute;ireann is implementing different means of providing extra capacity with existing operators, including upgrading vehicles, additional runs or additional vehicles being provided.  Where additional services will need to be procured, Bus &Eacute;ireann has put in place a framework of operators that are willing to provide additional services where required.  </p>  <p>For those children who are eligible for transport under the terms of the post-primary school transport scheme and whose parents decide not to use post-primary transport for the 2020/2021 school year, in light of the impact of most recent health advice, my Department will provide a grant to support them with the cost of private transport arrangements.  Parents of children on mainstream services were asked to inform the Department by Friday 4 of September and parents of children on Special Educational Needs services were asked to inform the Department by 18 of September, if they wished to avail of this option. Grants will be paid at the end of the school year following receipt of relevant documentation confirming the number of days the child/ren have attended school in the 2020/2021 school year. </p>  <p>  I can advise that, to date, my Department has contacted 336 families of mainstream eligible children to confirm their request and to outline next steps in regard to availing of this grant.  My Department is currently processing the details in the emails received from families of children on SEN services and will shortly be contacting these families in regard to the next steps.  When this process is complete my Department will contact the Deputy directly with full information on the numbers of families that have opted to avail of the grant towards the cost of making their own transport arrangements and will provide this information by county in tabular form as requested.  </p></reply>

It is not possible to appeal the information (estimated percentage mark or rank order) provided by the school.  Due to the nature of the Calculated Grades system the professional judgement of the school is outside of the appeals process.  The design of the statistical model and the application of the national standardisation process is also outside of the scope of the appeals process.  </p><p>At the time of closing the appeal application process on Wednesday 16<sup></sup>September, some 12,300 students had appealed almost 33,700 grades.  </p><p>The appeals process is continuing as normal following the announcements on 30 September and 03 October regarding errors found in the Calculated Grades model. This applies whether or not a student received an improved grade following the rectification of the errors. This is because the appeals process is a technical appeal, focussed on looking for errors in the transmission and processing of student data through the process. </p><p>The results of Stage 1 and 2 appeals will be made available in the coming days. </p><p>The third stage of the appeals process, on option to have the process reviewed by independent appeal scrutineers, will commence after the release of Stage 1 and Stage 2 appeals results.  It is not possible to provide an expedited appeal for any student or group of students. All appeals will be processed and results released simultaneously to ensure fairness and equity to all.</p><p>The CAO will be automatically notified by the Department of the outcomes of the appeals process.</p><p>If, as a result of an upgrade, a student becomes eligible for a college place at a higher CAO preference than the one they were already offered, they will be eligible for that course.</p><p>It is not possible to guarantee at this stage that, following a successful appeal, a student will be able to take up such a place offered in the academic year 2020/21. This depends on factors such as the number of appeals received, the nature of the appeal, and the higher education course being applied for. However, where possible, higher education institutions will attempt to facilitate students who are upgraded and receive a new offer.</p></reply>

The Leaving Certificate results of these students will remain unchanged as they do every year in these circumstances. </p>  <p>  The CAO system operates on behalf of the higher education institutions solely on the basis of the Leaving Certificate results that candidates have been awarded. </p>  <p>  Therefore, the CAO cannot differentiate within the group of candidates with the 2020 Leaving Certificate, just as the CAO cannot treat a 2019 Leaving Certificate candidate differently from a 2020 one. The CAO process for 2020 has been undertaken on that basis and there is no scope for the CAO to re-assess the selection of students for higher education programmes on the basis of any information that does not relate to the formal results of the Leaving Certificate in 2020 or any other year.</p>  <p>   There has been an increase in the numbers of available places in colleges this year so that improved CAO offers can be made to all candidates who benefitted from upgraded Leaving Certificate results. There were also extensive additional higher education places in 2020 &ndash; the most places ever offered &ndash; and the Department of Further and Higher Education and the higher education institutions are fully committed to providing further places to accommodate all students who are entitled to improved CAO offers. </p>  <p>  Of the 485 candidates who received improved CAO offers last week, some of them will move from one course to another and this will create the potential for further offers to other candidates in succeeding rounds of the CAO.

My Department invests &euro;1.9 Billion or almost 20% of its total educational budget annually on making additional provision for children with special educational needs.  This represents an increase of over 50% in total expenditure since 2011, at which point &euro;1.247 Billion per annum was provided. </p>  <p>  The policy of my Department is that all children with special educational needs, including those with autism, can have access to an education appropriate to their needs, preferably in school settings through the primary and post primary school network. </p>  <p>  This policy has been informed by published research, including the Report of the Task Force on Autism (2001), the Evaluation of Educational Provision for Children with Autistic Spectrum Disorders (ASD) (2006) and National Council for Special Education (NCSE) policy advice on Supporting Students with Autism Spectrum Disorder (2016).</p>  <p>  This policy ensures that the majority of children with special educational needs attend mainstream classes with their peers.</p>  <p>  Such placements facilitate access to individualised education programmes which may draw from a range of appropriate educational interventions, delivered by fully qualified professional teachers, with the support of Special Needs Assistants, Special Education Teachers and the appropriate school curriculum.</p>  <p>  But some students may find it difficult to manage full-time placement in mainstream and so placement in a Special Class or Special School setting where lower pupil/teacher ratios apply and there are other supports available.</p>  <p>  There is therefore not one preferred educational environment for children with special educational needs, rather there is a model which takes into account the identified educational needs of individual pupils.</p>  <p>  As such, my Department&rsquo;s policy focuses on ensuring that all students, including those with autism, can have access to an education appropriate to meeting their needs and abilities. </p>  <p>  The National Council for special Education is responsible to planning and coordinating local education provision and school placements for children with special needs for the whole country.  It has however advised that there are currently 60 classes supporting students with autism operating in mainstream schools in Limerick. These classes provide for up to 360 specialist places in mainstream schools based in a total of 37 Primary Schools and 23 Post Primary schools. 13 of these classes are new for the 2020/2021 school year.  In addition, 188 students with autism are supported within 5 Special Schools in Limerick.</p>  <p>  Taking a range of demographic factors into consideration, it is anticipated that additional places may be required in Limerick to cater for likely future demand in the city and county. The NCSE, through its network of local SENOs, will continue to engage with the local schools to establish additional classes as required.</p>  <p>  NCSE has also advised that there are currently 4 special classes operating in primary and post-primary mainstream schools in Newport, Co. Tipperary, supporting students with autism.  It is anticipated that a further special class will open here in September 2021, subject to available accommodation.</p>  <p>  A list of all special classes, including classes opened for September 2020, is available on the NCSE website at www.ncse.ie</p></reply>

Under the Programme for Government there is a commitment to seek to make further progress in reducing the pupil teacher ratios in primary schools.</p>  <p>  Previous budgets of 2016 and 2018 improved the staffing schedule by one point on both occasions to its historically lowest level ever of 1 teacher to 26 pupils. Primary schools are currently provided with class teachers on the basis of one teacher for every 26 pupils which is at its historically lowest level.  </p>  <p>  I am delighted to build further on this progress by announcing a further 1 point reduction in Budget 2021.  </p>  <p>  The staffing schedule for the 2021/22 academic year now stands at 1 teacher for every 25 pupils. This measure will help ensure better teacher retention in primary schools while also ensuring that  less pupils are required to retain or recruit a teacher.   </p>  <p>  Teacher numbers at primary level have increased by almost 3,500 when comparing the 2015/16 school year with the 2019/20 school year and this has led to a steady improvement in the pupil teacher ratio and average class size statistics during this period. </p>  <p>  The latest figures in relation to pupil teacher ratio show an improved ratio of teachers to students from 16:1 to 15:1 at primary level when comparing the 2015/16 school year to the 2019/20 school year.  Average class sizes improved from 24.9 to 24.1 in the same period.</p>  <p>  The DEIS programme allows for a reduced class size in Urban Band 1 primary schools with the application of a preferential staffing schedule to these schools of 20:1 at junior classes and 24:1 at senior classes to support those students at the highest risk of educational disadvantage. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, DEIS Plan acknowledges the allocation of teaching resources to DEIS primary schools with the highest concentrations of children at risk of educational disadvantage has served to improve learning outcomes.  It also commits to the evaluation of the level of teaching resources for schools participating in DEIS to be undertaken to inform future policy in this area.   </p>  <p>  In order to facilitate this a Class Size Working Group was established comprising representatives from the Education Partners, the Educational Research Centre and the relevant Business Units in my Department.</p>  <p>  A report on the work of this group is currently being finalised, and will take into consideration the feedback and observations of the working group members.  It is intended its findings will inform future policy direction in this area.  </p></reply>

The starting salary for a new entrant teacher in 2012 was &euro;30,702. As a result of the programme of pay restoration, the starting salary of a teacher from 1 October 2020 onwards will be &euro;37,692.</p>  <p>  Section 11 of the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 provides that &ldquo;the Minister [for Public Expenditure and Reform] shall, within three months of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before the Oireachtas a report on the cost of and a plan in dealing with pay equalisation for new entrants to the public service.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  The report laid before the Oireachtas on foot of this provision by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform assesses the cost of a further change which would provide a two scale point adjustment to new entrants recruited since 2011. The total cost of such an adjustment across the public sector is of the order of &euro;200 million, of which Education accounts for approximately &euro;83 million. The report also acknowledges that, during the financial crisis, there were policy changes which affected remuneration in different occupations across the public sector (including education).</p>  <p>  The matter of new entrant pay is a cross sectoral issue, not just an issue for the education sector alone. The Government supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants.</p>  <p>  The total year one cost of equalising the pay of new entrant teachers to the pre-2011 arrangements is estimated to be in the region of &euro;59 million per annum in year one (&euro;45 million for full resolution of pay scales and &euro;14 million for re-instatement of the H.Dip allowance).  The costs would rise in subsequent years as more new entrants join the system.</p>  <p>  On 24 September 2018, an agreement was reached between the Government and the public services committee of ICTU in respect of new entrant pay.</p>  <p>  This agreement is benefitting 16,000 teachers and nearly 5,000 SNAs within the education sector. The deal provides for a series of incremental jumps for new entrants.</p>  <p>  I am fully aware that the teacher unions have outstanding issues of concern following the September 2018 agreement. These outstanding matters will be given full consideration. This will happen in the context of the next round of pay talks. The positions of each of the parties on these matters must be given due regard in endeavouring to reach a mutually agreed resolution.</p>  <p>  The current series of restorative measures for new entrants have been achieved through continued engagement and collective bargaining between the Government and the public service unions and shows the benefits that such engagement can bring. </p></reply>

In the absence of these examinations, every effort has been made to make the system as fair as possible for as many students as possible.</p>  <p>  The process of national standardisation, which forms a key part of the Calculated Grades process, was applied to the information provided by schools in order to ensure comparability between the standards applied by individual schools and the national standard.  In order to be fair to the class of 2020, the teacher judgements made at the level of the school had to be adjusted so that a common national standard was applied. It was inherent to the system of calculated grades that school estimates would be subject to adjustment through this standardisations process.  </p>  <p>  These adjustments resulted in the school estimates of subject percentage marks staying the same or being revised upwards or downwards. The standardisation process operated on the premise that the school estimates should only be adjusted through the standardisation process where there was credible statistical evidence to justify changing them.  </p>  <p>  A standardising process happens every year and would have happened in 2020 had the Leaving Certificate examinations been run as normal.   In the system of calculated grades, the standardisation process applied uniformly across all subject and levels and school types.  The degree to which mark changes occurred related to the degree of over or underestimation in the school estimates for each subject and each level.  This means that some students experienced mark changes from the school estimates but no changes to the grades based on the school estimates; while others will have experienced marks changes from the teacher estimates leading to grade changes in one or more of their subjects.  </p>  <p>  Following standardisation, the estimated percentage mark was converted to a calculated mark and subsequently, a calculated grade which was provided to students on 7 September. It is only at this point that students were awarded a grade.  </p>  <p>  Therefore, it is not accurate to state that student(s) were downgraded, or upgraded, through the standardisation process.  Rather the grade that was awarded following the standardisation process is the grade for the 2020 Leaving Certificate (Calculated Grades).  </p>  <p>  The overall data on school estimated marks showed that there was a very significant rise in estimated grades against what would normally be achieved nationally. This level of grade increase based on the school estimates would have been unrealistic. For example, based on the school data, there would have been 13.8% H1 grades this year when in a normal year it is approximately 5.8%. Even with the standardisation process the rate of H1s this year is over 9%.    </p>  <p>  While some students will be disappointed at the results they have achieved, this is the case every year when the Leaving Certificate results are published. It may be more difficult for students to understand when they see the estimated mark from the school. </p>  <p>  The appeals process for Calculated Grades was open to students who were disappointed with the Calculated Grades they received in one or more subjects.

The Department's High Speed Broadband Programme, provides all recognised post-primary schools, high speed broadband with a minimum broadband speed of 100mbs. There are 58 special schools also included in this programme, managed for the Department by HEAnet. </p>  <p>  The school referred to by the Deputy has a high speed broadband connection of 100 Mbit/s which is uncontended and symmetrical, meaning this is a dedicated service to the school. Given that this is an uncontended service the school should have 100Mbp/s connectivity. HEAnet is currently conducting an extensive upgrade programme for post-primary schools that has already seen some 47% of schools upgraded to speeds greater that 200Mbp/s. A further 380 post-primary schools are now due an upgrade to that level of connectivity. That will see over 80% of post-primary schools with connections of 200 Mbp/s or higher. This school has already been identified as part of the cohort to be upgraded in the current school year, with work underway to procure that upgraded service.</p>  <p>  This upgrade programme is based on demonstrated requirements, and in the current circumstances the system is being closely monitored to prioritise those most in need of the higher speed connectivity, in line with contractual and procurement regulations.</p>  <p>  The delivery of high quality internet connectivity for all schools is a key objective of my Department, to support the embedding of digital technologies in teaching and learning. The Schools Broadband Programme is operated by my Department at an annual cost of some &euro;13m.</p></reply>

The purpose of this process was to allow as many students as possible to progress to employment, further education and training, or higher education. </p>  <p>  Schools provided an estimated percentage mark and a rank order for each student&rsquo;s subjects.  The process of national standardisation was applied to the school information in order to ensure comparability between the standards applied by individual schools and the national standard. Schools approached this task in a very professional manner, in line with detailed guidelines about the process, but inevitably some schools were overly harsh in their estimations while others were overly generous. In order to be fair to the class of 2020, the teacher judgements made at the level of the school had to be adjusted so that a common national standard was applied.   </p>  <p>  These adjustments resulted in the school estimates staying the same or being revised upwards or downwards. The standardisation process operated on the premise that the school estimates should only be adjusted through the standardisation process where there was credible statistical evidence to justify changing them.  </p>  <p>  The degree to which mark changes occurred related to the degree of over or underestimation in the school estimates for each subject and each level.  This means that some students experienced mark changes from the school estimates but no changes to the grades based on the school estimates; while others will have experienced marks changes from the teacher estimates leading to grade changes in one or more of their subjects.  </p>  <p>  Following standardisation, the estimated percentage mark was converted to a calculated mark and subsequently, a calculated grade which was provided to students on 7 September. It is only at this point that students were awarded a grade.  </p>  <p>  Therefore, it is not accurate to state that student(s) were downgraded, or upgraded, through the standardisation process.  Rather the grade that was awarded following the standardisation process is the grade for the 2020 Leaving Certificate (Calculated Grades).  </p>  <p>  The statistical model used was blind to demographic characteristics either at the level of the student or the school.   The standardisation process means that the same standard has been applied uniformly across all schools.  </p>  <p>  While the datasets used to generate Calculated Grades do include certain demographic information, this demographic information was not used as part of the process of generating the calculated grades through the standardisation process.  </p>  <p>  Following the issue of the outcomes of the appeals of Calculated Grades, my Department will be arranging to update the national statistics for the 2020 Leaving Certificate (Calculated Grades) results issued on the 7 September with the revisions to these grades which resulted from the coding error which led to revised grades being issued to some students on the 3 October and with the outcomes of the appeals process.   When the revised data set is published, a full gender breakdown of the national data will be provided at that time.</p></reply>

My Department&rsquo;s role is to ensure the correct class of PRSI is being returned for individuals, in order to protect their PRSI contribution record and scheme entitlements and to ensure the correct flow of funds into the Social Insurance Fund. Work is ongoing in my Department to tackle such misclassification across the economy. </p>  <p>  Cases of misclassification of employment status are detected through employer inspections and investigations of queries by employers and workers.  Cases are sent to the Department&rsquo;s Scope Section for a decision.  This section usually handles between 1300 and 1500 PRSI-related cases each year of which 5-7% relate to employment status.</p>  <p>  It is important to point out that these cases do not always involve a deliberate or fraudulent misclassification of an employee as being self-employed.  Sometimes it happens that both employer and employee are genuinely mistaken in their approach and are happy to correct the position once the Department&rsquo;s officials make a determination. </p>  <p>  Where misclassification of employees is detected, social insurance arrears are assessed by Social Welfare Inspectors and collected as required.  Under the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, there are specific offences in relation to employment contributions. </p>  <p>  There are approximately 380 Social Welfare Inspectors appointed nationwide who carry out work across the various social welfare schemes and whose work can include employer inspections.  More than 100 of these Inspectors are members of the Department&rsquo;s Special Investigations Unit who work to detect social welfare fraud.  Inspections are also undertaken jointly with other agencies including the Revenue Commissioners and the Workplace Relations Commission.</p>  <p>  A number of Social Welfare Inspectors work in a dedicated unit &ndash; the Employment Status Investigation Unit (ESIU) &ndash; which focuses solely on targeting potential cases of false self-employment.  Since it began its operations in Q4 2019, the ESIU has been carrying out investigations in a wide range of sectors of the economy.  The Unit carries out both its own projects and works in liaison with other Inspectors and agencies nationwide. </p>  <p>  In order to raise awareness among employers and workers, an inter-departmental working group has been working with the social partners to revise the Code of Practice for determining employment or self-employment.  It is my intention to place the revised Code on a statutory footing.  I also intend to bring forward new legislative proposals to combat the deliberate misclassification of employees, including:</p>  <p>  - anti-victimisation measures to give workers recourse to the Workplace Relations Commission if they feel they have been victimised by their employer as a result of questioning their employment status, and  </p>  <p>  - the introduction of a new criminal offence of wilfully misclassifying a worker as being self-employed.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

It is extremely effective at ensuring that our pensioners do not experience poverty.  The Government is committed to ensuring that this remains the case.  This Government is also acutely conscious of the need to consider the sustainability of the State&rsquo;s finances.  Accordingly, any changes to State Pension payment rates would need to be considered in the overall policy and budgetary context. </p>  <p>  Recipients of State pension payments may already have access to a range of additional supports, subject to satisfying eligibility conditions.  These supports include the living alone increase, household benefits, telephone support allowance, free travel and fuel allowance.  In this context, in March of this year, as part of Government COVID-19 response measures, the Fuel Allowance scheme was extended by four weeks until Friday, 8th May 2020.  At a cost of &euro;31.5 million, the extension of the fuel season for over 352,000 existing eligible households was put in place, to ensure that the most vulnerable groups, particularly older people in receipt of State pensions, were provided with additional targeted financial supports.  This extension meant that the 2019/2020 Fuel Season ran to the latest end date of any season in the last 30 years.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that my Department also operates both Exceptional and Urgent Needs Payments as part of the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme for people of any age, who have an exceptional or urgent need which they cannot meet from their own resources.  Payments are made at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case.  The scheme is administered by the Community Welfare Service of the Department. </p>  <p>  While I fully understand that these are difficult times for many people, any further economic measures can only be considered while taking account of the overall budgetary context and the availability of financial resources.  </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This commitment is recognised in both the Programme for Government and the National Carers&rsquo; Strategy. </p>  <p>  My Department provides income supports to carers such as Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit, Domiciliary Care Allowance and the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant.  Combined spending on all these payments to family carers in 2020 is expected to exceed &euro;1.3 billion. </p>  <p>  Carer's Allowance is a means-tested payment for carers who, on a full-time basis, look after certain people in need of full-time care and attention, where the carer's income falls below certain limits.  At the end of September 2020, there were 88,156 people in receipt of Carer's Allowance.  The provisional outturn on Carer&rsquo;s Allowance for 2020 is estimated at &euro;916 million.</p>  <p>  In addition, a carer whose work ceases as a result of COVID-19 and whose situation qualifies them for the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment, is able to receive that payment along with their current carer income support, whether Carer&rsquo;s Allowance or Carer&rsquo;s Benefit.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, despite the substantial extra financial demands due to the COVID-19 crisis, I announced that the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant would continue to be paid to carers this year at an estimated cost of over &euro;230.84 million.  The annual grant of &euro;1,700 is available to all carers providing full-time care to an older person or a person with a disability, regardless of their means or social insurance contributions.  This grant can be used for any purpose at the discretion of the carer and it is not taxed.  Other people who are not in receipt of a social welfare payment but who are providing full time care and attention to someone who requires that level of care are also eligible and can apply for a grant.</p>  <p>  At the end of June 2020, almost 127,000 grants were paid to carers receiving the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit or Domiciliary Care Allowance and to other full-time carers who are not receiving any of these payments.  Applications for the 2020 grant can be submitted up until 31 December 2021, and it is expected that further applications will be received before the closing date. </p>  <p>  Apart from these income supports specifically in place for family carers, my Department also provides  support under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme.  The Department may make an exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet from their weekly income.  ENPs are administered by the Community Welfare Service (CWS) of the Department.  ENPs are payable at the discretion of the CWS officer taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case. </p>  <p>  The provision of medical supplies such as PPE is a matter for the HSE and the Department of Health. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that payments made by my Department to carers are set out under legislation.  There is no provision to make the type of top-up payment outlined by the Deputy. </p>  <p>  Finally, I can assure the Deputy that I am very aware of the key role carers play in society and the particular challenges they face in light of Covid-19 and I will continue to keep the range of supports available to carers under review.  Any improvements or additions to these supports, including rate changes, can only be considered in a budgetary context and in the light of available financial resources.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

In order to ensure that the scheme was simple and accessible for the unprecedented number of applicants, a flat payment rate was introduced. This rate was the equivalent of the rate for a two-person household. </p>  <p>  From 26 June 2020, the Pandemic Unemployment Payment moved to 2 rates of payment, and a 3 rate structure is in place since 17 September. These changes more closely link the rate of payment to the amount that individuals previously earned and make the scheme more targeted and fair. In determining the rate payable, the objective was to ensure that recent earnings were taken into account. </p>  <p>  The rate of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment for a self-employed person is calculated by reference to their reckonable income in either 2018 or 2019, whichever is the greater.  Details of reckonable income are supplied to the Department by the Revenue Commissioners, and are supplied net of business related costs, including capital allowances.  When submitting returns to the Revenue Commissioners, self-employed persons can offset business related costs against gross trading income, with the resulting assessment to tax and PRSI based on net profits.  </p>  <p>  I hope that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

All payments on each scheme, whether by collecting cash at the post office or depositing money directly into someone&rsquo;s bank account, have to be processed in the same way.</p>  <p>  Some schemes reverted to a weekly pattern in August.</p>  <p>  I met with An Post and the Irish Postmasters Union in recent weeks.  I have also listened to concerns expressed by groups such as St Vincent De Paul around the difficulties presented to our customers, including our most vulnerable, in trying to manage money on a fortnightly basis.</p>  <p>  In this context, I announced earlier this week that all weekly social welfare payments which had been moved to a fortnightly schedule from the end of March will be fully restored to being paid weekly with effect from Monday, 2nd November 2020.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that the period of time in which cash payments have to be collected at post offices has been considerably extended.

This allows for the payment to be paid directly into a current account in any financial institution, whether that be with An Post, a bank or a credit union.  An Post has been kept informed of this initiative.</p>  <p>  Finally, the rules around nominating agents to collect social welfare payments at post offices have also been changed to allow for more agent collections, whereby customers can nominated a trusted individual to collect a payment on their behalf.</p></reply>

This decision was taken to comply with HSE and WHO guidelines in respect of social distancing.</p>  <p>  To help ensure that those who required a PPSN could get one, my Department introduced an email and postal service through which applications could be made. Figures on the numbers of applications received, or awaiting a decision, are not available as it is usually the case that each application involves a number of emails between the Department and the applicant, for example, where insufficient information or documentation has been submitted in support of the application.</p>  <p>  For the same reason, data in respect of average waiting times, or applications by county, are not available. However, by its nature this process involves, in most cases, correspondence with the customer in respect of supporting documentation required. This means most applications cannot be dealt with instantly.</p>  <p>  Between January 2020 and the temporary postponement of SAFE registrations, 26,278 PPSNs were allocated to people seeking a PPSN. Since then, 23,009 PPSNs have been allocated to date to people who applied through the postal and email service.</p>  <p>  The Department has refused 6,287 PPSN applications since the temporary postponement of SAFE registrations.</p>  <p>  It is expected that the PPSN allocation service will be resumed in PPSN Centres by Monday October 19th. This will mean a return to normal for customers seeking a PPSN; once they have completed their face-to-face SAFE registration, they will be issued with their Public Services Card, containing their PPSN, within five working days of their SAFE registration.  The provision of the service, once fully resumed, will remain subject to HSE/WHO guidance.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This figure includes the additional four weeks of the Allowance which were paid to support these vulnerable households during the COVID-19 emergency.  The purpose of the  payment is to assist households with their winter heating costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the heating costs and is not intended to meet these costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household.</p>  <p>  Current figures indicate that approximately 362,000 households are in receipt of Fuel Allowance. Those who qualified for Fuel Allowance last year automatically receive the payment again this year provided they continue to fulfil the eligibility requirements.  They do not therefore need to re-apply.  Due to the payment of Fuel Allowance across different IT platforms, accurate numbers of claims received and disallowed are not readily  available.  However, based on the information available, approximately 27,500 applications have been received in 2020 to date, with 14,500 disallowed. Approximately 21,600 were disallowed in 2019, 22,000 in 2018 and 21,100 in 2017.  </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

During his time on CE he completed  7 modules of training, and achieved a QQI Major award in Hard Landscape Construction. The purpose of the training and support that the person concerned received while on CE was to prepare him for full-time sustainable employment.</p>  <p>  The aim of the CE programme is to enhance the employability of disadvantaged and unemployed people by providing work experience and training opportunities for them within their communities.  The programme helps break the cycle of unemployment and improve a person&rsquo;s chances of returning to the labour market. Participation on CE is intended to be for a temporary fixed-term.  These placements are not full-time sustainable jobs.  There are participation limits in place to ensure that as many unemployed people as possible are able to benefit from the scheme.</p>  <p>   The Department's Activation service can work with the person concerned to ensure that the benefits and experience he received during his time on CE are maximised.  This process will help identify potential employment opportunities and offer support to him in overcoming any barriers to employment.</p>  <p>   Under the Service Support Stream (SSS) of the CE Programme, participants aged 62 years and over may remain continuously on CE up to the State pension age subject to availability of places on the SSS, satisfactory performance on the project, the agreement of the sponsoring organisation and approval by the Department as SSS places are subject to a limit to 10% of participants per individual CE project.

The legislation does not confer a statutory right or entitlement to ENPs and every application is considered separately.</p>  <p>  ENPs may be considered in exceptional circumstances, where, because of the nature of the requirement, it would be unreasonable and unrealistic to expect the customer to meet the need from their own resources. ENPs may be considered in circumstances where the non-payment of same may cause serious hardship to the customer and/or their family.</p>  <p>  ENPSs are not intended to cater for expenses which are predictable and reoccurring and which should be budgeted for out of regular weekly income and should not be used to supplement primary Social Welfare payments and should only arise under exceptional conditions and not become a regular or standard practice. It is expected that weekly social welfare payments should cover normal clothing needs and assistance for clothing should only arise under exceptional conditions and not on a regular seasonal basis, or as standard practice.</p>  <p>  According to the records of my Department an ENP was paid to the person concerned in respect of clothing in October 2019.

The scheme can play an important role in breaking the cycle of long-term unemployment for some people and improve their chances of employment. </p>  <p>  In  order to qualify for CE, a number of conditions, including being in receipt of a qualifying social welfare payment for a specific period, must be met.   The focus of CE is on the cohort of long-term unemployed people and the programme is monitored on an on-going basis to ensure that the schemes are meeting the training and development needs of the CE participants and also delivering the intended services in the local communities. </p>  <p>  The priority for my Department is to ensure that all employment and activation programmes have the best outcomes for participants.  A number of new conditions were introduced on CE in July 2017 to further support progression and broaden access to CE to a wider range of people.  CE continues to support those who are furthest removed from the labour market and it is not the Department's intention to amend the CE guidelines or qualifying criteria at this particular time. </p>  <p>   As the Deputy will be aware, as part of the July Stimulus Package, the Government announced 3,000 additional places on State Employment Schemes, including the CE Scheme.  This will provide opportunities for an increase in existing CE participant numbers and services provided to local communities.</p>  <p>  A number of factors will inform the decision on the allocation of the additional places.  These factors will include, training and development opportunities on schemes,  participant development requirements, existing employment support schemes and regional Live Register data.</p>  <p>  I am fully committed to the future of this programme and will continue to support and improve the programme for the benefit of the CE participants and the valuable contribution being made to local communities. </p></reply>

The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household.</p>  <p>  My Department also pays an electricity or gas allowance under the Household benefits scheme at an estimated cost of &euro;194 million in 2020.  This is paid at a rate of &euro;35 per month, 12 months of the year.  </p>  <p>  The criteria for fuel allowance are framed in order to direct the limited resources available to my Department in as targeted a manner as possible.  A Public Service pension is not a qualifying payment for fuel allowance.  Qualifying payments for those aged 66 or over include State Pension (Contributory or Non-Contributory), Widow's, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner&rsquo;s Pension (Contributory), Deserted Wives Benefit, Incapacity Supplement under the Disablement Pension Scheme, Death Benefit Pension under Occupational Injuries Benefit Scheme as well as certain social security payments from a country covered by EU Regulations or a country with which Ireland has a Bilateral Social Security Agreement.   All other qualifying conditions must also be satisfied to receive the payment. </p>  <p>  The Living Alone Increase is a &euro;14 increase in the weekly rate of payment of certain Irish social protection payments, awarded where the recipient is living alone.  For those aged 66 or over,  payments include State Pension (Contributory), State Pension (Non-contributory) , Widow&rsquo;s, Widower&rsquo;s or Surviving Civil Partner&rsquo;s (Contributory) Pension,  Widow's/Widower's Pension under the Occupational Injuries Benefit Scheme, Incapacity Supplement under the Occupational Injuries Benefit Scheme and Deserted Wife's Benefit.  It is not a stand-alone payment.  There are no circumstances where the living alone increase can be paid to people who are not in receipt of a qualifying payment from my Department.</p>  <p>  Any decision to allow former Public Servants who are not in receipt of a qualifying payment to receive the fuel allowance or the living alone increase would have budgetary consequences and would have to be considered in the context of budget negotiations. </p>  <p>  Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, exceptional needs payments may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which customers are unable to meet from their own resources, and this may include exceptional heating costs.  Decisions on such payments are made on a case-by-case basis.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, as well as Luas and services provided by over 80 private transport operators.  There are currently approx. 979,000 customers with direct eligibility.  The estimated expenditure on free travel in 2020 is &euro;95 million.</p>  <p>  The objective of the free travel scheme is to ensure that older people and people with disabilities remain active within their community. The Free Travel Scheme was never intended as a targeted support for people with severe mobility issues.  Financial support may be provided to a wheelchair user in the circumstances the Deputy has outlined through the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme (SWA). Under the SWA scheme my Department may award a travel supplement, in any case where the particular circumstances of the case so warrant.  The supplement is intended to assist with ongoing or recurring travel costs that cannot be met from the client&rsquo;s own resources and are deemed to be necessary.  Every decision is based on consideration of the circumstances of the individual case, taking account of the nature and extent of the need and of the resources of the person concerned. </p>  <p>  My Department provides an annual funding contribution of &euro;1.5 million towards the Transport for Ireland Local Links Programme, which is administered by the National Transport Authority.  The Programme provides services to people whose travel needs are not met by existing bus or train services.  The Programme aims to enhance and sustain nationwide accessibility through community based participation, particularly for those at risk of social exclusion.  Services provided include door to door services on certain routes.  There are improvements in access to a range of transport support schemes available to persons with disabilities in the State and ongoing work is being carried out by Government Departments, agencies and transport providers, to further improve access to public transport services.</p>  <p>  In addition to services supported by my Department, the Revenue Commissioners operate a Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers scheme. This scheme provides VRT and VAT relief, an exemption from road tax and a fuel grant to drivers and passengers with a disability, who qualify under the relevant criteria set out in governing regulations made by the Minister for Finance. Specifically adapted vehicles driven by persons with a disability are also exempt from payment of tolls on national roads and toll bridges.  Transport Infrastructure Ireland has responsibility for this particular scheme.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Additional payments may also be made in respect of a qualified adult and qualifying children.  The measures were designed to ensure that where a registered medical practitioner or a HSE medical officer diagnoses a person with COVID-19 or identifies him or her as a probable source of infection of COVID-19, the person concerned can comply with medical advice to isolate, while having their income protected.  This is essential to limit and slow down the spread of the virus, to keep the number of people affected to a minimum, and to reduce a peak of cases which would cause extreme pressure on the health system.</p><p>The enhanced rate of Illness Benefit was brought in as a short-term public health measure and is not a long-term income support payment.  It is payable for 2 weeks where a person is isolating as a probable source of infection of COVID-19 and for up to 10 weeks where a person has been diagnosed with COVID-19.  There are no waiting days in respect of the enhanced illness benefit payment.  </p><p>From the outset of COVID-19, many employers have taken the initiative, in line with subsequent requests from the Government, to be as flexible as possible in allowing staff time off where required. Employers have a general duty of care towards their workers and that care is often expressed in the form of negotiation, compromise and flexibility.  Some of the options to be considered for workers with responsibilities that preclude them from working their normal hours in the normal, pre-COVID-19, may include: </p><p>- offering paid compassionate leave,</p><p>- allowing employees to work from home,</p><p>- altering shifts, so that employees can co-ordinate caring between themselves and partners, or another person,</p><p>- allowing employees to take or rearrange annual leave,</p><p>- allowing employees to rearrange parental leave,</p><p>- allowing employees to take paid time off that can be worked back at a later time etc,</p><p>- allowing employees to take unpaid leave until they can return to work full or part-time.</p><p>In the event of an employee being told by their employer to go home or stay at home for a period of time without pay they may be entitled to claim the Pandemic Unemployment Payment or Jobseeker's Benefit/Allowance.  If they are not eligible for those payments, then they may apply for Supplementary Welfare Allowance.  </p><p>I trust that this clarifies the matter.</p></reply>

One of the measures is the development of a funded Work Placement Scheme to provide work experience for jobseekers that have been unemployed for more than six months (to include those who received a PUP payment).  </p>  <p>  This initiative builds on advice from the Labour Market Advisory Council that such placements have the capacity to keep unemployed people close to the labour market and provide them with quality work experience to increase their employability.  Moreover, work placements afford employers the opportunity to contribute to the national activation agenda. The use of work placements to straddle the transition from education and training to full-time employment has proven successful in the past and it is important that a new scheme be developed further to provide valuable work experience for jobseekers.</p>  <p>  &euro;30 million has been provisioned for this measure up to the end of 2021 to support 10,000 work placements for jobseekers.

The main priority of their work is around the welfare of children and young people and on ensuring that concerns and problems around attendance are addressed before attendance becomes a crisis issue. School Principals can make a referral to TESS when concern arises in relation to non attendance of a particular student. Currently TESS has 100 EWO&rsquo;s in post. </p>  <p>  The 2017/2018 Annual Attendance Report indicates that non-attendance rates in school remain broadly stable over the past five academic years from 2013/2014 to 2017/2018. There was a slight increase in primary school absences in 2017/2018 compared to 2016/2017 and a similar slight decrease in post-primary school absences in the same period. </p>  <p>  All schools have a School Attendance Strategy in place and attendance is a central theme of DEIS planning with all DEIS schools required to set targets for improved school attendance.  Non-attendance rates continue to be higher in DEIS Band 1 primary schools and DEIS post-primary schools when compared to other schools.</p>  <p>  For the first time in 2017/2018 schools were asked to indicate if absences were explained or unexplained and this indicated that over 60% of absences in primary schools were explained compared to just over 50% in post-primary schools. </p>  <p>  In November 2019, TESS rolled out a very successful campaign to promote positive school attendance called &ldquo;Every School Day Counts&rdquo; and over 2,000 schools ran initiatives in their schools to promote positive attendance as part of the national campaign. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, An Taoiseach announced, as part of his speech on the formation of Government on Saturday 27 June, that &ldquo;Educational welfare functions will be returned to the Department [of Education].&rdquo;  Discussions are currently underway between the two Departments in that regard.</p></reply>

There is no official data on the extent of staff shortages. However, officials in my Department have been actively monitoring the issue and have sought data and evidence-based proposals from sectorial representatives on the Covid Advisory Group on Reopening, which has been meeting regularly over recent months. </p><p>I am committed to supporting providers in responding to current challenges. For example, the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme is available to the early learning and childcare sector, with a full exemption to the turnover rule, to assist them with staffing costs. Specifically in relation to recruitment difficulties, it is important that any measures considered are proportionate to the problem they seek to address and that wider impacts would be carefully considered. </p><p>Staffing and recruitment difficulties are being caused not by insufficient supply of qualified personnel, but by high levels of turnover and attrition. This is predominantly down to poor terms and conditions in the workforce, with for example, the average pay being &euro;12.55 per hour, and half of staff only being able to access part-time contracts. It is expected that poor terms and conditions will be addressed in the medium to long term via three plans currently being pursued by Government: a new funding model, a workforce development plan, and additional investment. Short-term measures are more challenging to find and, as stated above, the Department continues to work intensively with sectorial representatives to examine what might be possible. One potential solution that has been proposed by the sector is being given active attention at the moment by the Department of Education and Skills and my Department. </p><p>In that regard, it is important to stress that the minimum qualification requirement to work directly with children in an early learning care service (Level 5 on the National Framework of Qualifications) was introduced in 2016 in order to improve the quality of provision and to achieve better outcomes for children. (There is currently no minimum qualification requirement for staff working in school-age childcare.) To remove this minimum qualification requirement could be contrary to the best interests of children and the vision for the sector that is outlined in <i>First 5</i>, the whole-of-Government strategy to improve the lives of babies, young children and their families. Such a move could be a significant backwards step in efforts to improve quality outcomes for children and could only be considered if there were a very strong evidence base requiring a change.</p></reply>

The exemption from regulation - and therefore from the National Childcare Scheme - applies to those who care for smaller numbers of children, and is set down in Section 58L of the Child Care Act 1991. </p><p>Prior to February 2019, only childminders who cared for more than three preschool children of different families were subject to regulation and therefore required to register with Tusla (or, prior to the establishment of Tusla, notify the HSE). As from February 2019, when Section 22 of the Childcare Support Act 2018 came into force, the scope of regulation - and of subsidies - broadened also to include a provider who cares for more than six children of any age at one time. </p><p>On the basis of the 2018 report of the Childminding Working Group on Reforms and Supports for the Childminding Sector ('<i>Pathway to a Quality Support and Assurance System for Childminding'</i>), in 2019 my Department published a Draft Childminding Action Plan, for the purpose of public consultation. The Draft Action Plan set out short, medium, and long-term measures on a phased basis for childminders to formalise their position over the next decade. It included specific proposals to extend regulation over a period of years to all paid, non-relative childminders, and thereby to open access to the National Childcare Scheme for all home-based childcare providers. An extensive consultation process on the Draft Childminding Action Plan took place in the latter part of 2019.</p><p>The Programme for Government commits to publish a report by year end on options to accelerate access to subsidies for non-relative childminders. Officials in my Department are currently finalising the Childminding Action Plan, drawing on the findings of the recent public consultation. While there has long been a need for such a plan, the introduction of the National Childcare Scheme provides a valuable new incentive for childminders to register with Tusla, giving them - and the parents who choose to use childminders - an opportunity that has not previously existed to access subsidies.</p></reply>

The Scheme has been designed to be flexible, with income thresholds, maximum hours and subsidy rates which can be adjusted in line with Government decisions and as more investment becomes available. As such, any adjustments deemed necessary by Government can be carried out in a quick and responsive manner. </p>  <p>  Currently, for income-assessed awards under the Scheme, the highest levels of subsidy will go to families at or below the minimum reckonable income threshold of &euro;26,000, with the level of subsidy tapering down smoothly as income rises towards the maximum net income threshold of &euro;60,000.</p>  <p>  The Scheme also offers a universal subsidy which is unrelated to parental income. The universal subsidy is available to all parents of children aged between 24 weeks and 36 months (or until the child qualifies for the Early Childhood Care and Education programme if later). The universal subsidy is set at a rate of &euro;0.50 per hour and is available for up to 45 hours per week. The universal subsidy is based on the child&rsquo;s age, and not on income.

The CAO process applications for undergraduate courses on behalf of the HEIs. Decisions on admissions are made by the HEIs who then instruct the CAO to make offers to successful candidates. As such, neither I nor my Department have a role in the operation of the CAO.</p>  <p>  The CAO system is a system that works on the assumption that grades obtained in the Leaving Certificate by candidates determine their points. It is on this basis that the CAO system allocates places to applicants including those from different years. To ensure impartiality, the automatic CAO points systems have been created in a way that does not allow for different treatment to be applied to different sub-groups. </p>  <p>  In order to help mitigate the impact of the changes to the grading system I announced the creation of an additional 2,225 places on high-demand courses in Higher Education Institutions. These places were provided in order ensure that as many students as possible could be accommodated on a course of their choice, given the unprecedented circumstances they are facing.</p>  <p>  Nonetheless, there were fluctuations in CAO points this year, as there are every year. The changes in points depend not only on the grades received by applicants but also on the number of applicants, and the number of places available. As we are in the midst of a global pandemic and economic flux, there is more volatility than usual this year due to factors such as reduced opportunities in the economy, students seeking to defer or re-apply in subsequent years and uncertainty around students travelling internationally both to and from Ireland.</p>  <p>  I know how difficult a time it has been for students and parents, and I appreciate how disappointing it can be for a student not to receive an offer for their course of choice, but I would like to stress the range of options available both in further education and training and apprenticeships, but also in pathways in higher education. For those whose route into higher education may not be what they originally planned, once they have a place there may be a pathway back to their preferred option.</p></reply>

Under the terms of the Student Grant Scheme, grant assistance is awarded to students attending an approved course in an approved institution who meet the prescribed conditions of funding including those which relate to nationality, residency, previous academic attainment and means. </p><p>The nationality requirements for the Student Grant Scheme are set out in Section 14 of the Student Support Act 2011 and Regulation 5 of the Student Support Regulations 2020. To qualify for a student grant, it is the candidate's nationality or his/her immigration status in the State that determines whether or not he/she meets the nationality requirement outlined in the Act and Regulations. </p><p>The Department of Justice and Equality adjudicates on a person's entitlement to remain in the State and on the stamp that is awarded where permission to remain is sanctioned. I have been advised by my colleague Helen McEntee TD Minister of Justice, that the restrictions attendant to the current COVID-19 pandemic have regrettably resulted in significant challenges to the delivery of normal services and the previously advised 6 months processing timeline for standard applications has increased to just under one calendar year. </p><p>Article 32 of the Student Grant Scheme 2020 provides for a review of eligibility for the award of a grant in the event of a change of circumstances in the academic year, including a change in relation to a student's nationality or immigration status. Where a student acquires Irish citizenship by naturalisation, or is granted one of the permission to remain criterion provided for in the Act or Regulations during the course of their studies, he/she may apply to SUSI to have his/her application re-assessed.</p><p>Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down in writing by SUSI and remains of the view that the scheme has not been interpreted correctly in his/her case, an appeal form outlining the position may be submitted by the applicant to the independent Student Grants Appeals Board.</p><p>SUSI&rsquo;s online application process for student grant applications for the 2020/21 academic year opened on 23rd April, 2020. The closing date for receipt of late applications by SUSI is 5th November, 2020.</p><p>The documentation required in support of the nationality requirements for student grant purposes will vary according to individual circumstances. Should a student wish to discuss his/her student grant eligibility or obtain information in relation to the supporting documentation requirements, the telephone number for SUSI&rsquo;s Helpdesk is 0761 087 874. Further information regarding the nationality requirements of the Student Grant Scheme is also available from SUSI's website: </p><p>In relation to fees, all applicants for the Free Fees Initiative must meet the prescribed criteria of the scheme including residency and nationality. It is a matter for the higher education institution to which a student is attending to determine eligibility and students should consult with the institution attending to confirm the documentation required to support their application. The documentation required in support of the nationality requirements will vary according to individual circumstances. Eligibility under this scheme is determined at date of entry to the approved undergraduate course, however where a student acquires Irish; EU; EEA; Swiss Confederation; or United Kingdom citizenship during their course of study, such students may be assessed for free fees during their course of study where the student met all criteria of this scheme, apart from nationality, at date entry to their course study.</p><p>Where students do not qualify for free fees funding they must pay the appropriate fee, either EU or Non-EU, as determined by each higher education institution. Higher education institutions are autonomous bodies and therefore the criteria governing the level of fee payable by students (EU or non-EU) is a matter for the relevant institution to determine in line with its own criteria. </p><p>Apart from the Student Grant Scheme and Free Fees Initiative, the Deputy will be aware of the recently announced &euro;168m funding package for the return to education. This package includes a &euro;10m access support package for higher education students. I have approved the allocation of &euro;8.1m of this funding to top up the Student Assistance Fund (SAF). The SAF assists students in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Institutions have the autonomy to maximise the flexibility in the Student Assistance Fund to enable HEIs to support students during the COVID-19 situation. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the third level institution attended.</p><p>Also tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education including approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in EU Member States and in non-EU countries. Further information on this tax relief is available from a student's local Tax office or from the Revenue Commissioners website .</p></reply>

The aim is to reduce the cost to the student by ensuring that there is a sufficient level of accommodation to meet future demand. The target as set out in <i>Rebuilding Ireland </i>and the NSAS is the provision of 7,000 bed spaces by end 2019 and a total of 21,000 additional PBSA beds by 2024.  The 2019 target has been surpassed, with 8,346 bed spaces completed by the end of the year.</p><p>Following significant rent increases in two privately run PBSA complexes in 2018, the Department of Education and Skills worked in close co-operation with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government to pass the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019.

Under the terms of the Grant Scheme, grant assistance is awarded to students attending an approved course in an approved institution who meet the prescribed conditions of funding, including those relating to nationality, residency, previous academic attainment and means. </p><p>The decision on eligibility for a student grant is a matter, in the first instance, for the centralised student grant awarding authority SUSI (Student Universal Support Ireland) to determine. SUSI are currently accepting late applications until 5th November 2020. As this late application closing date is fast approaching, should the student in question wish to make enquiries regarding student grant assistance and/or submit an online student grant application, she is advised to do so as soon as possible. Further information in relation to the student grant is available from SUSI's website or by contacting the SUSI Support Desk by telephone at 0761 087 874 or emailing </p><p>For the 2020/21 academic year, student grant applications will be assessed based on gross income from all sources for the period 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2019. </p><p>However, if a student or party to their application experiences a change in circumstances that is not a temporary change and is likely to continue for the foreseeable future, they can apply to have their application assessed under the change in circumstances provision of the relevant Student Grant Scheme.  The income of all parties to the application will be assessed or reassessed on the current year (2020) and they may also be asked to provide evidence of the current year&rsquo;s (2020) income. SUSI also requires confirmation that the change is not a temporary change and is likely to continue for the foreseeable future. Following such a review, the applicant may fall within the thresholds to become eligible for grant assistance or be entitled to an increased rate of grant or the special rate of grant. </p><p>Apart from the Student Grant Scheme, a funding package for the return to education in the amount of  &euro;168m was recently announced. This package includes a &euro;10m access support package for higher education students. An allocation of &euro;8.1m of this funding to top up the Student Assistance Fund (SAF) has been approved. The SAF assists students in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Institutions have the autonomy to maximise the flexibility in the SAF to enable HEIs to support students during the COVID-19 situation. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the third level institution attended. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis.</p><p>The Department has also allocated &euro;15 million of capital funding for a once-off Covid-19 Grant to support disadvantaged students in accessing ICT devices. This grant is being made available to further and higher education institutions. The institutions are using the grant funding to purchase devices to support disadvantaged students who are encountering challenges in accessing devices for online and blended learning. The distribution of the devices will be via appropriate lending schemes, and the associated terms and conditions, will be a matter for each individual further or higher education provider. Students should contact the access office of the institution they attend for further information.</p><p>Information regarding various funding options for higher education courses is also available from the Higher Education Authority (HEA) website .</p><p>Also, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education. Further information on this tax relief is available from the student's local Tax Office or from the Revenue Commissioners website, .</p><p>Back to Education Allowance (BTEA) is administered by the Department of Social Protection. Accordingly, any queries regarding the eligibility criteria or status of a BTEA application Further enquiries in respect of the BTEA must be referred to that Department.</p><p>Students in receipt of the Back to Education Allowance (BTEA) are not eligible for maintenance support under the Student Grant Scheme, as this would result in a duplication of income support payments. However, students in receipt of BTEA may be considered for SUSI fee supports up to a maximum of &euro;6,270. </p></reply>

Payment is by way of refund on receipt on certified receipts. Students are also entitled to a refund of travel expenses based on certified receipts.

Officials from my Department are liaising with the European Commission on the detail of this commitment, and along with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will travel to Greece in the coming weeks to make the arrangements for their safe passage to Ireland. </p>  <p>  My colleague, Minister O'Gorman, has also committed to relocating four unaccompanied minors from Greece into the care of Tusla.  Minister O'Gorman and his officials are working with Tusla to accelerate the arrival of additional unaccompanied refugee children from Moria, and hope to make further announcements in due course. </p>  <p>  The Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP) was established in 2015 in response to the migration crisis in central and southern Europe. Under this programme, the Government committed to accepting up to 4,000 people into the State, primarily through a combination of the EU Relocation Programme and the UNHCR's Refugee Resettlement Programme.   </p>  <p>  To date, more than 3,350 people have arrived in the State under this first phase of the Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP).  Most of the remaining people will arrive under the Irish Refugee Protection Programme Humanitarian Admissions Programme (IHAP).  However, these people make their own travel arrangements, and so no exact timeframe can be given for when they might arrive in Ireland. </p>  <p>  Last December, a second phase of the IRPP was announced giving a commitment to welcome a further 2,900 refugees between this year and 2023, through a combination of resettlement and community sponsorship. The refugees who are due to arrive from Greece are in addition to this number.</p>  <p>  Ireland can only accept the number of people that we are able to accommodate and support effectively. We will of course consider additional numbers as part of the EU response when we can provide the necessary support services including initial accommodation and appropriate housing once the new arrivals have received some orientation support.  The matter will continue to be kept under review.  </p></reply>

In addition, these figures only relate to persons who have registered with the International Protection Office (IPO) and does not reflect children resident in the centres who may not have been registered by their parents.</p><p>The length of time a person stays in state provided accommodation generally reflects the length of time taken to reach a final conclusion on their application for international protection or other permission to reside in the State and may also include applications to revoke Deportation Orders.  As the application process also allows for legal challenges against negative decisions at many stages of the process, the time taken to finalise many cases can be prolonged. </p><p>There are also more than 1,000 residents with an international protection status or a permission to remain in the State. My Department has a specific team who work in collaboration with DePaul Ireland, the Jesuit Refugee Service, the Peter McVerry Trust, officials in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, and the City and County Managers Association to collectively support these residents to access housing options. Between January and September of this year, 900 people have moved to accommodation in the community, of whom 644 received assistance from the support services outlined.</p><p>While responsibility for accommodating applicants for international protection is transferring to the new Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth Affairs, the system for the processing of international protection applications will remain under my remit. My Department and I will continue to make improvements to facilitate timely decisions while also maintaining the integrity of the system.</p></reply>

The visa office in Abuja is currently awaiting additional information from the applicant, to assist in the processing of this application.</p>  <p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the ISD of my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

While Part M of the Building Regulations do not, at present, require the installation of changing place facilities, some local authorities have installed them. An example of a public body going beyond the minimum requirements in Part M is the motion passed by Dublin City Council to install changing place facilities in all new build and green field developments. I would certainly encourage all local authorities to be as far-sighted as this to enable the dignity, and indeed safety, of the person with the disability to be maintained at all times. </p></reply>

This national strategy is informed by a pro-arrest, early-investigation and proactive high-visibility approach to assault reduction.  It places particular emphasis on prevention, education and awareness.  The strategy promotes early prosecution of offenders where feasible and appropriate.</p><p>A comprehensive and robust legal framework is in place with respect to knife crime including heavy penalties for breaches of the laws concerned.  Under the provisions of the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, the maximum penalty for a conviction for possessing a knife in a public place without good reason or lawful authority was increased from one to five years.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also have an extended power of search without warrant in relation to knives and offensive weapons.</p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also address the issue of knife crime through education and engagement with community initiatives.  </p><p>At an operational level, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na pro-actively targets public disorder and anti-social behaviour, including knife-related crime, through the strategic deployment of Garda resources, and areas identified as public order hot-spots by local Garda management are the subject of additional foot and mobile patrols.  </p><p>The Deputy will also be aware that my Department has published a draft new Youth Justice Strategy in tandem with an online consultation, which has been completed recently.  The draft Strategy is currently being refined with reference to the outcome of the public consultation and the views of key stakeholders, with a view to presenting the finalised version to Government by the end of the year.</p><p>A key priority for this new Strategy will be to strengthen and expand the role of the Garda Youth Diversion projects and other community-based initiatives, including those working with the Probation Service.

Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have noted that the increase in knives seized since 2017 is likely due to a change in recording practice. The Property and Exhibits Management System (PEMS) was implemented on 30/03/2016.  It is expected that PEMS has had a significant impact on the electronic recording and tracking of property and exhibits across the organisation, moving from the traditional property book.  This increase in records of property seized has been seen across all objects/categories since the introduction of PEMS, not just knives.  The impact of PEMS implementation is clear and should be considered alongside evidence of an increase in any object being seized in the later period.</p><p>The following is a summary of the age range of Suspected Offenders associated with those same incidents whereby a knife was seized over the same period from 01/01/2005 to 31/12/2019: <table>    <tr>       <th>Age of Person</th>       <th>12-17 years</th>       <th>18-23 years</th>       <th>24-29 years</th>       <th>30-35 years</th>       <th>36-41 years</th>       <th>42-47 years</th>       <th>48-53 years</th>       <th>54-59 years</th>       <th>60 years+</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Proportion of Incidents</td>       <td>16%</td>       <td>28%</td>       <td>21%</td>       <td>15%</td>       <td>10%</td>       <td>6%</td>       <td>3%</td>       <td>1%</td>       <td>1%</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>I am advised by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that to extract the number of stabbing assaults in each of the years 2005 to 2019, including the age range of perpetrators, a significant manual trawl of both the PULSE database would be required.

This is subject to all other aspects of their application being in order and each case is considered on its individual circumstances.  </p>  <p>  Applicants from Venezuela should utilise the online registration renewal system. My Department is aware of the current difficulties with procuring passports from Venezuela and an applicant should include a note to that effect when they apply. My Department can assist such people by issuing a six month permission pending receipt of the new/extended document.  </p>  <p>  On 18 September 2020, I announced that immigration and international protection permissions due to expire between 20 September 2020 and 20 January 2021, are automatically renewed to the 20 January 2021. The renewal of permission is on the same basis as the existing permission and the same conditions attach. This measure also applies to Venezuelan nationals who are legally resident here. </p></reply>

This legal framework requires that any proposed community CCTV scheme must:</p><p>- be approved by the local Joint Policing Committee,</p><p>- have the prior support of the relevant Local Authority, which must also act as data controller, and</p><p>- have the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner.</p><p>This is the legal basis for all community CCTV schemes, regardless of how they are funded and these key legal requirements have not changed since 2006. The option to establish a Community CCTV scheme is available to groups that meet these legal requirements, anywhere in the country.</p><p>Since 2017, my Department has administered a grant aid scheme supporting groups wishing to establish a community-based CCTV system in their area. To date, 29 applications have been approved under the scheme, involving approved grants awarded totalling more than &euro;752,000. Eligible groups, including community groups and local authorities nationwide, can apply for grant aid of up to 60% of the total capital cost of a proposed CCTV system, up to a maximum total of &euro;40,000.  The table details the Local Authorities that have been approved funding under the scheme. </p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, last year the grant aid scheme was extended to cover not only new CCTV systems but also to allow funding applications for extension or upgrade of existing Community CCTV systems which are incomplete or obsolete. Applicants can now also seek a once-off grant of up to &euro;5,000 for minor maintenance costs. </p><p>However in all cases, grant funding can be considered only for CCTV systems which meet the legal requirements, in other words CCTV systems which have been approved by the relevant Joint Policing Committee, the relevant Local Authority (also acting as Data Controller) and which have received the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner. </p><p>If the Deputy is aware of groups wishing to avail of the grant aid scheme, further details are available to download from my Department's website - and support and guidance is available to help interested groups through a dedicated email address fundsadmin-comm-based-cctv@justice.ie <table>    <tr>       <th>Local Authority</th>       <th>Name of Applicant </th>       <th>No of cameras</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Leitrim County Council</td>       <td>Carrick on Shannon</td>       <td>11</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wexford County Council</td>       <td>Wexford County Council</td>       <td>12</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wicklow County Council</td>       <td>Arklow Town, Wicklow</td>       <td>11</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wexford County Council</td>       <td>Courttown/Riverchapel</td>       <td>8</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wexford County Council</td>       <td>Gorey Town Park</td>       <td>5</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick City and County Council</td>       <td>Limerick - Newcastlewest</td>       <td>12</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Sligo County Council</td>       <td>Cranmore Regeneration Sligo</td>       <td>3</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick City and County Council</td>       <td>Limerick - Castleconnell</td>       <td>6</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick City and County Council</td>       <td>Limerick - Askeaton</td>       <td>4</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick City and County Council</td>       <td>Limerick - Abbeyfeale</td>       <td>6</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick City and County Council</td>       <td>Limerick - Kilmallock</td>       <td>7</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick City and County Council</td>       <td>Limerick - Rathkeale</td>       <td>7</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick City and County Council</td>       <td>Limerick - Adare</td>       <td>5</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick City and County Council</td>       <td>Limerick - Caherconlish</td>       <td>4</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick City and County Council</td>       <td>Limerick - Croom</td>       <td>5</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick City and County Council</td>       <td>Limerick - Murroe</td>       <td>4</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick City and County Council</td>       <td>Limerick - Pallasgreen</td>       <td>3</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick City and County Council</td>       <td>Limerick - Cappamore</td>       <td>2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick City and County Council</td>       <td>Limerick - Patrickswell</td>       <td>5</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick City and County Council</td>       <td>Limerick - Foynes</td>       <td>3</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Monaghan County Council</td>       <td>Monaghan Town</td>       <td>8</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilkenny County Council</td>       <td>Urlingford, Co.

The intention is to divert children and young people who have engaged in criminal or anti-social behaviour away from the Criminal Justice system and towards more positive life choices. Children who commit criminal offences are considered for admission to the Garda Diversion Programme, as provided in the Children Act 2001. Each such case is assessed and the Director of the Garda Diversion Programme (Garda Superintendent) decides if the case is suitable, or not, for inclusion. </p>  <p>  The operation of the programme includes informal and formal Garda warnings, delivered in the presence of parents or guardians, as well as provision for supervision by a Garda Juvenile Liaison Officer. The scope of the Diversion programme is illustrated by 2017 figures, which show that 10,607 children were referred for consideration under the programme. </p>  <p>  Garda Youth Diversion Projects (GYDPs) are a fundamental support to the operation of the statutory Garda Diversion Programme and provide a vital ingredient in enhancing community policing partnerships. These projects are community based multi-agency crime prevention initiatives, which are funded directly by my Department. GYDPs seek to divert young people who have become involved, or are at risk of becoming involved, in crime/anti-social behaviour away from future involvement with the Criminal Justice System. They are primarily targeted at 12-17 year old young people in communities where a specific need for the service has been identified. On average the Garda Youth Diversion Projects engage with between 3,500 and 4,000 young people across the state in any one year. </p>  <p>  Currently there are some 105 Garda Youth Diversion Projects. The intention is to further develop the service so that it is available to every child in the State who could benefit from it, through an ongoing expansion of existing services and where necessary the foundation of new projects.</p>  <p>  Further, the projects are being developed to provide family support to the parents of young people participating in the projects and are undertaking early intervention and preventative work. The role of the projects in relation to harder-to-engage young people is being enhanced and extended as part of the evolving Youth Justice system.  </p>  <p>  The Department is supporting ongoing development of practice in GYDPs through the Action Research Project led by the University of Limerick. The Action Research Project works directly with front-line Youth Justice Workers from local projects to develop interventions and best practice. Based on initial outcomes from the Action Research Project and evaluations of a number of pilot projects, it is intended to develop proposals to expand the existing services, to ensure national coverage and a stronger focus on difficult issues such as the hard-to-reach cohort. </p>  <p>  These issues are addressed in the draft Youth Justice Strategy 2020-2026, which is due to be published in Q4 2020.</p></reply>

Some courthouses in county towns can accommodate both family law and other types of business at the same time. However, it is preferred that family law business takes place on days when other business is not scheduled.</p><p>The position regarding the range of outlying venues varies from some having dedicated Family Law days, to Family Law &amp;amp; Civil matters, to Family Law &amp;amp; Juvenile matters to all court business. Some outlying venues only sit once per month so all business must be transacted at that one sitting.</p><p>While some courthouses have more than one courtroom to facilitate a Family Law sitting and a Criminal sitting at the one time in separate courtrooms, there is only one permanent District Court Judge assigned to most District Court Areas.</p><p>Domestic Violence applications are heard at any District Court sitting, as required. In addition, urgent Crime matters are also heard at any District Court sitting, as required.</p><p>With Covid-19, the Courts Service&rsquo;s ability to use all the courtrooms at the same time also depends on the expected footfall compared with the capacity of individual courtrooms, the foyer area of the courthouse, as well as ancillary facilities.</p><p>The following table outlines the situation in courthouses nationwide.</p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th><div>Courthouse</div></th>       <th><div>Dedicated / No Dedicated Family Law sittings</div></th>       <th><div>Number of Courtrooms in each Courthouse to   accommodate a family law court &amp;amp;

Such paid leave, if it were to be introduced, would likely require an amendment to the Organisation of Working Time Act, the responsibility for which lies with the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation. </p><p>It is the aim of government collectively, and of myself as Minister for Justice, to make available appropriate supports for people who are victims of Domestic Abuse to ensure there is a comprehensive approach that fully address their needs. When it comes to the employer / employee relationship, consideration has to be given to how the victim would prefer the issue of domestic violence to be dealt with, including whether sensitive issues such as domestic abuse are best dealt with in a private and confidential manner between employers and employees, using existing leave mechanisms such as force majeure.</p><p>As mentioned already, my Department coordinates the Second National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence 2016 &ndash; 2021, which is a whole-of-Government approach to taking forward the many actions necessary to address these matters fully. The Strategy includes input from relevant community and voluntary groups as well as other stakeholders across the sector. Overall, it aims to strengthen the law and structures in Ireland targeting domestic, sexual and gender-based violence. Considerable progress has been made in addressing these issues through the Strategy which facilitated the ratification by Ireland of the Istanbul Convention in 2019.</p><p>Furthermore,  in the context of the Covid 19 pandemic, my Department was conscious of the added risk and fear of domestic abuse. As part of an inter-agency plan and in addition to the funding already allocated for 2020, the Department to date has provided an additional &euro;327,250 to a number of organisations working in the sector, to support and extend the existing services they offer during the period of the Covid-19 pandemic. My Department is also leading a public awareness campaign on domestic abuse during the Covid-19 pandemic, known as &lsquo;Still Here&rsquo; and it aims to get the message to those experiencing domestic abuse and sexual violence that support services from State agencies and the voluntary sector are still available and accessible to support victims during the Covid-19 pandemic. Further information on the organisations involved in this initiative as well as services and supports for victims is available on the website .</p><p>In addition, under Budget 2021 and in recognition of the increased risk and incidence of domestic abuse during the pandemic, I secured &euro;2.7 million in increased funding to combat domestic, sexual and gender based violence, as well as support for victims. Furthermore an additional &euro;0.4 million in extra funding has been provided for organisations and groups responding to increased service demands from people impacted by domestic abuse during this period. In addition to continuing supports provided during the pandemic, the additional &euro;400,000 for 2021 will provide extra remote counselling services, and help keep helplines open, as well as welfare packs  and other practical supports for those most vulnerable.</p><p>Finally, the Deputy will also be aware that the draft Programme for Government contains a commitment to conduct an audit of statutory responsibilities in this area.</p></reply>

The outcome of this ruling &ndash; which was subsequently successfully appealed to the Court of Appeal &ndash; resulted in significant delays to the processing of citizenship applications last year. This has been compounded by COVID-19 restrictions which has resulted in significant challenges to the delivery of normal services to date this year. </p>  <p>  Currently, there are approximately 21,000 citizenship applications on hand, at various stages of processing within the system, ranging from those just received by my Department to those where a decision has been made but it is not possible to issue an invitation to a ceremony. </p>  <p>  A series of measures have been approved to address this caseload over the coming period.

Neither I, as Minister, nor my Department have any role in the processing of individual vetting applications.</p>  <p>  I would emphasise to the Deputy that the primary purpose of the employment vetting carried out by the National Vetting Bureau is to seek to ensure the safety of children and vulnerable adults.  It is carried out by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in accordance with the provisions of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012-2016.  I am sure that the Deputy will appreciate the importance of this task and the need for it to be carried out thoroughly and correctly. </p>  <p>  I am informed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that there are no backlogs or delays in Garda Vetting.  The current turnaround time for vetting applications submitted by organisations utilising the eVetting system is 3-5 working days for over 85% of applications received.  </p>  <p>  All Garda vetting applications are processed on a first come, first serve basis in chronological order from date of receipt.  This is with a view to observing equity and fairness in respect of all vetting subjects.  Processing times fluctuate upwards and downwards depending on seasonal demands and volumes received.</p>  <p>  In a number of instances, it is necessary to conduct enquiries with external Garda Stations and Agencies such as the Courts Service, Probation Service, Child and Family Agency, etc.  These enquiries are conducted for a multiplicity of reasons such as verification of identity; updating of incomplete records; and establishing outcomes of investigations.  In such instances processing times are significantly longer than the general average.</p>  <p>  Individual applicants can track the process of their application online using the eVetting Tracking System, details of which are contained in the email received by applicants when completing their application online.  Further details on this facility are also outlined on the An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na website, vetting.garda.ie.</p></reply>

Covid-19 in a prison setting would present significant challenges for prison management in terms of controlling the spread of the virus amongst staff and prisoners, the provision of appropriate medical treatment to affected persons and the maintenance of staffing levels.  Recognising these challenges, the Director General of the Irish Prison Service at an early stage established an Emergency Response Planning Team (&ldquo;ERPT&rdquo;) consisting of senior staff with skills and experience in areas including operational; healthcare; and infection control.  The ERPT was tasked with identifying and issuing instruction for any necessary actions with the aim of:</p>  <p>  -  Blocking the spread of Covid-19 into a prison setting;</p>  <p>  -  Early detection of any possible case of Covid-19 in a prisoner or staff member; and</p>  <p>  -  Prevention of the spread of Covid-19, should a case be confirmed. </p>  <p>  A huge amount of work has been carried out by the Irish Prison Service in this regard, informed and guided by the advice received from the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), and consistent with the prison specific guidance for the management of Covid-19 issued by the World Health Organisation (WHO) on 15 March 2020. </p>  <p>  I have been advised by the Irish Prison Service that from the onset of the pandemic, Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) guidelines including the use of face masks were developed in line with Public Health guidelines. The guidelines in place protect both those incarcerated and employees of the Irish Prison Service from the potential exposure to Covid-19. </p>  <p>  There are a number of levels of PPE that apply within prisons and the PPE guidelines take account of physical distancing requirements and potential contact with a suspected or confirmed case of Covid-19.</p>  <p>  PPE is required where there may be contact with suspected or confirmed cases of Covid-19, contact with those in quarantine and when prisoners are escorted to court or hospital. The Irish Prison Service has developed protocols regarding the use of PPE for staff which complement the broad range of infection control measures to prevent transmission of Covid-19 within prisons.</p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service has issued recommendations on the wearing of surgical masks by Prison Staff in certain circumstances and most recently determined that staff must wear surgical masks in areas which have been highlighted as locations where social distancing is difficult or cannot be maintained. This mandatory requirement comes in to effect this week. </p>  <p>  These include some offices and control rooms where more than one officer is present and when sharing vehicles. I am further informed that there are a number of Standard Operating Procedures in place for the distribution of PPE, as well as the donning and doffing and Infection Control measures and these are kept under consent review by the Irish Prison Service.</p></reply>

Consultations with a number of stakeholders, including the Law Society, have however, identified a number of important practical and legal obstacles to establishing such a mechanism.</p>  <p>  In the first instance, registration of a will would not guarantee its validity.  For example, under Part VII of the Succession Act 1965, there are statutory requirements regarding the signing and witnessing of a will.  The mere registration of the existence of the will would not prove that the will had been properly executed, or that the testator had sufficient capacity, or not been subject to undue influence or duress.  </p>  <p>  Secondly, a register could not guarantee or offer conclusive proof that a registered will was the last will of the testator because a new will could have been made by the testator at any time before a testator dies.  The most a register could do would be to confirm that a particular will had been registered on a particular day.  Such a register would not confer any priority over later wills if they were not registered, nor would it provide any guarantee that a registered will had not been revoked or replaced by a later will. </p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.</p>  <p>  The proposed policy change to the NHSS, to cap contributions based on farm and business assets at 3 years where a family successor commits to working the productive asset, has been approved by Government. The Department developed draft Heads of Bill while considering a number of complex ancillary policy and operational matters which may need to be addressed in the proposed legislation.</p>  <p>  The stated policy objective of the general scheme of the Bill is to introduce further safeguards in the NHSS to further protect the viability and sustainability of family farms and businesses that will be passed down to the next generation of the family to continue to work them as productive assets to provide for them their livelihood.</p>  <p>   The amendment of the scheme will bring certainty to the duration for which a contribution to the cost of care under NHSS will be levied against family farms and businesses. This in turn will support the viability of farms and businesses by increasing the likelihood of access to financing &amp;amp; promoting investment, which will encourage orderly succession planning with family members, encourage young farmers to remain farming and potentially encourage family members that had changed occupation or emigrated to return to the family farm.</p>  <p>   The General Scheme of Bill for the Amendment to the NHSS was approved by Government on 11 June 2019 and subsequently published. The changes to the Scheme will come into effect as soon as the legislative process is successfully complete. The General Scheme was sent to the relevant Joint Committee and the Department participated in pre-legislative scrutiny on 13 November 2019.  Engagement with the Office of the Attorney General began in early 2020 to progress the legislative development process.</p>  <p>  This piece of legislation is a priority for the Minister and will be progressed as soon as possible, to support Farm Families and Businesses . </p>  <p>  Further progress on the development of the Bill has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic with focus entirely on responding to the challenges presented by COVID-19. The response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been and continues to be a national and public health priority.</p></reply>

The HSE began planning for the resumption of adult disability day services in May. A group representative of families, service providers and other relevant stakeholders, including Inclusion Ireland, was convened and tasked with the development of a Resumption Plan. On May 31st the Framework for the Resumption of Adult Disability Day Services was published and the guidance to support this framework was published on July 8th. </p>  <p>  The guidance is to enable safe and person-centred disability day service supports to be provided in line with current public health advice and infection control guidance. It is not overly prescriptive in terms of detail as there is a wide diversity of disability in the 19,000 adults that received day service supports and day service locations vary enormously in size and capacity. Of this 19,000, approximately 5,000 people receive a day service as part of their residential placement. </p>  <p>  The key overarching elements of managing the risk of infection are: </p>  <p>  1.  Processes to identify people (service users and staff) with communicable infection (including COVID-19) before they access services/attend work or as soon as possible after they access services/attend work</p>  <p>  2. Processes to minimize the risk of spread of infection from people (service users and staff) who access services/attend for work with unrecognized infection (Standard Precautions)</p>  <p>  3. Early detection of spread of infection in the service and immediate response to limit harm.</p>  <p>  The guidance developed to support the resumption of adult day services also has had to take account of social distancing rules which has meant that there is a reduced number of people in each service location. This means that, when day services re-opened through August and September, they re-opened at 40% capacity. However, the HSE is committed to maximising the support that can be provided within these restrictions. The HSE also plan to capture the detail of the service being provided to each individual over the next few weeks, to get a better understanding of the quantum of service being provided. </p>  <p>  On Monday 28th September, Ministers Donnelly and Rabbitte announced that &euro;10 million is being made available in 2020 to support the resumption of day services and enhanced home support services for disability service users.  Of this, &euro;7.5 million will increase disability day services by one day a week for over 14,000 adults. This funding is being drawn down from the National Action Plan on COVID-19. Funding requirements for 2021 will be considered as part of the Estimates process. </p>  <p>In line with the Governments Resilience &amp;amp; Recovery Framework (2020 &ndash; 2021), the HSE regards the provision of disability services as essential to maintaining a response to people with a disability, in the same way that schools and creches are. Importantly,  Government&rsquo;s intention is that disability services will remain open at each level of the Resilience and Recovery Framework, subject to public health guidance.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy's question also pertains to a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to reply to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

This Plan provides a framework setting out Ireland's approach to managing and living with COVID-19 in a range of areas over the next 6 - 9 months.</p><p>The framework sets out five levels of response, each with a number of measures designed to help us all lower COVID-19 transmission and setting out what is permitted at that moment in time. It is framed to account for periods during which there is a low incidence of the disease, with isolated clusters and low community transmission, through to situations where there is a high or rapidly increasing incidence, widespread community transmission and the pandemic is escalating rapidly in Ireland and globally. It recognises the need for society and business to be allowed to continue as normally as possible and is designed so that either national or county level restrictions can be applied. </p><p>The Plan reflects a careful consideration of the impact of the introduction of restrictions on employment and livelihood's, keeping as many businesses open as possible at different stages, while acknowledging that some businesses and services are critical. It acknowledges that sports, arts and other social activities are central to our well-being and that sports and arts are also the world of work for our many in our communities.  </p><p>As I am sure the Deputy can appreciate, COVID-19 spreads when individuals and groups come into close contact with one another, enabling the virus to move from one person to another. COVID-19 is infectious in a person with no symptoms, or for the period of time before they develop symptoms. For this reason, we are all asked to be extra careful when socialising and working with others. For now, we must act like we have the virus to protect those around us from infection.</p><p>Ireland has moved from a short-term emergency response approach to a medium-term approach to managing risk and repairing the damage that COVID-19 has inflicted on society. All counties in Ireland are now at Level 3 of the Plan for living with Covid-19 until 28th October.  Further information on the public health measures in currently in place in relation  to the different Levels can be found at <i>www.gov.ie/en/campaigns/resilience-recovery-2020-2021-plan-for-living-with-covid-19/.</i></p><p>With specific regard to the Deputy's concern in relation to house parties, I would recall that the Health Act 1947 (Section 31A &ndash; Temporary Restrictions) (Covid-19) (No. 6) Regulations 2020 (S.I. No. 413 of 2020) provide that a person may only organise an event to be held in a private dwelling for social or recreational reasons where the person takes all reasonable steps to ensure that the persons attending reside in no more than one other household and do not exceed 6 in number.</p></reply>

However, some transport supports are provided by the HSE or funded agencies on a discretionary basis. A variety of transport solutions are pursued in each CHO area, including:</p>  <p>  -  Travel training by service providers or families to enable public transport to be used upon commencement of their day programme where applicable.</p>  <p>  -  Service providers provide transport where available capacity exists</p>  <p>  -  Local transport e.g. Local Link, private bus transport providers and taxis, funded via a combination of service provider, HSE funding, service user contribution, and / or combined funding to meet the transport requirements identified.</p>  <p>  -  HSE local funding, where available, is utilised to support service providers to provide transport solutions for service users</p>  <p>  -  Families agree to transport service users to service providers</p>  <p>  In general, disability service users are in receipt of disability allowance and are automatically entitled to the Free Travel Pass. </p>  <p>  The HSE was successful in securing Dormant Account monies to fund a project to map all Disability transport routes nationally, via information gathering by Disability Service providers and HSE Services who provide transport. The outputs of this study will be used as a basis for considering how to improve access to disability services and how to best make use of local resources.  </p>  <p>  Day services are now reopening, and the availability of safe transport is essential to the delivery of Day Services across the country. Reduced capacity on vehicles will mean more journeys to facilitate those that require a transport service to access their day service location. </p>  <p>  As services resume it will be necessary to identify how transport can continue to be provided in as safe a manner as possible and strictly within social distancing and other COVID-19 precautions. Transport providers will have to demonstrate that their transport services are safe and that all COVID-19 precautions have been established and observed. The guidance includes general guidelines and a risk assessment matrix on safe transport. While family members are to be encouraged to transport the individual to Day Services, this will not always be possible depending on the family circumstances and in these cases, there will continue to be a reliance on bus transport.</p>  <p>  Transport is a theme of the National Disability Inclusion strategy, and Action 104 of this strategy states: 'We will lead a review of transport supports encompassing all Government funded transport and mobility schemes for people with disabilities, to enhance the options for transport to work or employment supports for people with disabilities and will develop proposals for development of a coordinated plan for such provision. This plan will have regard to making the most efficient use of available transport resources.&rdquo; </p>  <p>  As part of the mid-term review of the NDIS, there will be a focus on promoting collaborative approaches to cross-cutting issues, and the working group on transport (Action 104), was convened by the Department of Justice and Equality in February 2020, with a focus on identifying opportunities for collaboration between transport and other public bodies to promote greater mobility for people with disabilities. </p></reply>

This Plan provides a framework setting out Ireland's approach to managing and living with COVID-19 in a range of areas over the next 6 - 9 months.</p><p>The framework sets out five levels of response, each with a number of measures designed to help us all lower COVID-19 transmission and setting out what is permitted at that moment in time. It is framed to account for periods during which there is a low incidence of the disease, with isolated clusters and low community transmission, through to situations where there is a high or rapidly increasing incidence, widespread community transmission and the pandemic is escalating rapidly in Ireland and globally. It recognises the need for society and business to be allowed to continue as normally as possible and is designed so that either national or county level restrictions can be applied. </p><p>The Plan also reflects a careful consideration of the impact of the introduction of restrictions on employment and livelihoods, keeping as many businesses open as possible at different stages, while acknowledging that some businesses and services are critical. It acknowledges that sports, arts and other social activities are central to our well-being and that sports and arts are also the world of work for our many in our communities.  </p><p>Ireland has moved a from a short-term emergency response approach to a medium-term approach to managing risk and repairing the damage that COVID-19 has inflicted on society. All counties in Ireland are now at Level 3 and will remain so until 28 October. The measures currently in place in place in Dublin and Donegal will be extended by 3 weeks. </p><p>As I am sure the Deputy can appreciate, COVID-19 spreads when individuals and groups come into close contact with one another, enabling the virus to move from one person to another. COVID-19 is infectious in a person with no symptoms, or for the period of time before they develop symptoms. For this reason, we are all asked to be extra careful when socialising and working with others. For now, we must act like we have the virus to protect those around us from infection.</p><p>Under Level 3, gyms may remain open with protective measures, for individual training only.  Further information on level 3 restrictions in relation to gyms can be found at - www<i>.gov.ie/en/publication/ad569-level-3/</i>and on the Active Ireland website at <i>.</i></p></reply>

Interrupting transmission of the COVID-19 virus is the main goal of public health measures and it is clear from the experience that the scale of effect of interruption of transmission is influenced by a number of factors. The most important way to protect our older population, whether living at home or in a long-term residential care (LTRC) setting, has been to reduce the amount of disease present in our community. The transmission of the virus, particularly in respect of LTRCs is multifactorial and its introduction into any setting could be the result of a number of factors.  </p>  <p>  As a new disease, health authorities across the world are learning about COVID-19 and adapting as new evidence and understanding is formed. The HSE in line with all health authorities continuously reviews emerging evidence and guidance. This is evident from the significant package of guidance that has been produced and has continued to be developed and updated in line with new national and international evidence and data, including advice and guidance in relation to transfers to nursing homes from hospitals, and vice versa. There is an ongoing need to seek to balance measures to manage risk with the need to ensure that the people can access care in the setting that is most suited to their needs and that the burden of restrictions on people who need care in nursing homes is not more onerous than is necessary. Public health experts advise that the key to protecting patients and staff from infection in nursing home settings is to follow the whole package of infection prevention and control guidance including hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene and regular cleaning. Additional protective measures have included visitor restrictions and resident isolation as appropriate. Keeping disease transmission low in the community reduces the potential for disease transmission into and within nursing homes.</p>  <p>  The independent COVID-19 Nursing Homes Expert Panel Report published on 18 August 2020, examined a range of issues and key learnings arising from the pandemic up to the point of publication of the report. The Panel identified a significant package of recommendations required to support the ongoing response to COVID-19 and with regard to longer-term strategic reform of older persons service. This is consistent with the Government commitment to assess how we care for older people and examine alternatives to meet the diverse needs of our older citizens.  My Department is engaged in a major programme of work to implement the Panel&rsquo;s recommendations.</p></reply>

While these restrictions have been introduced as protective measures they have resulted in significant stress for individuals with disabilities and their families. The reintroduction of services is now underway, as detailed in the HSE&rsquo;s roadmap to reopening services, in line with public health guidance. Since the outset, the HSE Community Healthcare Organisations (CHOs) and disability service providers worked collaboratively with families using creative and innovative models of care to support service users to where the need was greatest.</p>  <p>  The Government is very aware of the impact of the pandemic on people with disabilities, their families and carers. Children&rsquo;s services, respite services and adult day services are all resuming, having been reimagined and redesigned to be delivered in line with new guidance published by the HSE. Health and social care responses to the current public health emergency are under continuing review, including specific measures such as these to support vulnerable people. Supports available may change over time and the HSE is aware that the needs of people with a disability and their families will change over time as well. </p>  <p>  In line with the Governments Resilience &amp;amp; Recovery Framework (2020 &ndash; 2021), the HSE regards the provision of disability services as essential to maintaining a response to people with a disability, in the same way that schools and creches are. Importantly, Government&rsquo;s intention is that disability services will remain open at each level of the Resilience and Recovery Framework, subject to public health guidance, including the prevention and management of COVID 19 related infection.</p></reply>

Later that month, the Nursing Homes Expert Panel was appointed by the Minister for Health</p>  <p>  All of the available evidence and practical experience shows that older persons are particularly impacted by the virus and nationally and internationally the challenges facing nursing homes has been specifically highlighted. Even in a context where a nursing home remains COVID free, the impacts of necessary safeguards introduced through public health measures, such as cocooning, may have clinical and other impacts. The clinical management of COVID-19 and other matters such as potentially increased frailty and deconditioning in older persons will be important considerations as we learn to live with the virus for an extended period of time.</p>  <p>  From both a clinical and a general operational perspective, the day-to-day running and management of a nursing home in a landscape with COVID-19 has required significant adjustment both in terms of preparation and mitigation against the virus, and in circumstances where the virus has appeared. These operational considerations will remain part of the landscape for the time being.  Given these issues, it was critical that the package of expertise provided by the expert panel would capture all of the skills and experience required effectively deliver the terms of reference of the group, including: Public Health expertise; track record in research and evidence based review; relevant experience in geriatric medicine; clinical, operational and nursing experience regarding nursing home care. It was also important, in line with normal Departmental policy, that the perspective of the service user was embedded in the process</p>  <p>  These were the primary considerations in establishing the Panel.

Later that month, the Nursing Homes Expert Panel was appointed by the Minister for Health</p>  <p>  All of the available evidence and practical experience shows that older persons are particularly impacted by the virus and nationally and internationally the challenges facing nursing homes has been specifically highlighted. Even in a context where a nursing home remains COVID free, the impacts of necessary safeguards introduced through public health measures, such as cocooning, may have clinical and other impacts. The clinical management of COVID-19 and other matters such as potentially increased frailty and deconditioning in older persons will be important considerations as we learn to live with the virus for an extended period of time.</p>  <p>  From both a clinical and a general operational perspective, the day-to-day running and management of a nursing home in a landscape with COVID-19 has required significant adjustment both in terms of preparation and mitigation against the virus, and in circumstances where the virus has appeared. These operational considerations will remain part of the landscape for the time being.  Given these issues, it was critical that the package of expertise provided by the expert panel would capture all of the skills and experience required effectively deliver the terms of reference of the group, including: Public Health expertise; track record in research and evidence based review; relevant experience in geriatric medicine; clinical, operational and nursing experience regarding nursing home care. It was also important, in line with normal Departmental policy, that the perspective of the service user was embedded in the process</p>  <p>  These were the primary considerations in establishing the Panel. The membership of the Expert Panel reflected the requisite skills and experience.</p></reply>

As issues around the resumption of disability day services are COVID specific, funding was sought from the National Action Plan on COVID-19. </p>  <p>  Of this &euro;10 million, &euro;7.5 million will increase disability day services by one day a week for over 14,000 adults.</p>  <p>  &euro;2.5 million will provide 210 intensive support packages to enable children and young adults to remain at home and in their communities.  These intensive support packages will enable young adults with complex or high support needs to remain at home or in their communities. The packages can combine in-home supports, respite and support in the community, based on individual need. </p>  <p>  The additional funding will further support the resumption of day services, which began to gradually resume throughout August and September. However, it should be noted that capacity in day service locations will be reduced, in line with public health guidance. The HSE and service providers will keep this measure under review and as public health guidance evolves, capacity to provide supports will adapt accordingly. Both the HSE and service providers are committed to maximising the support that can be provided within these restrictions. </p>  <p>  Funding requirements for 2021 will be considered through the Estimates process. </p></reply>

The Plan is designed to help everyone &ndash; individuals, organisations and sectors &ndash; to better understand, anticipate and prepare for the measures that might be introduced to contain transmission of the virus. </p><p>Each level contains a &ldquo;basket&rdquo; of measures which are intended, collectively, to contribute to lowering risk of transmission in alignment with the risk level at that time. The set of measures, individually, do not comprise a list of activities or places which are equally safe. Instead, they are &ldquo;baskets&rdquo; of measures which are informed by public health understanding of the disease and recognise we can and must prioritise some activities over others. There are naturally difficult choices to be made in which activities to permit. </p><p>Sports, arts and other social activities are recognised in the Plan as being central to our well-being. At Level 3 indoor training is only permitted on an individual basis, therefore indoor sports classes cannot take place. Non-contact training is permitted outdoors, in pods of up to 15 people. </p><p>The Plan is clear that sectorial guidance also applies and in the above case guidance from Sport Ireland should also be considered:<i>www.sportireland.ie/covid19/sport-faqs.</i></p></reply>

In March 2019, the Government published the Inter-Departmental Working Group Report on Future Licensing and Regulation of Gambling. This report refers to the introduction of a modern licensing approach to all gambling activities, including enhanced protection of consumers and vulnerable individuals. </p><p>The report addresses the social impact of gambling, including the issue of problem gambling.  It notes the social and health impacts of problem gambling and acknowledges that problem gambling can lead to social breakdown, with devastating financial losses and alienation of family and friends. Problem gambling can be associated with a range of harms including higher risk of psychiatric disorders, alcohol and drug misuse, physical and mental health issues, separation and divorce, unemployment and insolvency </p><p>The 2014/15 Drug Prevalence Survey provides the first comprehensive set of data on the extent of gambling in Ireland. The results indicate that 64.5% of the population report some form of gambling in the 12 months prior to the survey, with 41.4% gambling on a monthly basis, or more often. The survey further found that prevalence of problem gambling in the general population was 0.8%. </p><p>The survey is being repeated for 2018/2019 under the auspices of the Health Research Board (HRB).</p><p>The Inter-Departmental Working Group recommended that:</p><p>-funding be made available for research, training, and community interventions into treatment of gambling addiction.</p><p>-  funding of public education and awareness raising programmes and the production of relevant information materials be supported.</p><p>-  assistance be given in the provision of additional services to treat gambling addiction. </p><p>In order to meet these objectives, the Group recommended that a Social Fund, managed by the gambling regulatory authority should be established. </p><p>The Health Service Executive has r  esponsibility for the provision of addiction treatment services.</p><p>People who present to the HSE for addiction treatment for gambling are offered the same range of interventions as those who present with a drug and alcohol addiction, or a mental health concern, including an initial assessment, a comprehensive assessment, and individual counselling. </p><p>Although some cases of problematic gambling have been provided with treatment, services have not been funded to develop a programme or intervention for problematic gambling. </p><p>To provide additional services for gambling addiction would result in significant capacity issues and lengthening of existing waiting lists for people with drug and alcohol problems. </p><p>The HSE also provides funding to a number of voluntary sector providers who treat gambling addiction, along with drug and alcohol addictions.</p><p>I support the recommendations of the working group report to address the social impact of gambling and to establish a social fund to support treatment services for gambling addiction. </p></reply>

This Plan provides a framework setting out Ireland's approach to managing and living with COVID-19 in a range of areas over the next 6 - 9 months.</p><p>The framework sets out five levels of response, each with a number of measures designed to help us all lower COVID-19 transmission and setting out what is permitted at that moment in time. It is framed to account for periods during which there is a low incidence of the disease, with isolated clusters and low community transmission, through to situations where there is a high or rapidly increasing incidence, widespread community transmission and the pandemic is escalating rapidly in Ireland and globally. It recognises the need for society and business to be allowed to continue as normally as possible and is designed so that either national or county level restrictions can be applied. </p><p>The Plan reflects a careful consideration of the impact of the introduction of restrictions on employment and livelihoods, keeping as many businesses open as possible at different stages, while acknowledging that some businesses and services are critical. It acknowledges that sports, arts and other social activities are central to our well-being and that sports and arts are also the world of work for our many in our communities.  </p><p>As I am sure the Deputy can appreciate, COVID-19 spreads when individuals and groups come into close contact with one another, enabling the virus to move from one person to another. COVID-19 is infectious in a person with no symptoms, or for the period of time before they develop symptoms. For this reason, we are all asked to be extra careful when socialising and working with others. For now, we must act like we have the virus to protect those around us from infection.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware, Ireland has moved from a short-term emergency response approach to a medium-term approach to managing risk and repairing the damage that COVID-19 has inflicted on society. All counties in Ireland are  at Level 3 of the Plan for living with Covid-19 until 28th October.

Under Level 2 restrictions, indoor dance classes, training and exercise can take place in pods of up to 6 people, once sufficient space is available and strict public health protocols are in place. Under Level 1 of the Framework, there is no specific capacity limit, with capacity guided by what can be accommodated safely in the venue while ensuring all protective measures are in place, including social distancing. </p><p>Further information on exercise and sporting events under the Plan is available at: www.gov.ie/en/publication/resilience-and-recovery-plan-for-living-with-covid-19-your-questions-answered/#exercise-and-sporting-events and n he Ireland Active website at .</p></reply>

Studies of these tests, similar to the one mentioned, are now starting in order to ensure that if and where deployed they would be of appropriate quality and sensitivity. However, this will not replace the requirement for large scale PCR testing which remains the &ldquo;gold standard&rdquo; for community testing for Covid-19.</p>  <p>  It is also worth noting the rapid Health Technology Assessment (HTA) which the Health Information Quality (HIQA) has in recent days submitted to NPHET on alternative diagnostic approaches, including antigen tests.</p></reply>

It is recommended to hold meetings and deliver programmes online or outdoors where this is possible, without diluting the benefits for participants</p><p>2. Where it is decided to host a face-to-face group/programme meeting, organisers are advised to undertake a risk assessment to ensure the health, welfare and safety of participants</p><p>3.

The recommended maximum number of attendees at level 3 is 15 people (including leaders), with 2 metres social distancing </p><p>5. Support groups and programmes should last a maximum of 115 minutes (1 hour and 45 minutes)</p><p>6. Individuals at higher risk from Covid-19, or in close contact with such individuals,<b></b>should only attend meetings that are conducted online</p><p>I want to acknowledge the input of supports groups and service providers in the formulation of this new guidance.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-10-13a.1393.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020101300093#WRCC04100"><p>The Quality-adjusted life Years (QALY) is the economic evaluation system which is used to set a threshold of cost-effectiveness when assessing medicines in Ireland.  The QALY is a measure of the state of health of a person or group in which the benefits, in terms of length of life, are adjusted to reflect the quality of life. One QALY is equal to 1 year of life in perfect health. QALYs are calculated by estimating the years of life gained for a patient following a particular treatment or intervention and weighting each year with a quality-of-life score (on a 0 to 1 scale). It is often measured in terms of the person&rsquo;s ability to carry out the activities of daily life, and freedom from pain and mental disturbance.</p><p>In March 2018, the Report on Evaluating Orphan Drugs published by the Joint Committee on Health, was received by my Department.  The Committee&rsquo;s report put forward a number of recommendations including the recommendation that &lsquo;<i>the QALY process is revised completely and replaced with a new assessment process. Such a process should be specific and appropriate to orphan drugs&rsquo;</i>. This recommendation was carefully considered by my Department, the Health Service Executive and the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics. </p><p>It was determined that the QALY is the best metric we have in the area of health economics to express health outcomes.  The QALY provides a useful way of assessing the value of a health intervention as this system combines mortality and morbidity into a single metric. The use of a generic measure of outcome such as the QALY makes it possible to compare outcomes from different technologies across different activities in the healthcare sector.</p><p>Calculation of cost-effectiveness ratios using QALYs also facilitates characterisation of the value of an intervention by making it possible to compare those ratios with common benchmarks. The value benchmark in Ireland for drugs ranges from &euro;20,000-&euro;45,000/QALY. This benchmark represents the &ldquo;value&rdquo; of a QALY; i.e. the &ldquo;willingness to pay&rdquo; to gain 1 QALY of health. Interventions with lower cost-effectiveness ratios below the threshold are said to have a favourable value. Interventions with higher ratios are considered to have unfavourable value.</p><p>The NCPE has advised that until such time as a comprehensive, reliable, scientifically validated alternative to the QALY can be found, we should continue to use the QALY to express health outcome benefits from the medicines that we assess for value for money.  Removing the QALY would have serious financial implications and currently there is not a comprehensive, reliable and validated methodology to replace it with.</p><p>In this context, it is important to note that the statutory framework in the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, which gives full statutory powers to the HSE to assess and make decisions on the reimbursement of medicines, requires the HSE to take account of a range of objective factors and expert opinion as appropriate and not just cost-effectiveness under the QALY system.  There is a list of  criteria which the HSE is required to consider including the magnitude of the clinical effect, cost effectiveness, budget impact and the unmet need. </p></reply>

In some cases, services are delivered directly by the Health Service Executive (HSE). However the majority of organisations providing services for people with a disability are funded by the HSE, on the basis of service arrangements underpinned by Section 38 and 39 of the Health Act 2004. Section 38 and Section 39 disability service providers have independent boards, who govern the organisations concerned and any deficits accruing are the responsibility of these organisations.</p>  <p>  Significant resources have been invested by the health sector in disability services over the past number of years. As set out in the National Service Plan 2020, the 2020 disability budget is &euro;2054.5m. This represents an increase of &euro;138.7m or 7.2% on the 2019 budget.  </p>  <p>  In the context of COVID-19, the HSE has provided significant supports to Section 38 and Section 39 organisations providing disability specialist services. Through the Community Healthcare Organisations (CHOs), the HSE is actively engaging with any Section 38 and Section 39 disability service providers who are experiencing financial challenges, including access to cash acceleration, where appropriate, to maintain continuity of service provision where cash flow issues arise.  Organisations receiving funding from the HSE should raise any concerns in relation to financial issues that may have implications for continuity of service provision with the relevant Community Health Care Organisation (CHO) responsible for the service arrangements. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Government has agreed to allocate substantial additional funding to the Health Vote to meet the costs associated with the implementation of the measures outlined in the National Action Plan in response to COVID-19. Specific action has been taken at my request and that of Minister Rabbitte, to relieve Disability service providers of the necessity to achieve a 1% efficiency target in 2020. </p>  <p>  The HSE will continue to work in partnership with all service provider organisations to ensure the best level of service possible is provided to people with a disability, and their families, within the resources available. As the Deputy's question deals with organisations providing services to the HSE, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the HSE for direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

To this end, a Dialogue Forum with Voluntary Organisations was established in December 2019 as recommended in the Report as a key mechanism for strengthening this relationship. The aim of the Forum is to build a stronger working relationship between the State and the voluntary healthcare sector for the benefit of patients and service users. The Forum will also facilitate regular dialogue with the voluntary sector on Sl&aacute;intecare and other policy initiatives and will consider issues around governance more generally.</p>  <p>  The Forum is independently chaired by Peter Cassells. Members of the Forum include the Department, the HSE, HIQA, the Mental Health Commission and the main representative bodies of voluntary providers of health and social care: The Wheel; Mental Health Reform; Disability Federation of Ireland; Not for Profit Association; National Federation of Voluntary Service Providers; Voluntary Healthcare Forum; Voluntary Hospices Group and National Community Care Network.</p>  <p>  The Forum met twice in December and January, but further meetings scheduled for March 2020 and May 2020 were postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  The Chair recently convened a sub-group of Forum to act as a planning group to assist him in planning and, where appropriate, progressing the work of the Forum over the next three to four months. The Planning Group met online for the first time on 29 September 2020 and the Group will meet again in November and December. It is planned to recommence full Forum meetings in early 2021.</p>  <p>  More generally, many of the Independent Review Group Report&rsquo;s recommendations dovetail with the Sl&aacute;intecare programme and are being considered in that context. In addition, some recommendations are being taken forward in the context of the Department of Rural and Community Development&rsquo;s 'Sustainable, Inclusive and Empowered Communities: A Five-Year Strategy to Support the Community and Voluntary Sector in Ireland 2019-2024'.</p></reply>

The HSE began planning for the resumption of adult disability day services in May. A group representative of families, service providers and other relevant stakeholders, including Inclusion Ireland, was convened and tasked with the development of a Resumption Plan. On May 31st the Framework for the Resumption of Adult Disability Day Services was published and the guidance to support this framework was published on July 8th. </p>  <p>  The guidance is to enable safe and person-centred disability day service supports to be provided in line with current public health advice and infection control guidance. It is not overly prescriptive in terms of detail as there is a wide diversity of disability in the 19,000 adults that received day service supports and day service locations vary enormously in size and capacity. Of this 19,000, approximately 5,000 people receive a day service as part of their residential placement. </p>  <p>  The key overarching elements of managing the risk of infection are: </p>  <p>  1. Processes to identify people (service users and staff) with communicable infection (including COVID-19) before they access services/attend work or as soon as possible after they access services/attend work</p>  <p>  2. Processes to minimize the risk of spread of infection from people (service users and staff) who access services/attend for work with unrecognized infection (Standard Precautions)</p>  <p>  3. Early detection of spread of infection in the service and immediate response to limit harm.</p>  <p>  The guidance developed to support the resumption of adult day services also has had to take account of social distancing rules which has meant that there is a reduced number of people in each service location. This means that, when day services re-opened through August and September, they re-opened at 40% capacity. However, the HSE is committed to maximising the support that can be provided within these restrictions. The HSE also plan to capture the detail of the service being provided to each individual over the next few weeks, to get a better understanding of the quantum of service being provided. </p>  <p>On Monday 28th September, Ministers Donnelly and Rabbitte announced that &euro;10 million is being made available in 2020 to support the resumption of day services and enhanced home support services for disability service users.</p>  <p>  Of this, &euro;7.5 million will increase disability day services by one day a week for over 14,000 adults. This funding is being drawn down from the National Action Plan on COVID-19. Funding requirements for 2021 will be considered as part of the Estimates process. </p>  <p>In line with the Governments Resilience &amp;amp; Recovery Framework (2020 &ndash; 2021), the HSE regards the provision of disability services as essential to maintaining a response to people with a disability, in the same way that schools and creches are. Importantly, Government&rsquo;s intention is that disability services will remain open at each level of the Resilience and Recovery Framework, subject to public health guidance</p>  <p>  As the Deputy's question also pertains to a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to reply to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

It is recognised that the impact of COVID-19 on society in general and especially those living in long-term residential settings has been considerable. During these times there has been a particular emphasis on retaining a holistic view of the well-being of residents, remaining person-centred, being cognisant of their rights as citizens, and being vigilant that in seeking to shield them from infection that these rights are not infringed upon in to an extent, or in a manner, that is disproportionate.</p><p>A key aim of the Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with COVID-19 is to provide clarity on what restrictive measures are appropriate around the country based on the pattern and progress of COVID-19 in a particular area at a particular time.  In line with this Framework, new COVID-19 Guidance on Visitations to Residential Care has been developed by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) to support long-term residential care providers in the discharge of their responsibilities and to support residents to the greatest extent possible, having regard to the challenging times we are living in.The latest guidance, including information on visitations to residential care facilities is available on the HPSC&rsquo;s website and the latest guidance, updated on 1st October is available here: </p><p><i>www.hpsc.ie/a-z/respiratory/coronavirus/novelcoronavirus/guidance/vulnerablegroupsguidance/.</i></p><p>As the Deputy is aware, all counties in Ireland are currently at Level 3 on the National Framework for Living with COVID-19. Under Level 3 of the Framework, it is unfortunately the case that visits to long-term residential settings are paused. I am very much aware of how difficult the current restrictions on visiting are for residents and their families, and we very much hope that a return to less restrictive visiting can be safely facilitated soon. </p><p>It is important to emphasise that the guidance is clear that visits should be facilitated in critical and compassionate circumstances.  Moreover,  in the context of Framework Level 3 a more flexible interpretation of critical and compassionate circumstances is appropriate compared with Framework Level 4 and 5.Furthermore, the term &lsquo;<i>critical and compassionate circumstances&rsquo;</i>may  include circumstances in which a resident is significantly distressed or disturbed and there is reason to believe that the visit may alleviate that distress or instances where a resident expresses a strong sense of need to see someone.</p><p>The guidance further states that virtual visiting, outdoor visiting and what is referred to as &lsquo;window visiting&rsquo; need not be restricted at any Framework Level, if there are suitable facilities and capacity to accommodate and support the visit. These options should be facilitated by service providers to the greatest extent possible.  It is also essential that all decisions regarding restricted access should be communicated clearly to each resident and to relevant others. </p></reply>

The HSE also shared a similar series of questions with the Union of Students in Ireland as well as contacting hospitals, and the National Poisons Information Centre in this regard.</p><p>On review of the data regarding the prevalence of use of nitrous oxide, at present, it is not represented in traditional data sets such as the general population survey, treatment data, or in the national drug-related death index; there have been no recorded deaths linked directly to the use of this substance. </p><p>The National Poisons Information Centre, Beaumont Hospital has received no calls in relation to nitrous oxide between 2015 to the present date, although there has been a small number of web-based queries about the substance. HSE Adolescent Addiction services have not had presentations from individuals seeking help in relation to use of nitrous oxide. Further, hospital sources are not currently reporting a concern in relation to harms associated with use of nitrous oxide. </p><p>Following its research, the HSE has concluded that while the use of nitrous oxide has emerged in an Irish context over the past two years, at present there is limited information to suggest emerging harms when compared to other more frequently used substances such as cocaine or MDMA. A locally targeted approach has been recommended within areas of need to address the use of this substance as a large-scale media campaign would be counterproductive if launched without formative research and a strong theoretical basis. </p><p>In this context, a number of steps have been taken to address the use of nitrous oxide. The HSE have published and promoted on social media tailored information aimed at parents who are concerned about the use of this substance by young people. New content has been added to the <i>Drugs.ie</i>website, as well as a harm reduction section on nitrous oxide. Nitrous oxide will also be included in new awareness resources being created by the HSE in quarter 4 of 2020. </p><p>Further, in support of a targeted response, a number of webinars have been hosted with the aim of upskilling local professionals regarding the use of nitrous oxide. Speakers at these events included a UK professional, the HSE, and professionals from the local areas. </p><p>In order to provide further data on its use, nitrous oxide will be included as the Irish module as part of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction EU Web Survey in March 2021.</p><p>I believe that particular vigilance is required to protect young people from threats to their health and well-being from misuse of substances, including nitrous oxide. I am committed to continuing to resource harm reduction and education campaigns aimed at increasing awareness of the risks of drug use.</p></reply>

In response to this need, the HSE Self-Isolation Facility at the Citywest Hotel opened to admissions on April 1st   2020, under the governance of HSE Community Operations (Primary Care).  The purpose of the unit is to provide a safe environment for residents to self-isolate, and to minimise the risk of community transmission of Covid-19. Referrals to the facility are made by a discharging hospital, GP, Public Health Doctor, contact tracing team or other appropriate medical physicians.</p>  <p>  In conjunction with the self-isolation facility at Citywest Hotel, the Hotel Convention Centre was converted into a 300 bed overflow step down facility for patients who have had the virus but are recovering, to alleviate pressure on hospitals in the greater Dublin area. Similar step-down facilities were also established in Limerick and Galway.  Thankfully, the pressure on our acute hospitals did not require this facility in Citywest to be brought into operation. </p>  <p>  The existing licence agreement for the use of the Citywest Hotel and Convention Centre is expiring and will need to be renewed by the end of October 2020, or the premises returned to its original condition and vacated. Costs incurred to date for Citywest have been &euro;24.7m (April to October 2020).</p>  <p>  Current Position:</p>  <p>The national self-isolation facility at Citywest remains operational with admissions continuing. In addition, the HSE Healthcare Worker Self Isolation pathway at Citywest opened for admissions on 1st June 2020. This service is provided for Healthcare Workers who are employed by, or are contracted to commence employment within the HSE, HSE funded agencies or any agency providing healthcare services in Ireland, who are required to self-isolate on arrival into the country prior to commencing employment. </p>  <p>  A significant testing (swabbing) centre is now also operational at the site since mid-September governed by HSE South West Dublin area (CHO7). This testing centre in its current configuration and staffing levels is delivering 750-800 tests per day. </p>  <p>  In additional, the following services, supported by Acute Operations are now operating from the Convention Centre under existing licence arrangements to ensure utilisation of the facility and to assist the reduction of patient waiting lists:</p>  <p>IEHG Glaucoma Testing: </p>  <p>  An IEHG led drive through glaucoma testing clinic is operational which proposes to treat 2,000 patients prior to the expiry of the current licence arrangement.  </p>  <p>CHI Allergy Testing:</p>  <p>CHI and CUH commenced &lsquo;Food Challenges&rsquo; allergy testing on 7th September 2020. It is anticipated that they will treat 400 patients during a six-week period prior to the expiry of the current licence arrangement. </p>  <p>CHI Orthoptist Clinic:</p>  <p>CHI commenced Orthoptist led clinics on 7th September 2020 to treat a waiting list of approximately 500 patients whose appointments were cancelled due to Covid-19 restrictions. </p>  <p>  Going Forward:</p>  <p>  The HSE is committed to the provision of a National Self-Isolation Facility in response to the Covid-19 pandemic and are actively working on contingency measures to ensure the on-going provision of Self-Isolation facilities through 2020 and into 2021 to meet continuing and potential future demand for this service.</p>  <p>  Based on activity to date, the HSE requires on-going access to a baseline capacity of 200 beds, with contingency to increase capacity beyond this level in response to increased Covid-19 infection rates; access to a contingent capacity such as that which exists in Citywest is particularly relevant in planning for the outcomes of serial testing in Direct Provision Centres and Food Manufacturing  which has the potential to create a greater level of demand for Self-Isolation Facilities. Negotiations with hotel owners, Tetrarch Capital, regarding a new contract are complete and the HSE are currently in the process of submitting a sanction request, to enter a new contract, to the Department of Health for review.</p></reply>

The programme is being offered through GPs.</p>  <p>  1.35 million doses of the Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine have been ordered this year, to be made available to all persons in an at-risk group aged from 6 months up. The HSE has also ordered 600,000 doses of the Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine, which is delivered via nasal drops rather than by injection and will be made available to children aged from 2 to 12 years.</p>  <p>  Orders for flu vaccines are placed early in the year for the following winter season, due to the necessary lead-times for manufacturing the vaccines, and at the moment the international market for vaccines is under pressure and is not able to supply significant additional quantities of the vaccine. However, the HSE is confident that the number of doses procured is sufficient to meet demand in the at-risk groups and this element of the vaccination programme has commenced.  Some GPs have also commenced the  vaccination programme for children.</p>  <p>  Those not covered by the HSE programme can avail of vaccination on a private basis.  I understand that stocks of vaccine for private administration are now being distributed. The Health Products Regulatory Authority has not been informed of shortages of vaccines.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-10-13a.1444.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020101300094#WRDD03900"><p>The 2020/2021 influenza vaccination season will be the 10th year that pharmacists have provided this service to patients. Since the pharmacy vaccination service began, the pharmacy regulator, the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (the PSI) have carried out a number of evaluations and a user satisfaction survey which have identified that this service is well received by the public and is provided to a high standard. </p>  <p>  It was therefore considered appropriate to build on the existing good practice and patient trust to further develop this service, in order to meet the evolving healthcare needs of the public and support the national healthcare system, particularly during this time of a pandemic.</p>  <p>  Due to the impact of COVID-19, there is a public health need to increase access to the influenza vaccine. I, as Minister for Health, have signed into law Statutory Instrument No. 401 of 2020 - Medicinal Products (Prescription and Control of Supply) (Amendment) (No. 5) Regulations 2020. These Regulations amend the Medicinal Products (Prescription and Control of Supply) Regulations 2003 to allow for influenza vaccination to be administered by registered pharmacists in places other than the premises of the retail pharmacy business in which they carry on their professional practice.</p>  <p>  This has the potential to greatly increase uptake of the influenza vaccine in all the groups, who can avail of the  vaccine free of charge  in particular those in the at-risk categories, as well as patients wishing to access this service privately. It also enables pharmacists who may be unable to provide a vaccination service on their pharmacy premises during the 2020/21 flu season, (due to requirements for social distancing/staff restraints etc.) to continue to provide this service for their patients and local community, albeit at a different, but safe location.  </p>  <p>  Given the importance of maximising the level of uptake in the flu vaccination, my Department, in conjunction with the HSE and following discussion with the IMO and IPU, has agreed to a process to enable and incentivise GPs and pharmacists not only to deliver vaccination to the expanded groups, but to actively seek out relevant patients and deliver vaccinations in a programmatic way, such as through dedicated flu vaccination clinics. This approach is considered necessary and appropriate so as to replace the more opportunistic vaccination approach of previous years with a much more proactive one. The ability to allow for vaccination to be administered by pharmacists in places other than the premises of the retail pharmacy business in which they carry on their professional practice is considered to be an enabler of this approach. </p>  <p>  However, it is not the role of the Minister for Health to set up off-site influenza vaccination clinics led by pharmacists or any other healthcare professional, rather this is demand led and arranged locally as the need arises, in lines with applicable regulatory requirements and clinical and practice guidelines.</p></reply>

A critical element of the strategy was to put in place an arrangement with the private hospitals to use their facilities as part of the public system, to provide essential acute hospital services for the duration of the emergency. Following negotiations with the Private Hospitals Association an overarching agreement with the 18 private acute hospitals was agreed at the end of March. Under the agreement, the HSE secured 100% of the capacity of the private hospitals until the end of June. Initial indications are that the costs arising from this agreement will be in the region of &euro;305 million euros (subject to verification).</p>  <p>  Following termination of the agreement, the Government mandated the HSE to seek to agree with the private hospitals a new arrangement which would provide the HSE with access to private hospital capacity in the event of a surge of Covid-19 cases. Critical care capacity will be agreed as part of the negotiations, which remain on-going. </p>  <p>  In addition, the HSE has initiated a procurement process to secure access to additional acute services and diagnostics from private providers which is required to address anticipated shortfall over the next two years. The process is likely to be completed by late October when a panel is expected to be in place. Following that, each hospital will run mini competitions for the services they need, and it is expected that those services will be in place in early to mid-November.  In the meantime, I have approved a HSE temporary arrangement for the treatment of patients in private hospitals.</p></reply>

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) in accordance with the advice of the World Health Organization. </p>  <p>  The resumption of services from June onwards has allowed for increased activity, with the HSE utilising innovative methods including telemedicine to facilitate patient appointments. Patient safety remains at the forefront of service resumption.  To ensure services are re-introduced in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols which has resulted in reduced capacity and activity </p>  <p>  The HSE continues to optimise productivity through alternative work practices such the use of alternative settings including private hospitals, community facilities and alternative outpatient settings.</p>  <p>  The National Treatment Purchase Fund has also recommenced arranging treatment in both private and public hospitals for clinically suitable patients who have been waiting for long periods on public hospital waiting lists.</p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy is a standardised approach used by the HSE to manage scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures.  It sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists and was developed in 2014 to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. </p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The implementation of ePrescribing is a significant programme of work and will take time to embed in acute and primary care settings.  To support access to prescriptions during the pandemic, a new service to facilitate the secure electronic transfer of prescriptions (ETP) between GPs and community pharmacy was deployed in response to Covid-19. Electronic transfer of prescriptions is just one aspect of the large programme of work involved in the full implementation of ePrescribing.</p>  <p>  Rapid implementation of the ETP was only possible in the pandemic because:</p>  <p>- the majority of GP practices avail of four accredited practice systems which the HSE rapidly upgraded to support the ETP during the pandemic,</p>  <p>- underpinning regulations were developed by the Department of Health,</p>  <p>- every community pharmacy in the country had access to the secure Healthmail system that was used to underpin ETP. </p>  <p>  This service has proven to be successful with approximately 50,000 scripts now being transferred electronically between GPs, community pharmacies every day. To build on this work, the HSE has established an ePharmacy Programme which will address the need for electronic prescribing (which in turn will support electronic discharge). A number of key specialist posts required to lead out on the ePharmacy Programme are in the process of being recruited by the HSE.</p></reply>

The restructuring of services, social distancing measures and self-isolation can be particularly difficult for those who are trying to remain drug or alcohol free and for those who are in recovery.</p>  <p>  The Government plan for living with Covid-19 details how non-Covid health and social care services will be resumed, especially during the challenging winter months. This includes planning for the safe resumption of drug and alcohol services, including community-based services, residential programmes and recovery support groups.</p>  <p>  The Department has set up a working group with drug and alcohol service providers to develop a 'Framework for the Restoration of Drug and Alcohol Services', in a planned and appropriate manner in line with public health advice. The working group has identified issues on which guidance and supports are required. </p>  <p>  I recently met with representatives of drug and alcohol task forces to discuss continued support for their work in identifying and responding to local needs. I confirmed my approval of additional funding to support the resumption of drug and alcohol services including the adaptation of services, premises, online meetings and personal protective equipment. The details of this additional funding will be communicated to the task forces shortly. </p></reply>

In this regard, my Department is in the process of developing a statutory scheme for the financing and regulation of home-support.</p><p>Work is on-going within the Department to determine the optimal approach to the development of the statutory scheme within the broader context of the on-going reform of Ireland&rsquo;s health and social care system, as envisaged in the <i>Sl&aacute;intecare Report </i>(2017). While work undertaken in 2019 focussed on the design of the scheme, work in 2020 is focussing on the development of a framework for the regulation of home-support services. In addition, the options for the funding of the new scheme are being examined through work with the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) on the projected demand for, and cost of, home-support services in various scenarios. This work will ensure that the funding model developed for the statutory scheme is fit for purpose.</p><p>Progress on the development of the scheme has been impacted by the ongoing work and diversion of resources as part of the response to COVID-19. In particular, the pilot of a reformed model of service-delivery, which had been scheduled to commence earlier this year has been delayed.  The Department is currently in discussions with the HSE with a view to commencing the testing of a reformed model of service delivery to underpin the statutory scheme later this year and into 2021.</p></reply>

These services contribute to positive ageing and better overall health.  However, the introduction of physical distancing, isolation and restricted contact with family and loved ones has changed the usual dynamic of social interaction. </p>  <p>  The HSE continues to work closely with providers and community staff to identify where service is most required and has been undertaking risk assessments of local services.  This is to ensure, insofar as possible, that Day Care services and respite services can resume in the context of COVID-19 and having regard for Public Health advice. </p>  <p>  Services will resume when it is safe to do so; when all infection prevention and control measures and the requirements of physical distancing can be maintained, so as to protect service users and staff and prevent any further spread of the virus. Some Day Centres may not be suitable for reopening due to the constraints of their physical environment and it will be necessary to continue or expand alternative service delivery models developed during recent months.  Some of the issues identified by the HSE include;</p>  <p>  - Day Care Centres operated in shared public facilities where other groups are also accessing the building and the risk of infection spread.</p>  <p>  - A number of HSE Day Care Centres are attached to HSE Residential Care Units and the clients of both the Day Care Centres and the residents from the Residential Care Unit are in the same location and use shared facilities.</p>  <p>  - Transport of clients to the Day Care Centres where family cannot assist. </p>  <p>  - Availability of isolation areas, should a client or a member of staff become unwell.</p>  <p>  I understand the impact that the continued delay in the re-opening of day centres and the restoration of respite services is having on older people and the important role this service can play in their lives. I have asked the HSE to ensure that it continues to assess the risks and benefits of re-opening, as well as continuing to expand and explore alternative ways of delivering services to this vulnerable group. I am also continuing to meet with groups that work with and on behalf of older people to see how they can best be supported during this challenging time.</p></reply>

The HSE began planning for the resumption of adult disability day services in May. A group representative of families, service providers and other relevant stakeholders, including Inclusion Ireland, was convened and tasked with the development of a Resumption Plan. On May 31st the Framework for the Resumption of Adult Disability Day Services was published and the guidance to support this framework was published on July 8th.  </p><p>The guidance is to enable safe and person-centred disability day service supports to be provided in line with current public health advice and infection control guidance. It is not overly prescriptive in terms of detail as there is a wide diversity of disability in the 19,000 adults that received day service supports and day service locations vary enormously in size and capacity. Of this 19,000, approximately 5,000 people receive a day service as part of their residential placement.  </p><p>The key overarching elements of managing the risk of infection are: </p><p>1.  Processes to identify people (service users and staff) with communicable infection (including COVID-19) before they access services/attend work or as soon as possible after they access services/attend work</p><p>2. Processes to minimize the risk of spread of infection from people (service users and staff) who access services/attend for work with unrecognized infection (Standard Precautions)</p><p>3. Early detection of spread of infection in the service and immediate response to limit harm.</p><p>The guidance developed to support the resumption of adult day services also has had to take account of social distancing rules which has meant that there is a reduced number of people in each service location. This means that, when day services re-opened through August and September, they re-opened at 40% capacity. However, the HSE is committed to maximising the support that can be provided within these restrictions. The HSE also plan to capture the detail of the service being provided to each individual over the next few weeks, to get a better understanding of the quantum of service being provided. </p><p>On Monday 28 September, Ministers Donnelly and Rabbitte announced that &euro;10 million is being made available in 2020 to support the resumption of day services and enhanced home support services for disability service users. Of this, &euro;7.5 million will increase disability day services by one day a week for over 14,000 adults. This funding is being drawn down from the National Action Plan on COVID-19. Funding requirements for 2021 will be considered as part of the Estimates process. </p><p>In line with the Governments Resilience &amp;amp; Recovery Framework (2020 &ndash; 2021), the HSE regards the provision of disability services as essential to maintaining a response to people with a disability, in the same way that schools and creches are. Importantly, Government&rsquo;s intention is that disability services will remain open at each level of the Resilience and Recovery Framework, subject to public health guidance. </p><p>As the Deputy's question also pertains to a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to reply to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

Professional counsellors can provide information on all options, including continued pregnancy supports and abortion services.</p><p>The HSE recommends that people should only visit a HSE-funded unplanned pregnancy counselling agency. A list of HSE-funded unplanned pregnancy agencies is available at </p><p>The HSE continuously monitors the situation and promotes the My Options service through a number of channels, including by posting unplanned pregnancy support messages across social media channels, Twitter, Instagram and Facebook to signpost the My Options website; radio advertisements and out of home advertising (e.g. in washrooms) at intervals throughout the year; and displaying the My Options campaign message on digital screens across 30+ healthcare locations in the waiting-room network. The HSE has advised that as the My Options website (myoptions.ie) is now well-established, the organic search performs exceptionally well for keywords relating to unplanned pregnancy and abortion. My Options Google search advertisements also perform well, with a high impression share. </p><p>The Deputy may recall that in 2019, a disingenuous agency began using &lsquo;My Options&rsquo; in the name of their website, causing confusion and putting people at risk of attending a disingenuous service. To counteract this, the HSE issued a statement to the media, reminding people to only visit a HSE-funded unplanned pregnancy counselling agency, and to check for the HSE logo or name if looking for information online. A High Court Case was also taken against the owner of a website, which was settled in favour of the HSE. </p><p>The HSE Sexual Health and Crisis Pregnancy Programme has produced guidelines to assist HSE funded counselling service providers in responding to complaints in this area. </p><p>In 2019, there were 13,214 calls to My Options and 2,793 calls to the nursing helpline. The My Options webchat service continues to provide information and support in an online setting. </p><p>In addition, the Deputy will be aware that the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 provides for the protection of the public by promoting high standards of professional conduct and professional education, training and competence through statutory registration of health and social care professions designated under the Act. The professions of counsellor and psychotherapist were designated for regulation by the Minister under the Act and will be regulated by CORU.</p><p>Regulations to designate the two professions under the Act and to establish the Counsellors and Psychotherapists Registration Board were made in 2018. The Board was appointed in February 2019 and held its inaugural meeting in May 2019. The work of the Counsellors and Psychotherapists Registration Board is significantly more challenging than for registration boards for some of the more established professions, owing to the different and complexity of entry paths into these professions, variety of titles used, and the variety and number of courses and course providers.</p><p>The Board is now undertaking the substantial work required to open the registers for counsellors and psychotherapists. This work includes consideration of titles to be protected and minimum qualifications to be required of existing practitioners applying for registration in the transitional period and for future graduates. </p><p>When the Board has opened the register and the transitional period to allow existing practitioners to register is completed, it will be an offence for anyone not registered to use the protected titles. All registrants will also be subject to the fitness to practice process in CORU which provides for sanctions against registrants when complaints are proven.</p></reply>

This Plan provides a framework setting out Ireland's approach to managing and living with COVID-19 in a range of areas over the next 6 - 9 months.</p><p>The Government has identified the reopening of our schools as a priority and the Plan acknowledges the key role of schools in supporting not just the academic progress of our children and young people, but their overall physical and mental health and well-being as well.  Schools support the physical and mental health of students through a range of interventions, including PE classes.</p><p>Ensuring that schools, early childhood care and education, childcare and childminding services can remain safely open in the context of any escalation of restrictive measures remains a Government priority. At levels 1-4 inclusive of the Plan for Living with COVID-19 schools and creches can remain open with protective measures. At level 5, recommendations will be based on the situation and evidence at the time. Decisions regarding whether schools and creches can remain open in the context of escalation to level 5 will be informed by Public Health advice.</p><p>Up-to-date Government advice and resources in the context of COVID-19 is published at </p><p>As the Deputy is aware, Ireland has moved from a short-term emergency response to a medium-term approach to managing risk and repairing the damage that COVID-19 has inflicted on society. All counties in Ireland are currently at Level 3 of the Plan for Living with COVID-19 until midnight Tuesday 27th October.  I of course recognise the difficulties and the inconvenience that this represents for many people, particularly children. Hence the reason we are making such strenuous efforts to prioritise the continuation of schooling for all. However, in line with all of the public health advice, there also unfortunately continues to be a requirement to limit our social contacts to the greatest extent possible.  </p><p>Further information on the public health measures currently in place  can be found at  </p></reply>

This is a new Reserve, and the particulars of how it will be distributed will be agreed after the Commission has presented their proposals for the Reserve by November 2020.</p>  <p>  It is important to recognise the disproportionate impact Brexit will have on Ireland, and especially on the Irish agrifood sector. Ireland exported &euro;5.47 billion of agrifood produce to the UK in 2019, which represents 38% of the total Irish agrifood exports in 2019.   The UK also remains our largest import market with imports of &euro;4.6 billion in 2019. </p>  <p>This trade is going to be impacted by the customs and regulatory costs that will apply from 1 January 2021. It is important that all operators understand that these requirements will apply whether there is a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) or not. Additionally, there is a serious potential impact from the EU and UK tariff schedules which would be imposed on trade between Ireland and Great Britain if a FTA that provides for zero tariffs and zero quotas is not agreed between the EU and the UK.</p>  <p>  My Department has put in place financial and budgetary measures to help the agrifood and fisheries sectors meet the Brexit challenges they have faced to date.

The programme itself will end in December 2020 but delays in finalising the new CAP regulations and State aid rules applicable to forestry mean that the programme will extend beyond this timeframe. </p>  <p>  While some minor changes may be introduced during the transitional period, as these may be covered under the existing State aid approval, more significant changes such as reintroducing the farmer premium rate may require new State aid approval.  Therefore, consideration of this proposal is better suited to take place as part of the development of the next Forestry Programme. Work on this new Programme is due to start in the coming months which will involve an extensive public consultation process and engagement with stakeholders across the forest sector. </p>  <p>  In relation to  support for harvest plans, the current State aid guidelines rule out grant aid for harvesting the primary purpose of which is the commercially viable extraction of timber. Whether or not the new State aid rules contain a higher degree of flexibility in this regard remains to be seen. </p>  <p>  In April 2018, my Department, announced a review of the national response to Ash Dieback Disease as it was increasingly evident from experience and the latest scientific advice that eradication of Ash Dieback disease was no longer feasible. The focus of the review was on the policy approach and associated support schemes, considering the move away from Ash Dieback eradication and bringing ash plantation management into focus. This new approach was circulated for stakeholder consultation in December 2019 and a total of 18 submissions were received in reply.  All submissions were carefully considered, and a number of meetings held with stakeholders to finalise a new scheme document. The new Reconstitution and Underplanting Scheme or RUS was launched in June 2020. There are no plans to undertake a review so soon after the scheme launch. However, the consultation process for the next forestry programme will provide an opportunity to revisit the question of an income compensation element in a revised Ash Dieback scheme.</p></reply>

However, under certain conditions replanting grants are made available as part of the Native Woodland Conservation Scheme. Under this scheme the conversion of existing conifer forests to native woodland are eligible for grants of up to &euro;5,000 per hectare. Private forest owners are also eligible for an annual premium payment of &euro;350 per hectare for 7 years.</p>  <p>  In order to receive this funding the conifer forest must be adjoining a sensitive watercourse, where native woodland establishment can contribute to the protection of water quality and aquatic habitats and species. Water sensitive areas include Freshwater Pearl Mussel catchments, fisheries sensitive areas, Acid Sensitive Areas, and high status waterbodies identified under the Water Framework Directive. </p>  <p>  Where a marketable quantity of timber is realised from the felling operation, the quantity (in cubic metres) of timber must be documented and details submitted to my Department, together with evidence of timber-related income (including invoices and receipts). My Department may reduce the grant payable accordingly, reflecting the value of the timber realised and (where relevant) the normal costs associated with standard replanting. </p>  <p>  Applications under the Native Woodland Conservation Scheme must be made before clearfelling takes place and applicants  must  ensure that  a valid felling licence is in place for any felling carried out under the scheme.</p></reply>

This process is a legal requirement to rule out the possibility of an adverse effect on a European Site (SACs or SPAs). The Department is acutely aware of the impact the delay is having on many applicants as well as the wider sector and is focused on addressing this delay and applying the necessary level of scientific rigour in relation to each AA process. The Department has assigned significant additional resources to reduce this backlog. These resources are a combination of additional ecologists, forestry inspectors and administrative staff, where required. </p>  <p>  The licence application referred to is currently waiting to be reviewed by a Department ecologist and unfortunately it will take some time before an ecologist can be assigned to work on an AA Determination for this application. The current estimate is over 9 months.  Submitting a Natura Impact Statement (NIS) for the licence would, however, significantly reduce the length of time it would take for the Department to complete the AA process for this application.  On receipt of a satisfactory NIS, the length of time it would take to complete the AA process is estimated to be between 2 and 3 months. </p>  <p>  If the applicant wishes to submit a NIS, they should notify the Department at ecologyqueries@agriculture.gov.ie. The Department&rsquo;s ecologist will provide written guidance by describing the issues on which the NIS must focus.</p></reply>

This was similar to an exercise which Mr. Mackinnon had previously conducted for the Scottish authorities. It was published at the end of last year and presented to the Forestry Programme Implementation Group in January. Its implementation is one of the commitments which this Government made for forestry in the Programme for Government. </p>  <p>  The report was informed by, among other things, discussions with a range of stakeholders including the forestry sector, farming organisations, the environmental pillar, State Bodies, Teagasc and the Forestry Appeals Committee.  In addition, written submissions were received at the time.</p>  <p>  The report includes 22 Ways Forward or recommendations across a range of issues.  I am pleased to say that many of these recommendations have already been taken on board by the Department and acted upon. We have, for instance, in line with Mackinnon, introduced an amendment to the Agriculture Appeals Act and have issued guidance on Natura Impact Statements. We have also introduced a single consent system for forestry road planning </p>  <p>  I recognise, of course, that it is very important that the report is fully implemented and that is why I am currently examining the appointment of an independent chair to oversee the process. The intention is that this person will report on the feasibility of implementing the Mackinnon recommendations for us to consider further. newly commissioned Forestry Programme Implementation Group, to monitor progress and to help deliver on its ambition. A review of the Forestry Programme Implementation Group is currently underway to enhance representation so that the membership on the Group is best selected to help advise on the implementation of the National Programme. </p>  <p>  There is a huge amount of activity in forestry at the moment especially on the reform of the planning and appeals processes and the commencement of the Forestry (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2020. Nonetheless, I am well aware that implementation of MacKinnon is also a priority and I expect to be making further announcements on this issue in the near future.</p></reply>

In addition, my Department also has responsibility for the upkeep and maintenance of North Harbour at Cape Clear, as well as the maintenance of a small number of specific piers, lights and beacons throughout Ireland, in accordance with the Marine Works (Ireland) Act 1902, and piers, lights and beacons constructed under the auspices of the Congested Districts Board.</p><p>Responsibility for the maintenance and development of Local Authority-owned harbours and piers rests with each individual Local Authority in the first instance and its parent Department, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage thereafter. </p><p>My Department does however provide limited funding to assist coastal Local Authorities in carrying out small scale projects for the development and repair of Local Authority owned piers, harbours and slipways under the annual Fishery Harbour and Coastal Infrastructure Development Programme, subject to available Exchequer funding and overall national priorities.  </p><p>Each year, Local Authorities are invited to submit prioritised lists of projects for consideration to be included in the annual capital programme. All applications for funding made by Local Authorities in respect of qualifying projects are then assessed, taking into account compliance with the criteria of the scheme, the priority attached to each project by the relevant Local Authority, the funding available, and the need to ensure a broad geographical spread of projects. Since 2010, my Department has provided funding of over &euro;31 million to 15 coastal local authorities for development and maintenance works.</p><p>Table 1 (contained in the below link) outlines the total funding granted by my Department to each Local Authority in the years 2010 to 2020. The figures also include Storm Damage funding in 2014 and 2015, which was additional funding to assist Local Authorities in repairing piers and harbours and eligible marine infrastructure owned by them, which were damaged by severe winter storms. </p><p>Table 2 (contained in the below link) gives a detailed project breakdown of this funding by Local Authority. The figures for 2020 are the allocated funding figures, not actual expenditure.

A transition period of three years for vessels over 18m targeting sprat was allowed to enable adjustment for these vessels, as the sprat fishery is concentrated inside the six nautical mile zone.</p><p>A Judicial Review was taken by two applicant fishermen challenging the validity of the Policy.

The Policy Directive 1 of 2019, which gave legal effect to the policy, was not ultra vires, </p><p>2. The Directive did not impinge the applicants constitutional rights.</p><p>3. Given the impact on the applicants there was a particular duty on the Minister to provide a fuller explanation and engage in further talks with the applicants.

The Policy directive did not breach EU law. </p><p>On 6 October 2020, the Judge held in summary that the Court&rsquo;s final order should be, inter alia, a declaration that Policy Directive 1 of 2019 was made in breach of fair procedures and is void and/or of no legal effect.</p><p>I am currently considering, on an urgent basis, the implications of the judgment in consultation with my Department officials and legal advisors.</p></reply>
