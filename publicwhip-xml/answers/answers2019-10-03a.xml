    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-10-03a.8.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1277" speakername="David Stanton" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019100300045#WRA00600"><p>I can inform the Deputy that I met recently with the organisation referred to in the Deputy's question shortly after the publication of their report, which we discussed thoroughly.  They raised several issues with me, including the issues around vulnerability assessments and accommodation standards.  They also raised concerns about emergency accommodation and I share those concerns.  We are appreciative of their insights and advice in these matters.</p>  <p>  The inter-departmental taskforce to which the Deputy refers ceased to function once it achieved its goal of a successful opt-in for Ireland to the European Communities (Reception Conditions) Regulations 2018.  As a result of the State&rsquo;s opt-in to the Regulations, we now have a legal obligation to offer accommodation, food and a range of other services (including meals, utilities, healthcare etc.) and allowances to any person who claims a right to international protection in Ireland while their legal claim is being examined.  As of 22 September 2019, the Department is accommodating 6,014 people in its 38 accommodation centres and 1,379 people in 33 emergency accommodation locations. </p>  <p>  A High Level Interdepartmental Group has been established in my Department, chaired at a senior level, to review the system.</p>  <p>  To complement the work being undertaken by the Inter-Departmental Group, an Advisory Group is being established, chaired by  Catherine Day. The Group will look at longer term approaches to providing supports to persons in the protection process and will include experienced former public servants and representatives from the NGO community. The Advisory Group will begin its work later this month.</p>  <p>  A whole-of-Government approach to direct provision means that several Government Departments and Agencies work closely together to ensure the necessary supports and services are provided to residents in direct provision. The Department of Justice and Equality offers accommodation and related services. The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection pays a weekly personal allowance to each resident and covers any exceptional needs.  The Department of Education and Skills provides school places for children resident in the centres and children also have access to the free pre-school scheme, the Early Childhood Care and Education programme.  The HSE provides mainstreamed health services to residents.  </p>  <p>  Since the introduction of the Regulations, significant improvements have been made to the Direct Provision system including an increase to the daily expenses allowance for residents, granting access to the Labour Market &ndash; since its introduction in July 2018, the immigration service has granted 3,100 permissions to residents living in our international protection accommodation services.</p>  <p>  Further targeted improvements include the rollout of the National Standards which were published on 15 August 2019.  The National Standards provide a framework for the continual development of services and supports for residents by improving the quality of care and ensuring consistency across the centres.  The Immigration Service of my Department inform me that the aim is to have all residents in commercial centres benefitting from independent living (cooking facilities and onsite food hall) by the middle of 2020.</p>  <p>  The implementation of the Standards, along with the continual rollout of independent living across the centres will significantly enhance the lives of all applicants and in particular families and children.</p></reply>

It should be noted that Ireland was the second safest EU member state in terms of road deaths per million inhabitants in 2018.</p>  <p>  However maintaining progress in road safety requires consistent ongoing attention and in the first instance it should be noted that up to 85% of all road traffic fines are paid by motorists on receipt of the relevant Fixed Charge Notice issued by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is important to understand that the figure referred to by the Deputy relates solely to a proportion of the remaining cases where Fixed Charge Notices had not been paid and the matter proceeds to summons.</p>  <p>  I am informed that approximately 95% of all penalty point offences are endorsed by the National Vehicle and Driver File on driver licences every year with over 85% of penalty point offence records received directly from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when the offender opts to pay the fixed charge amount and accept the penalty points. The remainder of relevant records are received from the Courts Service, following convictions in court.</p>  <p>  Insofar as non-service of summons is concerned this rate is higher than I as Minister or any agency engaged in road traffic enforcement would wish.  However, I am assured that work is ongoing by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to further improve the rate of summons service. </p>  <p>  I am informed that a Garda Summons Service Working Group has undertaken a review of the entire summons service process and has identified actions to improve the rate of service and a marked improvement in the rate of summons served has been noted since the commencement of its review.  Indeed I understand from Garda management that summons service rates are now at their highest in a decade. </p>  <p>  Further, the Criminal Justice (Fixed Charge Processing System (FCPS)) Working Group, jointly chaired by officials from my Department and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, continues to monitor progress in implementing the recommendations of the comprehensive 2014 Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate report, including the summons service process.  The Working Group's most recent progress report in respect of 2018 was published on my Department's website in July last. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that the third payment option, introduced in June 2017 encourages recipients of Fixed Charge Notices for road traffic offences to avail of a third and final opportunity to pay their Fixed Charge Notice amount, thereby eliminating the requirement to attend court.  In the period 25 October 2017 to 5 April 2019, take-up of the third payment option was at 31.37%, which represents a solid return in road traffic enforcement terms. </p>  <p>  In addition, the restructuring currently underway in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will have a positive impact on road traffic enforcement capacity over time.  For example, the mobility project currently being developed includes a particular focus on roads policing.   I am confident that the use of Garda mobile devices at the roadside will provide for a timelier, consistent and targeted approach to road traffic enforcement.</p></reply>

This approach includes a strong focus on quality of life issues and collaboration with local authorities to help address the causes of anti-social behaviour.</p><p>Garda visibility is a key element in tackling and indeed deterring anti-social behaviour and in this context An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is a growing organisation which is developing a partnership approach to problem solving with the community and other agencies.  In addition, anti-social behaviour is addressed through deployment of resources, including the Public Order Unit to augment local plans where appropriate.</p><p>A number of strong legislative provisions are available to Garda&iacute; to combat anti-social behaviour, including those under:</p><p>- the Criminal Damage Act 1991;</p><p>- the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994;</p><p>- the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003; and</p><p>- the Intoxicating Liquor Acts 2003 and 2008. </p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing placed a particular emphasis on the importance of community policing, in which front-line Garda&iacute; are visible and engaged in communities, developing partnerships with other public agencies and stakeholders, to deliver a multi-agency approach to community safety.</p><p>The new Garda Operating Model and revised Divisional Structure, announced recently by the Commissioner, meets a key commitment in &quot;A Policing Service for the Future&quot;, the four year implementation plan giving effect to the recommendations of the Commission on the Future of Policing. The new model is intended to provide more visible Garda&iacute; on the front line, as well as devolving more power and decision-making power from Garda Headquarters to Chief Superintendents leading Divisions.  This will ensure a more responsive police service reflecting local needs.</p><p>I am confident that these measures - the unprecedented resourcing of and increased recruitment to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as well as the ongoing process of Garda reform including a strengthened focus on community policing - will assist in ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country which will maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.</p><p>The Government also remains committed to ensuring that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have the necessary resources to tackle all forms of criminality in our communities.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-10-03a.21.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1277" speakername="David Stanton" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019100300045#WRA01500"><p>It is important to emphasise that all Departments and their agencies involved in the delivery of services and supports to applicants have a role to play in identifying and addressing the needs of applicants who present as vulnerable. This is particularly the case where vulnerabilities may only be disclosed or become evident after the initial stage of the protection process.  </p>  <p>  In June 2018, Ireland opted into the EU (recast) Reception Conditions Directive. This Directive lays down the standards for the reception of international protection applicants. Article 21 of the Directive requires Member States, in implementing the Directive, to take into account the specific situation of vulnerable persons, and Article 22 provides for the assessment of the special reception needs of vulnerable persons. The Article also sets out that the assessment need not take the form of an administrative procedure. For the purposes of the Directive and Regulation 8 of the 2018 transposing Regulations, vulnerable persons include minors, unaccompanied minors, disabled people, elderly people, pregnant women, single parents, victims of human trafficking, persons with serious illnesses, persons with mental disorders and persons who have been subjected to torture, rape or other serious forms of psychological, physical or sexual violence, such as victims of female genital mutilation. </p>  <p>  My Department is continually reviewing how to improve services to applicants and my officials are currently examining the options available to improve the procedure for the identification and assessment of those applicants deemed to be vulnerable in accordance with Article 21 of the Reception Conditions Directive.</p>  <p>  To assist in determining how best we can meet the health and related needs of applicants, the HSE National Office for Social Inclusion has recently commissioned research to explore the concept of vulnerability with a view to further improving our existing processes. I look forward to the outcome of this research.</p>  <p>  With regard to current procedures, every applicant has an initial interview conducted when they first attend the International Protection Office in Dublin. If the applicant indicates that they require accommodation , he or she will then be assessed for any specific reception needs. The result of the assessment is taken into account when assigning accommodation to the individual. </p>  <p>  Applicants are also invited for an initial health assessment on a voluntary basis. A Health Screening Team, which is funded and managed by the HSE, is located onsite at the Balseskin Reception Centre for this purpose. The team comprises of GPs, a Medical Officer, a Clinical Nurse Specialist and two nurses, a primary care social worker, two primary care psychologists and clerical/administration support. The team offers a range of individual services and screening for medical and psychosocial needs and makes onward referrals for any further treatment required. These health professionals communicate with my officials in the International Protection Accommodation Service (IPAS - formerly RIA), within the bounds of patient confidentiality, if a particular need is identified that will impact the person's accommodation requirements. In the coming weeks, a new primary care facility will be opening in Balseskin, which will enable the health care team to provide their services in a facility that is to the standard of all new HSE primary care facilities. </p>  <p>  In addition, arrangements are in place with Safetynet, who carry out health screening in various parts of the country on behalf of the HSE, to offer the screening service to those who do not, for whatever reason, avail of it in Dublin. Staff from Safetynet liaise with the IPAS if the person is deemed vulnerable on medical or related grounds. This can include a request that special arrangements should be taken regarding the assignment of the person's accommodation, for example if they need to be located near a particular hospital.</p></reply>

The Act also removes those who offer their services as a prostitute from the existing offences of soliciting for the purpose of prostitution. One purpose of this measure is to provide additional protection to persons involved in prostitution and to allow them to make reports to the Garda&iacute;, for instance where they have been subjected to violence by clients, without fear or concern of being prosecuted for selling sexual services.</p>  <p>  As with the legislation in Northern Ireland, there is provision under the 2017 Act to report on the operation of the legislation.  This will include an assessment of the impact on the welfare of those who engage in sexual activity for payment, as well as information on prosecutions and convictions.  The review will commence early next year.</p>  <p>  While not pre-empting the outcome of this forthcoming review, I am conscious that there are many differing opinions on the approaches which should be adopted to address this issue.  It is very important that any review should be underpinned by qualitative and quantitative data that includes the experience of those providing sexual services as well as those who provide support and advice and advocate on their behalf. </p>  <p>  This is undoubtedly a complex issue - reflected in the debates around the introduction of the 2017 provisions.  Measures to target the demand for commercial sex must continue to keep as a core principle the safety, health and well-being of all of those involved in prostitution.</p></reply>

It is a strong example of the extensive North-South cooperation between the police, customs services and other law enforcement agencies involved in tackling crime and enhancing the safety of all communities on both sides of the border. The Task Force complements both the ongoing formal and informal co-operation between AGS and PSNI, as well as specific joint investigations which take place when individual crime incidents with a cross border dimension occur, such as the one underway into the abduction and assault of an individual as already referred to.   </p>  <p>  Last week I attended the 17th Cross Border Conference on Organised Crime in Co. Cavan together with the Garda Commissioner, the Chief Constable of the PSNI, senior officers from all the agencies and senior officials from Department of Justice Northern Ireland and my own Department.  This is an annual event, aimed at enhancing cooperation between law enforcement agencies on both sides of the border, particularly in relation to cross border organised criminality and related issues.  This conference gave members of the Task Force the opportunity to consider in detail the necessary improvements and innovations, including international cooperation, which can be taken to strengthen the effectiveness of the Task Force.</p>  <p>  While the work of the Task Force is reviewed as part of the annual cross border conference on organised crime, there is ongoing multiagency engagement in relation to operations to tackle cross border crime.</p>  <p>  I am sure the Deputy will join me in welcoming the Commissioner's decision to establish an additional Armed Support Unit (ASU) in Cavan, which became operational this week. This ASU will complement the work of those already based in Ballyshannon, Co. Donegal and Dundalk, Co. Louth in the Northern Region.   </p>  <p>  The Northern region has benefited from the accelerated recruitment to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the unprecedented &euro;1.76 billion budget provided to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for 2019.  The Garda strength in the Northern Region has increased to approximately 1,500, an increase of 150 Garda&iacute; since the end of 2017 as well as approximately 150 Garda staff in the region, which represents an increase of almost 30% over the past 3 years.   </p>  <p>  The ongoing recruitment will provide the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; to deliver a visible, effective and responsive policing service.   These requirements will be kept under ongoing review by Garda management with a view to addressing any policing requirements for the Border region which may arise. In the event that a &ldquo;no deal&rdquo; Brexit gives rise to additional requirements in border areas, further resources can and will be provided through redeployment.</p>  <p>  Finally, I can assure the Deputy that, irrespective of the political outcome of Brexit, the excellent ongoing cooperation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI must and will continue to combat the threat posed by criminals that seek to exploit the policing challenges posed by the border.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps staffing and deployment requirements under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities, to ensure their optimum use.</p>  <p>  The Government decided in July 2016 to increase the number of Garda&iacute; to 15,000 and Garda staff to a total of 4,000 by 2021 and huge progress has already been made towards that goal.  As part of that plan, there is ongoing and increased recruitment of new Garda&iacute; and Garda staff, allowing for redeployment of Garda&iacute; to operational duties at the front-line.  There are now over 14,200 Garda&iacute; nationwide, supported by over 2,700 civilian staff.</p>  <p>  In fact, since the re-opening of the Garda Training College in 2014, approximately 2,800 new Garda members have attested and been assigned to front-line policing duties in communities throughout the country. Another 200 probationer Garda&iacute; are due to attest by the end of this year. </p>  <p>  In line with the recommendation of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, it is for the Commissioner to decide and balance the organisation's needs within the resources allocated to him.  For example, in addition to recruiting 600 Garda&iacute; the Commissioner decided this year to recruit an additional 600 Garda staff in 2019.  This will in turn allow for the redeployment of approximately 500 experienced Garda&iacute; to front-line policing duties by the end of this year.</p>  <p>  I am advised by the Garda Commissioner that as of 31 August, there were 473 Garda Reserves across the organisation. </p>  <p>  I am informed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that a class of approximately 100 Garda reserve recruits commenced training in March 2019 at the Garda College, Templemore. </p>  <p>  In addition, as recommended in the Commission's report, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is currently conducting a strategic review of the Garda Reserve to inform future decisions around its use. The strategy is expected to inform the development and preparation for a new Reserve recruitment drive by the end of 2019.  I understand that a class of 100 reserves commenced training in March and, as of 31 August, there are 473 reserves across the organisation.   </p>  <p>  Finally, it may be noted that unprecedented resources are currently being provided to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  A total budget of &euro;1.76 billion has been allocated to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2019, in addition to capital investment of &euro;92 million this year.  This ongoing investment is intended to support growth in the organisation as well as the ambitious Garda reform plan, with the overall goal of ensuring a visible, professional and effective policing service to all our communities, nationwide.</p></reply>

Ireland was the second safest EU member state in terms of road deaths per million inhabitants in 2018.</p>  <p>  However maintaining progress in road safety requires consistent ongoing attention and in the first instance it should be noted that Garda&iacute; indicate that up to 85% of all road traffic fines are paid by motorists on receipt of the relevant Fixed Charge Notice issued by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is important to understand that the figure referred to by the Deputy relates solely to a proportion of the remaining cases where Fixed Charge Notices had not been paid and the matter proceeds to summons.</p>  <p>  I am informed that approximately 95% of all penalty point offences are endorsed by the National Vehicle and Driver File on driver licences every year with over 85% of penalty point offence records received directly from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when the offender opts to pay the fixed charge amount and accept the penalty points. The remainder of relevant records are received from the Courts Service, following convictions in court.</p>  <p>  Insofar as non-service of summons is concerned this rate is higher than I as Minister or any agency engaged in road traffic enforcement would wish.  However, I am assured that work is ongoing by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to further improve the rate of summons service.</p>  <p>  I am informed that a Garda Summons Service Working Group has undertaken a review of the entire summons service process and has identified actions to improve the rate of service and a marked improvement in the rate of summons served has been noted since the commencement of its review.  Indeed I understand from Garda management that summons service rates are now at their highest in a decade.</p>  <p>  Further, the Criminal Justice (Fixed Charge Processing System (FCPS)) Working Group, jointly chaired by officials from my Department and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, continues to monitor progress in implementing the recommendations of the comprehensive 2014 Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate report, including the summons service process.  The Working Group's most recent progress report in respect of 2018 was published on my Department's website in July last.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that the third payment option, introduced in June 2017 encourages recipients of Fixed Charge Notices for road traffic offences to avail of a third and final opportunity to pay their Fixed Charge Notice amount, thereby eliminating the requirement to attend court.  In the period 25 October 2017 to 5 April 2019, take-up of the third payment option was at 31.37%, which represents a solid return in road traffic enforcement terms. </p>  <p>  In addition, the restructuring currently underway in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will have a positive impact on road traffic enforcement capacity over time.  For example, the mobility project currently being developed includes a particular focus on roads policing.   I am confident that the use of Garda mobile devices at the roadside will provide for a timelier, consistent and targeted approach to road traffic enforcement.</p></reply>

Where this is done in communities, signs can be erected in the area indicating that property has been marked. This, in itself, acts as a significant deterrent to criminals and has, I understand, had very positive effects on crime rates. </p>  <p>  Marking property with an Eircode has a number of distinct advantages. Aside from reducing the likelihood that your property will be stolen in the first place, it can assist Garda&iacute; in identifying stolen property that a person may have in their possession and provides evidence for prosecutions. It also allows for identification of the rightful owner and the return of property quickly and efficiently. </p>  <p>  I am informed that highly successful pilot projects involving the marking of property with eircodes have been carried out in West Cork and Monaghan and are being adopted by communities elsewhere in the country.  While supported by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, these initiatives have been successfully adopted by the local communities involved.  Whatever method is used, I would strongly encourage people to mark their property be it farm machinery, bicycles, computers or other personal property and to consider the advantages of using a unique identifier - such as eircode - in doing so.  </p>  <p>  I would also like to note the National Rural Safety Forum launched last month at the National Ploughing Championships.  The Forum was established following stakeholder consultation between my Department, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and key partners such as the Irish Farmers Association and Muintir na Tire.  One of the key objectives of the forum is crime prevention and crime opportunity reduction with a focus on property marking, recording, identification and return.  The Forum will, through individual and collective efforts, attempt to significantly increase the level of property marking and property recording nationally with a view to increasing deterrence, assisting in prevention of crime and to assisting in the identification of stolen property.</p></reply>

These services are demand led and generally it is difficult to predict demand far in advance. </p>  <p>  I am advised that as of 26 September 2019, 7,355 persons were being provided with accommodation by the International Protection Accommodation Services (IPAS, formerly the Reception and Integration Agency) of my Department. </p>  <p>  Currently, there are 5,966 persons residing in the 38 accommodation centres located nationwide across 18 counties. As these centres are at full capacity, there are also a further 1,389 applicants residing in 34 emergency accommodation locations in hotels and guest houses. </p>  <p>  Every effort is being made to re-accommodate applicants in emergency locations to a dedicated accommodation centre as quickly as possible. My Department is actively working on securing additional capacity, both in its existing centres and through sourcing new accommodation centres. </p>  <p>   IPAS has sought expressions of interest from parties who would be interested in providing accommodation and related services to people in the international protection process and has also launched a nationwide, regional tendering process to source new accommodation centres.</p>  <p>  In relation to the length of time applicants spend in the international protection process, my Department has introduced a number of measures aimed at reducing the time taken to determine applications. The International Protection Act, 2015, introduced the single procedure process for the determination of protection applications. </p>  <p>  Under the single procedure all elements of a person's protection claim (refugee status, subsidiary protection status and permission to remain) are considered together rather than sequentially. The aim of the single procedure is to help reduce waiting times significantly. </p>  <p>  In addition, a number of other measures have and are being taken including increases in staffing levels at the International Protection Office (IPO). A new streamlined system for processing Safe Country of Origin (SCO) cases has been implemented and various process improvements have been made in the IPO and in the International Protection Appeals Tribunal (IPAT). </p>  <p>  My Department is aiming to reduce processing times for first instance decisions to 9 months by the end of this year. An applicant who applies for international protection today can expect to receive a first instance recommendation/decision within approximately 15 months, provided that no complications arise. Prioritised cases are being processed in just under 9 months. </p>  <p>  Prioritised applications include those from countries such as Syria and Eritrea and from especially vulnerable groups of applicants, such as unaccompanied minors.</p></reply>

This was the case in line with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 which provides that management of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the allocation of Garda resources, including the deployment and distribution of Garda personnel, is solely a matter for the Commissioner.   </p>  <p>  These changes have been welcomed by the Garda Inspectorate, the Policing Authority, members of the Commission on the Future of Policing and many others, including the Irish Farmers Association.  The Commissioner has also made clear that he and his team are willing to meet Joint Policing Committees all over Ireland in the weeks ahead for detailed local engagement.  I am confident that the new Model will serve Ireland well by providing a more agile, localised and responsive police service nationwide.</p></reply>

Under the terms of the Scheme, the Tribunal is limited to a Chair and 6 ordinary members who provide services on a part-time basis. It is entirely independent in the matter of individual decisions on applications for compensation. </p>  <p>  Any decision to recruit a greater number of solicitors and barristers to service the Tribunal&rsquo;s needs would amount to a Scheme change. I have asked my officials to consider this issue further. </p>  <p>  I can confirm that five Departmental staff act as Secretariat to the Tribunal. These staff receive applications and gather the necessary information from applicants and other stakeholders such as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to each case. When all required information is available, Tribunal staff send the file to the Tribunal for consideration and decision. Where a decision is appealed, Tribunal staff make arrangements for a Tribunal appeal hearing.</p>  <p>  In terms of the duration of the process, I should note that it may take several years before an application for compensation is ready for submission to the Tribunal for consideration and decision. For example final Garda reports on the crime are required, as are the outcomes of any court cases initiated. In addition, in some cases the extent of injuries suffered by the victim may not be known for some years. It is also the case that the assessment of loss of earnings for consideration by the Tribunal may be complex to determine and may require employer assessment and social welfare reports. These and other factors can have an impact on the duration of any particular application. </p>  <p>  An assessment is currently being carried out by officials of my Department in relation to caseload in the scheme, including the extent and nature of any possible backlog. </p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy may be interested to know that in its fifth work programme, published in March 2019, the Law Reform Commission included a review of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme as one of 15 planned projects.  I welcome this project as an opportunity for a comprehensive examination of all aspects of this long-established Scheme, to ensure that the State&rsquo;s arrangements for the compensation of victims of violent crime are in keeping with good international practice and meet society's needs into the future.</p></reply>

The recidivism rate stood at 55% in 2007, but the report shows it fell to 45.8% in 2012.  Overall, this represents a decrease of 9.3% over a five year period.  </p>  <p>  I was also pleased to note that the CSO study published in June last in relation to offenders sentenced to probation also recorded noted significant reductions, with a drop of nearly 8 percentage points in re-offending rates recorded between 2008 and 2012.  The report shows that those sentenced to a Community Service Order were less likely to re-offend than those sentenced to a Probation Order.  </p>  <p>  I also particularly welcome the finding that Community Service continues to show very good outcomes. Over 350,000 hours of community service work were carried out around the country in 2018. This not only benefits communities nationwide and allows offenders a chance to make amends for their criminal actions in a tangible way, but the findings of the CSO&rsquo;s work clearly shows that such orders can also help reduce re-offending rates by the individuals involved.</p>  <p>  While there is clearly scope for further improvement, overall this evidence is very positive. It means that more ex-offenders are turning their lives around, and fewer are going on to re-offend, with all the negative consequences that brings for our communities.</p>  <p>  I expect that future studies in this CSO series are likely to show a continuation of the downward trend as, since 2015, a range of enhanced prisoner programmes aimed at reducing re-offending behavior have been introduced by the Irish Prison Service and the Probation Service. These include targeting offenders with high recidivism rates, in particular through the Joint Agency Response to Crime (JARC), a multi-agency approach to prolific offenders which prioritises them for targeted interventions and supports to address their behaviour and thus reduce crime and victimisation in local communities.  Independent evaluations have found that the JARC pilots are helping to reduce both the frequency and severity of reoffending among their clients groups and indeed have helped many offenders to move away from criminality altogether.</p>  <p>  I am confident that interventions of this nature will assist in continuing the positive downward trajectory in recidivism, as identified by the CSO&rsquo;s most recent report.</p></reply>

This relief provides for a rate of 10 per cent to be applied (since 1 January 2017) to chargeable gains arising on the disposal, by an individual, of qualifying business assets up to a lifetime limit of &euro;1 million.</p><p>The relief is available on the disposal of a wide range of qualifying businesses including high risk and potential innovation start-ups. It does not however make a distinction between start-ups and more traditional asset backed enterprises.</p><p><b>Research and development tax credit</b></p><p>The R&amp;amp;D Tax Credit provides a 25% tax credit for all qualifying R&amp;amp;D expenditure. Where a company has already offset the credit against current and previous year CT claims, it may apply for a refundable credit in three instalments.  The credit is available to all companies carrying out qualifying research &amp;amp; development activities. </p><p>The refundable nature of the R&amp;amp;D tax credit can be particularly attractive to start-up companies in the early stages of trading as the credit can effectively part-fund the R&amp;amp;D activity and act as a valuable source of cash-flow. </p><p>Deputies will be aware that I committed during debates on Finance Bill 2018 to consider amendments to the R&amp;amp;D tax credit to encourage uptake of the R&amp;amp;D credit by smaller companies, and this work is nearing completion.</p><p><b>Knowledge Development Box</b></p><p>The Knowledge Development Box (KDB) that profits from certain qualifying assets that are earned by a company, chargeable to corporation tax in Ireland, can be taxed at 6.25%. This only applies to the extent that the assets relate to Research and Development undertaken by the company.</p><p>The main purpose of the KDB is to encourage companies to develop certain types of intellectual property in Ireland and thereby engage in substantive operations that have a high value add for the Irish economy.</p><p>The KDB (Certificate of Innovations) Act 2017 allows smaller companies to avail of the KDB by allowing SMEs to claim for assets which are &ldquo;patentable but not yet patented&rdquo;, and reintroduced substantive patent examination through the Irish Patents Office to ensure that Irish Patents can qualify for the KDB. This is available to companies with annual income from intellectual property that is less than &euro;7.5m and annual global turnover of &euro;50m. However, the relief does not make a further distinction between SMEs and high-innovation start-ups, as referenced in the Deputy&rsquo;s question.</p></reply>

As such, since 2013 the Central Bank has used its enforcement powers under section 53 of the 2013 Act with 166 warning notices published and listed on the Central Bank&rsquo;s list of unauthorised firms.

The 2016 Regulations list the permitted classes of investments for credit unions which includes certain investments with credit institutions where &lsquo;credit institution&rsquo; means a person authorised as such under the EU Capital Requirements Directive (CRD IV). Under the 2016 Regulations, credit unions may therefore hold investments in UK credit institutions. However, the 2016 Regulations require that a credit union ensures that any investments made remain in compliance. Post-Brexit, the UK will become a third country (non-EU) for the purposes of the CRD IV. Investments made by credit unions in some UK credit institutions may therefore no longer come within a permitted class of investment under the 2016 Regulations in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  </p>  <p>  The Central Bank&rsquo;s supervisory expectations with regard to Brexit planning is that credit unions regularly monitor and report any potential Brexit associated risks they identify, and record these in their risk registers. Credit unions should consider the risks Brexit may pose to their credit union and in particular what risk mitigants may be appropriate for their own business model and common bond. </p>  <p>  The Central Bank is in the process of assessing the potential non-compliance by credit unions with the 2016 Regulations in respect of investments in UK credit institutions in the event of a no-deal Brexit and whether any actions are required to address this potential issue. The Central Bank will communicate with credit unions in this regard, as necessary.</p></reply>

Each of these businesses has been written to and was provided with suggestions regarding practical preparatory steps to take based on their trade pattern with the U.K. Additional follow up telephone contact is being made with businesses, approximately 44,000, that have the largest volumes of trade with the UK (greater than &euro;5,000) and those that trade most frequently with the UK (at least quarterly). This additional engagement work by Revenue will be completed on 4 October.</p><p>90% by value of the import trade with the UK in 2018 was carried out by businesses who now have an EORI number. 97% by value of the export trade was carried out by businesses who now have an EORI number. This indicates that businesses that are going to be significantly impacted by Brexit are responding to the call to be prepared.</p><p>Revenue have advised me that registering for an EORI number is a simple process and once a business is registered with the Revenue Online Service (ROS) the turnaround registration for an EORI number is approximately 3 minutes. </p><p>I commend  Revenue on the intensified Brexit engagement with businesses and I strongly urge all businesses that have received a Brexit preparedness letter from Revenue to take note of its advice to register for an EORI number and ensure that they or their agent have the facility and capacity to lodge a Customs Declaration by 31 October.</p><p><b>Table 1EORI REGISTRATIONS</b><table><tr><th>YEAR</th><th>YEAR TOTAL</th></tr><tr><td>2009-2015</td><td>31,573</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>2,902</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>2,594</td></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>2,976</td></tr><tr><td>2019 (to date)</td><td>18,563</td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL</td><td>58,608</td></tr></table></p></reply>

It has both a prudential and a consumer protection dimension to it. It was transposed into Irish law as the European Union (Insurance and Reinsurance) Regulations 2015 (S.I. 485 of 2015) and the legislation entered into force on 1 January 2016.</p>  <p>  As stated in the recitals for the Directive, &ldquo;the protection of policy holders presupposes that insurance and reinsurance undertakings are subject to effective solvency requirements that result in an efficient allocation of capital across the European Union&rdquo;. Furthermore, &ldquo;the main objective of insurance and reinsurance regulation and supervision is the adequate protection of policy holders and beneficiaries. &hellip; Financial stability and fair and stable markets are other objectives of insurance and reinsurance regulation and supervision which should also be taken into account but should not undermine the main objective.&rdquo; </p>  <p>  The Solvency II framework sets out strengthened requirements around capital, governance and risk management in all EU authorised (re)insurance undertakings. It also introduces increased regulatory reporting requirements and public disclosure requirements. The new requirements are intended to reduce the likelihood of an insurer failing and therefore is designed to provide policyholders with increased protection.</p>  <p>  In addition to Solvency II, Section 117 of the Central Bank Act 1989 provides that the Central Bank may produce a Consumer Protection Code for institutions that it licences, after consultation with the Minister for Finance. As the Deputy is aware, the provisions of this Code are binding on regulated entities and must, at all times, be complied with when providing financial services.</p></reply>

Nonetheless, to try and be as helpful to the Deputy as possible, Insurance Europe, the European (re)insurance federation, produces reports on an ongoing basis regarding the insurance industry across Europe. For example, the European Insurance in Figures (2017 data) and the European Motor Insurance Markets, both published in early 2019, contain some useful comparative information in respect of insurance costs up to 2017. The European Insurance &mdash; Key Facts report published in October 2018, graphs the average premium level across European countries for a variety of insurance products for the year 2017. The varying levels of premiums across Europe are accounted for by a wide range of regulatory, risk and economic factors which differ across European jurisdictions.</p>  <p>  In relation to insurance costs, it was noted by the Personal Injuries Commission in their reports that it was not possible to have meaningful comparisons to the European data (excluding the UK) regarding award levels (which are a key driver for insurance costs) as this information was not provided to them or available at a sufficiently granular level. However, I acknowledge that both insurance costs and award levels for personal injuries in Ireland are much higher than in our European counterparts. This is why the work of the Cost of Insurance Working Group (CIWG) is so important.</p>  <p>  The CIWG, which was established in July 2016, and which produced two reports, is continuing to work to implement the recommendations of the Cost of Motor Insurance Report and the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance Report.  Its most recent Progress Update, the Ninth, was published in July 2019 and shows that the vast majority of recommendations and actions due by Q2 2019 have been completed.</p>  <p>  I believe that these reforms are having a significant impact with regard to private motor insurance (CSO figures from August 2019 show that the price of motor insurance is now 24% lower than the July 2016 peak).  The Government is determined to keep working to ensure that these positive pricing trends continue and can be extended to other forms of insurance.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-10-03a.194.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019100300048#WRD03600"><p>I am advised by Revenue that, similar to the position that applies in the case of other taxes and duties, penalties can be imposed for various offences relating to local property tax (LPT), such as failure to submit a return or other documentation or the provision of false information. Thus, all taxpayers who fail to submit an LPT return, or who submit an incorrect LPT return, are liable to a penalty of the amount of the LPT that would be payable with a correct return, subject to a maximum penalty of &euro;3,000.</p>  <p>  In the normal course of events, a self-employed person is penalised for the late submission (or non-submission) of an income tax return by the imposition of a surcharge on his or her income tax liability. However, a self-employed person who has submitted his or her income tax return on time can also be liable to an income tax surcharge in respect of the late submission of his or her LPT return or the failure to pay LPT.  Where such a person has not submitted his or her LPT return by the time that he or she submits an income tax return, the income tax liability is increased by 10% up to a maximum increase of &euro;63,485.  However, where the LPT return is subsequently submitted and the associated LPT liability is paid, the income tax surcharge is capped at the amount of the LPT liability.</p>  <p>  Unlike self-employed taxpayers, PAYE taxpayers are not generally required to submit an annual income tax return. Therefore, it is not possible to impose a similar type surcharge on PAYE taxpayers for failure to submit an LPT return on time. While PAYE taxpayers and self-employed taxpayers are treated the same in terms of the amount of their LPT liability, the same treatment is not necessary, and not always possible, in relation to how Revenue addresses non-compliance by such taxpayers.  Revenue&rsquo;s compliance actions are tailored according to the type of taxpayer involved and the most effective way to ensure compliance. This is illustrated by the use of the facility to enforce the collection of LPT liabilities from PAYE taxpayers through mandatory deduction at source from a PAYE taxpayer&rsquo;s salary or pension.  As such an enforcement option can apply in the case of PAYE taxpayers, it is considered that linking non-compliance with LPT by self-employed persons with a surcharge on their income tax liabilities is both fair and proportionate.  </p>  <p>  Given the relatively low level of LPT liability for most property owners, the application of a 10% surcharge on a self-employed person&rsquo;s LPT liability alone would be unlikely to act as an effective deterrent to non-compliance.  As I have already stated, having incurred a surcharge, a self-employed person has the opportunity to cap the surcharge at the amount of the LPT liability due by submitting an LPT return and/or paying the LPT liability.  Compliance is not just about ensuring the submission of returns and the payment of outstanding tax liabilities; there is also a timing aspect to compliance.  Returns must be submitted and payments must be made by specified dates.  It is considered that reducing a surcharge or penalty to nil following the late submission of returns or payments would serve only to incentivise such late submission. </p>  <p>  Finally, it should be noted that the vast majority of property owners pay their LPT on time. There is no reason for property owners to put themselves in a position where they become liable to a penalty or surcharge.  If an individual has particular financial circumstances which cause difficulties in meeting his or her LPT liability, he or she may be entitled to a deferral of the tax or may avail of one of a number of payment methods to discharge the liability evenly over the course of the year. </p></reply>

The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is in regular contact with all other Departments and Offices including the Department of Health to monitor expenditure projections against Departmental allocations and also within the overall fiscal parameters. Each month, the drawdown of funds from the Exchequer is reported against published expenditure profiles in the Fiscal Monitor, published by the Department of Finance.</p>  <p>  While these monthly returns figures are still marginally under profile at end-September, the Minister for Health has signalled that there are significant pressures on his allocation this year and these issues are forming part of the Budget 2020 discussions. The estimated level of the supplementary estimate will be outlined in the course of the upcoming budgetary process, as is usual. </p>  <p>  However I have highlighted repeatedly to Minister Harris the need for staffing, PCRS and savings measures to be proactively managed by the Department of Health to ensure that there is no repeat of the magnitude of  last year's overrun. The range of new leadership and governance measures that have been put in place, including the appointment of a new CEO and Governance Board for the HSE, are important factors in ensuring the effective, professional management of Health spending in line with the allocations that have been authorised by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, in order to deliver progressively improved health outcomes for the citizens of our country.</p></reply>

This approach is beneficial for the State because it nurtures competition which ensures value for money is maintained and provides SME with a platform to take advantage of similar opportunities in Ireland and across the European Union.</p><p>Specifically, the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) have developed a suite of measures (circular 10/14) aimed at assisting SMEs to access public procurement opportunities. These include:</p><p>- Proportionate financial capacity criterion (turnover requirements limited to twice contract value); </p><p>- Contracting Authorities are encouraged to divide larger public contracts into lots;</p><p>- Provision for &ldquo;consortia bidding&rdquo; to assist SMEs to participate in procurement procedures where they would not have the relevant capability or scale; and</p><p>- Public bodies are required to advertise contracts for goods and services valued above &euro;25,000 on the national eTenders portal. </p><p>In addition, Minister of State Patrick O&rsquo;Donovan, who has responsibility for public procurement, chairs quarterly meetings of the SME Advisory Group, ensuring that the voice of Irish SMEs (including ISME, IBEC, SFA, Chambers Ireland, and CIF) is heard by Government.  </p><p>The OGP proactively engages with the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Inter-Trade Ireland and Enterprise Ireland to promote SME access to public procurement. The OGP participates at &quot;Go-2-Tender&quot; workshops and &quot;Meet the Buyer&quot; events which are also designed to help SMEs. </p><p>A series of information videos explaining specific public procurement topics, along with case studies of SMEs who have won government contracts, was launched by Minister of State O&rsquo;Donovan earlier this year.  A series of focused and targeted breakfast briefings has also been scheduled around the country in conjunction with Inter-Trade Ireland and the SME Advisory Group partners.</p><p>Currently, data on the award of public contracts does not generally capture the size of businesses that are successful. However, analysis carried and published by the OGP in the &quot;Public Service Spend and Tendering Analysis for 2016&quot; indicates that 94% of the analysed expenditure is with firms within the State and that the majority of the spend analysed is with SMEs. This was based on an analysis of &euro;4.723 billion expenditure across 77 public service bodies.  </p><p>The OGP will continue to proactively engage with business and strive to enhance the significant measures already in place to support SME access to public procurement opportunities.</p></reply>

This is due to the evidenced success for learners on the programme and the fact that many participants have now progressed onwards to commencing an apprenticeship.</p>  <p>  In addition, in May the Apprenticeship Council held a consultation with 47 employer representatives and other key stakeholders on &lsquo;Generation Apprenticeship &ndash; What&rsquo;s Next?&rsquo; The objective of this event was to gather feedback and ideas on the next steps in expansion of apprenticeship nationally.

Since it was launched in September 2013 it has grown quickly with a total of 164,000 subscribers and in the order of 3 million text messages sent annually.

An underlying aim of the review is to ensure that administration of civil justice in Ireland is able to respond to changing values and attitudes in our society and to promote equal access to justice.</p>  <p>  These initiatives build on the reforms put in place by the Mediation Act 2017 which encourages the use of mediation as an alternative to court based proceedings, with a view to achieving outcomes that respond to the needs of parties thereby reducing the potential cost of litigation.  Legislation is currently in preparation on a family court system which will also support the pursuit of alternative dispute resolution options, thereby helping to reduce costs.</p></reply>

It is a matter for the Commissioner to efficiently manage the significant resources which have been provided and to determine the allocation of budgets to all regions, including the Northern Region and all Divisions, including Cavan/ Monaghan Division, based upon operational requirements. </p><p>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the following table outlines the vehicles assigned to the Cavan/Monaghan Division in 2018 and to date in 2019.<table><tr><th>2019</th><th>Cars</th><th>Vans</th><th>4 x 4</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>CAVAN   MONAGHAN DIVISION</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>MONAGHAN   DISTRICT</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr></table><table><tr><th>2018</th><th>Cars</th><th>Vans</th><th>4 x 4</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>CAVAN   MONAGHAN DIVISION</td><td>6</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>BAILEBORO   DISTRICT</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>CARRICKMACROSS   DISTRICT</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>CAVAN   DISTRICT</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>MONAGHAN   DISTRICT</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>2</td></tr></table></p><p>I should also point out that a total of &euro;10 million has been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the purchase and fit-out of Garda vehicles in 2019. I understand from Garda management that this allocation is being used for the purchase and fit-out of over 300 for operational use in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The allocation of these new vehicles across the Garda Divisions is for Garda management and not for me as Minister. </p><p>I would also point out that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is a growing organisation. We currently have over 14,200 Garda&iacute; nationwide, supported by over 2,700 Garda staff. And as part of the Government&rsquo;s plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021, there is ongoing and increased recruitment both of new Garda&iacute; as well as Garda staff, allowing for redeployment of Garda&iacute; to operational duties at the front-line. Since the reopening of the Garda Training College in 2014, approximately 2,800 new Garda members have attested and been assigned to frontline policing duties in communities throughout the country. Another 200 probationer Garda&iacute; are due to attest by the end of this year. Further, the Garda Commissioner&rsquo;s decision to recruit a net 600 Garda staff in 2019 will allow for the redeployment of approximately 500 experienced Garda&iacute; to frontline and visible policing duties by the end of this year. </p><p>As part of this overall increase, additional Garda resources have been deployed to border areas in recent months and this process is continuing.  I am advised by the Garda Commissioner that as of 31 August 2019, there were 372 Gardai assigned to the Cavan/Monaghan Division, which represents a 17% increase since the end of 2015. These Gardai are supported by 44 Garda Staff, as of the same date. Since the reopening of the Garda College in 2014, 100 probationer Gardai have been assigned to the Cavan/Monaghan Division, including 35 in 2018 and 25 to date in 2019. </p><p>In the event that a &quot;no deal&quot; Brexit gives rise to additional requirements in border areas, the Commissioner has confirmed that further resources can and will be provided through redeployment.</p></reply>

Under the terms of the Scheme, the Tribunal is limited to a Chair and 6 ordinary members who provide services on a part-time basis. It is entirely independent in the matter of individual decisions on applications for compensation.</p>  <p>  I can confirm that five Departmental staff act as Secretariat to the Tribunal. These staff receive applications and gather the necessary information from applicants and other stakeholders such as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to each case. When all required information is available, Tribunal staff send the file to the Tribunal for consideration and decision. Where a decision is appealed, Tribunal staff make arrangements for a Tribunal appeal hearing.</p>  <p>  In terms of the duration of the process, I should note that it may take several years before an application for compensation is ready for submission to the Tribunal for consideration and decision. For example final Garda reports on the crime are required, as are the outcomes of any court cases initiated. In addition, in some cases the extent of injuries suffered by the victim may not be known for some years. It is also the case that the assessment of loss of earnings for consideration by the Tribunal may be complex to determine and may require employer assessment and social welfare reports. These and other factors can have an impact on the duration of any particular application. </p>  <p>  An assessment is currently being carried out by officials of my Department in relation to caseload in the scheme, including the extent and nature of any possible backlog. The assessment is currently being finalised by my officials.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy may be interested to know that in its fifth work programme, published in March 2019, the Law Reform Commission included a review of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme as one of 15 planned projects.  I welcome this project as an opportunity for a comprehensive examination of all aspects of this long-established Scheme, to ensure that the State&rsquo;s arrangements for the compensation of victims of violent crime are in keeping with good international practice and meet society's needs into the future.</p></reply>

The Deputy will be aware that insolvent persons seeking legal advice and assistance in relation to repossession proceedings against their home may be able to avail of such advice through the Abhaile scheme.  This free mortgage arrears support service was launched by the Government in October 2016.</p><p>Abhaile is not focused on bringing challenges to repossession proceedings because in most cases this will not help the borrower. Instead, Abhaile focuses on solving the borrower&rsquo;s substantive problem, by putting in place a solution to the arrears themselves, keeping the borrower in their home and helping them back to solvency. </p><p>In relation to the focus of the Deputy's question on legal aid applications, it is possible to apply for legal aid from the Legal Aid Board to defend repossession proceedings under the normal rules relating to civil legal aid. Borrowers who wish to do this must meet the financial eligibility and merits criteria prescribed under the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995 and the Civil Legal Aid Regulations 1996 to 2017.  The principal financial eligibility criteria are that the applicant must have disposable income of less than &euro;18,000 per annum and disposable capital assets of less than &euro;100,000 (excluding the home in which they live). </p><p>In the past, it may have been difficult for applications for legal aid in connection with defending repossession proceedings to satisfy the merits criteria for civil legal aid in circumstances where the applicant accepts that the debt (i.e. the unpaid home loan) is owed to the Plaintiff lending institution and falls due to be paid and there is no legal defence available. The Deputy will be aware of the added protections conferred under the recently enacted Land and Conveyancing Law Reform (Amendment) Act 2019, however, it remains to be seen how the courts will interpret the new legislation.</p><p>Under Abhaile, by contrast, the borrower can obtain free independent financial advice and negotiation assistance from a Personal Insolvency Practitioner, a MABS Dedicated Mortgage Arrears adviser, and/or an accountant. The service includes detailed analysis of the borrower&rsquo;s individual financial situation and home mortgage arrears, identifying their best option to resolve their arrears with priority given to remaining in their home wherever possible, and negotiation assistance to put a solution into place.  </p><p>Since the Abhaile service began in July 2016 and, as of 23rd September 2019, 3,763 vouchers for a legal advice consultation in relation to potential solutions to mortgage arrears (which may include advice in relation to the defence of possession proceedings) have been issued. A duty solicitor service is in place at county registrars&rsquo; courts for repossession proceedings and almost 8,000 people have availed of that service. It is important to note that persons availing of the Abhaile service do not have to meet any financial eligibility criteria, save that they are insolvent and at risk of losing their home, nor do they have to pay a contribution.  This is a far more sustainable and effective focus for public intervention &ndash; both more effective for borrowers, and better for taxpayers.</p></reply>

No. 569 of 2011). The application fee, stipulated at &euro;175, is payable on application for a certificate of naturalisation, and a certification fee is payable on the issue of a certificate of naturalisation. The standard certification fee is &euro;950, while a reduced fee of &euro;200 applies in the case of an application made on behalf of a minor or in certain cases where the application is made by a widow, widower or surviving civil partner of an Irish citizen. In the case of recognised refugees and stateless persons the certification fee is nil. Therefore, in relation to the cost of applying for and receiving a certificate of naturalisation there is no cost to a person recognised as a refugee under the International Protection Act 2015. </p>  <p>  There is no provision in the Regulations for the discretionary waiver or reduction of fees, or for differing fees to apply to different nationalities, pensioners or based on length of residency. While the operation of the Act is kept under review, there are no plans to amend the fees as they are comparable with other jurisdictions.  </p>  <p>   The standard fees payable by an applicant are designed to reflect the effort and cost involved in processing applications for a certificate of naturalisation. Formal citizenship ceremonies have been introduced at no extra cost to applicants. These have been universally well received by participants as the ceremonies provide a sense of dignity and occasion that serves to underscore the importance to both the State and the applicant of the granting of Irish citizenship.</p>  <p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the Immigration Service of my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

The new Tribunal will deal with allegations of serious misconduct by both solicitors and barristers and will replace the existing bodies which currently operate for that purpose and will be winding-down their existing caseloads. Extensive preparations have been ongoing at the Legal Services Regulatory Authority to put the necessary procedural, staffing, IT and other supports in place with the intention of being in a position to receive and process public complaints from next week subject to the formal completion of the relevant Commencement Order to that effect. At that point, members of the public will no longer make their complaints through the legal professional bodies as they do at present but directly to the Authority while the new Disciplinary Tribunal will come into operation in its own right. Details of the relevant public complaints procedures will be made available by the Authority including on its website www.lsra.ie when they come into operation.</p>  <p>  Next week should also see the introduction of the new legal costs transparency regime set out in Part 10 of the 2015 Act including, separately, the transition of the Office of the Taxing-Master to that of the Legal Costs Adjudicators which will maintain a publicly accessible Register of its legal costs determinations. Similarly, the roll-out of Legal Partnerships and Limited Liability Partnerships will take place. The new professional conduct regime being introduced under Part 6 will, therefore, underpin the new legal costs and other obligations that will apply to legal practitioners being regulated under the 2015 Act. Again, as Minister I will be supporting the imminent roll-out of these functions with the commencement of the relevant statutory provisions.</p></reply>

That is why my Department and its agencies have put in place extensive supports, schemes and advisory resources to ensure that to ensure that businesses around the country are prepared for Brexit. These measures aim to assist businesses in identifying and managing key risk areas and develop practical preparatory actions regardless of the circumstances of the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU. </p><p>My Department&rsquo;s total exchequer allocation increased by 9.1% year on year, up from &euro;871m in 2018 to &euro;950.2m for this year. This is made up of a record &euro;620m in capital and &euro;330.2m in current funding, which includes an increase of &euro;65m in capital &ndash; up 11.7% on last year&rsquo;s allocation of &euro;555m; and, an increase of &euro;14.2m in current funding &ndash; almost 4.5% more than our 2018 allocation of &euro;316m.</p><p>I allocated an additional &euro;5m to the network of Local Enterprise Offices, &euro;3m to Enterprise Ireland, &euro;2m to IDA Ireland and &euro;1m to InterTradeIreland to help businesses prepare for Brexit, together with funding for the longer-term Future Growth Loan Scheme and the IDA Regional Property Programme. I also provided extra staff for the regulatory bodies of my Department to ensure they are properly resourced to address the additional demands that Brexit will create.</p><p>The Local Enterprise Offices [LEOs] are the first-stop-shop for anyone seeking guidance and support on starting or growing their business. The LEOs have organised various events to enable companies to learn about the potential impacts and opportunities of Brexit. </p><p>In addition, 1,017 LEO clients have received one-to-one mentoring solely focused on Brexit. Technical Assistance Grants for Micro Export are offered as an incentive for LEO clients to explore and develop new market opportunities. 729 LEO clients have been approved for the Technical Assistance Grant. </p><p>The Local Enterprise Office interactive one day Prepare Your Business for Customs workshop helps businesses understand the key customs concepts, documentation and processes required to succeed in a post Brexit environment. 917 Participants have so far attended this Customs Training.</p><p>InterTrade Ireland also plays a major role as part of Ireland&rsquo;s Brexit response and offers Brexit-related advisory services to eligible businesses. So far this year, more than 4,500 SMEs have directly engaged with the Brexit Advisory Service.  </p><p>ITI offers a Brexit Planning Voucher and Brexit Implementation Voucher schemes, which enables businesses to get professional advice on how best to plan, prepare and implement for the UK's withdrawal from the European Union. These supports help businesses obtain advice on specific areas such as tariffs, currency management, regulatory and customs issues and movement of labour, goods and services. </p><p>ITI Brexit Start to Plan vouchers are worth up to &euro;2,250 (inclusive of VAT) each. Over 1,800 businesses have applied for a Brexit Start to Plan voucher, of which over 1,600 have been approved. ITI new Brexit Implementation Voucher provides financial support up to &pound;5,000/&euro;5,625 (inclusive of VAT), with InterTradeIreland paying 50%. This will allow businesses to implement critical changes making them better prepared to deal with a new trading relationship.</p><p>In August, ITI launched a new advertising campaign and a new online resource to encourage and assist firms in preparing for Brexit. The online &ldquo;Bitesize Brexit&rdquo; resource is a one-stop-shop for cross-border traders, presenting information in easily digestible segments and includes specific actions businesses should take in preparing for Brexit.</p><p>The Brexit Loan Scheme was launched in March of 2018. The Scheme, using a combination of Irish Exchequer and EU guarantees, leveraged up to &euro;300 million of lending at a maximum interest rate 4% at a cost to the Exchequer of &euro;23 million - &euro;14 million provided by my Department and &euro;9 million provided by Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p><p>The Brexit Loan Scheme provides relatively short-term working capital, 1 to 3 years, to eligible businesses with up to 499 employees to help them to innovate, change or adapt to mitigate their Brexit challenges. Businesses can confirm their eligibility with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) and, if deemed eligible, can apply to one of the participating finance providers for a loan under the scheme.  </p><p>As at 27 September, there have been 816 applications for eligibility under the scheme, of which 738 have been approved to date by SBCI. 194 of those applications have progressed to sanction at bank value, to a total value of &euro;43.52 million.</p><p>The Future Growth Loan Scheme launched in March of this year. The scheme provides a longer-term facility, 8 to 10 years, of up to &euro;300m to support strategic capital investment for a post-Brexit environment by business at competitive rates. This scheme is jointly funded by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation (&euro;37.2 million) and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (&euro;24.8 million) at a total cost to the Exchequer of &euro;62 million. </p><p>This scheme is available to eligible businesses in Ireland and the primary agriculture (farmers) and seafood sectors to support strategic long-term investment. The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, the scheme operator, opened for eligibility applications on 17 April and up to 27 September it had received 1,353 eligibility applications and issued 1,283 eligibility letters.</p><p>Enterprise Ireland has established a Prepare for Brexit online portal and communications campaign, as well as an online &ldquo;Brexit SME Scorecard&rdquo; to help Irish businesses self-asses their exposure to Brexit and a &ldquo;Be Prepared Grant&rdquo; to support SME clients in planning to mitigate risks arising from Brexit. It has also launched a new Eurozone Strategy to help SMEs broaden their export footprint beyond the UK.</p><p>Over 6,500 business have used Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Brexit Scorecard to date and 85% of EI client firms have a plan in place, while 216 applications for the Be Prepared grant have been approved. 288 EI clients have received funding under its &ldquo;Act On&rdquo; programme, which supports the engagement of a consultant to help clients identify weaknesses and improve resilience. EI has also hosted 16 Brexit Advisory Clinics. </p><p>EI also launched a Customs Insights Online course at the beginning of the year. This is a new online training support to help all businesses understand how customs work including the documentation and process required to operate and succeed post Brexit. The Customs Insights course explains in clear and simple terms the main customs rules and included the key actions companies can take to prepare for customs after Brexit and the options from Revenue that are available to make the customs process more efficient. This will be available for any company to use whether they are importers or exporters and also whether they are agency clients or not. There have been over 1,700 Customs Insights Course participants.</p><p>Enterprise Ireland also recently published 12 &lsquo;Brexit Essential&rsquo; questions aimed at helping exporting businesses further prepare and take action ahead of the UK&rsquo;s impending withdrawal from the EU.  The Brexit Essentials campaign highlights the key questions and documentation that businesses need to address in order to trade successfully with the UK post 31 October.</p><p>My Department, together with the Department of Education and Skills,  in association with key industry partners, also launched a new support measure to help customs agents, intermediaries and affected Irish businesses develop the capacity to deal with the additional customs requirements due to the UK&rsquo;s departure from the EU. The new initiative is called Clear Customs, and it comprises of a free customs training programme provided through Skillnet and a financial support payment from Enterprise Ireland to assist with the costs of recruiting and assigning staff to customs roles in addition to necessary customs IT requirements. To the 27 of September, 168 applications have been made to access financial support through the scheme.</p><p>While I have seen a very positive uptake of the supports available, I am conscious that the delays to Brexit may have led businesses to defer their immediate planning. However, the UK&rsquo;s exit from the EU will mean changes for Irish businesses. I want businesses to know that my Department and its agencies are here to help.  The existing supports, schemes and advice are in place to ensure that businesses are prepared for any Brexit scenario.</p><p>The first table attached sets out the uptake of the different Brexit-related supports available through the Department and its agencies as at 27 September 2019.</p><p>The second table attached sets out the respective exchequer increases in allocations to ITI, EI, IDA and the LEOs between 2018 and 2019 and the cost/expenditure of the supports available. Whilst these increases are not all due to Brexit, they are mainly provided to assist the enterprise agencies in their responses to the challenges posed by Brexit.</p></reply>

That is why my Department and its agencies have put in place extensive supports, schemes and advisory resources to ensure that businesses around the country are prepared for Brexit. These measures aim to assist businesses in identifying and managing key risk areas and develop practical preparatory actions regardless of the circumstances of the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU. </p><p>My Department&rsquo;s total exchequer allocation increased by 9.1% year on year, up from &euro;871m to &euro;950.2m. This is made up of a record &euro;620m in capital and &euro;330.2m in current funding, which includes an increase of &euro;65m in capital &ndash; up 11.7% on last year&rsquo;s allocation of &euro;555m; and, an increase of &euro;14.2m in current &ndash; almost 4.5% more than our 2018 allocation of &euro;316m.</p><p>I allocated an additional &euro;5m to the network of Local Enterprise Offices (LEO's), &euro;3m to Enterprise Ireland, &euro;2m to IDA Ireland and &euro;1m to InterTradeIreland to help businesses prepare for Brexit, together with funding for the longer-term Future Growth Loan Scheme and the IDA Regional Property Programme. I also provided extra staff for the regulatory bodies of my Department to ensure they are properly resourced to address the additional demands that Brexit will create.</p><p>The LEOs are the first-stop-shop for anyone seeking guidance and support on starting or growing their business. The LEOs have organised various events to enable companies to learn about the potential impacts and opportunities of Brexit. </p><p>In addition, 1,017 LEO clients have received one-to-one mentoring solely focused on Brexit. Technical Assistance Grants for Micro Export are offered as an incentive for LEO clients to explore and develop new market opportunities. 729 LEO clients have been approved for the Technical Assistance Grant. </p><p>The Local Enterprise Office interactive one day Prepare Your Business for Customs workshop helps businesses understand the key customs concepts, documentation and processes required to succeed in a post Brexit environment.  To date, 917 participants have attended this customs training.</p><p>InterTrade Ireland also plays a major role as part of Ireland&rsquo;s Brexit response and offers Brexit-related advisory services to eligible businesses. So far this year, more than 4,500 SMEs have directly engaged with the Brexit Advisory Service.  </p><p>ITI offers a Brexit Planning Voucher and Brexit Implementation Voucher schemes, which enables businesses to get professional advice on how best to plan, prepare and implement for the UK's withdrawal from the European Union. These supports help businesses obtain advice on specific areas such as tariffs, currency management, regulatory and customs issues and movement of labour, goods and services. </p><p>ITI Brexit Start to Plan vouchers are worth up to &euro;2,250 (inclusive of VAT) each. Over 1,800 businesses have applied for a Brexit Start to Plan voucher, of which over 1,600 have been approved. ITI new Brexit Implementation Voucher provides financial support up to &pound;5,000/&euro;5,625 (inclusive of VAT), with InterTradeIreland paying 50%. This will allow businesses to implement critical changes making them better prepared to deal with a new trading relationship.</p><p>In August, ITI launched a new advertising campaign and a new online resource to encourage and assist firms in preparing for Brexit.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-10-03a.350.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1249" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019100300051#WRG01600"><p>I recently attended the Informal meeting of Trade Ministers which took place on 1st October 2019 in Brussels.  Ministers discussed the critical situation in the WTO, and EU collective efforts regarding its reform and on-going negotiations.  Ministers also discussed related trade matters involving the United States.  In addition, the EU Commission updated Trade Ministers on the preparation of the third annual report on the implementation of EU trade agreements.  Finally, Ministers discussed the next steps in the EU agreement with Mercosur.</p>  <p>  In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s request for an update on recent EU trade agreements, the latest up-to-date information on specific FTAs is as follows: </p>  <p>  EU-Canada (CETA) &ndash; The 21st September marked the second anniversary of the Agreement&rsquo;s &lsquo;provisional application&rsquo;, under which EU/Irish companies gain access to the removal of customs duties and substantially improved access to the Canadian public procurement market.  CETA also opened up new sectors of the Canadian services market, reduced regulatory barriers and provided more transparent rules for market access.  Ireland already has a strong trading relationship with Canada which is reflected in the &euro;3.2 billion worth of annual trade between both countries.  The value of Irish exports to Canada is worth &euro;2.4 billion whilst the value of Irish imports from Canada is worth &euro;780 million.  </p>  <p>  EU-Japan - The EU-Japan Economic Partnership (EPA) was signed in Tokyo on the 17th July 2018.  The European Parliament and Japan's National Diet voted to ratify the EPA in December 2018 and the Agreement entered into force on 1st February 2019.  The Agreement provides for tariff reductions to be delivered on a phased basis over a period of up to 15 years.  It will open up new opportunities for Irish exporters and companies across a wide range of sectors, including the agri-food sector, which will see particular benefits with new access for dairy products and beef.  It will also facilitate greater ease in doing business in the financial services, med-tech, and green energy sectors and across the full range of trade interests that Ireland and Japan share.  The Agreement also creates opportunities for Irish-based manufacturers in our pharmaceutical sector through an expansion of existing Mutual Recognition Agreement (MRA) on Good Manufacturing Practice to cover new pharmaceutical products.</p>  <p>  EU-Singapore - The EU-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (FTA) was signed by the EU and Singapore at the 12th Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) Summit on 19th October 2018.  The FTA was ratified by the European Parliament on 12th   February 2019.  The aim is for the FTA to enter into force during 2019.  The deal goes beyond many previously negotiated free trade accords in committing to open up public procurement, an area where the EU and Ireland has many leading suppliers, and agreeing on technical standards in areas such as motor vehicles, electronics and green technologies.  Irish-owned SMEs are developing strong trade links with Singapore and this trade is growing steadily.  </p>  <p>  EU-Vietnam &ndash; An FTA was successfully negotiated with Vietnam in 2015.  The European Commission and Vietnam signed the deal on the 30th   June 2019 in Hanoi.  The hope is that it will be ratified by the European Parliament during 2019.  The EU-Vietnam FTA will eliminate over 99% of tariffs and will unlock a market with huge potential for Irish exports.  The FTA will also create opportunities by addressing other barriers to trade and will address trade-related areas such as public procurement, regulatory issues, competition, services, investment, intellectual property rights, and sustainable development.  The Agreement creates opportunities for the Irish Agri-food sector, in particular. Ireland's food exports to Vietnam have grown considerably in recent years and the FTA will support further growth.  There are opportunities for Ireland to grow exports in dairy products, pork, seafood, and alcoholic beverages by taking advantage of reduced tariffs under the FTA.  Currently tariffs on EU exports of spirits to Vietnam are particularly high at 48% and will be eliminated under the FTA. The elimination of tariffs of 15% on frozen pork products is also significant for Irish producers.</p>  <p>  EU-Mexico - On the 21st   April 2018, the EU and Mexico announced that they had reached Political Agreement in their negotiations to modernise the existing EU-Mexico Global Agreement to broaden its scope to include regulatory cooperation, more trade in agriculture and food, common phytosanitary standards (food safety and animal and plant health), sustainable development, rules of origin, public procurement.  The EU and Mexico hope to finalise the full legal text before the end of the year.  The final text will be reviewed by lawyers from both parties, a process called &ldquo;legal scrubbing&rdquo;.  After this, the agreement will be submitted for the approval of EU Member States and of the European Parliament before signature.  The Agreement will provide a platform to increase Irish exports to Mexico, this will be significant for Ireland&rsquo;s important Agri-food sector especially for dairy, pork and beef products.  Ireland is a significant exporter to Mexico of powdered milk and milk derivatives.  There are also many exciting opportunities in Mexico for Irish businesses including in the automotive, aeronautics, electronics, financial and telecommunications sector.</p>  <p>  EU-Mercosur - The EU recently reached political agreement in their negotiations with the Mercosur region (Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, and Paraguay).  The EU-Mercosur Agreement is the EU&rsquo;s largest trade deal to date.  The Agreement covers a population of over 770 million with trade in goods and services valued at &euro;122 billion.  It aims to reduced and, in some areas, eliminate trade tariffs between the EU and the Mercosur region.  In 2018, Ireland exported &euro;0.5 billion worth of goods to the Mercosur region.  In 2017 &ndash; the latest year for which data is available &ndash; services exports to Mercosur totalled almost &euro;1.5 billion.  Trade with this region has grown by 19% in the period 2010 to 2016.  The EU-Mercosur Agreement will, we anticipate, allow Irish exporters to expand faster, and will open opportunities across a wide range of sectors &ndash; in business services, chemicals, machinery, medical devices and processed food and dairy.  This Agreement will see a significant reduction or elimination of tariffs and barriers to trade that will allow a cross flow of trading and investment between Ireland and the rest of the EU, and the Mercosur region.  The EU-Mercosur Free Trade Agreement will make exports from Ireland more attractive and potentially increase the demand for Irish products.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware from Debates in this House before the summer Recess, the TRQ agreed in respect of beef is more than we would have wished for.  Equally, there was much debate about the environmental sustainability elements of the Agreement.  </p>  <p>  The final text of the Agreement will be reviewed by lawyers from both parties, a process called &ldquo;legal scrubbing&rdquo; and translated into the various EU and Mercosur languages.  After this, the agreement will be submitted for the approval of EU Member States and of the European Parliament before signature - a process we believe will take 2 years based on previous FTAs.  </p>  <p>  The Government has committed to a full independent economic impact analysis, and to an environmental impact assessment of the deal, in the meantime.</p>  <p>EU-Australia - Negotiations for an FTA with Australia commenced in July 2018.  Four rounds of negotiations have been held with the most recent taking place 1st-5th July 2019.  The fifth round is scheduled to take place the week commencing the 14th October.  Good progress has been made across many areas to date, however, more challenging discussions are also anticipated on sensitive issues such as recognition of the EU&rsquo;s Geographic Indicators for food and beverages, and in finding agreement on the structure of tariff offers.  </p>  <p>  EU-New Zealand &ndash; Negotiations for an FTA with New Zealand also commenced in 2018. To date there have been four rounds of negotiations with the most recent taking place from 13th-17th May 2019 in Wellington. Overall, progress has been constructive with some chapters capable of being closed and the negotiation continuing with the date of the next round yet to be agreed.  </p>  <p>  EU-Chile &ndash; Negotiations for a trade agreement with Chile were launched in November 2017.  There have been four rounds of discussions to date, the latest taking place in Santiago de Chile 1&ndash; 5 April 2019. Over the course of the round the negotiating teams discussed all the issues covered by the Agreement.  </p>  <p>  EU- Indonesia - The first FTA negotiations with Indonesia took place in September 2016.  The eighth round of negotiations took place in Jakarta from 17th-21st   June 2019.  The negotiations are approximately at the half-way point.  Good progress has been made in a number of areas, however, more challenging discussions lie ahead.  The ninth round of negotiations is expected to be held in early December 2019. </p>  <p>  In relation to EU-US discussion on trade, on the 25th July 2018, European Commission President Juncker and President Trump met in Washington to launch a new phase in the close friendship and strong trade relations between the United States and the European Union.  They agreed a Joint EU-US Statement to:</p>  <p>  -  work together toward zero tariffs, zero non-tariff barriers, and zero subsidies (on non-auto industrial goods) and to work to reduce barriers and increase trade in services, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, medical products, as well as soybeans,</p>  <p>  -  strengthen strategic energy cooperation to potentially increase US imports of (LNG) to diversify the EU&rsquo;s energy supply,</p>  <p>  -  launch a close dialogue on standards to ease trade barriers, reduce bureaucratic obstacles, and slash costs, and</p>  <p>  -  work closely together with like-minded partners to reform the WTO and to address unfair trading practices, including intellectual property theft, forced technology transfer, industrial subsidies, distortions created by state owned enterprises, and overcapacity.</p>  <p>  An EU-US Executive Working Group (EWG), was established on foot of the July joint statement, co-chaired by EU Trade Commissioner Cecelia Malmstr&ouml;m and the US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, as the vehicle for carrying forward this joint agenda.  The EWG has met over a dozen occasions most recently in New York on 24th   September 2019.</p>  <p>  On 15th April 2019, the EU Council voted by qualified majority to approve the negotiating directives for the commencement of trade negotiations with the US in the sectors of conformity assessment and the removal of tariffs on industrial goods.  The approval of the negotiating directives was a key step on the road to a possible future limited trade agreement between the EU and US.</p>  <p>  On 25th July 2019 the European Commission released a progress report &ndash; available on the DG Trade website - on the work of the EWG in delivering on the EU-US Joint Statement July 2018. Entitled &ldquo;Greater together: Slashing billions in industrial tariffs and boosting transatlantic trade&rdquo;, this is the second progress report since the formation of the EWG.  The report underlines the fact that there has been concrete progress made in EU-US trading relationship in the areas of conformity assessment (full implementation of the Mutual Recognition Agreement on Pharmaceuticals) and cooperation on increasing EU purchasing of US soya beans.  There have also been positive conversations around medical devices and cybersecurity.  While these areas of progress are encouraging, no progress had been achieved in the area of Industrial Goods. The USTR has made clear to Commissioner Malmstr&ouml;m that the US will not engage on this strand as a future deal will not be acceptable to Congress, without Agriculture being included.  The relevant EU Negotiating Directive, or mandate, drawn up in accordance with the July 2018 agreement between the US and EU Commission Presidents, makes clear that Agriculture is not comprehended by the discussions.  Therefore, progress on Conformity Assessment is certainly more achievable, but more engagement with the US is required.  </p>  <p>  US &ldquo;Section 232&rdquo; tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from the EU remain in place.  Additionally, President Trump delayed by 6 months, to November 2019, the imposition of tariffs on automotive and automotive parts imports from the EU to allow US trade officials to attempt to negotiate a solution to what the US sees as a matter of national security &ndash; that is, that the importation of autos and auto-parts is a threat to US national security, a position the EU cannot accept.  While the US has signalled its view the commencement of a new EU Commission term in November 2019 is an opportunity to re-engage on trade matters, the EU have been clear that there is no mandate from Member States to revisit the existing Negotiating Directives to discuss agriculture. </p>  <p>  While the position of both parties regarding agriculture remains a barrier to significant progress in terms of negotiating an agreement on industrial goods, there has been progress both through the aforementioned EWG and the recent renegotiation of the &ldquo;Hilton&rdquo; Beef quota between the EU and US.  This agreement does not change the overall volume, quality or safety of beef imported into the EU; rather it allocates a larger share of the WTO quota (35,000 tonnes out of a total of 45,000 tonnes) to the United States, phased in over a period of 7 years.  The quota was an interim solution put in place some years ago to address a longstanding dispute between the EU and the US regarding the EU&rsquo;s ban on the importation of hormone beef into the EU.  This agreement regarding the redistribution of the Hilton Quota is the result of considerable negotiations between all interested countries.</p>  <p>  In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s Question regarding proposed duties on EU imports, these relate to cases where both the EU and the US have been found at fault by the WTO in relation to providing certain subsidies to their aircraft manufacturers, Airbus and Boeing, respectively.  In that regard, the WTO this week published their Arbitration findings in the Airbus case which effectively authorised the US to apply retaliatory measures up to the value of $7.5 billion annually against the EU.  As this dispute relates to the aircraft manufacturing sector, the primary target for US remedial tariffs would be aircraft manufacturing, however, the US can apply retaliatory measures to a wider range of goods exported by EU Member States.</p>  <p>  As International Trade Policy is a competence of the EU Commission under the EU Treaties, the EU Commission takes the lead on this issue taking into account the views of individual Member States and the collective good of the Union.  Therefore, Ireland continues to be engaged with the Commission, both at a Ministerial and Official level on these issues. Indeed, as recently as Tuesday of this week, I attended the EU Council of Trade Ministers&rsquo; meeting in Brussels where, among other items, EU Ministers discussed our concerns on these Aircraft cases and I articulated Ireland&rsquo;s particular concerns.  In that regard, the European Commission has consistently communicated to the US that the EU is ready to work with them to agree on a fair and balanced solution for our respective aircraft industries.  As recently as this July, the EU shared concrete proposals with the US for a new regime on aircraft subsidies, and a way forward on existing compliance obligations on both sides, to avoid a round of tit-for-tar tariffs as the EU will have a similar option against the US in some 6/9 months when an Arbitrator determines the quantum of damage to EU industry US subsidies to Boeing has caused. So far, regretfully, the US has not engaged. Nonetheless, Ireland&rsquo;s preference, as I and my Government colleagues as well as my officials have articulated, along with the EU, is for a negotiated settlement to be reached on these issues.</p>  <p>  Initial analysis by my Department of the US list of products on which it proposes to apply tariffs on foot of the Airbus Arbitration findings published this week is that Irish exporters of certain cheese products, pork products, butter and Irish Cream Liqueurs will be subject to additional import duties of 25%.  On the other hand, despite earlier lists published by the US, Irish Whiskey appears not to be included among the current measures.</p>  <p>  My Department has engaged with colleagues in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, as well as industry and its Enterprise Agencies in relation to the implications for Irish business of the US proposals here.  In parallel, Government has highlighted our concerns in bilateral engagements with US interlocuters in Dublin and Washington, intensively over recent months. The issue of the tariffs was also raised during the US Presidential and Vice-Presidential visits this year.  I and my officials, as well as colleagues in the Department of Foreign Affairs &amp;amp; Trade and Agriculture, Food &amp;amp; the Marine, continue in contact with our US counterparts in Dublin and Washington on these issues.</p>  <p>  Our position remains that the mutual imposition of sanctions will only inflict damage on businesses and citizens on both sides of the Atlantic and harm global trade and the broader aviation industry at a sensitive time.  Ireland does not want to see this escalation at this time.</p></reply>

However, the Council noted that cost pressures are evident in some areas including the labour market, credit, business services and residential property. </p>  <p>  Examining our price level index, an indicator of aggregate prices relative to the EU average that is deflated by GDP, Ireland had the 5th highest prices in the European Union, behind Denmark, Finland, Luxemburg and Sweden. In 2018, Ireland&rsquo;s purchasing power parities price level index was 13.3 percent higher than the EU average. Nevertheless, prices in Ireland increased by 0.7% in 2018, which was markedly lower than the European Union inflation average of 1.9%.</p>  <p>  The National Competitiveness Council (NCC) plays an important institutional role ensuring that the Government has an independent voice raising important competitiveness and productivity issues. Under the Council&rsquo;s Terms of Reference, it is required to prepare two annual reports:</p>  <p>  - An annual report benchmarking the competitiveness of Ireland&rsquo;s business sector against international peer countries; and,</p>  <p>  - An annual report outlining the main competitiveness challenges facing the business sector in Ireland over the medium term, and the policy responses required to meet them.</p>  <p>  Alongside these reports, they also produce a Cost of Doing Business report, a Productivity Statement, and a series of shorter competitiveness bulletins. As the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, I am responsible for presenting the findings of the NCC&rsquo;s competitiveness documents to the Taoiseach and the Government.</p>  <p>  Addressing Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness remains a key priority for the Government. We continue to monitor Ireland's cost base and to analyse the factors that are crucial to improving our competitiveness. A range of initiatives are in process across Departments to: enhance our cost competitiveness and productivity; improve the ease of doing business; reduce the administrative burden businesses face; and, drive greater efficiencies across the enterprise base. </p>  <p>  Significantly, in March 2019, Future Jobs Ireland was launched, a cross-government framework designed to improve our economy&rsquo;s resilience in the face of emerging and future challenges. It sets out 26 &lsquo;ambitions&rsquo; to 2025 across five pillars in the areas of innovation; productivity; skills and talent; participation; and transitioning to a low carbon economy. This initiative has proposed concrete and ambitious actions to enhance our productivity and competitiveness in order to ensure that we are well positioned to adapt to transformational changes the economy will face in the years ahead.</p>  <p>  A range of specific deliverables in Future Jobs Ireland 2019 aim to enhance the business environment and improve competitiveness, as well as other factors, that contribute to specific sectoral cost challenges. For example:</p>  <p>  - On credit and financial costs, the Future Growth Loan Scheme will provide long term debt financing for strategic investments at competitive rates in a post-Brexit environment;</p>  <p>  - On legal services, new business models for legal services will be introduced, including new legal partnerships and limited liability partnerships;</p>  <p>  - On construction, an implementation plan for actions to stimulate construction sector productivity will be delivered, including greater deployment of Building Information Modelling.</p>  <p>  Increasing productivity is the only long-term sustainable way of increasing the standard of living for our people, and there are a range of further initiatives underway across Government to enhance productivity, including:</p>  <p>  - The review of SME policy designed to assess the SME business ecosystem and the range of supports offered to SMEs undertaken by my Department in conjunction with the OECD; and</p>  <p>  - The development of an Industry 4.0 strategy to respond to the challenges and opportunities arising from the impact of digital technologies.</p>  <p>  As a small open economy, we must never underestimate the importance of maintaining competitiveness, and ensuring that the cost of doing business does not impede this. In this regard, the actions outlined form an integral component of the Government&rsquo;s over-arching plan for the future of the Irish economy.</p></reply>

As a result, at least 40% of the fund will be available to food businesses. </p>  <p>  The scheme features a two-stage application process. First, businesses must apply to the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) to confirm their eligibility for the scheme. Businesses can use guidelines provided on the SBCI website to determine if they are eligible, and if so, to complete the eligibility form.  As part of the process, businesses must submit a business plan, demonstrating the means by which they intend to innovate, change or adapt to meet their Brexit challenges. The SBCI assesses the applications and successful applicants receive an eligibility reference number.</p>  <p>  Successful applicants can then apply for a loan under the scheme with one of the participating finance providers using their eligibility reference number. Participating finance providers are the Bank of Ireland, Ulster Bank and Allied Irish Bank. Approval of loans is subject to the finance providers' own credit policies and procedures.  </p>  <p>  As at close of business 30 September 2019, 151 food businesses have applied for eligibility under the Brexit Loan Scheme since it opened in March 2018. 128 of the received applications were approved and received eligibility codes and 35 food businesses have been sanctioned financing to date with a total value of &euro;9.19 million.</p></reply>

The report covers the clinical and technical issues involved in ensuring both:</p><p>1. the safe and effective provision of mesh procedures in urogynaecology and</p><p>2. an appropriate response to women who suffer complications as a result of undergoing such procedures.</p><p>This report was published on the Department of Health website on 21 November 2018. </p><p>The CMO&rsquo;s Report identifies that for many women, surgical procedures using synthetic mesh devices have provided a more effective and less invasive form of treatment than traditional SUI and POP procedures. However, mesh devices are associated with significant and severe complications in a minority of women. These are of concern given the difficulties of mesh implant removal.</p><p>The CMO's Report makes 19 recommendations including:</p><p>- the development of patient information and informed consent materials;</p><p>- surgical professional training and multidisciplinary expertise in units carrying out mesh procedures;</p><p>- the development of clinical guidance;</p><p>- the development of information systems to monitor the ongoing use of mesh devices;</p><p>- ensuring the reporting of mesh related complications; and</p><p>- ensuring timely, appropriate and accessible care pathways for the management of women with complications.</p><p>In advance of the report&rsquo;s completion, the HSE was requested in May 2018 to begin work immediately on the development of national standardised patient information and informed consent materials and the clarification and development of treatment pathways and appropriate referral services for women suffering serious complications. </p><p>The HSE was also asked by the Chief Medical Officer on 24 July 2018 to pause all mesh procedures where clinically safe to do so, pending confirmation by the HSE of the implementation of recommendations relating to (i) professional training requirements, (ii) patient information and consent and (iii) the development and maintenance of a national data set for all mesh procedures carried out in HSE funded hospitals.</p><p>A Synthetic Mesh Devices Advisory Group was convened by the HSE, to advise on and progress all of the recommendations which included three patient representatives, as well as representatives of the HPRA, the IOG, the RCSI, the CFI and all Hospital Groups to advise on and action all of the recommendations above. </p><p>I am informed that an ongoing work programme for the clarification and development of treatment pathways and appropriate referral services for women suffering from mesh-related complications is being progressed by the HSE. This work includes identifying the appropriate specialist clinical expertise and facilities required at hospital group level and nationally to provide comprehensive aftercare services. </p><p>Pending the completion of this work, I am informed that work to identify and progress service options for women with immediate or urgent needs is nearing completion. </p><p>As was requested by the Secretary General of my Department in November 2018, the HSE prepared an Implementation Plan for the complete set of recommendations set out in the CMO&rsquo;s Report, which was approved by the Leadership Team in the HSE and published on the HSE website on 26 April 2019. </p><p>I am informed that the HSE has advised that a further detailed progress report on implementation of the recommendations will be provided to my Department in the coming weeks. </p><p>The HSE has published a dedicated webpage about vaginal mesh implants, including contact information for women suffering complications, which I hope is a useful resource. This can be found on the HSE website. </p><p>I would strongly encourage all women affected by mesh to engage with the relevant HSE contact points provided, to ensure that their service needs can be identified and provided for.</p><p>At my meeting with the Mesh Survivors Ireland Group on 7 March 2019 I agreed to continue engagement with them on a pathway forward, to ensure that the ongoing clinical management of this patient group is in line with international best practice and emerging evidence. It is my intention to meet again with the Mesh Survivors Ireland group in the coming weeks.</p><p>Mesh devices are regulated medical devices and the overall risk benefit profile associated with their use is considered positive. There is no basis for the introduction of a general redress scheme for women who have suffered mesh complications.</p></reply>

In that respect, the HSE have been asked to consider actions/initiatives over and above non-funded actions, and to look at building capacity and options available to them to alleviate the expected overcrowding. The HSE are engaged in a process of consultation with Hospital Groups and Community Healthcare Organisations and the Department expects to receive a draft Winter Plan resulting from this process in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  The HSE provides a variety of different types of social care support which can facilitate the discharge of older persons from the acute hospital and into community care.</p>  <p>  Transitional care supports acute hospitals across the country in discharging patients who have completed their acute care and who require long stay residential care under the Nursing Home Support Scheme (NHSS) or who require convalescence up to 4 weeks prior to returning home. This facilitates the patient discharging to a private nursing home to finalise their NHSS application or to take up convalescence.  </p>  <p>  Respite care is provided in several different ways and settings across the health system. It is provided through designated respite beds in Public Residential centres and also &lsquo;contracted&rsquo; by the HSE in private nursing homes &ndash; where it is used to increase the availability of such beds to meet demand &ndash; within the resources available in the local area. Respite can be provided on an emergency basis for unforeseen circumstances that occur due to bereavement/illness of carers or emergency environmental changes to the residence of the client. Planned Respite can be provided to people, which allows carers a planned break throughout the year. This is planned in conjunction with the person and their carers and is seen as a part of the continuum of care for the person. </p>  <p>  In the context of planning and preparing for the challenges of the winter period, the Department and the HSE have been considering a comprehensive approach to the current the high-level of delayed transfers of care (DTOCs). However, recognising the urgency of the situation, approval was provided to the HSE to begin actions immediately to the value of &euro;5m in 2019.  As part of these measures the HSE released a significant number of funding approvals within NHSS this month in order to bring the waiting time back to 4 weeks, and to provide additional home support and transitional care beds. This has seen a reduction in the number of DTOCs over the last month.</p></reply>

The HSE advises that, at present, the further diagnostic scans requested by the Deputy (including cholangiopancreatography, electroencephalogram, angiogram, and bone scan), are not yet captured as part of this project.  </p><p>The HSE advises that a pilot project commenced in 2016 by the HSE Acute Hospitals Division to progress the collection of national radiology waiting list data. The project has been supported by the Radiology Clinical Care Programme and has involved key stakeholders across the system including the National NIMIS Team, Hospital Groups, and the support of the National Treatment Purchase Fund for data collection and data management expertise.</p><p>The information that is currently being collected is presently being tested and validated at hospital; hospital group and national level and as such should be used/reported in conjunction with the caveats set out below:</p><p>- Data is subject to inclusions and exclusions which are documented in the Data Profile Document. This document is available from Acute Operations and has been circulated to all Hospital Groups.</p><p>- Data contains urgent, routine and surveillance/planned activity which is currently not broken down in detail, as such this includes surveillance/planned activity which may not be exceeding planned date.</p><p>- Data is still undergoing validation at Hospital and Hospital Group level.</p><p>- Data does not take into account local nuances at site level (Site profile developed to support understanding of same).</p><p>- The purpose of this aggregate data is to provide a National Level overview of the number of patients waiting for modalities of CT, MR and Ultrasound.</p><p>- This report is not intended to be used for the active management of hospital diagnostics waiting list, local reports and mechanisms should continue to be used for the management of diagnostics waiting lists at hospital level.</p><p>- In Q2 there were a total of 173,036 patients reported on the waiting list from all sites, this 173,036 patients represents all outpatients waiting, urgent, semi urgent, routine and planned/surveillance (where diagnostic access is planned at particular time intervals).  </p></reply>

The Report identified around 4000 people (based on 2008 census) with disabilities in Ireland living in congregated settings, defined as a residential setting where people live with ten or more people.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Partnership Government contains a commitment to continue to move people with disabilities out of congregated settings, to enable them to live independently and to be included in the community.  The objective is to reduce this figure by one-third by 2021 and ultimately, to eliminate all congregated settings.</p>  <p>  By the end of this year, we will have exceeded this target and under 2,100 people with a disability will remain living in congregated settings. I want to emphasise that the appropriate supports and resources are being put in place to ensure that people are supported as they move out of residential centres. The model of care for individuals will be based on a person centred plan (PCP). The PCP may change over time in line with an individual&rsquo;s needs and circumstances and the model of service delivery applicable at a particular time.</p>  <p>  Any opportunity for residents to live in smaller settings in the community will come after considerable planning and discussion with those residents and their families. It will be on the basis that it will enhance their life, and anyone who moves will continue to access the services they require.</p>  <p>  The HSE has prioritised the transition of a further 160 people from congregated settings in 2019 under its Service Plan, and I am informed that 59 people have moved into their homes in the community at the end of June this year.</p>  <p>  As the HSE is responsible for leading out on the recommendations of "Time to Move on from Congregated Settings - A Strategy for Community Inclusion", I have asked the HSE to reply directly to the Deputy in relation to the questions posed.</p></reply>

In this regard, the Government is committed to improving waiting times for hospital appointments and procedures.</p>  <p>  Budget 2019 announced that the Government has further increased investment in tackling waiting lists, with funding to the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) increasing from &euro;55 million in 2018 to &euro;75 million in 2019. The joint Department of Health/HSE/NTPF Scheduled Care Access Plan 2019 was published in March and sets out measures to improve access for patients waiting for scheduled care this year. The plan places a strong focus on ten high-volume Inpatient/Day Case procedures. </p>  <p>  The NTPF advise that over recent months they have placed a particular focus on engaging with hospital groups and individual hospitals to identify orthopaedic waiting list proposals. The NTPF welcomes proposals from all acute hospitals for initiatives to improve access for patients on waiting lists. </p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly.</p></reply>

There are many reasons for this, such as a patient undertaking the application process for NHSS, awaiting assessment for a home support package, homelessness, ward of court application, and the availability of resources.</p>  <p>  When possible, the HSE will use transitional care to accommodate the patient during the period between discharge and the finalisation of new care arrangements, but there can often be a delay, especially in cases where the patient and family are coming to terms with the new circumstances.</p>  <p>  This year, services are being stretched more than ever, with demand consistently outstripping supply, and we have seen an increase the number of delayed transfers of care. While the HSE maximises the use of resources, prioritising those requiring discharge from acute hospitals, there is a growing demand for egress support. In response, and in the context of planning and preparing for the challenges of the winter period, the Department and the HSE have been considering a comprehensive approach to the current the high-level of DTOCs. However, recognising the urgency of the situation, approval was provided to the HSE to begin actions immediately to the value of &euro;5m in 2019.  As part of these measures the HSE released a significant number of funding approvals within NHSS in September, and provided additional home care and transitional care beds.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Deputy's specific question, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly with the requested information.</p></reply>

For the first eight months of 2019, the number of patients over the age of 75 attending hospital EDs increased by 2.7% compared to the same period last year. This reflects increasing demand for unscheduled care, especially by patients in the 75 years and over age group.</p>  <p>  However, the National Service Plan 2019 includes an expected activity target that 99% of patients aged 75 and over attending at an Emergency Department are discharged or admitted within 24 hours and any breach of this target in respect of patients in this age cohort is unacceptable.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Deputy's specific question, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly with the requested information.</p></reply>

This review took into account TSE testing requirements, Animal By-Product (ABP) regulations, budgetary considerations, the need to maintain competition and the need for an adequate collection and disposal infrastructure including the availability of adequate rendering capacity especially in the event of a serious (Class A) disease outbreak. </p>  <p>  A number of changes were introduced to the collection of fallen animals under the scheme in 2013. Those included enhanced compliance provisions and putting limits on the distance for material from fallen animals over 48 months can be transported while maintaining a competitive aspect to the market including a provision whereby animal collectors would have a choice of at least two rendering plants for disposal of fallen animal material. </p>  <p>  These changes were introduced by amendment to the terms and conditions of the fallen animal scheme.

The MFF is a critical matter for all Member States and its agreement requires unanimity at the EU Council.  It is clear that there are divergent views among Member States on the appropriate level for the budget.  While some Member States (including Ireland) have indicated their willingness to increase their contributions once they contribute towards areas of added European value, there are others who feel equally strongly that the current proposals, such as they are, are too costly.  </p>  <p>  Brexit further compounds the budgetary issue, with some &euro;12 billion per annum in UK net contributions being removed from the budget post-2020.  </p>  <p>  I continue to work at building consensus among my agriculture colleagues in Europe with regard to maintaining the CAP budget. In May last year, I co-signed a Joint Memorandum in Madrid, which calls for the CAP budget to be retained at current levels for the EU 27 post-2020.  The memorandum has been supported by up to 20 other EU Agriculture Ministers.  We will continue to work together on this issue as the negotiations for the CAP post-2020 and its budgetary allocations progress.</p>  <p>  At the Council of Agriculture Ministers, I have consistently called for an adequate CAP budget to meet the increasing demands being placed on farmers in the context of the post-2020 CAP proposals, for example, in achieving greater climate ambition. Indeed, I made this point most recently at last week's Informal Council meeting in Helsinki. </p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to work closely with its EU colleagues to build a consensus around the need to fight for a strong CAP budget as the negotiations progress. </p></reply>

Since the Government&rsquo;s decision on 7 May 2019 to approve the appointment of a preferred bidder to the National Broadband Plan, work has continued to finalise a contract with the preferred bidder, including the finalisation of financial and legal documents. The deployment of the NBP State Intervention network will commence shortly after the contract is concluded with the preferred bidder.</p>  <p>  The Bidder has indicated that the NBP State intervention will take an estimated 7 years from the beginning of deployment and in the first year of roll out, the Bidder will deploy approximately 300 Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) across all counties. BCPs will provide a community based high speed broadband service, enhancing online participation and allowing for the establishment of digital work hubs in these locations. The Bidder is aiming to pass 133,000 premises at the end of the second year, with 70-100,000 passed each year thereafter until roll out is completed.</p>  <p>  The procurement process has determined that the maximum cost to the State over the 25 year term of the project will be &euro;2.1bn, excluding VAT of &euro;355m and contingency of &euro;480m. The total spend to date on the procurement process and subsequent evaluation of tenders is &euro;28,235,975 (including VAT).</p>  <p>  While work continues on finalising the contract and in parallel to this work, I am considering the recommendations of the Joint Oireachtas Communications Committee report which was published recently.

I also understand that there is one completed third party project application to the Midland Fisheries Fund. </p>  <p>  I would expect that details of projects that have been successful in their applications to Inland Fisheries Ireland in 2019 and have been approved by the Board will be notified to my Department and I will be happy will to announce details of the projects shortly. </p>  <p>  Sustainable funding schemes available to IFI for disbursement include the Salmon and Sea Trout Rehabilitation, Conservation and Protection Fund, due to the State through the sale of salmon and sea trout licences and the Midland Fisheries Fund, gathered through the sale of permits in the midland fisheries area. Some 50% of this State funding is made available for works related to the funds. The Midland Fisheries Fund does facilitate in-stream fisheries enhancement work in trout fisheries and I understand that works undertaken to improve habitat for salmon and sea trout also benefit other salmonid species. </p>  <p>  The Salmon and Sea Trout Rehabilitation, Conservation and Protection Fund is confined to these species in respect of which a licence fee is required. A further sustainable funding mechanism to fund projects related to trout and other species nationally could be considered to if there were similar requirements for those species. </p>  <p>  The IFI budget for 2020 has yet to be finalised and I am advised that IFI allocate budget to priority works across the country. IFI has previously undertaken lagarosiphon weed control and stock management in the Western Lakes and is working on the Owenriff for example, and these initiatives are expected to continue. </p></reply>

This umbrella title covers various series of scientific and habitat management investigations in arterially drained rivers, commenced in 2008. The EREP is the successor to the Environmental Drainage Maintenance or EDM Programme, involving a series of shared studies by OPW and IFI.    The EREP, as with the EDM, has undergone significant development and transformation during the period since its inception in 2008. The Shared Service Agreement of 2018 set out a priority, within EREP, of an essential greater focus on scientific investigations within an emphasis on Water Framework Directive (WFD) requirements. </p>  <p>  The investigations undertaken in 2018 covered a range of issues, completing a detailed 2-year examination of fish, habitat and barriers in the Inny catchment, continuing a programme of long-term monitoring of sites previously examined in the 1990s, examining options for OPW in regard to management of old channel meanders and of gravel traps among other priorities. </p>  <p>  The Shared Service Agreement identified that a number of proposals could be examined annually within EREP in the context of river enhancement. It was also agreed by OPW and IFI that, in line with the WFD, the status of any waterbody where river enhancement works might be proposed would be assessed in advance of undertaking any works. </p>  <p>  Waterbody status is assessed under WFD and an Ecological Quality Ratio or EQR is allocated. This is a WFD management process and the EQR identifies if a waterbody is in HIGH, GOOD, MODERATE, POOR or BAD status. Sites identified as being in HIGH or GOOD status are deemed not to require further &lsquo;intervention&rsquo; to improve status. The Agreement identified that detailed EQR data would be collected for fish community and for habitat in any waters where works were being proposed, in advance of any determination to proceed. </p>  <p>  It is, therefore, a priority that the scientific evidence gathering process, underpinning proposed works, should be advanced and completed before any determination on proceeding with works is finalised. In that regard, and in view of the commencement of the current Shared Service Agreement in 2018, thus far work has concentrated on the essential data gathering element agreed under EREP.   </p></reply>

Following EU State aid approval, the second phase of the scheme, an operational support for biomass boilers and anaerobic digestion heating systems, opened for applications in June of this year. Under this phase of the scheme, eligible renewable energy technologies will be supported through a multi-annual payment, for a period of up to 15 years, on the basis of prescribed tariffs. Under Project Ireland 2040, the National Development Plan sets out an allocation of &euro;300 million for the roll-out of the scheme for the period up to 2027.   Applications received under the second phase of the scheme are being evaluated by SEAI, who administer the Support Scheme for Renewable Heat. SEAI inform me that the first projects have completed the evaluation process and are ready for approval. Prior to any projects being formally approved, an Annual Budget Cap for the scheme must be set. This is a financial safeguard that was included in the Government decision approving the scheme. It places an overall limit on the State's annual expenditure in any given year and is one of a number of measures put in place based on lessons learned from similar schemes in other jurisdictions. </p>  <p>  The Annual Budget Cap will be set by me with the agreement of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. I plan to do this as part of the budgetary process and I expect the first projects to be formally approved this month. </p></reply>

Ireland welcomes the benefits that the enhanced connectivity and technology will bring.    It is expected that 5G will be commercialised over the next few years. Rollout in Ireland is primarily a matter for private mobile network operators, operating on a commercial basis.</p>  <p>  As Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, I have policy responsibility for matters pertaining to public exposure to non-ionising radiation. This is an area that is kept under review and earlier this year I assigned a new statutory function to the Environmental Protection Agency to provide general information to the public on matters pertaining to public exposure to non-ionising radiation, to monitor international scientific developments and provide independent advice to my Department in this area. Information is published on the EPA&rsquo;s website at www.epa.ie/radiation/emf </p>  <p>  Irish policy in this area is informed by a substantial volume of internationally recognised scientific research and evidence. This includes the guidelines set down by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection, the ICNIRP. </p>  <p>  These guidelines provide scientifically-based exposure limits that are applicable to both public and occupational exposure from electromagnetic fields (EMF), including 5G. ICNIRP guidelines apply up to a frequency of 300 gigahertz (GHz), well above the maximum frequencies being considered for 5G. ComReg, the independent telecoms regulatory authority, ensures that licensed mobile operators comply with their licence conditions and do not exceed ICNIRP guidelines. </p>  <p>  In 2015, the Irish Government commissioned a report by the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment of the Netherlands (RIVM). This was published in 2016 and is entitled &ldquo;Electromagnetic Fields in the Irish Context&rdquo;. It examined and synthesised existing peer-reviewed research into clear findings, with particular focus on the potential health effects of electric and magnetic fields arising from high voltage power lines, and electromagnetic fields from base stations for mobile communication. This report reaffirms the overall conclusion of an earlier 2007 report, &ldquo;Health Effects of Electromagnetic Fields&rdquo;, that there is insufficient evidence to establish a causal relationship between exposure to low-frequency electromagnetic fields and adverse health effects. </p></reply>

As the scope for reductions in energy or related carbon emissions from the technologies the Deputy mentions is limited, and as the focus for grant supports needs to be on technologies with the potential to deliver the most effective impact (i.e. significant users of heat or electricity), no specific supports are envisaged for this type of equipment. However, the Excellence in Energy Efficient Design (EXEED) grant scheme can be applied to any investment project where energy is a factor. EXEED has supported a number of projects in the Leisure Sector. Power generating treadmills and exercise bikes could form part of an overall investment in an energy efficiency project in a leisure centre. </p>  <p>  Beyond the specific grant supports available, the SEAI also provides information and advisory services to businesses. These range from an SME guide to energy efficiency and case study examples of best practice to advice on energy efficiency design. New online audio-visual modules for businesses focusing on energy efficiency opportunities are also being developed and will be available in the coming months. </p>  <p>  By availing of these supports and improving their energy efficiency, businesses can cut costs as well as carbon, free up resources that can be invested in more productive activity, improve their competitiveness, resilience, and green credentials. I would encourage all businesses to engage with SEAI to benefit from these supports.  </p></reply>

This will, in turn, reduce the need for less efficient and more costly generation at peak times and support the increase in renewable power on the electricity system. </p>  <p>  The programme is being coordinated by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities with ESB Networks responsible for rolling out smart-ready electricity meters and Gas Networks Ireland responsible for the installation of smart-ready gas meters. </p>  <p>  A customer who does not want an upgraded meter will be able to decline to have this new meter installed. However, the intention is that the default position will be for the installation of a smart meter for newly constructed dwellings and other premises or where meters are due for replacement at the end of their life. Under its licence ESB Networks is required to have in place a code of practice covering persons visiting land and/or premises on behalf of the licensee and a Complaints Handling Procedure which applies in the event that an issue arises.</p>  <p>  The rollout plan is scheduled to replace 250,000 electricity meters between autumn 2019 and the end of 2020 and a further 500,000 meters every year from 2021 to 2024. On 2 September 2019 ESB Networks commenced the replacement of over 2 million electricity meters with new smart-ready meters. I have been informed that as of 30 September 2,000 electricity meters have been installed.</p></reply>

Responsibility for the regulation of the electricity and gas markets is solely a matter for the independent regulator, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU), which was assigned responsibility for the regulation of the Irish electricity market following the enactment of the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999, and subsequent legislation. The regulation of retail market prices for electricity in Ireland ended in 2011 and for gas prices in 2014. Price setting is wholly a commercial and operational matter for electricity suppliers with no regulatory approval involved.The Government is acutely aware of the financial challenges faced by families and businesses from electricity and gas prices, with the main thrust of Government policy on energy costs focused on the competitive market and the provision of supports for energy efficiency. Government policy has supported competition to drive down prices. Data from approved price comparison sites (www.bonkers.ie and www.switcher.ie) shows that consumers can make significant savings by switching energy suppliers in the competitive market. In addition, the Government has provided more than &euro;100 million in capital funding for energy efficiency schemes in 2019.</p><p>The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) is the lead organisation for the submission of Irish data on electricity and gas prices to EUROSTAT, and publishes reports and analysis of these statistics twice yearly, which include Ireland&rsquo;s EU ranking in terms of energy prices. The latest SEAI energy prices report covering July-December 2019 is available on the SEAI website at:  </p><p>The latest SEAI report highlights that Ireland continues to have amongst the highest electricity and gas prices for household and business customers within the EU. While overall electricity costs are influenced by various drivers, Ireland&rsquo;s elevated position in European rankings should be seen in the context of a number of drivers, including high reliance on imported fossil fuels for electricity generation, the small size of the Irish market, and a widely dispersed low density population that increases costs associated with electricity and gas transmission and distribution. </p></reply>

Under this plan, Ireland will become one of the first countries in the world to ensure that those in rural areas have the same digital opportunities as those in urban areas.    This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment across the country, and a State intervention in those areas where commercial operators acting alone are unlikely to invest. The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector. In 2012, less than 700,000, or 30% of Irish premises had access to high speed broadband. Today, 74% of the 2.4 million premises in Ireland can access high speed broadband. </p>  <p>  The goal of the National Broadband Plan intervention is to engage a company to build, operate and maintain the NBP State intervention network. </p>  <p>  The Government decision on 7 May 2019 means that it is intended to award the State Intervention contract to National Broadband Ireland, subject to contract close, including the finalisation of financial and legal documents. Deployment of the NBP State Intervention network will commence shortly after that. </p>  <p>  The Bidder has indicated that the NBP State intervention will take an estimated 7 years from the beginning of deployment.</p>  <p>  A deployment plan will be made available by the Bidder once the contract is signed. In the first year of roll out, the Bidder will deploy approximately 300 Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) across all counties. It is anticipated that between 7 and 23 BCPs will be deployed in each county. BCPs will provide a community based high speed broadband service, enhancing online participation and allowing for the establishment of digital work hubs in these locations. </p>  <p>  The Bidder is aiming to pass 133,000 premises at the end of the second year, with 70-100,000 passed each year thereafter until roll out is completed.</p>  <p>  Work continues on finalising the contract and in parallel to this work, I am considering the recommendations of the Joint Oireachtas Communications Committee report which was published recently. I will bring my deliberations of the report to Government in due course.</p></reply>

In relation to Irish registered motorcycles or agricultural tractor vehicles, some of these vehicles display insurance discs and some do not.  In these cases, no additional documentation is required if the vehicle displays a valid Irish insurance disc.  However, if the vehicle does not display a valid Irish insurance disc, it is recommended that a motor insurance certificate or a Green Card is carried in the vehicle.  Any policyholder with an Irish registered vehicle who requests a Green Card from their insurance provider will be issued with one.  </p>  <p>  EU law governs vehicles registered in non-EU countries travelling to the EU. Under the EU Motor Insurance Directive (2009/103/EC), the default position is that Green Cards will be required as proof of motor insurance for UK-registered vehicles entering the EU, including Ireland, post Brexit.  This means that UK and Northern Ireland registered vehicles will require a Green Card if driving to Ireland.  </p>  <p>  My Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have made a number of requests to the European Commission regarding its intentions to fix a date under Article 8(2) of the Motor Insurance Directive from which the carrying of Green Cards would not be required after the UK has exited the EU.  While the Commission has confirmed that such a measure is not part of its published Contingency Plan, my officials are continuing to pursue this matter with the Commission. </p></reply>

These can be found at the following link: www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/er/spt/statisticsofporttraffic2018/. For ease of reference the relevant tables are attached at Appendix 1.</p><p>As you will understand, the number of units can vary greatly from day to day due to seasonal factors or day of the week. Rosslare estimate they handle an average of 330 RoRo units per day.  Dublin Port has an estimated daily average of 2700 RoRo units and 2000 LoLo TEUs. The Port of Cork report a daily move count of 85 LoLo TEUs at their Ringaskiddy Terminal and 850 LoLo TEUs at their facility in Tivoli.  There are 3 RoRo sailings out of Cork every week in the summer season with an average now of 30 RoRo units on each of these sailings. There are 2 RoRo sailings out of Cork during the Winter months with an average of 40 RoRo units per sailing. </p><p>Additionally Dublin Port publishes quarterly figures on their website.  These can be accessed at: . For ease of reference the relevant tables are set out at Appendix 2.</p><p>Feedback from the Irish ports is that they all have spare capacity.</p><p>In relation to contingency plans, the Government has extensive preparations in place for a possible no-deal Brexit on 31 October 2019. In its Action Plan published in July 2019, the Government acknowledged that a no deal Brexit will be highly disruptive and will have profound implications across all aspects of society. It will be impossible for the UK to maintain the current seamless arrangements with the EU across the full range of sectors including transport connectivity, trade flows and supply chains. The contingency plans in place, including in the transport sector, will mitigate but cannot eliminate the impacts of a no-deal Brexit.</p><p>The re-introduction of customs or border controls as a consequence of Brexit will undoubtedly increase transit times for all traffic travelling via or from the UK to Continental Europe, including for many Irish importers and exporters. </p><p>The three locations for which Ireland is heavily dependent on connectivity to the UK are Dublin Port, Dublin Airport and Rosslare Europort.  The Office of Public Works has worked across Government with relevant agencies and Departments in delivering the required facilities for these agriculture, health and customs checks at these locations. Temporary facilities are now in place to meet the needs of these agencies. Additional staffing in Customs, Agriculture and Health have been recruited and trained to provide the necessary support and to manage the efficient movement of freight and people through these locations.  </p><p>The necessary associated staffing and IT systems are also in place. Testing of the relevant IT systems is continuing. Communications with stakeholders is ongoing and will continue during October 2019.</p><p>Trade between Port of Cork, Shannon Foynes Port Company and UK is more limited and is not exposed to the implications of Brexit in the same way as Dublin Port and Rosslare Europort. However, both ports have also been contingency planning for Brexit, including planning for any opportunities that may arise.  While Shannon Foynes handles no LoLo or RoRo presently, I am aware that as part of their expansion plans and Brexit contingency planning, the Port is currently examining the viability of new direct container services from Foynes to Europe.

The online system will offer a user friendly and effective system for parents, whilst offering greater efficiency in the administration and costs associated with the operation of a Government scheme. A secure identity verification system is required for any such IT system, and the Public Services Card and MyGovID offers this security in the safeguarding of applicants' information and the administration of public funding.</p>  <p>  The Scheme has not yet launched. It is targeted to launch on 29th October, with payments flowing from November. Following expert advice regarding the launch of the new Scheme, the online application process will be introduced first, followed shortly thereafter by the paper based application process. </p>  <p>  With regard to the report by the Data Protection Commissioner (DPC) into the PSC, the Government and the Attorney General have carefully considered the findings of the report, including the legal basis for the use of the PSC by specified bodies or persons (such as the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs).

Over 3.2 million of the population already have the card, many of whom it is believed are the parents of young children who may be interested in the subsidies available under the National Childcare Scheme. Those families already availing of current targeted childcare schemes do not require the card and they can remain on these schemes until end of August and, as such, will not require the card.</p></reply>

Currently only childminders who care for 4 or more children of preschool age, or, 7 or more children including those of school age, can register with Tusla and therefore take part in State subsidy schemes. To address this limitation while protecting children and providing assurance of the quality of childminding provision, First 5 - the Whole-of-Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families 2018-2028 - committed to extend regulation to all other paid, non-relative childminders on a phased basis over the lifetime of First 5. </p>  <p>  The Draft Action Plan proposes that in Phase 2 of the Action Plan an amendment to the Child Care Act 1991 would enable registration with Tusla - and therefore participation in the National Childcare Scheme - by all paid, non-relative childminders who meet initial qualification and regulatory requirements that would be determined during Phase 1 of the Action Plan. While I am keen for this step to be taken at the earliest possible opportunity, it will be important that this step is only taken when preparations are complete, including: when new Regulations are in place that are proportionate and appropriate to the home setting in which childminders work; when the Tusla Inspectorate is ready to register and inspect all non-relative childminders; and when more detailed costings have been completed on the budgetary implications for the National Childcare Scheme. </p>  <p>  The Draft Action Plan estimates that Phase 2 costs, including all of the reforms outlined in the plan, could be in the region of between &euro;27m and &euro;58m based on two scenarios of either 5,000 or 10,000 childminders registering with Tusla and becoming eligible for participation in the National Childcare Scheme. The costs are related to both early learning and care and school-age childcare. </p>  <p>  However, there would be offsetting savings, principally through increased labour market participation as a result of wider access for parents to National Childcare Scheme subsidies.  </p>  <p>  However, it should be noted that the costing the Action Plan is challenging given considerable uncertainty about the number of childminders currently working in the country, and the number of childminders who would remain in the sector following the introduction of regulations. This uncertainty impacts on estimates of the number of additional children and families who would be able to access the new National Childcare Scheme subsidies. The cost estimates outlined in the Draft Action Plan are therefore indicative and will be refined during the first phase of the action plan. </p>  <p>  The Inter Departmental Group on Future Investment in Childcare which reported in 2015 recommended that supply side measures (such as the NCS), rather than tax credits to parents, represented the most effective use of Exchequer investment. This was based on international experience and the ability to leverage quality and control costs to parents with supply side measures, i.e. subsidies paid directly to providers to reduce the childcare fee to parents.</p></reply>

It would therefore not be appropriate for me to comment on the specific matter mentioned at this time as funding for the provision of youth services in 2020, amongst other areas, remains under discussion and is ultimately subject to the final outcome of this process.</p>  <p>  I have enhanced investment in youth service provision each year since I took office, increasing current funding for youth services by an additional &euro;8.5 million in the last three years.  This represents an increase of 16% compared to 2016 . Included in this funding under the Youth Service Grant Scheme has increased by almost 10% since 2016, rising to &euro;11.126m in 2019.  </p>  <p>  In addition, I have taken on board the findings of the Value for Money and Policy Review of Youth Programmes.  I am prioritising the implementation of an integrated funding scheme as recommended by this Review. Consultations with a wide range of stakeholders are continuing with a view to introducing this targeted youth funding scheme as soon as possible.  </p>  <p>  In 2019, my Department has funding of &euro;60.4 million that is being deployed across a broad range of programmes supporting the provision of youth services throughout the country, with a specific focus on services in communities in areas considered to be disadvantaged based on the deprivation index. With the invaluable assistance of each Education and Training Boards and national organisations, the funding from my Department supports national and local youth programmes involving approximately 1,400 youth work staff  working in communities across the country, as well as some 1,500 youth clubs nationally.</p></reply>

This investment has been targeted at improving access to high-quality, affordable early learning and care and school-age childcare. All three objectives - access, affordability and quality - are critical to parents and children and one impacts on the other, hence a comprehensive response is required.</p>  <p>  In terms of affordability, the numbers of children benefitting from State supported early learning and care and school age childcare in Ireland has doubled since 2015. Free preschool provided under the ECCE Programme has increased from one year to two, saving working parents &euro;5,000 over the two years. This Programme benefits over 100,000 children annually. There have been significant increases in subsidies for families on lower incomes, rising from &euro;95 per child per week in  2016 to as much as &euro;145 per child per week from 2017. A new universal subsidy for under threes was also introduced in 2017 totalling &euro;1040 per annum. The latter two measures benefitted approximately 80,000 children last year.</p>  <p>  Affordability does remain an issue. Indeed,  new data from Pobal&rsquo;s Annual Sector Profile 2018/2019 shows the average fee for full-time provision now stands at &euro;184 per week - an increase of 3.6% since last year. The lowest full-time fees were recorded in Co. Leitrim at &euro;148 per week, with the highest full-time fees recorded in Dublin (Dun Laoghaire Rathdown), at &euro;246 per week for children</p>  <p>  The National Childcare Scheme (NCS), when introduced shortly, will see further progress on this. On its introduction, the NCS will ensure that families on NET household incomes of less than &euro;60,000 will receive some type of subsidy, with those on less than &euro;26,000 (NET) receiving the maximum subsidy which is as much as &euro;200 per child per week.</p>  <p>  The OECD has compared the supports for early learning and care and school-age childcare previously available in Ireland with the expected impact of the NCS. For a lone parent working, net costs in Ireland in 2015 were the highest among all OECD countries ( and second highest for couples). The OECD estimated that NCS will bring net costs down to make Ireland only the 11th highest in the OECD for lone parents, or closer to the OECD average.</p></reply>

The responses received were presented to the National Advisory Group on Volunteering, which is representative of all stakeholders and chaired by myself. This group, which has met on two occasions to date, is currently working closely with my officials in producing the draft of the National Volunteering Strategy. </p>  <p>  When the draft is completed, there will be a further opportunity for public consultation, following which it will be submitted to Government for approval. An implementation plan for the strategy will also be developed.</p></reply>

Receiving the maximum rate of JA without a strong financial incentive to engage in education or training can lead to long-term welfare dependency from a young age. If a young jobseeker participates in education or training the personal rate that applies is &euro;203 per week.  </p>  <p>  In 2013 the EU adopted a Council Recommendation to member states on a Youth Guarantee. Under the Youth Guarantee process my Department&rsquo;s case officer&rsquo;s engage with young jobseekers on a monthly basis, to prepare and implement a personal progression plan to help them find work which is tailored to their specific skillset. Where young people do not find work quickly, they are supported through placement on employment and training schemes, which are closely aligned to the needs of the labour market. For example, the Youth Employment Support Scheme (YESS) which I launched last year is a work experience scheme targeted exclusively at young jobseekers facing barriers to employment and participants on the scheme receive a payment of &euro;229.20 per week.  </p>  <p>  These policies have been effective in reducing both youth and long-term unemployment. For example, the most recent data shows that Irish youth unemployment has fallen from a peak of 31.2% in 2012 to 14.7% in August 2019. </p>  <p>  My Department is finalising a review on the impacts of the reduced rates on young jobseekers which I will be reviewing shortly.  This is a complex and detailed piece of work which also examined the research undertaken by the National University of Maynooth into effectiveness of the introduction of reduced JA rates payable to young jobseekers aged 18 and 19.</p>  <p>  Any changes to the age related rates of payment of JA would also have to be considered in a budgetary context and within the scope of the overall resources available for welfare improvements. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy at this time.</p></reply>

As part of its free services, MABS provides help and advice to those in mortgage arrears.</p>  <p>  The Dedicated Mortgage Arrears (DMA) advice service, which operates across the MABS regional network was established in 2015, as part of the Government's response to providing supports to mortgage holders in arrears. </p>  <p>  The DMA service aims to ensure that borrowers in mortgage arrears have access to information on the range of supports and options available to them and, where required, negotiates with lenders on their behalf.  To date, it has helped almost 8,000 borrowers with mortgage arrears issues. </p>  <p>  Since its inception, the DMA service has become an integral part of the Abhaile suite of services, which provides access for people who are insolvent and in mortgage arrears, to independent financial and / or legal advice and assistance under a voucher scheme accessed through MABS.  Abhaile is jointly coordinated and funded by the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection. MABS, CIB, the Insolvency Service of Ireland and the Legal Aid Board are working together to provide the various Abhaile services.</p>  <p>  Together with my colleague, Charlie Flanagan, Minister for Justice , I was pleased to announce, last month,  that the Abhaile service (including DMA) is being extended for a further three years. </p>  <p>  The Citizens Information Board (CIB) receives its overall budget allocation for all services, including DMA, on an annual basis. An allocation for the DMA service  has been sought for the service for 2020 as part of the Citizens Information Board overall budget requirements for 2020, however this is subject to the completion of the Department's overall estimates process. Once completed this will be communicated to CIB. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The grant, subject to certain conditions, assists households dependent on these supplies with the costs incurred in providing such a supply of water for domestic purposes or rectifying serious deficiencies with an existing supply.</p><p>Information on this grant is available from local authorities and from my Department's website at the following link:</p><p>www.housing.gov.ie/water/water-services/rural-water-programme/private-wells.</p><p>Earlier this year, I announced details of the new Multi-annual Rural Water Programme 2019-2021. This included an improved funding scheme for individual wells.</p><p>The composition of the new multi-annual programme is based on recommendations from the Working Group that I established in April 2018 to conduct a review of investment needs and rural water services. The changes that I have approved to the individual wells grant scheme are as follows:</p><p>-  A maximum grant for rehabilitation works of &euro;3,000, which represents an increase of 47% on the current maximum grant amount;</p><p>-  Where the local authority agrees that the most appropriate solution is to provide a new well, the maximum grant payable would be &euro;5,000;</p><p>-  Recognising the role of the grant in improving quality, the water quality treatment element (typically filtration and UV filtration) will qualify for 100% funding up to a maximum of &euro;1,000;</p><p>-  Up to 85% of other costs would be met, subject to the total combined maximum costs of &euro;3,000 for well rehabilitation or &euro;5,000 for a new well;</p><p>-  For clarity, applicants would not be able to avail of both grant amounts, so they would not be able to avail of &euro;3,000 for well rehabilitation as well as the &euro;5,000 for a new well. </p><p>Work is at an advanced stage of development for the new scheme. I expect that the process will be completed shortly when the necessary regulations dealing with the financial assistance arrangements and related administrative matters are put in place. This will enable a circular letter, terms and conditions, guidance and the application form to issue to local authorities shortly thereafter.</p></reply>

The accommodation sourced by tenants should be within the prescribed maximum HAP rent limits, which are based on the household size and the rental market within that area.  The tenancy agreement is between the tenant and the landlord and is governed by the Residential Tenancies Acts.  The Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) was established as an independent statutory body under the Act to operate a national tenancy registration system and to facilitate the resolution of disputes between landlords and tenants.</p>  <p>  For tenancies in Local Electoral Areas (LEAs) which have not yet been designated as a Rent Pressure Zone, the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2015 provided that rent reviews can only take place every 24 months rather than every 12 months, unless there has been a substantial change in the nature of the accommodation that warrants a review.  The review of rent will still be undertaken on the basis of the market rent and the landlord must also provide three examples of rents for similar properties in a comparable area to demonstrate this.</p>  <p>  Tenants must be given 90 days&rsquo; notice of new rent and can make an application for dispute resolution to the RTB if they have not been given the required notice, or if they feel the rent increase is in excess of the market rent.  These provisions have effect notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in a lease or tenancy agreement. </p>  <p>  Each local authority has statutory discretion to agree to a HAP payment up to 20% above the prescribed maximum rent limit to secure appropriate accommodation for a household that requires it.  It is a matter for the local authority to determine if the application of the flexibility is warranted on a case by case basis. </p>  <p>  While there is no legislative provision precluding HAP supported households contributing towards their monthly landlord rent, local authorities have a responsibility to ensure that tenancies are sustainable and are advised not to provide HAP support to tenancies where the household would not be in a position to meet the rental costs involved.</p>  <p>  At the end of Q2 2019, there were more than 48,000 households in receipt of HAP support and over 28,000 separate landlords and agents providing accommodation to households supported by the scheme.</p></reply>

Harnessing the off-balance sheet potential of private investment in social housing is an important objective of the Government and the social housing targets that are set out in Rebuilding Ireland over the period to 2021 reflect the ambition in that regard.  </p>  <p>  My Department has introduced the Enhanced Long Term Social Housing Leasing Scheme in order to target newly built or yet to be built houses and apartments for long term leasing, and to target property developers and investors who are in a position to deliver housing at a reasonable scale in order to supplement delivery under Pillar 2 of Rebuilding Ireland.  </p>  <p>  The first call for proposals for the Enhanced Leasing Scheme was open from January to April 2018 and a total of 33 submissions were received.  The second call for proposals closed on 25th October 2018 and a total of 22 submissions were received. </p>  <p>  The first Agreement for Lease was signed by Dublin City Council in Q2 2019 for 23 new social housing homes, with expected delivery in 2020.  A number of other proposals are currently in the due diligence or proposal stage.  </p>  <p>  My Department and the Housing Agency continue to work with local authorities and proposers in respect of the Enhanced Leasing Scheme, and the leasing schemes generally, in order to ensure maximum delivery of high quality leased properties to meet the needs of households on social housing waiting lists.  To this end, the Enhanced Long-Term Social Housing Leasing Scheme is in full operation and accepting proposals, complementing the range of other delivery mechanisms operated by my Department, and it is expected that further Agreements for Lease will be signed by the end of 2019. </p>  <p>  The Enhanced Leasing Scheme is one of a number of social housing leasing schemes operated by my Department under the Rebuilding Ireland programme, designed to increase the general supply of social housing in an off-balance sheet manner.  These schemes are collectively generating significant interest and progress on leasing generally is tracked on the Rebuilding Ireland status reports published on a quarterly basis, which are available on my Department's website at the following link: www.housing.gov.ie/housing/social-housing/social-and-affordble/overall-social-housing-provision.</p></reply>

Regulations in respect of the making of Schemes of Priority were signed on 12 March 2019, and these were issued to local authorities on 22 March 2019.  The purpose of a Scheme of Priority is to set out the affordable purchase arrangements at local authority level.  This includes the methodology that will be applied by local authorities to determine the order of priority to be accorded to eligible households where the demand for such affordable dwellings exceeds the number available.  </p><p>In line with the legal requirements of the Affordable Dwelling Purchase Arrangements, further regulations will be put in place over the coming months regarding eligibility and other matters. When the operational procedures for the scheme are finalised, and before dwellings are made available for purchase under the scheme, a programme of communication will be undertaken by my Department and local authorities.</p><p>In order to support the delivery of discounted homes to buy or rent, this Government has committed &euro;310 million under the Serviced Sites Fund, from 2019 to 2021, to provide infrastructure to support the delivery of some 6,200 homes.  To date, funding of &euro;127 million, in support of 35 projects in 14 local authority areas, has been allocated for infrastructure works on sites that will support the delivery of almost 3,200 homes. </p><p>Details of all SSF funded infrastructure projects can be found on the Rebuilding Ireland website at the following links:  </p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>The overall cost and the timing of delivery for these projects is contingent upon the completion of design, planning and procurement in the first instance, and local authorities are working to achieve delivery as quickly as possible. </p><p>In addition to making discounted homes available for purchase, the Government is also committed to the development of &lsquo;Cost Rental&rsquo; in Ireland. Under the Cost Rental model, rents cover the cost of delivering, managing, and maintaining the homes only, less both the profit margin seen in the private rental sector and any financial supports provided by the State/local authorities.  With the resulting rents significantly below market levels, this would mean that many households on moderate incomes will have access to a more affordable and stable form of rental tenure than would otherwise have been the case. </p><p>In order to drive delivery, two early mover pilot projects are being advanced, one at Enniskerry Road, in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, and the other at Emmet Road in Inchicore. In tandem with these pilot projects, my Department is developing a national policy approach to Cost Rental for Ireland to ensure future projects can be delivered at a scale and in a manner that will have the desired positive impact on the Irish housing sector. </p><p>These new schemes are complemented by other key Government affordability initiatives, including the Rebuilding Ireland home loan and the Help to Buy Scheme.In addition,  the Land Development Agency's  initial portfolio of sites will have the potential to deliver 3,000 affordable homes and the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund ( LIHAF) will support more than 2,300 affordable homes on mainly publicly owned lands, while 5,600 further homes will benefit from a LIHAF related cost reduction, some of which have already come on stream.</p><p>In overall terms, programmes are in place under which some 18,000 affordable homes or homes with a LIHAF related reduction will be delivered, with 15,000 households already supported under the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan or the Help to Buy Scheme.</p></reply>
