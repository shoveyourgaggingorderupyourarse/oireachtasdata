The LEEF has met regularly to facilitate discussions with Government on issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic and our economic recovery.  </p>  <p>  Social dialogue, through the LEEF process, played a crucial role in ensuring workplaces are safe during the COVID-19 pandemic including preparing, updating and overseeing a Work Safely Protocol.  Under the auspices of LEEF, there has also been significant progress on other issues such as the introduction of statutory sick pay, remote working, and establishment of a High Level Review of Collective Bargaining.  </p>  <p>  The Social Dialogue Unit also supports my engagements with representatives from the Environmental Pillar, the Community and Voluntary Pillar, and the Farming and Agriculture Pillar. This has included a series of meetings between myself and key Ministers with those groups to discuss how social dialogue can be strengthened, as well as issues of concern to those sectors.  </p>  <p>  Social dialogue, between Government, trade unions and other representative groups also takes place through structures like the National Economic Dialogue, the National Economic and Social Council, the National Competitiveness and Productivity Council and through many sectoral groups, and with Ministers and Departments directly.</p></reply>

The HSA maintains a strong focus on specific high-risk areas, such as agriculture, through inspection and enforcement, ongoing partnerships, and through education and awareness-raising campaigns. </p><p>Although farming fatalities declined by over 50% with 9 fatalities recorded in 2021 compared to 20 in 2020, the sector remains one of the most dangerous sectors in which to work in Ireland. <table>    <tr>       <th></th>       <th>Agriculture 2021</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Accidents Reported</td>       <td>113*</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Fatalities </td>       <td>9 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>* There is significant underreporting of non-fatal work-related incidents in agriculture as most are self-employed sole traders.</p><p>In August 2021, the HSA published its Farm Safety Action Plan 2021 &ndash; 2024. The aim of the new Farm Safety Action Plan is to reduce fatalities, serious injuries and ill health in the agriculture sector. Five critical areas have been identified for attention - Behaviour, Education and Training; Health and Vulnerable Persons; Tractor; High Risk Machinery; Livestock Handling and Buildings, Work at Height.</p><p>The HSA, through its Agricultural Policy Unit, provides practical assistance and support to achieve the goals and objectives contained within the Farm Safety Action Plan. The Farm Safety Partnership Advisory Committee, which is an advisory committee to the Board of the HSA, will monitor the implementation of the action plan over its term.</p><p>In November 2021, legislation was introduced (Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (General Application) (Amendment No 2) Regulations 2021 (S.I. No 619 of 2021)) to make use of PPE and undergoing training mandatory for use of All Terrain Vehicles (ATV&rsquo;s) in the workplace. This was introduced as a result of the number of accidents involving these vehicles, resulting in fatalities and life changing injuries in recent years, particularly in farm settings. These Regulations will come into effect from November 2023 to ensure the necessary training and equipment requirements have been put in place.</p><p>In addition to the actions being undertaken by the HSA, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM) under the guidance of Minister of State Martin Heydon has a range of measures in place and in the process of being put in place to incentivise and promote the issue of farm safety. </p><p>A key element of the DAFM approach is the on-going Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Scheme (TAMS) II scheme. Under the suite of seven TAMS measures, there is a wide range of farm safety-related investments available for grant-aid. As part of the TAMS II schemes, &lsquo;Health and Safety&rsquo; guidelines are included in all &lsquo;Building Specifications,&rsquo; drawn up by DAFM for the construction of agricultural buildings and structures. Additionally, it is a requirement for all applicants under the TAMS II schemes to complete a half day of farm safety training.</p><p>DAFM supports the AgriAware Farm Safe Schools initiative for 2022 which is on a mission to Engage, Educate and Empower children to be farm safety ambassadors.</p><p>A further initiative being taken by DAFM, in conjunction with the Department of Finance, is the Accelerated Capital Allowance Scheme for Farm Safety and Disabilities Adaptation Equipment. The scheme provides for accelerated capital allowances at 50% per annum over two years for eligible specified farm safety and adaptive equipment.</p></reply>

The Irish State&rsquo;s general policy is to promote the sourcing of labour and skills needs from within the workforce of the European Union and other EEA states. However, where specific skills prove difficult to source within the EEA, an employment permit may be sought in respect of a non-EEA national who possess those skills.</p>  <p>  All Employment Permit applications are processed in line with the Employment Permits Act 2006, as amended and are dependent on a job offer from an Irish registered Employer for an eligible occupation. It should be noted that the State's employment permit system is ordered by the use of occupation lists which determine which employments are highly demanded and which are ineligible for consideration for employment permits at a point in time and these lists are reviewed on a twice-yearly basis.</p>  <p>  In March 2020, my Department implemented a contingency plan to ensure that the employment permit regime could continue to operate throughout the COVID-19 crisis. The Department is committed to flexibly dealing with employment permit issues that arise for both employers and employees as a result of the pandemic. The feedback received from enterprise across the board has been universally positive. </p>  <p>  In fact, Ireland was one of the few countries that has managed to keep their employment permit system fully operational throughout the pandemic. Full details in relation to the contingency arrangements introduced by the Employment Permits Section in response to the pandemic can be accessed on my Department's website through the following link:enterprise.gov.ie/en/Publications/COVID-19-Employment-Permits-System-Contingency-Arrangements.html.</p>  <p>  Where an employment permit holder has been made redundant they must notify the Employment Permits Section of my Department when the employment ceases on the prescribed Redundancy Notification form within 4 weeks of the redundancy. An employment permit holder then has up to six months from the date on which their employment ceases to find further employment. </p>  <p>  If the permit holder secures another job within the six month period of the redundancy they will be exempted from certain rules that otherwise would apply i.e. the requirement to complete a Labour Market Needs Test and the eligibility criteria in relation to the job. In addition, if an employment permit holder was made redundant from an occupation that subsequently was deemed ineligible for a permit, but had been offered the same role by a different employer, then an employment permit application will be considered.</p>  <p>  Information regarding employment permit holders who are made redundant from their employment is available on my Department&rsquo;s website and can be accessed through this link: enterprise.gov.ie/en/What-We-Do/Workplace-and-Skills/Employment-Permits/Redundancy/.</p></reply>

These long-standing provisions have been, and continue to be, of significant benefit to compliant companies. There is a considerable incentive on companies and their advisers to ensure timely filing of annual returns, thereby safeguarding the audit exemption and avoiding late filing penalties and possible prosecution.</p>  <p>  Against this background, there has been a very significant increase in the compliance rate for the filing of annual returns, moving from a widespread culture of non-compliance up to the 1990s to a situation, in recent years, where in the region of 90 - 95% of companies meet their filing obligations on time.</p>  <p>  The question has been raised about the potentially disproportionate effect that the loss of audit exemption may have, particularly in relation to SMEs, as a consequence of late filing (due to the costs associated with providing two years of audited financial statements). My Department keeps company law under review on an ongoing basis and is considering what changes might be appropriate to the current regime to ensure that the consequences of late filing do not unduly penalise small business while also maintaining the incentive to file annual returns in a timely manner. </p></reply>

It is the National Competent Authority in respect of <i>Regulation (EU) 2021/821 of the European Parliament and of the Council setting up a Union regime for the control of exports, brokering, technical assistance, transit and transfer of dual-use items</i>. The Department operates the highest standards of Export Controls, in accordance with EU law and international best practice.</p><p>&lsquo;Dual-use&rsquo; items are products and components, including software and technology, that can be used for both civil and military applications. The list of &lsquo;Dual-use&rsquo; items subject to Export Control is set out in Annex 1 to <i>Regulation (EU) 2021/821</i>. The bulk of &lsquo;Dual-use&rsquo; exports from Ireland are mainstream business ICT products, both hardware and software, (networking, data storage, cybersecurity etc). They are categorised as &lsquo;Dual-use&rsquo; items as a consequence of fact that they make use of strong encryption for data protection purposes.</p><p>My Department is also the National Competent Authority in respect of the <i>Trade</i>elements of EU Restrictive Measures i.e. trade sanctions.</p><p>The Programme for Government contains a clear commitment to the promotion of Human Rights through business practices and in particular, to rigorously scrutinise all applications for export licences for Dual-use items and Military equipment. </p><p>My Department administers controls on the export of Military equipment from Ireland, in accordance with the <i>European Council Common Position 2008/944/CFSP defining common rules governing control of exports of military technology and equipment</i>. The list of Military equipment subject to these controls is set out in the <i>Common Military List of the European Union</i>.</p><p>In keeping with the commitment in the Programme for Government, all applications for export licences are rigorously scrutinised by my officials, on a case-by-case basis, in accordance with the relevant legislation.  Each application is reviewed against the eight assessment criteria set out in <i>Council Common Position 2008/944/CFSP. </i>Applications also reviewed against any EU Restrictive Measures, such as trade sanctions or arms embargoes, that may be in place in respect of the destination country.</p><p>The Department of Foreign Affairs has responsibility for Ireland&rsquo;s international relations and global human rights. In this context, my officials seek the views of the Department of Foreign Affairs on all applications for &lsquo;Dual-use&rsquo; and Military export licences.</p><p>Where appropriate, the Department also consults with Competent Authorities in other Member States.</p><p>The Office of the Revenue Commissioners may refer pending exports to the Department for a number of reasons: to clarify the details of an export licence presented with the goods as part of the export documentation; to verify that a licence has been properly authorised; or to confirm that a licence is not required.</p><p>The classification codes for &lsquo;Dual-use&rsquo; items in the EU Regulation do not translate well to the Combined Nomenclature (CN) classification for goods, which underpins the operation of the harmonised Customs Union. A single CN code can apply to both controlled and uncontrolled goods. This can give rise to uncertainty as to whether goods presented at the point of departure from the Customs Union fall within the scope of Export Controls.</p><p>Revenue may also refer exports to known sensitive third countries for confirmation that the exports would not be in breach of EU trade sanctions.</p><p>In 2020 the Department received 165 referrals from Revenue with respect to exports to the following countries: Belarus, Russia, Zimbabwe, Libya, South Korea, United States, Syria, Myanmar, Yemen, Brazil, Pakistan, Sudan, Singapore, Zambia, Brazil, United Arab Emirates, Turkey &amp;amp; Canada. After investigation, all shipments were released. It is the long-standing policy of the Department not to release exporters&rsquo; details in order to respect exporters' commercial confidentiality and protect their security.</p><p>The purpose of a site inspection is to assess an exporter&rsquo;s implementation of an Internal Compliance Programme (ICP). That is, its internal policies and procedures to ensure compliance with export controls and with the terms and conditions of licences. The assessment is carried out having regard to <i>Commission Recommendation (EU) 2019/1318 on internal compliance programmes for dual-use trade controls</i>This Recommendation identifies and sets out the core elements essential for an effective ICP.</p><p>EU Regulations require that exporters seeking an export authorisation implement an ICP in most circumstances. However, the Regulations do not provide for the certification of ICPs by Member States&rsquo; competent authorities, but rather require them to take into consideration the implementation of an ICP by the exporter when assessing licence applications. Therefore, the Department&rsquo;s assessment of an exporter&rsquo;s ICP during an inspection will inform the risk assessment for subsequent licence application by the exporter.</p><p>Virtual visits are conducted using industry standard, secure remote conferencing systems, which incorporate encryption and other security measures.</p><p>In 2020 Authorised Officers of the Department conducted 20 physical site visits and 25 virtual ones. Authorised Officers of the Department also conducted 35 outreach engagements in 2020.</p><p>The Department issues a range of export licences, pursuant to EU Regulations and the Control of Exports Act 2008. Licenses are issued subject to a set of Terms and Conditions regarding exports made under the licence. In 2020, the Department initiated a review the Terms and Conditions to ensure that they remain fit for purpose and are appropriate for the prevailing global security and human rights situation, and current business models (supply-chains, distribution channels etc). Following this review, in 2021 the Department introduced a new Global &lsquo;Dual-use&rsquo; Licence with strengthened Terms and Conditions.</p><p>Work is underway within the Department to give the Terms and Conditions statutory footing and will bring forward legislation this year to provide an overarching legal framework for the introduction and revision of Terms and Conditions, along with robust powers of enforcement. The drafting of the Bill by the OPC is well advanced and it is my intention that the Bill will be published in Q1 2022, and my hope that it will be enacted before the end of 2022. </p></reply>

The text of this response is replicated below. As that previous response notes, the details sought by the deputy are in chapter six of the recently published Expert Group on Future Skills Needs report, Skills for Zero Carbon- The Demand for Renewable Energy, Residential Retrofit and Electric Vehicle Deployment Skills to 2030- in particular pages 87 to 91. This report is available on the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs website, www.egfsn.ie. </p>  <p>  The Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN) is the independent body tasked with advising the Government on the current and future skills needs of the Irish economy. Its Secretariat is based in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</p>  <p>  As part of its 2021 work programme, the EGFSN undertook a study on the nature and quantity of skills required between now and 2030 to deliver on some of the key enabling measures in the Climate Action Plan. </p>  <p>  These are the targeting of 5GW of offshore renewable wind energy, an increase in onshore wind energy of up to 8.2GW, and the generation of up to 1.5GW of grid scale solar energy; the energy efficient retrofit of 500,000 residential homes to a minimum B2 Building Energy Rating; and the target of having 840,000 electric cars, as well as 95,000 commercial vehicles, on Irish roads. </p>  <p>  The resulting study, Skills for Zero Carbon: The Demand for Renewable Energy, Residential Retrofit and Electric Vehicle Deployment Skills to 2030, was published by the EGFSN on 24th November, and the Government has committed to acting on its findings in both Housing for All- A New Housing Plan for Ireland and Climate Action Plan 2021- Securing our Future, through a range of upskilling, reskilling and apprenticeship supports.</p>  <p>  According to the EGFSN's analysis, in order to deliver on the Climate Action Plan's 2030 targets, employment in wind and solar energy generation will have to quickly increase to 8,000, from a 3,000 baseline in 2020, within a number of years, and ultimately stand at 9,000 by 2030. This will mainly consist of workers in roles including Construction and Installation, Technicians and Technical Professionals, Engineering, Transport and Logistics, and Legal and Professional Services.</p>  <p>  The workforce engaged in residential retrofit and heat pump installation will similarly have to ramp up quickly and increase more than fourfold (from c.4,000), to stand at over 17,000 for the remainder of the decade. These roles will mainly be concentrated in Insulation and Airtightness, Cosmetic and Repair, Lighting and Electrics, Engineering and Support, and Heating.</p>  <p>  The existing motor mechanic workforce of c.15,000 will meanwhile need to be transitioned to work on Electric Vehicles as EV uptake increases.</p>  <p>  The full details of these forecasts, including the occupational breakdowns, can be read in chapter 6 of the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs report, which is available on www.egfsn.ie. </p></reply>

The scheme has seen a rapid uptake and as of January 10th, 2022, there has been 3,480 loans sanctioned to a total value of over &euro;748 million.</p>  <p>  The scheme features a two-stage application process, whereby businesses must first apply to the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) to confirm their eligibility under the scheme. Successful applicants are issued an eligibility reference number, which they can then use to make a loan application to a participating finance provider.</p>  <p>  The information provided with this parliamentary question confirms that the business secured an eligibility reference number from SBCI for the FGLS.</p>  <p>  The SBCI administer the FGLS on behalf of my department and were requested to look into the matter raised by the business in relation to the FGLS participating finance provider's engagement with them regarding a loan application through the FGLS.</p>  <p>  SBCI contacted the business and participating finance provider for details of this matter. The participating finance provider is in the process of reviewing the business plan underpinning the loan application by the business.</p>  <p>  The business has also been provided with contact details for a lending manager within SBCI in case of the need for further follow up.</p>  <p>  The decision on any loan application by the business will be made by the participating finance provider in line with their own credit policies and procedures. However, if the business is not successful in their loan application, there is an option for them to avail of the internal appeals process within the finance provider.</p></reply>

Details of the supports can be found on my Department&rsquo;s website: Government supports for COVID-19 impacted businesses - DETE (enterprise.gov.ie).</p>  <p>  The Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) provides a subsidy to qualifying employers based on the numbers of paid and eligible employees on the employer&rsquo;s payroll and charges a reduced rate of employer PRSI of 0.5% on wages paid which are eligible for the subsidy payment. </p>  <p>  The EWSS has been a key element of the Government&rsquo;s response to the continued Covid-19 crisis to support viable firms and encourage employment and it is widely recognised that the EWSS has played an essential role in supporting businesses, encouraging employment and helping to maintain the link between employers and employees during this pandemic.</p>  <p>  Government policy has been that there will be no cliff edge to the support, at the same time, it is necessary to unwind and phase out this temporary, emergency support measure. On Budget Day of last year, an extension of EWSS in a graduated form until 30 April 2022 was announced, ensuring there will be no sudden end to the EWSS.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that all business supports are being kept under review to ensure that they are timely and target those that need them the most. I would urge businesses to make sure that they are aware of what is available to them and apply for the appropriate schemes.</p></reply>

At a minimum the Waste Management (Food Waste) Regulations must be complied with. These require many types of businesses to separate and appropriately disposal of organic wastes. The 'My Waste for Business' resource (www.mywaste.ie/business) provides more information on managing waste responsibly.</p>  <p>  My Department's enterprise development agencies - Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and the Local Enterprise Offices - provide advice and supports to businesses of different sizes, sectors and ambitions. These can include resources to assist with implementing circular economy initiatives such as the GreenStart, GreenPlus and Green for Micro programmes; however the appropriate support will depend on the nature of the entity looking for assistance. Talking to a Local Enterprise Office is always a useful starting point for new entities or small businesses. </p>  <p>  If the entity is a Social Enterprises may be able to access different supports or grants, and the Department of Rural and Community Development publishes a useful supports and resources table for Social Enterprises on their website.</p>  <p>  Circul&eacute;ire is a cross-sectoral industry-led innovation network dedicated to accelerating the net-zero carbon circular economy in Ireland and aims to source, test, finance, and scale, circular manufacturing systems, supply chains and circular business models to deliver significant reductions in both CO2 emissions and waste across their membership. It may be able to provide useful information or advice regarding the proposal. </p>  <p>  I would encourage businesses interested in circular economy practices to engage with Climate Toolkit for Business (climatetoolkit4business.gov.ie) which was recently I launched recently with Minister Ryan. The Toolkit provides an estimate of a user's carbon footprint based on some simple information input by them, then generates a tailored action plan and points to relevant state supports that can assist in implementing its recommended actions - including in the area of materials and waste management. </p></reply>

Growth in the regions was particularly buoyant with 53% - 133 projects of the 249 investments won going to regional locations and employment growth recorded in every region of the country. </p><p>Job losses remained at a relatively modest level relative to the size of the overall portfolio resulting in an extremely strong net employment growth, with a 16,826 net increase.</p><p>The strong growth in regional investment was supported by IDA Ireland&rsquo;s property programme. A robust property and infrastructure ecosystem can be the key differentiator in winning FDI projects, as evidenced by the record regional results achieved under IDA&rsquo;s Winning 2015-2019 strategy. </p><p>The 2021 figures show a pattern of sustained, robust growth in FDI investment and FDI-related employment over a continuous period of more than ten-years. The results in 2021 represent a strong start to IDA&rsquo;s new 2021-2024 strategy, Driving Recovery and Sustainable Growth, which seeks to further enhance FDI&rsquo;s place at the centre of a resilient, sustainable, and inclusive Irish economy. </p><p>As the Deputy is aware, in response to COVID, the IDA migrated many of its business development and client engagement activities to digital platforms.

The Commission&rsquo;s core services include the inspection of employment rights compliance, the provision of information, the processing of employment agency and protection of young persons (employment) licenses and the provision of mediation, conciliation, facilitation, and advisory services.</p>  <p>  The WRC is staffed by approximately 200 civil servants from my Department. This number includes a sanction for 60 WRC inspectors. In the main, WRC inspectors rank at Executive Officer (EO) grade with Higher Executive Officers (HEO) grade, acting as Team Managers. </p>  <p>  In Budget 2022, an additional &euro;500,000 was allocated to the WRC pay budget to allow for additional inspectors to be hired. Accordingly, the total number of WRC inspectors is expected to increase to 70 over the coming year. The total funding allocation for the WRC in 2022 to &euro;15,696,000.</p>  <p>  The full year cost of recruiting an executive officer inspector for the WRC would be approximately &euro;62,092. This is based on the calculation of staff costs as set out in the Public Spending Code. The code sets out that the cost should be based on the midpoint of the salary scale and include employer&rsquo;s salary related PRSI, imputed pension costs and overheads e.g., ICT equipment, legal costs, travel and subsistence.  Using the same methodology, the cost of sixty  additional inspectors at EO level would be approximately &euro;3,725,520.</p>  <p>  My Department fully supports and continues to work closely with the WRC in monitoring its staffing and budgetary requirements. This includes anticipating future resource requirements to ensure that it is supported and adequately resourced to carry out its important work.  It is proposed to review inspector capacity again in the context of the 2023 REV allocation, engaging with the WRC to assess the impact of the 2022 increase and to evaluate if there is a need to further increase this cohort.</p></reply>

Account is also taken of contextual factors such as Brexit and, in the current context, COVID 19.</p>  <p>  Changes which were announced in June 2021 removed a number of Health Care occupations from the Ineligible Occupations List including Chartered Physiotherapist and Occupational Therapist. This provides access to the General Employment Permit for non-EEA nationals wishing to take up employment in the State as a Chartered Physiotherapist or Occupational Therapist. In accordance with Employment Permit legislation, in order to ensure that job opportunities are made available to Irish and EEA nationals, employers must satisfy a Labour Market Needs Test before a General Employment Permit can be issued to a non-EEA national. This policy fulfils our obligations under the Community Preference principles of membership of the EU. </p>  <p>The next review of the Occupations Lists will open in the coming weeks by Public Consultation.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-01-19a.173.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1505" speakername="Damien English" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022011900070#WRE05100"><p>Ireland operates a managed employment permits system maximising the benefits of economic migration and minimising the risk of disrupting Ireland&rsquo;s labour market.  The employment permits regime is designed to facilitate the entry of appropriately skilled non-EEA nationals to fill skills and/or labour shortages in the State, required to develop and support enterprise for the benefit of our economy.  However, this objective must be balanced by the need to ensure that there are no suitably qualified Irish/EEA nationals available to undertake the work and that the shortage is a genuine one.</p>  <p>  The employment permits system is managed through the operation of the critical skills and ineligible occupations lists which determine employments that are either in high demand or are ineligible for consideration for an employment permit and these lists are subject to twice-yearly evidenced based review. </p>  <p>  Since March 2020, my Department has implemented Covid-19 contingency arrangements moving employment permit operations seamlessly to a totally remote working environment.  Feedback received from enterprise across the board has been universally positive.  In fact, Ireland was one of the few countries that has managed to keep their employment permit system fully operational throughout the crisis. </p>  <p>  From the outset of the crisis, in order to assist the HSE and all other medical providers in the State to respond to, and to assist with, the public health response to the threat of Covid-19, all medical employment permits are expedited with immediate effect. </p>  <p>  My Department experienced a significant increase in applications for employment permits in the past year.  Applications for Employment Permits increased significantly over the course of 2021, impacting on processing times.  From the start of January to the end of December 2021, some 27,666 applications were received, representing a 69% increase over the same period in 2020 (16,293) and a 47% increase on 2019 (18,811), which itself represented an 11 year high in applications.  My Department has issued 16,275 employment permits in 2021, and processed a total of 17,968 applications which represents a significant volume of activity.  The impact of this has resulted in a significant backlog, which has increased from 1,000 in April 2021 to approximately c. 10,500 by mid January 2022, which is now stabilising.</p>  <p>  In addition, the extension of categories of employment permits following the latest Review of the Occupational Lists has increased the availability of employment permits for these roles.    </p>  <p>  Processing times have been impacted by this increase in demand but also because of the HSE cyber-attack.  As a result, employment permit applications associated with the July Doctors rotation (which occurs twice yearly in January and July) had to be submitted either manually or through other nonstandard methods.  This resulted in a significant additional administrative burden in dealing with these applications, requiring staff to be temporarily reassigned to assist in the process and had a direct impact on wider processing times for other permit applications. </p>  <p>  An Action Plan has been developed and is being implemented to tackle the backlog, with both human resource interventions and systemic changes.  The staffing actions being taken include:</p>  <p>  - Recruitment of additional permanent and temporary staff.  This is an increase of 69% on our permanent capacity and 125% to include temporary staff to deal with the backlog.</p>  <p>  - Temporary reassignment of staff from other areas of the Department with relevant skills.</p>  <p>  - Increased overtime.</p>  <p>  As the Plan is implemented and begins to take effect, we expect to see rapid improvements from end-January, with the backlog considerably reduced by the end of Q1 and substantially reduced by the end of Q2 2022. </p>  <p>  In addition, further systemic changes have also been introduced.  My Department has worked with the Department of Health, the Health Service Executive and the Department of Justice to streamline and extend the time period for General Employment Permits (GEP) issued to doctors.  A new two-year multi-site GEP for Medical Doctors in Public hospitals and Public health facilities was introduced in respect of the January 2022 Doctors rotation.  This will result in significant benefits for applicants, as well as major efficiencies for the Employment Permits Section, by eliminating the necessity to apply for additional employment permits when moving to a different Public hospital or Public health facility within this two year period.</p>  <p>  The Department provides regular updates on its website in relation to processing times and engages directly with key stakeholders including the IDA, Enterprise Ireland, AmCham, IBEC, representative groups and individual companies, as required.  </p>  <p>  The Management Board of my Department is overseeing the implementation of the Action Plan and its impact on the backlog and waiting times.</p></reply>

Details of the supports can be found on my Department&rsquo;s website: Government supports for COVID-19 impacted businesses - DETE (enterprise.gov.ie).</p>  <p>  The Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) provides a subsidy to qualifying employers based on the numbers of paid and eligible employees on the employer&rsquo;s payroll and charges a reduced rate of employer PRSI of 0.5% on wages paid which are eligible for the subsidy payment. </p>  <p>  The EWSS has been a key element of the Government&rsquo;s response to the continued Covid-19 crisis to support viable firms and encourage employment and it is widely recognised that the EWSS has played an essential role in supporting businesses, encouraging employment and helping to maintain the link between employers and employees during this pandemic.</p>  <p>  Government policy has been that there will be no cliff edge to the support, at the same time, it is necessary to unwind and phase out this temporary, emergency support measure. An extension of EWSS in a graduated form until 30 April 2022 was put in place for employers validly registered on or before 31 December 2021 to participate in the scheme from 1 January to 30 April 2022, ensuring there will be no sudden end to the EWSS. Details of EWSS are available through the Revenue website at   www.revenue.ie/en/employing-people/ewss/registration-and-operation-of-ewss.aspx.</p>  <p>It is important to note that all business supports are being kept under review to ensure that they are timely and target those that need them the most. I would urge businesses to make sure that they are aware of what is available to them and apply for the appropriate schemes.   </p></reply>

The Commission for Regulation of Utilities is assisted in its statutory role by EirGrid.  EirGrid published its Generation Capacity Statement in September 2021, which covers the period 2021 to 2030 and has identified a medium term need to develop circa 2,000 MW of generation capacity.

The AMBER area represents the area to be served by the network to be deployed under the NBP State led intervention. </p>  <p>  I appreciate people's frustration when they are living close to a fibre network but cannot get a connection to that network, particularly given the heightened importance of connectivity during the Covid-19 pandemic. The NBP will ensure that in all such cases a future proofed high speed broadband network will be built to serve these premises and work to deliver on this is underway.  </p>  <p>  I am advised by National Broadband Ireland (NBI) that, as of 7 January, over 290,000 premises have been surveyed or have surveys underway with over 154,000 premises constructed or under construction across all counties including Kerry. Surveying is complete in the Deployment Areas of Dingle (Ballydavid), Rathmore and Kilgarvan. Pre works are underway in the Deployment Areas of Ballyheigue and Castlegregory and main works are underway in the Deployment Areas of Tralee and Killarney, with over 5,000 premises now available for order or pre order.</p>  <p>  I am advised by NBI that surveying is currently underway in the area where the premises at Inch is located, with anticipated date for connection in H2 2022.  NBI has also confirmed that the premises located in the Killarney area had an originally anticipated connection date of August 2021 to October 2021 and the anticipated connection date is now February 2022 to April 2022. Given the scale and complexity of the NBP, any dates issued, whilst based on the best available information at the time, are indicative and are subject to change. Many factors, including those beyond NBI&rsquo;s control such as the Covid-19 pandemic, can impact the dates communicated.  On December 2021 the premises was opened for pre-order, resulting in the ability for the resident to place a pre-order for service from a range of providers.</p>  <p>  Further details are available on specific areas within County Kerry through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. NBI has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Question raised regarding the estimated NBI network connection times in County Kerry, the network rollout for the National Broadband Plan is divided into 227 Deployment Areas (DAs) across the country.  These are typically an area of approximately 25km in radius and in total they cover 96% of Ireland&rsquo;s landmass. The architecture of the network design is specifically based on the design of the NBI network coming from the Eir exchanges or the metropolitan area networks (MANs). It is based on an engineering design that allows NBI to reach every premises as quickly as possible working within the confines of how fibre networks are built. Counties are covered by a number of DAs which means there are differing timescales for connection across county areas.</p>  <p>  Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 7 January, 449 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for school BCPs. BCP&rsquo;s are installed in County Kerry at Gneeveguilla (Tureencahill), Cable Station, Saint Fiachna's Church, Railway Station Heritage Centre And Community Space, Killeenagh Killenagh, Kielduff Community Centre, Chapeltown, Cill&iacute;n Liath, Kilmoyley Community Centre, Black Valley (Lady Of The Valley Church). Further details can be found at nbi.ie/bcp-locations/.  </p>  <p>  Boheeshil National School, Dunloe Upper, Coars National School, Scoil N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta Dar Earca, Naomh Charthaigh, Boys National School, Loughfouder National School, Realt Na Maidne, Aghatubrid National School and Scoil N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta Cillin Liathhave been installed by NBI for educational access. My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband, within the Intervention Area, for connection over the term of the NBP. In this regard, an acceleration of this aspect of the National Broadband Plan was announced in December 2020 which will see some 679 primary schools connected to high speed broadband by 2022, well ahead of the original target delivery timeframe of 2026.  Further details are available on the NBI website at nbi.ie/primary-schools-list/. </p></reply>

The AMBER area represents the area to be served by the network to be deployed under the NBP State led intervention.    My Department has made enquiries to see if a commercial broadband network provider would consider connecting this  premises and neighbouring premises to its fibre network. The company stated that this premises is almost 550m from the nearest fibre connection via its network and that the houses to the rear that have fibre are fed from a parallel road and the service provider does not have any plans to serve the additional premises. I appreciate people's frustration when they are living so close to a fibre network but cannot get a connection to that network, particularly given the heightened importance of connectivity during the Covid-19 pandemic. The NBP will ensure that in all such cases a future proofed high speed broadband network will be built to serve these premises and work to deliver on this is underway. </p>  <p>  I am advised by National Broadband Ireland (NBI) that, as of 7 January, over 290,000 premises across all counties have been surveyed. Surveys are complete or underway in County Galway in the Deployment Areas of Galway and Ballinasloe, Gurteen, Kilkerrin, Duniry and Lettermore. Pre-build works are underway in Gort, Athenry, Loughrea and Inverin. In total over 6,800 premises are available to order or pre-order in Galway.</p>  <p>  Further details are available on specific areas within County Galway through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. NBI has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries.</p>  <p>  In addition to the challenges to the delivery of the NBP due to the Covid-19 pandemic, NBI has faced a range of other challenges due to the sheer scale and complexity of rolling out fibre to the home in a rural environment. These include significant tree trimming to ensure cable can be placed on overhead poles, remediation of ducting that has been in place for many decades, the co-ordination of hundreds of contracting crews and addressing the many issues arising week on week which could not have been foreseen until the build crews commenced work on the ground. My Department has worked closely with NBI to put in place a remedial plan under the Contract. This plan addresses delays experienced by NBI, primarily arising as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. Work is underway to re-baseline milestones for 2022 and beyond. This has resulted in some changes to timeframes for connection for end users.  </p>  <p>  Given the scale and complexity of delivery of the new high speed broadband network under the NBP, I am advised that any dates provided by NBI on its website are based on the best available information at the time and may be subject to change. NBI has recently published details of its full deployment schedule on its website, www.nbi.ie, which enables all premises within the intervention area to have an anticipated service activation date range.</p>  <p>  Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 7 January, 449 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for school BCPs. BCP&rsquo;s are installed at Ballinakill Community Centre, Clonberne Community Enterprise Centre, Cortoon Community Centre, Leitrim Community Centre, Halla Pobal Th&iacute;r An Fhia (T&iacute;r An Fhia Community Hall), Clarenbridge Nursing Home, Kilronan Library, Tuam Golf Club, Lackagh Heritage Centre and Museum,  Old Secondary School, Lettermullen Community Centre, Clonfert Community Hall, Inishbofin Community Centre, Sylane Hurling Club, Irish Workhouse Centre and Comhar Na Noile&aacute;n. Further details can be found at nbi.ie/bcp-locations/. </p>  <p>  Carnmore National School, Clontuskert National School, Scoil Mhuire, Ballinakill National School, Briarhill National School, Brownsgrove National School, Mweenish National School, Saint Joesph's National School, Kilcroan National School, Scoil Caomhain, Saint Colman's National School, Ballinlass National School, Scoil Ui Cheithearnaigh, Saint Mary's National School, Cahergal National School, Scoil Seamus Naofa and Scoil Naomh Brighde have been installed by NBI for educational access. My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband, within the Intervention Area, for connection over the term of the NBP. In this regard, an acceleration of this aspect of the National Broadband Plan was announced in December 2020 which will see some 679 primary schools connected to high speed broadband by 2022, well ahead of the original target delivery timeframe of 2026.  Further details are available on the NBI website at nbi.ie/primary-schools-list/.</p></reply>

I have no role in providing any supports for such extraction.    </p>  <p>  Industrial scale peat extraction is subject to a dual consent process requiring planning permission and, for sites over 50 hectares, an Integrated Pollution Control (IPC) licence from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). There has been a history of widespread non-compliance with this dual consent process, with many operators in the sector lacking planning permission and / or an IPC licence.  </p>  <p>  Following a 2019 High Court judgment which re-affirmed, inter alia, that industrial peat extraction absent planning permission constitutes unauthorised development, the onus has been on operators to first regularise their activities via the planning system and then secure the necessary licenses before any recommencement can take place.  </p></reply>

These steps include:</p><p>-  Ireland transposed the SUP (Single Use Plastic) Directive last year. It banned a range of single-use items from July 2021. Further measures will be introduced in the coming years under the SUP, which will significantly reduce the amount of SUP items being placed on the market.</p><p>-  A Deposit Return Scheme for plastic bottles and aluminium cans will be introduced later this year.</p><p>-  All packaging being placed on the market must, by 2030, be reusable or recyclable.</p><p>-  We will examine measures to support increased use of recycled materials in packaging, including the introduction of a virgin plastic levy.</p><p>-  We will support an ambitious approach in discussions with European Commission- focussing on reducing over- packaging and packaging waste while driving design for reuse and recyclability of packaging.</p><p>While I welcome the recent initiative by the French Government, it should be noted that the ban does not necessarily mean that the volume of packaging waste in general will decrease, only that plastic packaging cannot be used for fruit and vegetables. Other non-plastic forms of packaging remain permitted. It should also be noted that as an island nation, the route to market for a significant amount of our food is different to that of France. Transportation distances, the need for longer shelf life, food safety and food waste all have to be considered. I am keen to monitor progress of the French initiative as part of working on an EU wide basis to reduce packaging waste. Ultimately, our focus should be on reducing the volume of all types of packaging.</p></reply>

The SEC process of learning consists of 3 core steps of "Learn" (the SEC Network), "Plan" (the Energy Master Plan Partnership) and "Do". Under this latter stage, the SECs access the various SEAI energy efficiency grants, notably the Community Energy Grant Scheme, to help them progress their identified projects. </p>  <p>  The Community Energy Grant Scheme supports cross-sectoral, partnership approaches that deliver energy savings to a range of building types including public, commercial and community buildings with a particular focus on using the projects to deliver home retrofits. Furthermore, the Scheme is designed to engage all members of the SEC network who wish to participate in delivery of energy efficiency works. </p>  <p>  In 2020, there were a total of 490 SEC members in the network. This increased to 618 at the end of 2021.

A post-works BER (Building Energy Rating) C standard is a minimum requirement for support under the scheme. However, this scheme will transition to the Micro-generation Support Scheme (MSS) as part of the phased introduction of that scheme in 2022. The final design of the MSS was approved by Government on 21 December 2021, and the scheme will open on a phased basis in 2022. The MSS will offer supports for new installations, including solar PV panels, in the form of a capital grant for domestic and small non-domestic applicants, or a premium export tariff for larger non-domestic applicants. Home-owners will continue to be able to apply to the SEAI for a grant towards the cost of installing equipment under the MSS. In 2022, grant amounts under the MSS will be at the same level per kW as the existing SEAI solar PV grant scheme. Under the MSS, buildings will not have to meet a minimum BER standard, even after any new equipment is installed, and homes built pre-2021 will be eligible.</p></reply>

The over-riding objective is to ensure that all packaging placed on the Irish market is reusable or recyclable in an economically viable way by 2030. Measures already actioned include:- The introduction of eco modulated fees which will result in a more favourable rate applying to recyclable plastic packaging over non-recyclable packaging placed on the market.- Transposition of the EU Directive (EU) 2019/904 which saw a ban on a range of single-use plastic items being placed on the Irish market from 3 July 2021.- An awareness campaign in September 2021 announcing that soft plastics can be disposed of in the domestic recycling bin - this was a significant step to increase recycling rates and help to reach future EU recycling targets.- The Separate Collection (Deposit Return Scheme) Regulations 2021, providing the legal framework for the DRS scheme which will become operational across the country in Quarter 3 this year   Other measures contained in the Plan which will be progressed this year include:- A revision to the Packaging Regulations in Q2 of this year which will enact the Programme for Government commitment to end self-compliance as an option for producers placing packaging on the market.- Ongoing engagement with the EU Commission on the review of the essential requirements contained in the Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive.

I propose to take Question Nos 144 and 155  together.</p>  <p>  There are currently two new electricity interconnectors under development to link Ireland's electricity system to France (Celtic interconnector) and to Wales (Greenlink interconnector).</p>  <p>  A revision of the Trans-European Networks for Energy (TEN-E) Regulation has taken place over the last 12 months to facilitate the increased climate objectives contained in the European Green Deal.  Following agreement over a provisional revision of the TEN-E Regulation between negotiators of the Council Presidency and the European Parliament on 15 December, it is anticipated that the revised regulation will be approved by the Council and Parliament during the coming months. </p>  <p>  This revised regulation will subsequently form the legislative basis for selection of the 6th EU Projects of Common Interest (PCI) list for energy infrastructure during 2023-24. The increased focus on the establishment of offshore grids contained in the provisional revised TEN-E Regulation has been strongly advocated for by Ireland during discussions at Council over the last 12 months. </p>  <p>The decision to apply for inclusion on the 6th PCI list will be a matter for individual project promoters of eligible energy infrastructure, including proposed new electricity interconnectors between Ireland and neighbouring countries. It is important to note that my Department will continue to support development of regional offshore grids through the establishment of an appropriate policy framework, engagement with viable proposed new offshore infrastructure projects, and working groups within the North Seas Energy Cooperation (NSEC), of which Ireland will hold the rotating Presidency during 2022. </p></reply>

In the period since 8 December, the following offshore renewable energy related milestones, which are necessary to facilitate realisation of the 5 GW of installed offshore wind by 2030 objective set out in the Climate Action Plan 2021, have been achieved by Government:    - The Maritime Area Planning Act, 2021, was signed into law by the President on the 23 December 2021. The Act represents the biggest reform of marine governance since the foundation of the State and establishes in law a new planning regime for the maritime area. The new consenting regime under the Act will be a key enabler of decarbonisation of Ireland&rsquo;s energy sources and the development of offshore energy.</p>  <p>  - Government has committed to the establishment of the new agency, the Maritime Area Regulatory Authority, by Q1 2023. This agency will inter alia be responsible for assessing applications for Maritime Area Consents by prospective renewable energy projects, which will be a first step that is required for development within Ireland&rsquo;s maritime area. </p>  <p>  - A public consultation on the draft terms and conditions for the first offshore wind auction has been completed. Following assessment of the many consultation responses received, I will seek Government approval on the final terms and conditions later this year. The draft terms and conditions include a mandated community benefit contribution level of &euro;2/MWh, with these obligations to accrue to hosting communities prior to project construction. In order to capture greater local economic and employment benefits, operations and maintenance facilities for projects supported in the first offshore auction will be required to be headquartered in an Irish or Northern Irish port. </p>  <p>  - A public consultation was launched on 20 December regarding the process for Phase Two projects to participate in subsequent offshore wind auctions which will be necessary to meet Government&rsquo;s 5GW target by the end of this decade. </p>  <p>  - A Policy Statement setting out the strategy for commercial ports to facilitate offshore renewable energy activity in the seas around Ireland was published by the Department of Transport on 20 December. </p></reply>

Decarbonising Ireland&rsquo;s electricity system will play a vital role in this transition, and therefore the Government has agreed a more ambitious commitment to increase the proportion of renewable electricity to up to 80% by 2030. This will not only reduce emissions from electricity but will also facilitate the electrification of heating and transport and reduce emissions in these sectors as well. Detailed modelling was undertaken in support of the development of CAP 2021.    In terms of electricity network modelling, ESB Networks (ESBN) concluded a range of system studies and modelling in 2019. These sought to identify the requirements to achieving the electric vehicle and heat-pump electrification targets in the 2019 CAP and the National Development Plan. This included a specifically commissioned study that modelled the cost of the electricity distribution network reinforcement from 2020 to Net-Zero carbon emissions. The results were used as an evidence base in the Price Review process undertaken by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities which saw approval of &euro;3.3 billion capital expenditure on the electricity distribution network for the period 2021-25. </p>  <p>  Action 127 of CAP 2021 requires &ldquo;National distribution system analyses identifying technical requirements to achieve up to 80% renewables and electrification of heat and transport&rdquo; to be completed in 2023. Already, ESBN is assessing what further energy transition modelling is necessary building on the 2019 analysis. In the meantime, it continues to innovate through initiatives such as the National Networks, Local Connections Programme, which seeks to underpin economic growth and reduce the overall cost of investment in the electricity distribution system. </p></reply>

Particulate matter emissions are most closely associated with the domestic burning of solid fuels but can also be the result of burning of waste and other materials. While these spikes are likely linked to increased burning of fuels because of cold weather, the EPA advises that such occasional &ldquo;spikes&rdquo; can also be attributed to other periodic weather conditions such as still air and fog. They are not necessarily indicative of an ongoing problem.</p><p>Nonetheless, the elevated levels of PM2.5 illustrate again that further action is needed to tackle this harmful pollutant. To this end, I am progressing the measures I announced in September 2021 to further regulate the sale, marketing, distribution and use of solid fuels for domestic heating in Ireland. New emissions standards will be introduced across a range of fuels to ensure that the most polluting will no longer be available for sale on the Irish market.  Introducing these standards will improve the quality of the air that we breathe, and the health of the public that we serve.</p></reply>

A prospecting licence relates to the activity of prospecting (exploring) for minerals and does not, if granted, give a licence holder permission to mine. All prospecting licence applications, including renewals, are subject to public consultation giving all stakeholders and local communities an opportunity to make an input. Where a licence holder seeks to have a licence renewed, the application is evaluated by the Geoscience Regulation Office of my Department. Where renewal is proposed, a renewal offer is made to the holder, setting out the terms and area of the prospecting licence. If the holder accepts the offer, legislation requires 21 days&rsquo; public notice of the Minister&rsquo;s intention to renew a prospecting licence and for the receipt of any submissions; in practice a 30 days&rsquo; notice period is allowed, similar to that required for an environmental impact assessment. Notification is given through a printed notice in the newspaper that is most relevant to the prospecting licence area under consideration. The Minister&rsquo;s Intention to Grant Notices is also sent for public display to the appropriate Garda station(s), local authority office(s) and the Geological Survey Ireland.  Additional information on the process of granting prospecting licences and making submissions is available online on my Department's website  <i>. </i></p><p>The current application remains under consideration by my Department and no decision has been made as of yet.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-01-19a.335.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022011900073#WRH03200"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163 and 164 together.  159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 158, 157 and 155  together. </p>  <p>  The all-island Single Electricity Market, which operates in Ireland and Northern Ireland, is overseen by the Single Electricity Market Committee. The Single Electricity Market Committee consists of the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, their Northern Ireland counterparts and an independent member. The market operates independently from me as Minister with the Commission for Regulation of Utilities being solely accountable to a Committee of the Oireachtas.</p>  <p>  I understand that the regulatory authorities have a number of measures in place in the Single Electricity Market to mitigate market power. These include controls on generators&rsquo; bidding under certain circumstances, an obligation on ESB to sell a proportion of its generation output forward based on prices and volumes set by the regulatory authorities and ring-fencing, which is a regulatory measure that is used to separate generation and supply activities within certain vertically integrated companies that have the potential capability to exert market power. While my Department does not monitor the activity of market participants, I understand that the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, through a Market Monitoring Unit monitors the behaviour of market participants in the Single Electricity Market to ensure open and transparent competition. </p>  <p>  The Commission for Regulation of Utilities has processes and procedures in place that allows issues or complaints to be raised.  Any such issues would be investigated and, if breaches of competition rules were established, appropriate actions would be taken as set out in the licence terms and conditions which could include financial penalties. While such investigations are confidential, if any enforcement actions were taken, these would be made public.</p>  <p>  Within the Single Electricity Market there are markets for energy, generation capacity and system services. The energy market includes day ahead and intraday markets. Generators bid into these markets based on market rules, a number of which the Deputy has referenced. The market price is determined by these market rules as the marginal cost of generation capacity required in each half hour of the day. The day ahead market made up 86% of the overall energy market in the last three months of 2021 &ndash; down from 93% the previous year &ndash; and thus provides a key wholesale electricity price benchmark.</p>  <p>  The market price is reduced when there are greater levels of lower cost generation in the market. During periods when there are large amounts of renewable generation &ndash; such as on windy days &ndash; the market price reduces. Combined-cycle gas turbines are the most efficient fossil fuel power stations and so generally have a lower operating cost than other less efficient power stations. As a result, they are generally operating ahead of other power stations which may have higher operating costs. ESB owns and operates four of the ten combined cycle gas turbines currently in the Single Electricity Market. Continued reliable and safe operation of existing, and the development of new, generation capacity is vital to ensure security of electricity supply and provide value for money to consumers.</p>  <p>  The high electricity prices being seen in Ireland and across Europe are a direct result of the significant increases in natural gas prices. The price increases have impacted gas and electricity consumers across Europe and are not unique to the Single Electricity Market in Ireland. In order to reduce the burden on households, the Government has increased the winter fuel allowance by &euro;5 per week and plans to provide &euro;100 support to every residential electricity consumer in Ireland to help alleviate the impact of these higher prices.</p>  <p>  As the Single Electricity Market is operated independently from me as Minister and my Department, the oversight of its operation is a matter for the regulatory authorities. I have not raised any concerns with the regulatory authorities in relation to any specific market participants. </p>  <p>  If the Deputy, market participants or others have any concerns in relation to the operation of the electricity market in Ireland, I would suggest they raise these matters directly with the Commission for Regulation of Utilities which has processes and procedures to deal with and examine any issues raised​.</p></reply>

It is anticipated that the Government will consider the draft policy statement in the coming months. </p>  <p>  The document highlights the role of minerals in our everyday lives and the critical role that they will play in our transition to net zero emissions by 2050. The draft policy recognises that we need to repair, reuse and recycle more minerals and metals, but that this alone will not supply the types and quantities of minerals required to decarbonise our energy through solar power, renewable wind energy and batteries. Relying solely on minerals sourced outside Ireland and the EU risks supporting their development in parts of the world where less stringent environmental and human rights standards apply, as well as risking our ability to secure the minerals required to make the green and digital transitions a reality.</p></reply>

The scheme delivers a range of energy efficiency measures free of charge to lower income households vulnerable to energy poverty. To date over 143,000 homes have received free upgrades under the scheme leaving them better able to afford to heat their homes to an adequate level. During the first 9 months of 2021, the approximate average value of the energy efficiency measures provided per household was &euro;17,100.</p>  <p>  Revisits under this scheme are currently not available. This enables the work programme to prioritise eligible homes that have not previously received free upgrades under the scheme. There are currently over 7,000 homeowners on the Warmer Homes Scheme work programme who have never received any upgrade works under the scheme. The National Retrofit Plan includes a commitment to review ways to improve how current energy poverty schemes target those most in need. Recommendations on the implementation of changes to the scheme to better target those most in need will be finalised shortly.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the grants available through SEAI aim to maximise emission reductions and deliver energy savings for the widest range of homeowners possible. The grants which are available, and their respective eligibility criteria, were selected as the most likely to deliver significant energy savings to homeowners as well as the best value for money for the Exchequer.</p></reply>

Despite the unprecedented challenges presented by the Covid-19 pandemic, National Broadband Ireland has made steady progress on delivery of the new high speed fibre broadband network under the National Broadband Plan with over 290,000 premises surveyed or with survey underway across all counties and 154,000 premises constructed or under construction. NBI has also advised that 54,000 premises are available to order and pre-order across 21 counties as of 7 January 2022. </p>  <p>  NBI&rsquo;s fibre network architecture is centred around existing Openeir exchanges and the State owned Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs). This strategy is based on engineering design principles that allows every premises to be passed as quickly and as efficiently as possible. The fibre network is divided up into 227 Deployment Areas (DA). Each Deployment Area is centred around existing Regional or Local Exchanges. NBI commenced the rollout in the 33 Deployment Areas across Ireland (at least 1 per county where possible) that have regional exchanges as these exchanges already have an established connection back to existing data centres. Regional exchanges are mostly located near urban areas. Once NBI install their equipment in the regional exchange and from there to the data centres, they can then install their equipment in the neighbouring local exchanges and connect them back to the regional exchange.</p>  <p>  In terms of County Clare, the regional exchanges are located in the Limerick and Gort Deployment Areas with local exchanges in Kilkishen, Feakle, Ogonnelloe, Corfin, Tiermaclane, Labasheeda, Kilrush, Milltown Malbay, Lisdoonvarna and Behagh. In line with the rollout of the regional exchanges, NBI started works in the Limerick Deployment Area and Gort Deployment Area and these exchanges are enabled supporting the first Premises to be passed in County Clare. Work is ongoing on the Kilkishen Deployment Area and the local exchange is due to be enabled in H2 2022. To date, NBI has surveyed more than 7,900 premises and over 1,500 premises can either order or pre-order today. </p>  <p>  Further details are available on specific areas within County Clare through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. NBI has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries.</p>  <p>  Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 7 January, 449 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for school BCPs. BCP&rsquo;s are installed in County Clare at Loop Head Lighthouse, Caherconnell Stone Fort, Obair Family Centre, Loughraney Kids Playschool, Michael Cusack Visitor Centre and Cree Community Centre. Further details can be found at nbi.ie/bcp-locations/. </p>  <p>  Kilmurry McMahon National School, Shragh National School, Ennistymon National School, Saint John The Baptist National School, Furraglaun Primary School, Moneen National School, Clooney National School and Stonehall National School have been installed by NBI for educational access.  My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband, within the Intervention Area, for connection over the term of the NBP. In this regard, an acceleration of this aspect of the National Broadband Plan was announced in December 2020 with an ambition to connect some 679 schools to high speed broadband by the end of 2022, well ahead of the original target delivery timeframes across the NBP fibre program. Further details of schools in scope are available on the NBI website at nbi.ie/primary-schools-list.</p></reply>

Analysis carried out in 2016 for the Strategy to Combat Energy Poverty found that 28% of households in Ireland could be in energy poverty on the basis of needing to spend more than 10% of their income on their energy needs. Good progress has been made since the launch of the Strategy as evidenced by ESRI analysis of the number of households at risk of experiencing energy poverty in 2019 and 2020. This showed that the share of households needing to spend more than 10% of their income on their energy needs was 17.5% in 2020. The Survey on Income and Living Conditions supports this, indicating that the proportion of people who report that they are unable to afford to keep the home adequately warm, has fallen from 9% in 2015 to 3.4% in 2020.    Government policy to alleviate energy poverty for a number of years has focused on supplementing lower income households through the Fuel Allowance and other payments, as well as providing free energy efficiency upgrades through the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland schemes and the Social Housing retrofitting programme. </p>  <p>  Budget 2022 has allocated &euro;202 million for SEAI residential and community retrofit schemes. Over half of this (&euro;109 million) will be used to provide free energy efficiency upgrades to households that are in, or at risk of, energy poverty. The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage will invest a further &euro;85 million as part of the Social Housing Retrofit Programme this year. Overall, this represents an allocation of &euro;194 million to retrofitting homes of those most at risk of energy poverty - an increase of &euro;20 million on the 2021 allocation. Budget 2022 also provided for a &euro;5 increase to the Fuel Allowance to &euro;33 per week, or &euro;924 per year, as well as an extension of the eligibility criteria for the payment, by the Minister for Social Protection. </p>  <p>  In addition a scheme to credit all domestic electricity account holders with up to &euro;100 in 2022 was approved by Government in December 2021. This payment is one of a suite of measures to mitigate the effects of the recent significant rises in electricity prices, which includes support through the social protection system. Approximately 2.1 million domestic electricity account holders will benefit from the scheme for a one-off, exceptional payment to their electricity accounts. The scheme will apply to all domestic accounts, including pay as you go customers.</p>  <p>  Protections are also in place for customers falling into arrears on their energy bills. Under the supplier led voluntary Energy Engage Code, suppliers will not disconnect a customer who is engaging with them. Suppliers must also provide every opportunity to customers to avoid disconnection and must identify customers at risk of disconnection and encourage them to engage as early as possible.</p>  <p>  A review of the implementation of the Strategy to Combat Energy Poverty will be completed in Q1 2022 and will inform next steps in relation to the development of a new strategy. Measures to support those least able to afford to retrofit their homes have also been included in the new National Retrofit Plan, published as part of the Climate Action Plan last year.</p></reply>

This Office will play an important role in our transition to zero emission vehicles. It will co-ordinate measures to support the uptake of EVs and the rollout of charge point  infrastructure.</p><p>In terms of existing supports for public charging, the Public Charge Point Scheme, which is administered by the SEAI, continues to be available during 2022 to provide local authorities with a grant of up to &euro;5,000 to support the development of on-street public chargers. The primary focus of the scheme is to provide support for the installation of infrastructure which will facilitate owners of electric vehicles, who do not have access to a private parking space, but instead rely on parking their vehicles in public places near their homes to charge their EVs. It should be noted that this scheme facilitates the installation of standard charge points.</p><p>Thirteen local authorities have been in touch with SEAI in relation to the scheme.  To date, letters of offer have issued to Louth County Council and Dublin City Council in 2021, to install a total of 29 charge points within their administrative areas. <table>    <tr>       <th>Item</th>       <th>Count</th>       <th>Charging Stations</th>       <th>Charging Points*</th>       <th>Value (Total)</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Applications Approved</td>       <td>3</td>       <td>19</td>       <td>29</td>       <td>&euro;143,038</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Applications Expired/Cancelled/Rejected</td>       <td>-</td>       <td>-</td>       <td></td>       <td>-</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Applications Under Review</td>       <td>-</td>       <td>-</td>       <td></td>       <td>-</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total Applications</td>       <td>3</td>       <td>19</td>       <td>29</td>       <td>&euro;143,038</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>*A charging station can be dual which results in two charge points being available for cars to use.</p><p>There were no charge points constructed under this scheme in 2020 or 2021 respectively. My Department is currently reviewing the Scheme to ensure that it is as effective as possible in driving the decarbonisation effort.</p><p>There is also a need for a seamless public charging network that will provide for situations or instances where home charging is not possible such as on-street and residential charging, destination charging, and workplace charging. </p><p>&euro;10 million was committed from the Climate Action Fund to support ESB investment in the charging network and this has leveraged a further &euro;10 million investment from ESB, with the infrastructure to be in place by the end of 2022. This intervention alone will result in:</p><p>- 90 additional high power chargers, each capable of charging two vehicles</p><p>- 52 additional fast chargers, which may replace existing standard chargers</p><p>- 264 replacement standard chargers with more modern technology and with each consisting of two charge points</p><p>Further details on the progression of this project can be found at esb.ie/ecars/our-network/network-upgrades.</p><p>My Department is also developing a new scheme which will support the installation of destination charge points in locations such as hotels, visitor centres and parks. This new initiative will help provide another critical link in the overall network for public charging.</p></reply>

As such, I welcomed the report from the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action on reducing emissions in the transport sector by 51% by 2030 and read the recommendations with great interest.  </p>  <p>  However, as Minister for Transport, while I am responsible for the policy and overall funding of public transport, I am not responsible for its day-to-day operations nor decisions on fares. The National Transport Authority (NTA) has the statutory responsibility for the regulation of fares in relation to public passenger transport services and for securing the provision of those services by way of public transport services contracts, in respect of services that are socially necessary but commercially unviable. The funding of those services comprises both the fares paid by passengers and the subvention payments from the Exchequer. The main purpose of the subvention payment is to meet the gap between income from fares and the cost of operating services.</p>  <p>  Any assessment of a proposed change to public transport fare structures would be a matter for the NTA to consider in the first instance.  I have, therefore, referred the Deputy's question to the NTA for direct reply.  Please advise my private office if you do not receive a reply within ten working days.</p></reply>

I am acutely aware of the concerns outlined in the report in relation to the cost of transport, particularly personalised or individualised transport requirements for Persons with Disabilities, and acknowledge the important role that transport plays in all our lives.</p>  <p>  I must emphasis to the Deputy that specialised non-public (closed) door-to-door services do not fall under my aegis; nevertheless, I am fully committed to strengthening our public transport offerings  and progressively making them accessible for all, especially for Persons with Disabilities, Persons with Reduced Mobility and Older People. In this regard, I have secured &euro;15.35 million to retrofit older infrastructure and facilities, and through the National Transport Authority (NTA), we will use this funding in 2022 to roll out more accessible bus stops, wheelchair accessible taxis and improve train stations accessibility. In addition, the NTA will continue to support Persons with Disabilities to travel independently on the public transport network through initiatives such as the Just A Minute (JAM) Card and the provision of Disability Awareness Training to public transport staff. Furthermore, in rural Ireland, where currently more than 90% of Local Link services are accessible, the new Connecting Ireland Rural Mobility Plan aims to provide greater access to public transport services for all users, through increasing the frequency and number of routes provided.</p>  <p>  My Department is also spearheading a number of initiatives focused on reducing the cost of public transport services, including the recently introduced 90-minute fare and the development of Next Generation Ticketing. Furthermore, I have secured &euro;25 million to introduce a youth travel card which will allow any person nationwide who is between 19 and 23 years old to avail of discounted travel costs. Collectively, these measures will benefit all members of society, including those with hidden disabilities and/or who may not qualify for the Free Travel Scheme.</p>  <p>  Additionally, starting Q1 2022, my Department and the NTA will be actively collaborating with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, through a Working Group arising from National Disability Inclusion Strategy (NDIS) and Make Work Pay Report, to review of the current provision of disability transport and mobility schemes across Government Departments, agencies, and local authorities. The aim of the group is to develop a plan to enhance options for travel to work or employment for persons with Disabilities, efficiently utilising available transport resources. We will also continue our membership on the NDIS Steering Group, working together with the other Departments and Agencies that have responsibility for individualised, personalised transport support schemes.</p></reply>

It accounts for circa 80% of EV charging sessions and will continue to be the primary method of charging in the future.</p>  <p>  The Government has introduced a requirement that new buildings and those undergoing substantial renovation works will have to include charging points for electric vehicles if they have more than 10 car parking spaces. </p>  <p>  The EV Home Charger Grant Scheme has been in operation since January 2018 to support the installation of home chargers for purchasers of new and second-hand BEVs and PHEVs.  The grant provides generous support towards the full cost of installation of a home charger up to a maximum of &euro;600. As regards existing apartment buildings, work is currently being progressed to expand the EV home charger grant to include shared parking in apartment blocks and similar developments. My Department is working closely with the SEAI and expects a scheme for apartments to open shortly.</p>  <p>  In terms of existing supports for public charging, the Public Charge Point Scheme continues to be available during 2022 to provide local authorities with a grant of up to &euro;5,000 to support the development of on-street public chargers. The primary focus of the scheme is to provide support for the installation of infrastructure which will facilitate owners of electric vehicles, who do not have access to a private parking space, but instead rely on parking their vehicles in public places near their homes to charge their EVs. My Department is reviewing the Scheme at present to ensure that it is as effective as possible in driving the decarbonisation effort and which will support installation of public chargers particularly in areas without own driveway.</p>  <p>  In addition, the national charging infrastructure strategy will consider this issue in particular and develop proposals to address the current disparity between homeowners with and without off street parking.</p></reply>

One of the issues examined was eligibility for the scheme. Disability groups in particular were unhappy at the fact that some people were being issued with Disabled Parking Permits because they had particular medical conditions rather than an actual mobility impairment. As a result of the review, the scheme was revised so that permits are now given on the basis of mobility impairment rather than the diagnosis of a particular condition or illness. This is in line with the original intention of the scheme.</p>  <p>  The possibility of extending the eligibility criteria for the scheme, to include people with autism or with certain forms of intellectual or cognitive impairment, has been raised on a number of occasions. My department has consulted extensively with the joint issuing authorities of the scheme, who also represent people with disabilities, the Disabled Drivers Association of Ireland and the Irish Wheelchair Association, on this matter. In light of this consultation, there are currently no plans to change the criteria.</p>  <p>I must particularly emphasise to the Deputy that issuing a large number of extra permits by extending the eligibility criteria would put the existing scheme under significant additional pressure and compromise the availability of disabled parking spaces for those with restricted mobility who are currently eligible.   </p></reply>

This funding represents 100% of eligible operational expenditure, in the areas of safety and security, at these airports in 2021.  Targeting funding at vital operations at the airports such as air traffic control, fire services and security, ensures airports can continue to remain compliant with regulatory requirements in these areas. </p><p>The remaining &euro;93 million was provided under the Supplementary Supports Scheme to Irish Airports. The EU&rsquo;s Temporary Framework for State aid measures to support the economy in the current emergency of COVID-19, and Article 107(2)(b) of the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), provide the basis for funding under this Scheme.</p><p>Funding to our smaller regional airports under the Temporary Framework covers the difference between earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) from 1 March 2020 and 31 December 2021, up to a maximum of &euro;1.8m per airport, compared to a comparable period in 2019.  The aid is in the form of a direct grant. Uncovered fixed costs incurred during the period between 1 March 2020 and 31 December 2021 have also been supported under the Temporary Framework. </p><p>I am pleased to say that the funding allocated to our smaller regional airports of Donegal, Knock and Kerry means that these airports are being fully compensated for the damage caused by Covid during 2020 and 2021, to the maximum amounts allowable under the Temporary Framework. </p><p>Funding to Dublin, Cork and Shannon Airports has been allocated under a Damages Measure under the TFEU. The purpose of this measure is to compensate the State airports for losses incurred as a direct effect of the containment measures adopted by the Irish Government in the period 1 April to 30 June 2020. The difference in EBIT from 1 April to 30 June in 2020 and 2019 was assessed when determining funding allocations. Funding was then allocated to each airport on a pro-rata basis in line with 2019 passenger numbers and calculated in accordance with the eligibility criteria of all measures under the approved State aid Scheme. This funding will continue to compensate airports for the damage caused as a result of Covid, by providing State airports with flexibility to roll out discounts on airport charges, with a view to supporting the recovery and restoration of strategic connectivity, including on long-haul routes, for Ireland.</p><p>Further information on the Regional Airports Programme 2021-2025, the Covid-19 Regional State Airports Programme 2021 as well as the Supplementary Support Scheme to Irish Airports, including eligibility criteria, is available here gov.ie - Irelands Regional Airports Programme 2021-2025 (www.gov.ie)</p></reply>

This Programme mirrored the focus, including the sustainability objectives, of the Regional Airports Programme. Shannon Airport was allocated almost &euro;11.9m in funding under this Programme in 2021.  </p>  <p>  This funding was in addition to the provision of an allocation of capital funding to Shannon Airport of almost &euro;6.3m for a Hold Baggage Screening project and an Embankments project in 2021.  An additional &euro;5.5m was also provided to Shannon Airport under the Department's Covid Supplementary Support Scheme to Irish airports. This funding will provide Shannon Airport with flexibility to roll out route incentives/charge rebates, in consultation with airlines, with a view to supporting recovery and growth of connectivity.</p>  <p>  In 2022, due to suppressed passenger numbers in 2020 and 2021 Shannon Airport has now become eligible for funding under the Regional Airports Programme 2021-2025.  This year, funding of &euro;36 million is available under this Programme, supporting Shannon Airport and the other eligible regional airports of Cork, Ireland West, Donegal and Kerry.  This budget allocation represents a significant increase in funding available under the Programme in 2022, which takes account of the broadening of the Programme to include both Shannon and Cork Airports.</p>  <p>  Beyond 2022, Shannon Airport will only remain eligible for funding under the Regional Airports Programme while annual passenger numbers, in the preceding two years,  remain suppressed under 1 million.  However the aviation supports totaling over &euro;23.6m provided to Shannon Airport in 2021 is a clear indication of the importance Government attaches to Shannon Airport being well positioned to weather the current crisis and for recovery and growth into the future. As was the case in 2021, Government will continue to keep Aviation Supports under review in 2022.  </p></reply>

Accordingly, proper administration and enforcement of driver disqualification is critical to safety on our roads. The disqualification of drivers and the enforcement of the various provisions is a shared responsibility of the Road Safety Authority (RSA), the Courts Service, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and my Department.</p>  <p>  Where a driver is convicted and given a driving disqualification by the Courts, the current process involves the Courts Service entering the details on their own Criminal Case Tracking System (CCTS), and then manually printing and sending the disqualification notices to the RSA external provider. The external provider subsequently records the details of the disqualification on the driver record on the Department National Vehicle and Driver File (NVDF), on behalf of the RSA. </p>  <p>  A project is now underway to provide for electronic transfer of such driver disqualifications details to the NVDF,  once the time period to lodge an appeal has passed, and no appeal has been lodged.

It is envisaged that the new automated process will be completed by the end of Q1, 2022. </p>  <p>  I understand that the role of the provider itself is broader than just entry of such driver disqualifications on the NVDF.

This means reducing deaths on Ireland&rsquo;s roads annually from 144 to 72 or lower and reducing serious injuries from 1,259 to 630 or lower by 2030. It will also be the first step in Ireland&rsquo;s journey towards realising Vision Zero, i.e., no deaths or serious injuries by 2050. </p>  <p>  The Strategy will be conducted over three phases, with Action Plans for each.  The Action Plan for the first phase, 2021-2024, is available here - rsa.ie/docs/default-source/default-document-library/government_road_safety_strategy_action_plan_2021_2024_13th_dec21_final.pdf?sfvrsn=ec8d58d1_3.  Action Plans for the subsequent phases (2025 &ndash; 2027 and 2028 &ndash; 2030) will be developed in the 6 months leading up to those phases and will take account of the prevailing circumstances at those times. </p></reply>

The Greenway projects to be funded are shown in Appendix 1 below, showing the status of each project. As can been seen, eight projects (including two divided into phases) will be under construction next year, some of which will be completed. There are many more Greenway projects further back in the project lifecycle. Overall, next year circa 40 projects will be progressed (some further divided into phases). Approximately 900km of Greenways will be in pre- construction and 150km will be constructed in 2022; this compares to circa 850km and 125km respectively for 2021.</p>  <p>  NCN - &euro;0.4m</p>  <p>  The development of a National Cycle Network (NCN) will be allocated circa &euro;0.4m for 2022. The NCN should provide for a coherent and integrated national cycle network, combining Active Travel and Greenways, to guide both cycling users and future investment. The NCN is being developed by TII, in conjunction with the NTA and other stakeholders, under Departmental oversight. It is under development with a view to issuing a draft for public consultation in the Spring.</p>  <p>  Research - &euro;0.13m</p>  <p>  Funding is to be allocated to TII for research which will assist with the monitoring and evaluation of the Greenway network, for example user and surveys and &ldquo;Value for Money&rdquo; analyses. </p>  <p>  Greenway Interpretation, Failte Ireland - &euro;0.75m </p>  <p>  It is estimated that a budget of up to &euro;750K will allow for the development of a comprehensive suite of content (drones, video, stills etc) by F&aacute;ilte Ireland specific to each of the Greenways already established and also for those coming on stream in 2022.

While recent months saw a welcome return of demand, with the National Transport Authority (NTA) reporting 86% of drivers back working in October, the recent increase in infection rates late last year gave rise to the necessary reintroduction of a number of Covid related restrictions. Conscious of the potential impact of such restrictions on affected sectors and society in general, the Government has sought to ensure that any restrictions are targeted and appropriate and is continuing to closely monitor the situation as it develops. </p>  <p>  In the meantime, I can confirm that the vast majority of measures that we have taken to support the taxi industry from the start of the pandemic remain in place and, as such, I do not consider that there is a need to introduce new or additional supports.</p>  <p>  I understand that as many as 70% of SPSV drivers availed of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment at the height of the pandemic. As the Deputy may be aware, the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) has been reopened for a limited time to support people who lose their employment as a result of the new COVID public health restrictions from Tuesday 7 December 2021. Self-employed SPSV operators can continue to claim the PUP and earn up to &euro;960 in a given 8-week period, net of expenses. </p>  <p>   In addition, support for SPSV operators continues to be available through a series of specific measures designed to support the sector, with a view to addressing statutory costs faced by operators which cannot be deferred. Standard licence renewal fees for SPSVs were waived in 2021 and are being waived again in 2022 at an estimated cost of &euro;3 million. The NTA has put in place schemes to refund the Motor Tax paid by SPSV operators in the period 1 September 2021 to 31 August 2022 and to waive NCT fees for the same period. Further details on these schemes are available on the NTA website. </p>  <p>  The NTA has also waived standard age limits for taxis and hackneys through to the end of 2022, thereby ensuring no operator exits the industry simply because of the need to replace a vehicle. </p>  <p>  Many of the major costs faced by SPSV operators, such as insurance and dispatch operator fees, can be deferred or cancelled during a period of inactivity. </p>  <p>  Recognising that the replacement of a vehicle is the single largest cost faced by any SPSV operator, and in view of my commitment to support the transition of the SPSV fleet towards zero/low-emission vehicles, we have confirmed that there will be a further reiteration of the current eSPSV Grant Scheme this year, following the allocation of funding as part of the Budget 2022 process. </p>  <p>  There was an exceptionally high take up rate for the eSPSV grant scheme in 2021: it received a total of 1,488 applications, and, at the beginning of November, approximately &euro;8.5 million had been paid to applicants with the remainder of funding allocated to applicants with current provisional grant offers.  In addition, Microfinance Ireland announced on 9 September that a loan finance up to &euro;25,000 was available to support applicants to the Scheme, as many SPSV owners were finding it difficult to secure finance from banks and other commercial lending providers.  Further information on this facility is available from Microfinance Ireland.</p></reply>

Accordingly, residential property owners in estates not yet taken in charge benefit from the expenditure of these proceeds in the same way as the owners of other residential properties in the general locality in terms of the provision of public roads, footpaths, lighting, open spaces, surface water drainage and other public amenities. LPT is accordingly payable, regardless of whether or not an estate has been taken in charge.  </p>  <p>  The relevant planning and development matters fall  under the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage. </p></reply>

This Office is an important element of the Government's ambitious insurance reform programme to help to enhance competition, reduce costs and increase the availability of cover.</p>  <p>  Since its establishment, the Office has held over 60 meetings with a wide range of stakeholders including insurance companies, representative bodies, civil society groups and state regulators on issues surrounding competition.  Minister Fleming also recently met with the CEOs of the major insurance providers in Ireland to discuss a variety of issues with them, including expanding their risk appetite in underserved areas, such as those raised by the Deputy. Furthermore he has also met with niche providers who are seeking to expand their cover here.</p>  <p>  Separately, the Office is also working closely with the IDA to bring, where possible, new entrants into the Irish insurance market and to improve the market's overall competitiveness. Officials are seeking to leverage the ongoing reform work for potential new market entrants and are identifying targets to engage with. This will, in the first instance, seek out providers who offer insurance in areas which have been identified as &lsquo;pinch-points&rsquo; in the Irish market where some customers are encountering difficulties. </p>  <p>  In conclusion, this Government is committed to securing a more sustainable and competitive market through seeking to deepen and widen the supply of insurance in Ireland. In this regard, it is my intention to work with colleagues across Government departments to ensure the timely implementation of the Action Plan as the best means of helping deliver this, including for community centres as outlined in the Deputy&rsquo;s question.</p></reply>

In general, such capital allowances are claimed at a rate of 12.5% annually, over eight years.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that capital expenditure incurred on a food waste biodigester by a person carrying on a trade in the hospitality sector would appear to represent expenditure on plant and machinery for the purposes of capital allowances, and therefore to qualify for tax relief under current rules.</p></reply>

The EWSS has been a key component of the Government&rsquo;s response to the Covid-19 crisis. It is an economy-wide scheme that operates across all sectors.</p>  <p>  In money terms, the overall support provided to-date (13th January) by EWSS is over &euro;7 billion comprising direct subsidy payments of  &euro;6.12 billion and PRSI forgone of &euro;956 million to 51,900 employers in respect of over 706,700 employees.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, as announced on 9th December the enhanced rates of EWSS subsidy would apply for a further two months, December 2021 and January 2022. This will give certainty to businesses when they need it most.</p>  <p>  The Government and I have been clear that there will be no cliff edge to supports for employers but we have also been clear that the EWSS cannot run indefinitely, nor is it sustainable to continue with the enhanced rates for a prolonged period of time given the very substantial costs to the Exchequer.</p>  <p>  As such, from 1 February 2022, the original two-rate structure of &euro;203 per week and &euro;151.50 per week will apply; for March and April 2022 the flat rate subsidy of &euro;100 per week will apply and the scheme will end on 30 April 2022.</p>  <p>  In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s specific question, the Government further announced on the 21 December 2021, that the EWSS will reopen for certain businesses who would otherwise not be eligible and that such businesses can continue to be supported until the expiry of the scheme on 30 April 2022. The new arrangements for EWSS will provide employers who have previously availed of EWSS but who are no longer eligible, with the opportunity to re-qualify for the scheme where they meet certain conditions. Broadly, to re-qualify the business must experience a 30% reduction in turnover, or customer orders during a particular reference period. Further details of the qualifying conditions can be located on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link- www.gov.ie/en/press-release/bf5d1-government-announces-significant-expansion-of-supports-for-businesses-affected-by-the-latest-public-health-restrictions/.</p>  <p>  Employers that qualify for re-entry to the scheme will receive support on a prospective basis from 1 January 2022 onwards, and they can remain in the scheme until its expiry date (30 April 2022).</p>  <p>  Finally, as has been the case throughout the pandemic, the Government will continue to monitor developments closely.</p></reply>

The legislation governing the HTB scheme is set out in section 477C of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  </p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue as follows:</p>  <p>  In addition to requiring that the new property is occupied as the sole or main residence of a first-time purchaser, the legislation also defines a &lsquo;qualifying residence&rsquo; for the purposes of the scheme.  The legislation is very specific as to the definition of a qualifying residence.  It must be a new building which was not, at any time, used or suitable for use as a dwelling. Thus, for a property to qualify for the HTB scheme, it must not previously, at any time, have been used as a dwelling, or been suitable for use as a dwelling. </p>  <p>  Revenue Tax and Duty Manual 15-01-46  outlines further guidance on what would be considered a &ldquo;new&rdquo; house. </p>  <p>  As regards the specific case outlined in the Deputy&rsquo;s question, given that the house was completed in 2012 and has been occupied for many years, albeit by the ultimate purchaser, the house would not be considered a qualifying residence for the purposes of HTB as it was previously suitable for use as a dwelling, and was in fact so used.  In such circumstances, HTB relief would not be available.</p></reply>

This introduced additional time limits for complaints in respect of a &ldquo;long-term financial service&rdquo;. These expanded time limits were included in the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman Act 2017 which established the FSPO. The definition of long term financial service was further refined in 2018 to ensure greater protections for consumers. It is not proposed to make further amendments to the time limits within the Act at this time.</p>  <p>  I would also add that section 51 of the Act, governing time limits, prescribes that any complaint about a "long-term financial service", can be made not only within the standard period of six years of the date of the conduct complained of, but also within a period of three years of a certain "date of knowledge" as prescribed within the Act. In addition, the Ombudsman has a statutory discretion, regarding such complaints, to extend the time where there are reasonable grounds for requiring a longer period and it would be just and equitable in all the circumstances to do so.</p>  <p>  I am advised that any jurisdictional determination, including in relation to time limits, is made by the Ombudsman on the basis of an in-depth assessment of the evidence available regarding the complaint, to ensure that the provisions of the Act are observed.</p></reply>

This means that , even if it were permitted by the Directive, a reduction in the rate of VAT on building materials would not lead to a reduction in the cost of supplying new homes because the VAT charged on the materials and services used in construction is already recoverable by the suppliers of the homes. </p></reply>

This position is reinforced by EU legislation, specifically the Solvency II Directive.</p>  <p>  However, this point notwithstanding, the Government is committed to reforming the Irish insurance environment through delivery of the Action Plan for Insurance Reform. </p>  <p>  One of the key developments to date is the new Office to Promote Competition in the Insurance Market, which is chaired by Minister of State Fleming. This Office is an important element of the Government's ambitious insurance reform programme to help to enhance competition, reduce costs and increase the availability of cover.</p>  <p>  Since its establishment, the Office has held over 60 meetings with a wide range of stakeholders including insurance companies, representative bodies, civil society groups and state regulators on issues surrounding competition.  Minister Fleming also recently met with the CEOs of the major insurance providers in Ireland to discuss a variety of issues with them, including expanding their risk appetite in underserved areas, such as those raised by the Deputy. Furthermore, he has also met with niche providers who are seeking to expand their cover here.</p>  <p>  Separately, the Office is also working closely with the IDA to bring, where possible, new entrants into the Irish insurance market and to improve the market's overall competitiveness. Officials are seeking to leverage the ongoing reform work for potential new market entrants and are identifying targets to engage with. This will, in the first instance, seek out providers who offer insurance in areas which have been identified as &lsquo;pinch-points&rsquo; in the Irish market where some customers are encountering difficulties. </p>  <p>  In conclusion, this Government is committed to securing a more sustainable and competitive market through deepening and widening the supply of insurance in Ireland. In this regard, it is my intention to work with colleagues across Government departments to ensure the timely implementation of the Action Plan as the best means of helping deliver this, including for the sectors outlined in the Deputy&rsquo;s question.</p></reply>

Profits or gains arising from the sale of stud greyhound services is generally considered a trading activity and any income from the sale of those services and related activities must be taken into account in computing the taxable income of the trade. </p>  <p>  In determining whether an individual is trading, each situation would need to be considered based on its own particular facts.  As set out above, whether the proceeds of sale are taxable or fall outside the scope of income tax for the individual depends on whether the sale is made as part of a trading activity or a hobby activity.  </p>  <p>  In relation to Value-Added Tax (VAT), the VAT rating of goods and services is subject to EU VAT law, with which Irish VAT law must comply. In general, the EU VAT Directive provides that supplies of goods and services are chargeable to VAT at the standard rate. However, Ireland by way of derogation from the general rule is permitted to continue to apply a reduced rate, currently 13.5%, to the supply of live greyhounds. </p>  <p>  Under VAT law, traders/businesses are required to register for VAT where their taxable supplies exceed certain thresholds.  Where a VAT-registered trader/business is engaged in the sale of live greyhounds they are required to charge VAT on those supplies at the appropriate reduced rate.</p>  <p>  Individuals acting in their private capacity are not VAT-registered traders, and so they are generally not required to charge VAT on anything they sell, including live greyhounds.</p></reply>

In order to qualify for relief, the applicant must hold a Primary Medical Certificate issued by the relevant Senior Area Medical Officer (SAMO) or a Board Medical Certificate issued by the Disabled Driver Medical Board of Appeal. Certain other qualifying criteria apply in relation to the vehicle, in particular that it must be specially constructed or adapted for use by the applicant. In the event that a PMC is not granted by the relevant Senior Area Medical Officer an appeal may be made to the independent Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal (DDMBA) who operate out of the National Rehabilitation Hospital in Dun Laoghaire. I have no role in relation to the granting or refusal of PMCs and the HSE and the Medical Board of Appeal must be independent in their clinical determinations.  </p>  <p>  The medical criteria were included in the Finance Act 2020, by way of amendment to Section 92 of the Finance Act 1989. This amendment arises from legal advice in light of the June 2020 Supreme Court judgement that the medical criteria in secondary legislation was not deemed to be invalid, nevertheless it was found to be inconsistent with the mandate provided in Section 92 of the Finance Act 1989 (primary legislation).</p>  <p>  I can confirm that a request for an appeal from the individual named in the details supplied, was received on 20th December 2021. The members of the DDMBA wrote to me recently tendering their resignation from the Board. Work is now ongoing in my Department to appoint a new Board as quickly as possible.

It is hoped to move this process along as quickly as possible so that appeals can recommence early in the new year. </p>  <p>  I should point out that assessments by the HSE are continuing to take place.</p></reply>

Where the age exemption applies the claimant&rsquo;s income will be exempt from income tax in that year.</p>  <p>  The age exemption applies for any year of assessment where an individual is aged 65 years or over and his or her total income does not exceed &euro;18,000. Where an individual is a married person or civil partner and is jointly assessed to tax, the age exemption will apply where either individual is aged 65 or over and where the couple&rsquo;s total income does not exceed &euro;36,000. The relevant income thresholds may be increased further if the individual has a qualifying child. The thresholds are increased by &euro;575 in respect of both the first and second child, and &euro;830 in respect of each subsequent child.</p>  <p>  Marginal relief may be available where the individual&rsquo;s or couple&rsquo;s income exceeds the relevant exemption limit but is less than twice that amount. Where marginal relief applies the individual or couple is taxed at 40% on all income above the exemption limit to a ceiling of twice the exemption limit.  Once the income exceeds twice the exemption limit marginal relief is no longer available and the individual pays tax under the normal tax system.  It should be noted, however, that where the individual&rsquo;s income is greater than the exemption limit but below twice that limit, the taxpayer is always given the benefit of the more favourable treatment between the use of marginal relief or the normal tax system of credits and bands.     </p>  <p>  Further guidance on the application of the age exemption and marginal relief can be found on Revenue&rsquo;s website in Tax and Duty Manual Part 07-01-18, which may be accessed at the links below:</p>  <p>  - Revenue website: www.revenue.ie/en/personal-tax-credits-reliefs-and-exemptions/marital-and-civil-status/exemption-and-marginal-relief/marginal-relief.aspx</p>  <p>  - Tax and Duty Manual: www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/tdm/income-tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax/part-07/07-01-18.pdf.</p>  <p>  The age exemption limits were last increased in Budget 2008. In common with other personal tax credits and reliefs, and in the context of the financial crisis, they were reduced to their current levels in Finance Act 2011.</p>  <p>  Additional guidance on a range of other tax credits and reliefs which may be available for individuals over 65 years of age can be found in Tax and Duty Manual Part 15-01-26, which can be located at the following link &ndash; Tax and Duty Manual: www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/tdm/income-tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax/part-15/15-01-26.pdf.  </p>  <p>  In addition, it is also worth pointing out that the State Contributory Pension and the State Non-Contributory Pension are not chargeable to Universal Social Charge or Pay Related Social Insurance.</p></reply>

If employers subsequently determine they are not eligible, or they wish to voluntarily remove themselves from the scheme, they can do so by removing the marker from the submissions and repaying the subsidies claimed, without contacting Revenue.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that it undertakes a multi-faceted approach to compliance checks to safeguard the integrity of the EWSS.   This includes real time risk-based checking of submissions and cross-referencing claim data against other Revenue data sources to identify anomalies or trends requiring attention.  The real time checking procedures are supported by engagement with employers, to facilitate timely resolution of issues, and to ensure employers claim the correct EWSS entitlement, or cease claiming where they no longer have an entitlement.   </p>  <p>  I am further advised that Revenue is also carrying out a risk-focused follow-up program of compliance interventions.  In most instances, agreement is reached and any EWSS overpaid is recouped or the liability is warehoused under the Debt Warehouse Scheme.   Where issues are identified and agreement is not reached, Revenue will raise a notice of assessment which is collectible in the same manner as any outstanding tax. Employers have the right to submit an appeal to the Tax Appeals Commission (TAC) within 30 days of the assessment.   There are currently 60 assessments raised for the amount of &euro;5.1 million of which 4 have been appealed for the amount of &euro;1million.    </p>  <p>  Revenue have audited 212 registered companies under the EWSS via their compliance programme to 31 December 2021.  Revenue have advised that 77 of these audits have been finalised, yielding almost &euro;1.5 million and 135 are ongoing.  An additional 5,594 registered employers have been subject to a compliance check under the compliance programme to 31 December 2021. Overall, Revenue has finalised EWSS related interventions with 3,500 employers, recouping &euro;19.2 million, which equates to 0.3% of the total subsidy paid. There are further compliance checks with 2,306 employers ongoing, which will be finalised in due course.  </p>  <p>  Finally, I am advised by Revenue that since the scheme commenced, a total of 16 employers advised Revenue they were voluntarily removing themselves from the scheme, 9 of whom withdrew and fully repaid nearly &euro;21 million and 7 withdrew and partially repaid just over &euro;4.5 million.   A total of 402 employers have repaid in full all subsidies claimed, totalling approximately &euro;52 million with an additional 3,331 making partial repayments totalling approximately &euro;54 million.  This figure includes employers who deemed themselves ineligible as part of the monthly eligibility review process and repaid subsidy monies in line with the scheme requirements. Employers were not required to indicate the reason for a repayment, therefore Revenue is not in a position to provide a breakdown between those employers who repaid due to ineligibility, arising from employer self-assessment or a compliance check and those who voluntarily repaid. </p>  <p>  Due to taxpayer confidentiality as enshrined in Section  851A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, Revenue are not in a position to provide the names of employers who have paid back subsidy payments.   </p></reply>

The total cost of the scheme was c.  &euro;2.9 billion.</p>  <p>  As part of the administration of the TWSS, Revenue carried out a programme of compliance checks on all employers who participated in the scheme to ensure that they were eligible to receive the supports and to ensure the funds were paid out to qualifying employees. Revenue have advised that 99.8% of these checks have been completed, with 153 cases ongoing. To date, Revenue has recouped over &euro;31.5 million in overpayments from 1,786 participating employers, which represents around 2.7 %. </p>  <p>  In addition, Revenue also completed a TWSS reconciliation scheme which identified an aggregate liability of &euro;308 million, the majority of which related to the transitional period of the scheme, operated up to 5 May 2020, when &euro;410 per week was paid to employers in respect of eligible employees. Therefore, when the compliance and reconciliation exercises are combined the aggregate amount of TWSS identified for recovery amounted to &euro;324 million.

The EWSS remains in operation until 30 April 2022. </p>  <p>  The key eligibility criteria for the TWSS were that the business was suffering significant negative economic impact due to the pandemic, the employees were on the payroll at 29 February 2020, and the employer had fulfilled its PAYE reporting obligations for February 2020 before 1 April 2020, at the latest.</p>  <p>  As regards eligibility for the EWSS, an employer must be able to demonstrate that its business has experienced a 30% reduction in turnover or orders between 1 January and 31 December 2021, by reference to the corresponding period in 2019, as a result of business disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. Furthermore, the employer must have a tax clearance certificate to be eligible to join the EWSS and must continue to meet the requirements for tax clearance throughout the scheme.  Where an eligible employer makes a payment of wages, within prescribed limits, to a qualifying employee during the scheme, the employer can claim an EWSS subsidy in respect of that employee. </p>  <p>  As I have said previously, the primary purpose of the COVID wage subsidy schemes is to ensure, as much as possible, that employers keep employees in employment, thereby maintaining the employer/employee relationship, so that normal operations can quickly restart once the restrictions are lifted, rather than making them redundant and eligible for the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP). These emergency support schemes were developed to deal with a situation where businesses were restricted from trading due to public health guidelines and not because of any economic or other trading conditions. It was considered that the best metric to determine the impact of the public health restrictions was a decline in turnover. At the outset of the restrictions nobody could anticipate how long or what impact the restrictions would have or how businesses or customers would react.  Qualification for TWSS, and subsequently EWSS, was based on projections of the business.</p>  <p>  The legislation enacted by the Oireachtas places the administration of the subsidy schemes under the care and management of Revenue, which includes ensuring that this very significant investment of public funds is properly allocated to eligible employers and businesses in line with the legislation enacted by the Oireachtas.</p>  <p>  The eligibility criteria for the wage subsidy schemes, as provided for in legislation, do not include any conditions related to the payment by a company of a dividend or dividends to its shareholders. Thus, there is no impediment to employers paying dividends to its shareholders and this is a business decision for a company to take based on its financial circumstances.</p>  <p>  The Office of the Revenue Commissioners is statutorily independent in how it conducts its activities so it would not be appropriate for me to request Revenue to conduct an examination of companies who have paid out dividends, while also receiving State supports.  In any event, the fact that the legislation does not prohibit the practice would seem to make such an examination inappropriate.</p>  <p>  As regards the Deputy&rsquo;s second question on whether I propose to introduce new conditions on employers in relation to the use of and access to the EWSS, it should be noted that the overwhelming majority of companies that have participated in the wage subsidy schemes did so because they genuinely believed they would need support at that point based on the effect of the pandemic on their business. The experience both Revenue and I have had is that employers participating in the scheme are doing so in good faith. </p>  <p>  I would also note that the schemes are characterised by a high degree of compliance by beneficiary firms. I set out details of the comprehensive compliance and assurance programmes carried out by Revenue in relation to the wage subsidy schemes separately in response to other questions raised by the Deputy. </p>  <p>  I am advised that a number of companies have returned the TWSS or EWSS payments to Revenue either because they voluntarily withdrew from either scheme, found they were ineligible or their business performance was better than they expected when they entered the schemes.  In that regard 860 employers have refunded &euro;10.9 million in TWSS payments.  In addition, 16 employers advised Revenue they were voluntarily removing themselves from the EWSS, 9 of whom fully withdrew and repaid nearly &euro;21 million and 7 partially withdrew and repaid just over &euro;4.5 million.</p>  <p>  A total of 402 employers have repaid in full all subsidies claimed since the EWSS began, totalling approximately &euro;52 million with an additional 3,331 making partial repayments totalling approximately &euro;54 million.</p>  <p>  To date, the EWSS has helped almost 52,000 employers to keep over 700,000 employees in employment since the scheme began in September 2020.  It is highly likely that the vast majority of employers who have claimed COVID-19 wage supports have not had the wherewithal to pay dividends during the period of the pandemic.  It is not readily apparent to me what impact an outright ban on dividend payments, or indeed a cap on such payments, would have had on the employment prospects of those 700,000 employees whose employers have been supported by EWSS payments.</p>  <p>  However, I have said previously that I will keep this matter under review and assess if it would be appropriate to introduce any further conditionality into the scheme. This issue requires careful consideration to ensure that businesses that may well be profitable, but are far less profitable than they were in the past, are not precluded from participating in the scheme in the future. Such firms may still require this support to have a viable and successful future. It would be important that any changes are proportionate and would not undermine the overarching policy rationale underpinning the scheme, which is to maintain employment.</p></reply>

Businesses operating within these sectors, who would ordinarily operate evening and night-time trading hours, will be considered to be significantly restricted from operating for the purposes of the CRSS and will be eligible for support under the scheme where they meet the eligibility conditions.  The Government have also agreed that the turnover reduction criteria will be increased from no more that 25% of 2019 turnover to no more that 40% of 2019 turnover.</p>  <p>  It is not sufficient that the trade of a business has been impacted because of a reduction in customer demand as a consequence of Covid-19, or by public health guidance generally in force. The scheme only applies where, as a direct result of the specific terms of the Government restrictions, the business is required to either prohibit or significantly restrict access to its business premises.</p>  <p>  To qualify for the CRSS, a business must have tax clearance and have been established prior to 26 July 2021. Any business established after 26 July 2021 is not eligible for the scheme. Revenue has advised me that the business referred to in question (1222/21) was established in September 2021 and, as such, does not qualify for the CRSS. </p>  <p>  Under the existing scheme any business established after 12 October 2020 was not eligible for CRSS. The Government have decided that new businesses established between 13 October 2020 and 26 July 2021 will now be eligible to apply for the scheme.   In addition to the amendment of the turnover criteria, this is a significant extension of the CRSS. The CRSS is intended as a support for existing businesses and I have no plans to further modify the eligibility criteria of the CRSS.</p>  <p>  The legislation provides businesses with the entitlement to appeal Revenue&rsquo;s decision on CRSS eligibility to the independent Tax Appeals Commission (TAC), where they dispute the interpretation applied.  If a business wishes to appeal Revenue&rsquo;s decision that it is not entitled to the CRSS, it should do so within 30 days of the refusal notification. </p>  <p>  The CRSS is just one of the Government supports to assist businesses impacted by COVID-19. Businesses not falling within the scope of the CRSS may be entitled to support under other measures put in place by Government, including the COVID Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) and the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS). EWSS is an economy-wide scheme that operates across all sectors.  As the Deputy may be aware, as announced on 9 December, it was decided that the enhanced rates of support which were due to end on 30 November 2021 would be extended for a further two months until end-January 2022. On 21 December, it was decided on foot of the restrictions I have outlined above, that the EWSS would reopen for certain businesses who would otherwise not be eligible for the support. Businesses that previously registered for EWSS and received a payment in compliance with the scheme have the opportunity to re-qualify for the scheme where they meet certain conditions. Broadly, the business must experience a 30% reduction in turnover, or customer orders during a particular reference period and have tax clearance.</p>  <p>  Finally, it is my intention that the legislative aspects associated with the revised arrangements for CRSS and EWSS, outlined above, will be addressed by primary legislation in the coming weeks. In the meantime, the Revenue Commissioners are operating the revised arrangements on an administrative basis pending the legislation.</p></reply>

Contributions to a pension fund are relieved from tax and growth in these funds are also accumulated on a tax-free basis. Payments out of the fund during retirement are then subject to income tax, and USC and PRSI where applicable. I do not have any plans to change the current arrangements for tax relief on pension contributions.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the Programme for Government contains a commitment to introduce a pension auto-enrolment system. This aims to address the low proportion of Irish employees with supplementary pension cover, which includes both occupational and personal pensions. My colleague Deputy Humphreys, Minister for Social Protection, is finalising a proposal for Government on the overall design of the AE system. As such it would not be appropriate to comment on any specific design features of the AE regime in advance of Government approval. In line with the Economic Recovery Plan, published in July 2021, implementation of the AE system will commence over the course of 2022 and 2023 with the necessary legislative, organisational and organisational structures being put in place.</p></reply>

This is an EU requirement across all Member States and is necessary to protect public health, to ensure food safety and product standards and to protect EU businesses from unfair international competition thus preserving jobs for European workers, including Irish workers. The information required for the importation of non-Union goods is specified in the UCC and includes the commodity (TARIC) code of the items within the gift. I am advised by Revenue that the data contained within the import declaration, serves not only to allow for the calculation of the taxes and duties which may be owed, but also facilitates the risk analysis of the goods in order to ensure the provenance of goods imported into the EU and to protect EU citizens from goods which may pose a danger to the health and well-being of citizens and enables Revenue to target and disrupt illegal trade, and confront non-compliance. </p><p>While data may be supplied on the physical parcel / package, this does not remove the obligation for an electronic import declaration which is required to facilitate the completion of an electronic risk assessment and calculation of tax and duty owed. Consignments from outside the EU cannot be delivered without a valid electronic Customs import declaration. While tax and duty are not usually payable on gifts valued at less than &euro;45, an electronic import declaration including the TARIC code is still required for every gift. </p><p>I am also advised by Revenue that in the context of parcels and packages, while Customs declarations are often submitted by the courier business or postal operator on behalf of the recipient (importer) in Ireland, the information required to complete the declaration is generally supplied by the exporting party although the importer (the recipient in Ireland) may also provide information to the courier business or postal operator that is needed to complete the declaration. Where the courier business or postal operator does not have the necessary information, it may contact the exporting party or the importer to gather the necessary information to enable them to complete the declaration. Alternatively, where sufficient information to complete the Customs declaration in not available, the courier business or postal operator may choose to return the goods to the sender. It is a matter for the relevant courier business or postal operator to determine, based on its business model, how to deal with instances where they do not have the data needed to complete the necessary Customs declaration.</p></reply>

At the outset, it is important to note that such deductions may arise in accordance with the principle of indemnity, under which an insured party who has suffered a loss is restored, in so far as possible, to the same financial position that they were in immediately prior to this event. In addition, this practice must be considered on a case-by-case basis, as individual policy wordings could provide a contractual basis for making such deductions.</p>  <p>  My officials have considered various options to address this issue. As recently noted by Minister of State Fleming at the Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and Taoiseach, any retrospective recoupment of amounts deducted by insurers would be difficult to implement from a legal perspective. Separately, it is my understanding  that the issue of Government grants is expected to be addressed as part of a ruling on quantum in the ongoing business interruption test case, which remains before the Courts, and on which it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time.</p>  <p>  In light of these considerations, it was decided that the appropriate way to address this issue is to increase the transparency around the deduction of State supports from claims settlements. The Insurance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which is currently being drafted, will make amendments to existing legislation to enable the Central Bank to collect data on such deductions by insurers through the National Claims Information Database (NCID). This will greatly enhance policymakers&rsquo; understanding of the prevalence of this practice, and will provide an important evidence-base for taking any further action in this area, if necessary, in order to protect taxpayers&rsquo; interests. In addition, the Bill will create a new requirement on insurers to notify consumers about any such deductions made to claims settlements. </p>  <p>  I believe that this is a proportionate and appropriate response to this issue, which will avoid unintended consequences and will not pre-empt any legal ruling on the matter. I expect the draft Bill to be published early within this quarter, and I look forward to working with colleagues to progress it through the Oireachtas to complement the Government&rsquo;s ongoing work on insurance reform.</p></reply>

In money terms, the overall support provided to-date (as at 13 January) by EWSS is over &euro;7 billion, comprising of direct subsidy payments of &euro;6.12 billion and PRSI forgone of &euro;956 million to 51,900 employers, in respect of over 706,700 employees. </p>  <p>  There are, however, certain consumer protection requirements which govern the provision of mortgage credit to consumers.  For example, the European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016 (CMCAR) provide that, before concluding a mortgage credit agreement, a Central Bank regulated mortgage lender must make a thorough assessment of the consumer&rsquo;s creditworthiness with a view to verifying the prospect of the consumer being able to meet his or her obligations under the credit agreement.  </p>  <p>  The CMCAR further provides that a lender should only make credit available to a consumer where the result of the creditworthiness assessment indicates that the consumer&rsquo;s obligations resulting from the credit agreement are likely to be met in the manner required under that agreement.  The assessment of creditworthiness must be carried out on the basis of information on the consumer&rsquo;s income and expenses and other financial and economic circumstances which are necessary, sufficient and proportionate. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 imposes &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer and Suitability&rsquo; requirements on regulated lenders.  Under these requirements, lenders are required to assess affordability of credit and the suitability of a product or service based on the individual circumstances of each borrower. </p>  <p>  The Code specifies that the affordability assessment must include consideration of the information gathered on the borrower&rsquo;s personal circumstances and financial situation.  Furthermore, where a lender refuses a mortgage application, the CMCAR requires that the lender must inform the consumer without delay of the refusal. In addition, the Code requires that the lender must clearly outline to the consumer the reasons why the credit was not approved, and provide these reasons on paper if requested.  </p>  <p>  Within this regulatory framework, the decision to grant or refuse an application for mortgage credit remains a commercial matter for the individual lender and the fact that EWSS legislation enacted by the Oireachtas placed the administration of the scheme under the care and management of Revenue does not change or impact on that position.  </p>  <p>  Lenders continue to process mortgage applications and have supports in place to assist customers impacted by COVID-19. Therefore, if mortgage applicants have any queries or concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on their mortgage application, they should in the first instance contact their lender directly on the matter.  </p>  <p>  It should also be noted that the Central Bank has indicated that it expects all regulated firms to take a consumer-focused approach and to act in their customers&rsquo; best interests at all times, including during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Therefore, if a mortgage applicant is not satisfied with how a regulated firm is dealing with them in relation to an application for credit or the drawn down of credit, or they believe that the regulated firm is not following the requirements of the Central Bank&rsquo;s codes and regulations or other financial services law, they should make a complaint directly to the regulated firm. If the mortgage applicant is still not satisfied with the response from the regulated firm, he or she can refer the complaint to the statutory Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.  </p>  <p>  Matters in relation to policy and the administration of mortgages provided by local authorities are a matter for my colleague the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage. </p></reply>

Exemptions from VAT for certain activities in the public interest are set out in Chapter 2 of Title IX of the Directive. These provisions are transposed into Irish legislation in Part 1, Schedule 1, VAT Consolidation Act 2010. Paragraph 2(5) of Schedule 1 provides for an exemption in respect of the supply of professional dental services.</p>  <p>  The exemption from VAT in respect of dental services is not dependent on the legal form of the taxable person supplying the service. It is the nature of the service that informs the VAT treatment. The legislation which transposes Article 132 of the Directive, and Revenue&rsquo;s interpretation of the legislation, ensures that the exemption from VAT to the supply of dental services is applied consistently and in a manner which is not dependent on the legal form of the person supplying the service. In accordance with the Directive and CJEU jurisprudence the VAT exemption applies to dental services provided by a clinic, a principal dentist, or by an associate dentist, where those services are provided to a patient.</p>  <p>  Where a principal dentist receives consideration in respect of fee sharing arrangements and the nature of services consists of the supply of facilities for the carrying on of a dental practice, Revenue views this as a taxable supply of services within the scope of VAT. The final consumer in this fee sharing arrangement is not a patient availing of a supply of dental services to which the exemption applies.</p>  <p>  Revenue has been clear at all times regarding the VAT treatment of dental fee sharing arrangements and has outlined its position in correspondence and meetings with the Irish Dental Association.</p></reply>

It includes provisions defining categories of alcohol and alcoholic beverages and sets out the basis on which excise duties on such products are to be established. Chapter 1 of Part 2 of the Finance Act 2003 transposes Council Directive 92/83/EEC and the rates of APT for the various categories of alcoholic beverages are provided for in Schedule 2 of that Act.  The rate of APT applying to a particular alcoholic beverage depends on the category it falls within and its alcohol content which is expressed as a percentage of volume.</p>  <p>  The VAT rating of goods is subject to the requirements of the EU VAT Directive with which Irish VAT law must comply.  In accordance with the Value-Added Tax Consolidation Act 2010, VAT is chargeable on beer and wine at the standard rate, currently 23% in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The rate of APT on beer with an alcohol content exceeding 2.8% volume is currently &euro;22.55 per hectolitre per cent of alcohol in the beer. For a pint of beer with, for example, 4.2% alcohol content, APT would be &euro;0.54.  VAT at 23% on a pint of beer retailing at &euro;6 would be &euro;1.12. Therefore, the total tax take on a &euro;6 pint of beer with an alcohol content of 4.2% volume is &euro;1.66. The APT due on a pint of beer with an alcohol content lower than 4.2% volume would be less than &euro;0.54 and beer stronger than 4.2% volume would be liable to a higher rate of APT.</p>  <p>  The rate of APT on still wine with an alcohol content exceeding 5.5% volume but not exceeding 15% volume is currently &euro;424.84 per hectolitre, which equates to &euro;3.19 on a 75 cl bottle. On a bottle of wine retailing at &euro;12.50 the VAT take would be &euro;2.34. Therefore, the total tax take on a &euro;12.50 bottle of still wine with an alcohol content exceeding 5.5% volume but not exceeding 15% volume is &euro;5.53 Different APT rates apply to still wines with different levels of alcohol content and to sparkling wines, and full details of all rates of APT are available on Revenue&rsquo;s website.</p></reply>

In order to qualify for relief, the applicant must hold a Primary Medical Certificate issued by the relevant Senior Area Medical Officer (SAMO) or a Board Medical Certificate issued by the Disabled Driver Medical Board of Appeal. Certain other qualifying criteria apply in relation to the vehicle, in particular that it must be specially constructed or adapted for use by the applicant.</p>  <p>  To qualify for a Primary Medical Certificate an applicant must be permanently and severely disabled, and satisfy at least one of the following medical criteria, in order to obtain a Primary Medical Certificate:</p>  <p>  - be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs;</p>  <p>  - be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs;</p>  <p>  - be without both hands or without both arms;</p>  <p>  - be without one or both legs;</p>  <p>  - be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg;</p>  <p>  - have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.</p>  <p>  The current medical criteria medical criteria were included in the Finance Act 2020, by way of amendment to Section 92 of the Finance Act 1989. This amendment arises from legal advice in light of the June 2020 Supreme Court judgement that the medical criteria in secondary legislation was not deemed to be invalid, nevertheless it was found to be inconsistent with the mandate provided in Section 92 of the Finance Act 1989 (primary legislation).</p>  <p>  In light of the resignations of the board members from the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, Department of Finance officials are working with the Department of Health and the Public Appointments Service in terms of seeking expressions of interest from medical practitioners to participate in the Board. It is hoped to move this process along as quickly as possible to then appoint five members, so that appeals can recommence early in the New Year.</p>  <p>  Requests for appeal hearings can be sent to the DDMBA secretary based in the National Rehabilitation Hospital. New appeal hearing dates will be issued once the new Board is in place. Assessments for the primary medical certificate, by the HSE, are continuing to take place. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate this Scheme confers substantial benefits to eligible persons and changing the medical criteria to more general mobility-focused criteria, would raise the already considerable cost of the Scheme in terms of tax foregone to the Exchequer. Any increase in the cost of the Scheme would require a concomitant increase in tax, reduction in public expenditure, or increase in the Exchequer deficit.</p>  <p>  While I am very aware of the importance of this scheme to those who benefit from it, I am also aware of the disquiet expressed by members of this house and others in respect of the difficulties around access to the scheme.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, I gave a commitment to the House that a comprehensive review of the scheme, to include a broader review of mobility supports for persons with disabilities, would be undertaken.</p>  <p>  In this context I have been working with my Government colleague, Roderic O&rsquo;Gorman, Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. We are both agreed that the review should be brought within a wider review under the auspices of the National Disability Inclusion Strategy, to examine transport supports encompassing all Government funded transport and mobility schemes for people with disabilities. Its work was interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>  <p>  This the most appropriate forum to meet mutual objectives in respect of transport solutions/mobility supports for those with a disability. </p>  <p>  Minister O&rsquo;Gorman has confirmed that he has asked his officials to reconvene the working group established to carry out that review at the earliest opportunity. With this in mind, officials from both my Department and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth have met recently to discuss proposals for progressing the Disabled Drivers Scheme review within the wider review. My officials will continue to work closely with officials from the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, to progress this review, and on foot of that will bring forward proposals for consideration.</p></reply>

The report put forward options for further consideration, rather than recommendations, and any further consideration would require the participation of several Departments and organisations, including my own Department. The ten options are split into short, medium and long-term options. Five potential short-term options were identified as measures which could potentially be implemented within 18 months, i.e. within Budgets 2018 and 2019.</p><p>One short-term option was to increase the mortgage interest deduction available to landlords.  In this context, it should be noted that in Budget 2017, a phased unwinding of the restriction on interest deductibility over five years for all residential landlords was initiated. The second step, an increase from 80% to 85% deductibility, took effect from 1 January 2018.  Budget 2019 accelerated progress in this area and, from 1 January 2019, the restoration of full mortgage interest deductibility for landlords of residential property has been in place. </p><p>A further option was to consider introducing Local Property Tax (LPT) deductibility for landlords. The Report noted that LPT is a relatively small expense and therefore is unlikely to make a significant difference to the position of any individual landlord in cash terms and so may not be regarded by landlords as a sufficient measure to encourage them to stay in or enter the rental market. The Report also found that the measure would also have a deadweight cost in respect of landlords who do not intend to leave the rental market and would create a more favourable position for landlords of property compared to owner-occupiers, as owner-occupiers cannot claim a tax deduction for LPT. </p><p>In Budget 2018 I introduced another of the short-term options: deductibility for pre-letting expenditure for previously vacant properties. This measure applies to residential premises which have been vacant for at least 12 months and which are then let after the date of the passing of the Finance Act 2017, i.e. after 25 December 2017. The expenditure is allowed as a deduction against rental income from that premises. It applies to expenses that would be allowable if they had been incurred while the property was let, such as the cost of repairs, insurance, maintenance and management of the property.  Certain limitations are in place regarding this measure, for example the expenditure must have been incurred in the 12 months before the premises is let as a residential premises.  The total deduction allowed is capped at &euro;5,000 per vacant premises and the deduction will be clawed-back if the property ceases to be let as a residential premises within four years of the first letting. I prioritised this option as it was specifically designed to encourage an overall increase in housing supply by bringing currently vacant property back into residential use. As the Deputy may be aware, I extended this measure in Budget 2022.</p><p>The final short-term option was to improve the collection and sharing of data on the rental accommodation sector.  A significant issue that hampered the progress of the Working Group was a lack of robust data on various elements of the housing market, due to the differing metrics used by the various agencies. With a view to address this issue, a Data Group was convened after the publication of the Housing for All Strategy to ensure the plan is underpinned by a robust data strategy. The group reports to the Housing for All Delivery Group, chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach and my Department participates in the bi-weekly meetings of this group.</p><p>Five of the options put forward in the report were medium-term and long-term options. Medium-term options are measures which work with the current tax system but might take longer to develop and implement, and as such would require a longer lead-in period. The long-term options look at the potential for more fundamental changes to the tax system, and so would require significantly greater resource commitments to progress.  </p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, taxation is only one of the policy levers available to the Government through which to boost rental and overall housing supply and that, in line with the Tax Expenditure Guidelines, consideration of whether a tax measure is the most appropriate policy tool for a given purpose would be required. Ireland&rsquo;s past experience with tax incentives in the housing sector strongly suggests the need for a cautionary stance when considering intervention in the rental sector. There are many competing priorities which must be considered when deciding which policy measures to introduce and the rental sector is just one of many other sectors that may require assistance and intervention.</p><p>Finally, the following tables summarise the options set out in the report. <table>    <tr>       <th>Short-term options</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Accelerated restoration of full mortgage interest deductibility for landlords of residential property </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Introducing Local Property Tax deductibility for landlords </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Enhancing loss relief for landlords (or a sub-set of landlords), to allow relief for rental losses against other income sources in the same year </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Introducing deductibility for pre-letting expenditure for previously vacant properties </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Improvements in the collection and sharing of data on the rental accommodation sector </td>    </tr> </table>  <table>    <tr>       <th>Medium-term options</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Allowing a deduction against rental income for an element of the capital cost of the rental property in the initial years of ownership, with a corresponding reduction in the base cost of the property for Capital Gains Tax purposes on a future disposal </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Capital Gains Tax relief for properties acquired and retained as rental accommodation </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Incentive to attract investment capital into the construction of property, in areas of need, to be let at social / affordable rents. </td>    </tr> </table>  <table>    <tr>       <th>Long-term options</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Review of provisions for the holding of rental property via pension vehicles </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Consideration of developing a separate method of taxing rental income, for example, a flat tax or a separate rate of tax, as a policy lever to support the sector as a whole or specific sub-sectors (for example, affordable housing/urban housing) </td>    </tr> </table> p. 6 'The Report of the Working Group on the Tax and Fiscal Treatment of Accommodation Providers', available at www.gov.ie/en/collection/51d1c-budget-2018/ </p></reply>

To claim the additional credits and reliefs to which they may be entitled, PAYE taxpayers should complete an income tax return at the end of the tax year. </p>  <p>  Where an income tax return is not completed, it is not possible for Revenue to know if a taxpayer may be due additional credits or reliefs and as such it is not possible to provide the Deputy with an estimate of potential overpaid income tax.  However, Revenue has confirmed that it has to date refunded &euro;390 million to PAYE taxpayers in respect of 2020 and &euro;57 million in respect of 2021.</p>  <p>  In addition, Revenue has also confirmed that it issues reminder letters every year to taxpayers who did not claim any additional credits in the previous four years advising them that they may be entitled to further tax relief depending on their individual circumstances.

The National Remote Work Strategy aims to make remote work a permanent feature of the Irish working experience in a way that maximises the economic, social and environmental benefits.</p>  <p>  As part of the national remote working strategy: Making Remote Work, the Tax Strategy Group (TSG) reviewed the current tax arrangements for remote working in respect of both employees and employers. The TSG paper outlines the effects of Covid-19 on remote working in Ireland, provides an international comparison of remote working tax rules, sets out options for consideration with regard to enhancing the tax arrangements for both employers and employees in respect of remote work and evaluates those options in accordance with the Department of Finance Tax Expenditure Guidelines. Among other things, the paper acknowledged that employees may experience costs that they would otherwise not incur due to remote working such as additional heat, electricity and increased broadband reliance. However, it also pointed out that this was balanced by potential savings associated with working from home such as reduced commuting costs, as well as potential improvements in employees' work/life balance and reduced commuting time. The paper is published on the gov.ie website.</p>  <p>  In line with Government policy to facilitate and support remote working, as part of Budget 2022, I announced that an income tax deduction amounting to 30% of the cost of vouched expenses for heat, electricity and internet services in respect of those incurred while working from home can be claimed by taxpayers. This measure enhances and formalises existing arrangements that are currently operated by Revenue on an administrative basis and its legislative aspects were provided for in Finance Act 2021.</p>  <p>  The amount of the relief will depend on the particular circumstances of the remote worker in terms of the level of costs incurred and their marginal tax rate. However, this measure will provide some relief for those with additional expenses arising from working from home and it will support living standards as the economy recovers.</p>  <p>  Any amounts reimbursed or to be reimbursed, directly or indirectly to the remote worker in relation to the expenses of working from home by his or her employer should be deducted from the amount of relief being claimed.</p>  <p>  Revenue&rsquo;s online system will enable individuals claim tax relief in real time as they pay for these costs throughout the year. The enhanced relief will apply for the year of assessment 2022 and subsequent years.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware Budget 2022 also included a substantial income tax package that will be of benefit to everyone who pays income tax and aims to help citizens when prices are rising.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that the Government recently approved the establishment of the Electricity Costs Emergency Benefit Scheme under which a payment of &euro;100 will be made to each domestic electricity customer as a once off measure to mitigate the effects of the unprecedented rise in electricity prices on domestic electricity customers.</p></reply>

The gain attributed to that 7-year period will not attract CGT. However, where the property is held for more than 7 years, relief is reduced in the same proportion that the period of 7 years bears to the period of ownership, so if the property is held for 9 years, 7/9 of the gain will be relieved. </p>  <p>  This relief was amended in Finance Act 2017 for disposals made on or after 1 January 2018, to provide that gains on land and buildings acquired between 7 December 2011 and 31 December 2014 are not chargeable gains where the land or buildings are held for at least 4 years and up to 7 years from the date they were acquired. </p>  <p>  I would note that the structure of the relief means that 2018 is the first year that this relief could be claimed by taxpayers. </p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that the available information in relation to relief from Capital Gains Tax under section 604A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 is published on Revenue&rsquo;s website at: www.revenue.ie/en/corporate/documents/statistics/tax-expenditures/relief-on-disposal-of-certain-land-or-buildings.pdf </p>  <p>  As indicated in the statistics at the above link, there were 890 claims made for relief under section 604A in 2019 (the latest year for which tax returns are available).

There is insufficient information gathered on the tax returns to determine whether the properties covered by the relief are the same as those earning the rental income. </p></reply>

It is an economy-wide scheme that operates across all sectors.  </p>  <p>  The eligibility criteria for Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) are based on self-assessment principles and the legislation provides that an employer must be able to demonstrate that his or her business will experience a 30% reduction in turnover or customer orders between 1 January and 31 December 2021, by reference to the corresponding period in 2019, as a result of business disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.   </p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, as announced on 9th December the enhanced rates of EWSS subsidy would apply for a further two months, December 2021 and January 2022. This will give certainty to businesses when they need it most. </p>  <p>  The Government and I have been clear that there will be no cliff edge to supports for employers but we have also been clear that the EWSS cannot run indefinitely, nor is it sustainable to continue with the enhanced rates for a prolonged period of time given the very substantial costs to the Exchequer.</p>  <p>  As such, from 1 February 2022, the original two-rate structure of &euro;203 per week and &euro;151.50 per week will apply; for March and April 2022 the flat rate subsidy of &euro;100 per week will apply and the scheme will end on 30 April 2022.</p>  <p>  The Government further announced on 21st December 2021, that the EWSS will reopen for certain businesses who would otherwise not be eligible and that such businesses can continue to be supported until the expiry of the scheme on 30 April 2022. The new arrangements for EWSS will provide employers who have previously availed of EWSS but who are no longer eligible, with the opportunity to re-qualify for the scheme where they meet certain conditions. Broadly, to re-qualify the business must experience a 30% reduction in turnover, or customer orders during a particular reference period. Depending on the particular circumstances of the business in question, the re-opening of EWSS may be relevant to certain businesses who previously didn&rsquo;t qualify for EWSS as at 31 December 2021. </p>  <p>  Further details of the qualifying conditions can be located on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link- </p>  <p>www.gov.ie/en/press-release/bf5d1-government-announces-significant-expansion-of-supports-for-businesses-affected-by-the-latest-public-health-restrictions/.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware the Covid Restriction Support Scheme (CRSS) remains in place to support businesses who are required to close or significantly restrict customers from accessing their business premises, and who meet the qualifying criteria.  Under the relevant legislation, the CRSS was due to end on 31 December 2021 but it was extended to the end of January 2022. </p>  <p>  The Tax Debt Warehousing Scheme remains available to support businesses that are experiencing tax payment difficulties arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. The scheme applies to VAT debts, PAYE (Employer) debts, certain self-assessed income tax debts and overpayments of both the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) and the EWSS. </p>  <p>  On 20 December 2021 the Government agreed to extend the tax debt warehousing scheme to extend the period where liabilities arising can be &ldquo;warehoused&rdquo; to the end of Q1 2022 for taxpayers eligible for the COVID-19 support schemes; this means that interest free period for those taxpayers will now be 1 April 2022 to 31 March 2023, extending the period by 3 months from 31 December 2022.  </p>  <p>  It is worth pointing out the comprehensive package of other business and employer supports that have been made available over the course of the last 18 months or so and are still available, such as the CRSS and the Credit Guarantee Scheme, for businesses with reduced turnover as a result of public health restrictions.   A full list of the Covid-19 Income Supports Schemes available to businesses can be obtained via the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment&rsquo;s at the following link - </p>  <p>  enterprise.gov.ie/en/What-We-Do/Supports-for-SMEs/COVID-19-supports/ </p>  <p>  In addition, I would also draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s Tourism Business Continuity Scheme 2022, which was launched last week.  Further details can be obtained via the following link &ndash; </p>  <p>  www.failteireland.ie/tourism-business-continuity-programme.aspx   </p>  <p>   Finally, as has been the case throughout the pandemic, the Government will continue to monitor developments closely.</p></reply>

Consequently, I am not in a position to direct insurance companies as to the pricing level that they should apply to particular categories of individuals.</p>  <p>  On a general level, insurance companies consider a number of risks when determining the premium for a proposed insurance policy. For example, in the case of motor insurance, I understand that insurers use a combination of rating factors in making decisions on whether to offer cover and what terms to apply, such as: the age of the driver; vehicle type; claims record; driving experience; number of drivers; how the car is used; etc. Insurers also price in accordance with their specific claims experience and do not use the same combination of rating factors. Accordingly, premium prices vary across the market. </p>  <p>  With regard to the Deputy&rsquo;s query about potential discrimination, I would note generally that the Equal Status Acts 2000-2018 prohibit certain kinds of discrimination, including in the provision of services. The legislation protects against discrimination on nine specific grounds, including age. However, in relation to insurance, the legislation also provides that people can be treated differently on any of the grounds (except gender) &ndash; but only if the differences are based on actuarial or statistical data or other relevant underwriting or commercial factors, and are reasonably based.  </p>  <p>  Where somebody feels they have been treated unfairly by a particular insurance provider, they have the option of making a complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO). The FSPO acts as an independent arbiter of disputes that consumers may have with their insurance company or other financial service provider. The FSPO can be contacted either by email at info@fspo.ie or by telephone at 01-567-7000.</p>  <p>  Finally, it may be useful for the Deputy to know that Insurance Ireland, the representative body for the insurance industry in this country, operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to insurance. This can be contacted at feedback@insuranceireland.eu.</p></reply>

However, the price lenders charge for their loans is a commercial matter for individual lenders.  As Minister for Finance I cannot determine the lending policies of individual banks including the interest rates they charge for loans including mortgages.  </p>  <p>  Despite this, it should also be noted that recent trends indicate that certain mortgage rates have been falling in Ireland. For example, the interest rates on new mortgages (excluding renegotiations) have fallen from 4.05% in December 2014 to 2.71% in November 2021.  </p>  <p>  The weighted average interest rate on new fixed rate mortgage agreements stood at 2.59% in November 2021, down from a series high of 4.11% in December 2014. There has also been a reduction in the interest rates charged on loans to SMEs and consumers over the same period.</p>  <p>  However, Irish mortgage and other loans can have different characteristics from those offered in other countries. For example, many Irish banks include incentives such as cash back offers, which reduce the effective Irish mortgage interest rate. Also Irish mortgages are generally not subject to upfront fees which are typically charged by banks in some other EU jurisdictions.</p>  <p>  There are also a number of important factors which will likely influence the interest rates charged on Irish mortgages. These include for example operational costs, certain structural factors as referenced above (such as incentives offered), as well as the fact that pricing will reflect: </p>  <p>  - credit risk and capital requirements which in Ireland are elevated due to historical loss experience;</p>  <p>  - the level of non-performing loans which is higher in Ireland relative to other European banks (as provisioning and capital requirements are higher for these loans to reflect their higher risk and this in turn results in higher credit and capital costs for the Irish banks); and</p>  <p>  - higher cost-to-income ratios which has been a characteristic of the Irish banking sector in recent years. </p>  <p>  Separately the Central Bank introduced a number of increased protections for variable rate mortgage holders which came into effect in 2017. The enhanced measures, which are provided for in an Addendum to the Consumer Protection Code 2012, require lenders to explain to borrowers how their variable interest rates have been set, including in the event of an increase. The measures also improve the level of information required to be provided to borrowers on variable rates about other mortgage products which could provide savings for the borrower and signpost the borrower to the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission's (CCPC) mortgage switching tool.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank also introduced additional changes to the Consumer Protection Code in 2019 to help consumers make savings on their mortgage repayments, provide additional protections to consumers who are eligible to switch, and facilitate mortgage switching through enhancing the transparency of the mortgage framework. Consumers can reduce average pricing in the mortgage market by availing of switching options to ensure that recent and potential future price reductions through increased competition pass through to the greatest number of customers possible. Indeed a Central Bank study estimated that three in every five &lsquo;eligible&rsquo; mortgages for principal dwelling homes stand to save over &euro;1,000 within the first year if they switch and &euro;10,000 over the remaining term. </p>  <p>  To conclude I appreciate that greater sustainable competition in the credit market will be of benefit to consumers and other borrowers.  Accordingly, the review of the retail banking market which is now underway in my Department will consider how the banking system can best support economic activity, assess competition and consumer choice in the market for banking services and consider options to further develop the mortgage market.  </p></reply>

The main purpose of a pension fund is to provide a secure income in retirement for the pension beneficiary. The purpose of providing tax relief for pension contributions is to encourage saving - by employers, employees and the self-employed - towards retirement income. Any drawdown permitted would reduce the pension savings from which individuals could provide for their retirement, with smaller pension schemes losing a larger proportion of their overall savings.</p>  <p>  As an exceptional measure, with a view of relieving hardship during the financial crisis, early drawdown from pension funds was permitted. However, it was only available from one type of pension product (additional voluntary contributions (AVCs)) and it was introduced for a limited period of time. Section 782A Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provided members of occupational pension schemes with a three-year period, from 27 March 2013 to 26 March 2016, during which they could draw down, on a once-off basis, up to 30% of the accumulated value of their AVCs. The amount drawn down was subject to income tax under Schedule E, PRSI and USC, which was collected under the PAYE system.</p>  <p>  The maximum amount that could be drawn down under this provision was 30% of the accumulated value of AVCs made by the individual. This meant that draw down was not available to anyone who had not made AVCs. Furthermore, it was not possible to make a drawdown from AVCs paid by an employer; from any AVCs which were part of a scheme member&rsquo;s &ldquo;normal&rdquo; contributions; from any contributions to a Personal Retirement Savings Account (PRSA); or from contributions by the employer or the individual to an occupational pension scheme.</p>  <p>  While leaving employment or changing professions before retirement may have implications for the individual and could potentially bring financial hardship, it is not the intended purpose of a pension fund to provide income for an individual during this time.</p>  <p>  Ireland operates what is described as an &ldquo;Exempt &ndash; Exempt &ndash; Taxed&rdquo; or &ldquo;EET&rdquo; pension regime. Contributions to a pension fund are relieved from tax (first &ldquo;E&rdquo;) and growth in these funds are also accumulated on a tax-free basis (second &ldquo;E&rdquo;). Payments out of the fund during retirement are then subject to income tax (&ldquo;T&rdquo;) and USC and PRSI where applicable. The introduction of a scheme to allow early drawdown of pension funds could undermine the integrity of the &ldquo;EET&rdquo; regime. Therefore, I do not have any plans to introduce such a measure.</p></reply>

The EWSS has been a key component of the Government&rsquo;s response to the Covid-19 crisis. It is an economy-wide scheme that operates across all sectors.</p>  <p>  In money terms, the overall support provided to-date (13th January) by EWSS is over &euro;7 billion comprising direct subsidy payments of &euro;6.12 billion and PRSI forgone of &euro;956 million to 51,900 employers in respect of over 706,700 employees.</p>  <p>  While the criteria for eligibility for business in general is based on a reduction in turnover, as a result of the pandemic and having regard to the importance of maintaining the provision of childcare facilities so as to enable parents to continue in, or to take up, positions of employment, the legislation provided that childcare businesses in possession of tax clearance and registered in accordance with Section 58C of the Childcare Act 1991 are eligible for the EWSS. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, as announced on 9th December the enhanced rates of EWSS subsidy would apply for a further two months, December 2021 and January 2022. This will give certainty to businesses when they need it most.</p>  <p>  The Government and I have been clear that there will be no cliff edge to supports for employers but we have also been clear that the EWSS cannot run indefinitely, nor is it sustainable to continue with the enhanced rates for a prolonged period of time given the very substantial costs to the Exchequer.</p>  <p>  As such, from 1 February 2022, the original two-rate structure of &euro;203 per week and &euro;151.50 per week will apply; for March and April 2022 the flat rate subsidy of &euro;100 per week will apply and the scheme will end on 30 April 2022.</p>  <p>  Since the introduction of EWSS there has been regular and, where necessary, detailed engagement between my Department and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth (D/CEDIY). Analysis undertaken by D/CEDIY informed the approach taken with regard to the childcare sector. Childcare business will continue to benefit from the EWSS exemption until end April 2022.</p>  <p>  As announced by my colleague, Minister O&rsquo;Gorman, it is intended to put in place a transition fund between May and August 2022, which early learning and childcare providers can access. From September 2022, a major new funding stream will be introduced, to support providers in meeting their operating costs in return for a commitment that fees to parents will not increase.</p>  <p>  Therefore, I am satisfied that a coherent approach has been taken as regards the exit strategy for EWSS and the introduction of the new funding stream for the childcare sector. As such, it would appear that the need for a further extension of the enhanced rates of subsidy for the childcare sector does not arise. </p>  <p>  Finally, the Government will continue to monitor developments closely. </p></reply>

This is achieved by ensuring a positive consumer focused culture within regulated firms, that the consumer protection framework remains effective by reviewing, developing and enhancing the protections in place, and monitoring and enforcing compliance with the required standards through themed reviews and inspections. </p>  <p>  In the event regulated firms are not meeting their obligations to consumers, the significant legislative changes introduced since the financial crisis have equipped the Central Bank with an array of investigative, regulatory and enforcement powers, including imposition of fines, to take appropriate actions against such firms. </p></reply>

In order to qualify for relief, the applicant must hold a Primary Medical Certificate issued by the relevant Senior Area Medical Officer (SAMO) or a Board Medical Certificate issued by the Disabled Driver Medical Board of Appeal. Certain other qualifying criteria apply in relation to the vehicle, in particular that it must be specially constructed or adapted for use by the applicant. In the event that a PMC is not granted by the relevant Senior Area Medical Officer an appeal may be made to the independent Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal (DDMBA) who operate out of the National Rehabilitation Hospital in Dun Laoghaire.</p>  <p>The members of the DDMBA wrote to me recently tendering their resignation from the Board, which was formally acknowledged on the 26th   November 2021. My officials are engaged with the Department of Health and the Public Appointments Service in terms of seeking expressions of interest from medical practitioners to participate in the Board. It is hoped to move this process along as quickly as possible so that appeals can recommence early in the new year.</p>  <p>  Requests for appeal hearings can be sent to the DDMBA secretary based in the National Rehabilitation Hospital. New appeal hearing dates will be issued once the new Board is in place. Assessments for the primary medical certificate, by the HSE, are continuing to take place. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate this Scheme confers substantial benefits to eligible persons and changing the medical criteria to more general mobility-focused criteria, would raise the already considerable cost of the Scheme in terms of tax foregone to the Exchequer. Any increase in the cost of the Scheme would require a concomitant increase in tax, reduction in public expenditure, or increase in the Exchequer deficit.</p>  <p>  I gave a commitment to the House that a comprehensive review of the scheme, to include a broader review of mobility supports for persons with disabilities, would be undertaken. In this context I have been working with my Government colleague, Roderic O&rsquo;Gorman, Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. We are both agreed that the review should be brought within a wider review under the auspices of the National Disability Inclusion Strategy, to examine transport supports encompassing all Government funded transport and mobility schemes for people with disabilities. Its work was interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>  <p>  This the most appropriate forum to meet mutual objectives in respect of transport solutions/mobility supports for those with a disability.</p>  <p>  It is anticipated that the NDIS working group will be meeting shortly. My officials will continue to work closely with officials from the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, to progress this review, and on foot of that will bring forward proposals for consideration.</p></reply>

The Regulator has advised that there are protocols in place to ensure that rigorous testing of equipment takes place before each and every Lotto draw and that each step of the draw process is strictly adhered to. The Regulator has also confirmed that the Lotto game has operated in line with the game rules and that there are no regulatory issues</p>  <p>  The current extended period without a jackpot win, preceded by three jackpot wins in three weeks, is unusual in the history of the game. However, statistically unlikely events are part of the nature of games of chance and of lotteries. Following a request from the Operator for a &ldquo;Will be Won&rdquo; change to the Lotto Game and to bring the extended roll-over to an end, the Regulator has approved this new feature of the game.</p>  <p>  This new feature sees the full Lotto jackpot roll down to a winner or winners in the next winning prize tier if not won by a Match 6 ticket within five draws of the jackpot reaching its &euro;19m cap. The request for this new feature was submitted by the Operator on 7th December 2021. The Regulator and her officials have prioritised the regulatory checks in place to ensure that any changes to Lotto game rules were in the interest of players, that the National Lottery continues to be run with all due propriety and, subject to these, that returns to Good Causes are maximised.  The Regulator requested further essential information, tests, and assurances from the Operator on its proposal and is satisfied that the &ldquo;Will Be Won&rdquo; feature meets all regulatory requirements.  </p>  <p>The first &ldquo;Will Be Won&rdquo; draw held on Saturday 15th   January 2022 was won by a single ticket holder. I am pleased that the long running roll over of the lottery jackpot has come to a conclusion, that the Lotto Jackpot was capped at &euro;19m in October and note that lotto prizes have been boosted by an additional &euro;23.9m as a result of this measure. The introduction of arrangements that ensure that this situation will not be repeated with the new &ldquo;Will be Won&rdquo; arrangements is also welcome. I would also note that an unprecedented &euro;289m has been generated for Good Causes from the National Lottery in 2021, a 14% increase over 2020. </p>  <p>  The Regulator has informed me in relation to the Deputies queries regarding ticket sales, prizes and advertising costs, that Clause 20.6 of the the lottery licence requires that the Regulator shall not disclose or divulge any of the Licensee&rsquo;s confidential information without the prior written permission of the Licensee (except where compelled to by law), which has not been forthcoming.  With regard to cyber-attacks, it is the view of the Regulator that it is not good practice to reveal whether there have or have not been any cyber-attacks and that confirming or denying such attacks could encourage such attacks in the first instance and create unnecessary and misplaced concern about the National Lottery&rsquo;s security systems.</p>  <p>  I do not, in the circumstances, consider it necessary or beneficial to review the operation of the National Lottery. I have however commenced a review of the transparency and effectiveness of how Lottery funding is distributed, to ensure that it is best targeted in support of Good Causes.  In noting that some &euro;6 billion has been raised for Good Causes since the National Lottery commenced in 1987 it is appropriate that members of the public and those who play the National Lottery are fully aware of how lottery funding is accessed and distributed to the benefit of communities nationally. </p></reply>

It is, however, the case that competitions are initiated under the Civil Service Regulations Act are confined to staff who have Civil Servant status.</p></reply>

When this engagement has concluded and the Framework is agreed with the Civil Service Management Board, it will be rolled out to all civil service organisations. The Framework will inform the development of organisational blended working policies, which will be tailored to meet the specific requirements of each Department/Office.</p>  <p>  The current Government advice is that everyone should work from home unless it is necessary to attend the workplace in person.</p></reply>

This report examined, inter alia, issues around the demand for the data concerned; methodologies and technologies used; the potential for direct provision by the State of these services itself, and; the maturity of the market to provide these services efficiently. On foot of this report, DPER undertook a review in 2020 which found that the business case for its continued funding of Benefacts was no longer justified and accordingly the decision was made to terminate funding. This decision was notified to the Chairperson of the Board of Benefacts and other relevant stakeholders from June 2020.</p>  <p>  Recognising that other public service bodies with direct policy involvement in the not-for-profit sector may have wished to consider whether they had an appreciable business case to continue funding Benefacts, my Department agreed to fund the initiative up to the end of 2021. This provision was made to facilitate relevant public service bodies to consider their position and to assess all of the options in relation to their respective business needs concerning data on the not-for-profit sector.</p>  <p>  In April 2021, my Department reaffirmed its 2020 decision to all of the parties concerned. Furthermore, in acknowledgment of the impact of Covid-19 on this deliberative process, DPER sanctioned a final three month extension of funding to Benefacts up to the 31st March 2022.  As of December 2021, no department or agency had identified a need to continue to avail of and provide funding to the service. </p>  <p>  The factors influencing the original decision of April 2020  have not changed materially and, consequently, the decision of this Department to terminate funding remains unaltered. </p>  <p>  My officials are continuing to work closely with the executive and Board of Benefacts to ensure that all necessary requirements under the funding agreement will be met, including those which may arise under a wind-up scenario.</p></reply>

The Scheme comprises grass embankments, permanent walls and demountable flood barriers and pumping stations and is designed to protect 77 properties on the north side of Fermoy against the 1-in-100-year flood event.  Damages avoided in such an event in are in the order of &euro;18 m.</p>  <p>  Cork Co. Council carries out the Operation and Maintenance of the Fermoy North scheme on behalf of the Office Public Works (OPW), the Contracting Authority.  An OPW-developed Flood Early Warning System (FEWS), which is used for both the towns of Fermoy and Mallow, is operated by Cork County Council staff in Mallow.  Upon receipt of a flood warning, Local Authority staff erect the substantial demountable defences on the completed scheme on the north side.</p>  <p>As part of the operation and maintenance arrangements, the Council engages a contractor who regularly services the pumping stations at Rathealy Road and the Western Embankment.  The contractor made immediate interim adjustments at the pumping stations following the flood event of 23 February 2021 and then serviced the pumps to ensure the systems were functioning correctly.  Council personnel monitor the pumping stations.</p>  <p>  Cork County Council, with support from the OPW, have been investigating the possible cause or causes which led to the February 2021 flood event, including investigations regarding the functioning of the pumping stations at Rathealy Road and the Western Embankment.</p>  <p>  As part of the investigations, Cork County Council engaged a specialist who has completed a comprehensive diagnostic analysis of both Fermoy North pumping stations. This analysis is to determine what occurred in February and to establish if all the original pumping systems are functioning correctly (as designed), and to provide appropriate recommendations to rectify any outstanding issues.</p>  <p>  Further to the Deputy&rsquo;s question on the status of a report to be prepared by The Office of Public Works following the flood event in February 2021, I am informed that Cork County Council are preparing this report which they have advised will be completed in the coming weeks. I can also confirm that the investigation and report into the February event is being carried out by Cork County Council only.

The CIP and the details of these provisions are set out in the Appendix A. The CIP is managed by each individual public service employer and by way of example the arrangements for CIP in the Civil Service are set out in Appendix 3 of Circular 05/2018 Arrangements for Paid Sick Leave and follows for the Deputy's information.</p><p>The CIP defines eligibility criteria for the granting of extended sick leave. The medical criteria are set out in the CIP and the relevant Occupational Health Provider appointed by the employer will advise if the nature of the illness meets the medical criteria.</p><p>The decision to award CIP is made by management following consultation with the relevant Occupational Physician and with consideration of all the circumstances of the case. CIP may still be granted based on management&rsquo;s discretion where the medical criteria are not met. There are guidelines available to assist managers in making a fair and equitable decision. </p><p>Appendix A: CRITICAL ILLNESS PROTOCOL</p><p>Critical Illness Provisions</p><p>Where an individual is given access to the critical illness provisions, the Scheme provides for:</p><p>- Up to 365 days' paid sick leave in a four year period (comprising 183 days or 6 months on full pay in a rolling one year period, followed by 182 days a further 6 months on half pay).  This is the same as the access that existed under the previous sick leave schemes in place across much of the public service. </p><p>- Under a protective year provision, an individual who has taken sick leave because of a critical illness will continue to have access to the extended sick pay limits for 12 months following thedate of return to work following a critical illness or injury to afford further protection.</p><p>- An extended period of temporary rehabilitation remuneration (TRR) of up to 730 days (2 years). This  may be paid where it is a direct continuation of an illness under the Critical Illness Protocol and </p><p>- A further period of sick leave is required to rehabilitate from the critical illness/injury;</p><p>- An occupational health physician certifies that there is a reasonable prospect of the individual returning to work and giving regular and effective service; and </p><p>- The decision to award the additional period of temporary rehabilitation remuneration is reviewed every 6  months.  </p><p>The rate of payment of TRR is determined based on pensionable service. Public servants who pay Class A PRSI may also receive Illness Benefit from the Department of Social Protection in addition to TRR.</p><p>These are the general provisions of the extended paid sick leave that relate to critical illnesses. </p></reply>

All recruitment is demand led and, while every effort is made to endeavour that panels are not large, candidates are advised from the outset that placement on a particular panel is no guarantee of appointment to a position arising from their participation in a particular competition.</p>  <p>  The panels established from the 2019 competition expired on 31 December 2021, with my Department having previously authorised a three month extension.  A new competition will be advertised by PAS on 20 January that may be used to fill vacancies arising for fluent Irish speakers at the grade of Executive Officer over the next 2 years.  I consider this an appropriate timeframe in terms of striking a balance between how long candidates may remain on panels against the need to refresh panels by allowing applications from those either not eligible at the closing date or who did not meet the standard at a point in time for a particular competition.</p></reply>

In addition to deploying intrusion protection systems, software vulnerabilities are managed by maintaining up-to-date versions.</p>  <p>The vulnerability referenced in the question was identified by my Department on Friday 10 December. In accordance with current standard operational procedures my staff immediately began to examine the Department&rsquo;s internal and external facing systems in a coordinated fashion to identify potential vulnerabilities.  Vendors of key software applications, equipment, and services were consulted to identify any potential issues with their applications, equipment or services. The recommendations that were detailed in advisory alerts issued by the National Cyber Security Centre on the vulnerability were followed which included checking through system logs for exploits and ensuring that mitigation measures such as applying security patches were put in place.</p>  <p>  There were no unplanned stoppages of my Department&rsquo;s online or other services and there is no evidence to indicate that any computers, devices or services were compromised by the vulnerability.</p>  <p>  No additional costs have arisen to date to address the vulnerability. As the vulnerability was investigated and addressed where necessary by existing Department resources and under existing support arrangements, there was no need for additional dedicated specialist teams to be established, recruited or contracted.</p></reply>

The OPW is providing some funding under the Minor Works &amp;amp; Flood Mitigation Scheme towards these works.  While work is currently ongoing on the development of a solution, the Council is not yet in a position to confirm the programme times in relation to planning approvals and construction.</p>  <p>  A length of flood defence wall upstream of the footbridge in the Town centre remains to be constructed which will facilitate flood defence at a high level (for relatively rare floods) for the adjacent apartments and the town centre, as well as a proposed future public walkway, being proposed by Cork County Council.  It is expected that cost for this remaining work will be shared between Cork County Council and the OPW.</p>  <p>  Cork County Council and their consultants have been undertaking assessments of the wider surface water drainage network in the area and these assessments are progressing. Discussions have taken place with a view to completing some remedial/improvement works with any further works to be progressed once the required reports or consultations are completed.</p></reply>

Cavan County Council confirmed in May 2019 that the Council would act as lead agency on the management and delivery of the proposed flood relief scheme in Cavan Town. A Steering Group, comprising of representatives from the Office of Public Works and Cavan County Council, is now in place and is progressing this Scheme.Following a competitive procurement process, it is expected that Engineering and Environmental Consultants will be appointed in the coming weeks to progress this scheme. Once appointed, consultation with statutory and non-statutory bodies, as well as the public, will take place at the appropriate stages to ensure that all parties have the opportunity to input into the development of this scheme. </p><p>The OPW and Monaghan County Council will work closely to ensure that the three schemes for Ballybay, Iniskeen and Monaghan town will be commenced as soon as possible within the ten year timeframe for this programme of investment under the National Development Plan.</p><p>Outside of this national programme of investment on major flood relief schemes, local flooding issues are a matter, in the first instance, for each Local Authority to investigate and address. All Local Authorities, including Cavan County Council and Monaghan County Council, may carry out flood mitigation works, using either their own resources, or by applying for funding under the OPW Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme. This Minor Works Scheme was introduced by my Office in 2009.</p><p>The purpose of the scheme is to provide funding to local authorities to undertake minor flood mitigation works or studies to address localised fluvial flooding and coastal protection problems within their administrative areas. The scheme generally applies where a solution can be readily identified and achieved in a short time frame. The works to be funded are carried out under local authority powers and ongoing maintenance of the completed works is the responsibility of the Council. </p><p>Under the scheme, applications are considered for projects that are estimated to cost not more than &euro;750,000 in each instance. Funding by the OPW, of up to 90% of the cost, is available for approved projects.  Applications are assessed by the OPW having regard to the specific economic, social and environmental criteria of the scheme, including a cost benefit ratio and having regard to the availability of funding for flood risk management. Full details of this scheme are available on <i>www.gov.ie/opw</i></p><p>Since 2009 funding to Cavan County Council under this scheme has totalled &euro;463,302. This includes recent approvals in 2020, totalling &euro;75,600 to Cavan County Council for projects at Aghadreenagh Redhills, Ballyhaise Pitch, Ballyhaise Cavan Rd, Drumliffe Ballyhaise Knockateery Cloverhill and Mullinavaranogue.  </p><p>In 2021, the OPW approved funding of &euro;75,500 to Monaghan County Council for a project at Drumfalra, Ballybay, bringing the total approved funding under this scheme since 2009 for this Council to &euro;2,495,359. In December 2021 my Office received an application for funding for a project on Plantation Road, Monaghan from Peace Campus to Peter&rsquo;s Lake. This application is currently under consideration by my Office. Details of all approved localised flood relief schemes and coastal protection measures by my Office under this scheme are available on the OPW website at <i>www.gov.ie/opw</i></p><p>Under the Arterial Drainage Act 1945, as amended, the OPW maintains the Boyne, Inny, Blackwater and Glyde and Dee catchments in accordance with its statutory requirements. Cavan County Council has statutory maintenance responsibilities for the parts of Erne Catchment. </p></reply>

Project activity under PEACE PLUS will continue up to a closure date in 2029. </p><p>In order to facilitate early programme mobilisation, SEUPB has already commenced pre-development support.  For example, a workshop for potential applicants under Theme 3.2 PEACE PLUS Youth Programme was held on 10 December 2021.  </p></reply>

Under the Act, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) is the independent regulator for sound broadcasting content in the State. My officials have been engaging with the BAI regarding the actions they are taking to promote equality, diversity and inclusion in the broadcasting sector in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The BAI is currently undertaking a review of its Gender Action Plan which was launched in 2018. The 2018 Gender Action Plan set out its objectives under four key pillars: data collection and publication; research, encouraging gender initiatives, and accountability. Work on the review is on-going and BAI anticipate its completion in 2022. The findings of the BAI Gender Action Plan review, once complete, will contribute to the development of a BAI Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Strategy.</p>  <p>  In terms of funding for audio and audiovisual content for Irish audiences, the BAI now consider the number of women in key creative roles as a criterion in assessing applications for the Sound &amp;amp; Vision Scheme as a measure to support and encourage greater gender equality in the industry.</p>  <p>  The BAI provide funding for sectoral learning and development with the aim of challenging and supporting the Irish broadcasting sector to remain relevant and to deliver for the audience. Initiatives funded through sectoral learning and development include Women on Air, Women in Film and Television and Learning Waves. Women on Air&rsquo;s Board members and speakers volunteer their time to ensure a greater diversity of voices on the airwaves. A Womenonair.ie database for media of women who are ready, willing, and able to contribute to broadcast media opportunities was launched in January 2021.</p>  <p>  The BAI established and facilitate the Broadcasting Sustainability Network which aims to foster best practice and to provide support to the Irish broadcasting sector on sustainability based on the United Nation&rsquo;s Sustainability Development Goals including Goal 5: Gender Equality.</p>  <p>  In considering any proposals to require the allocation of a proportion of airtime to Irish artists, as set out in the details supplied, I am conscious of the legal and other factors which must be taken into account. The potential benefit to music production in Ireland must be balanced with the rights of broadcasters, subject to their contractual or regulatory obligations, to determine the type of content they wish to broadcast and to ensure commercial revenue particularly in the context of the current media climate. </p>  <p>  The introduction of any airplay quotas would need to be consistent with EU law, in particular those provisions of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) guaranteeing freedom of establishment and free movement of services and which prohibit discrimination based on nationality. </p>  <p>  An example of airplay quotas in the EU can be seen in France. In 1994, France introduced a mandatory quota for 40% airplay of French language music on French radio stations. In 2016, this quota was reduced to 35%.  Any quota for airplay would be considered to restrict free movement of services by placing music meeting certain criteria in a more advantaged position.  However, a quota for airplay of music in a particular language, as is the case in France, can be justified under EU case law, as the preservation and promotion of an official language of a Member State constitutes a general interest objective. </p>  <p>  Unlike music in a particular language, a quota system for music produced in a particular place, as suggested in the details supplied, does not appear to have grounds for exemption from the general requirements of EU law.  Therefore, without a similar justification on the grounds of linguistic protection, a quota for music produced in a particular Member State would be considered to restrict free movement of services by placing music produced in other Member States at a disadvantage.</p>  <p>  The Deputy can be assured however that I will continue to engage with all relevant stakeholders in order to further explore appropriate approaches to support equality, diversity and inclusion on our broadcasting services.</p></reply>

Sport Ireland does not allocate funding directly to clubs but channels it through the relevant National Governing Bodies of sport, in this case the Football Association of Ireland (FAI). </p>  <p>  I have referred the Deputy&rsquo;s question to Sport Ireland for direct reply in relation to any funding or support provided to the FAI for League of Ireland clubs, including the club mentioned by the Deputy, in 2020, including any funding under the Covid-19 funding schemes. I would ask the Deputy to contact my office if a reply is not received within 10 days. </p>  <p>  In relation to my Department&rsquo;s role, the Sports Capital and Equipment Programme (SCEP) is the primary vehicle for Government support for the development of sports and physical recreation facilities and the purchase of non-personal sports equipment throughout the country. League of Ireland clubs are entitled to apply directly for SCEP funding up to a value of &euro;300,000 for assistance to upgrade and improve stadia.</p>  <p>  The Large Scale Sport Infrastructure Fund (LSSIF) is designed for projects where the grant sought is greater than the maximum available under the SCEP. The first allocations under the LSSIF were announced in January 2020 and, thus far, approximately &euro;86.4m has been awarded to 33 different proposals.  </p>  <p>  Details of all allocations, including those made to League of Ireland clubs, under the SCEP since 2000 are published at www.gov.ie/en/collection/471ed5-sports-capital-allocations/. Details of the allocations made under the LSSIF are available at www.gov.ie/en/service/4113b3-large-scale-sport-infrastructure-fund-lssif/.</p></reply>

This requirement applies to persons that are accessing shared swimming pool facilities. Under the regulations in place, such a facility is not obliged to ask for, or check, the immunity status of children under the age of 18 who are accompanied by a vaccinated parent/guardian. It should be understood however that there is no legal prohibition on the owner/operator of such premises from asking for, or checking, the immunity status of people entering their own premises, as they see fit to do so. </p>  <p>  I should also like to provide additional clarification on the exceptional and special provisions applying to swimming pools. These provisions recognise the particular contribution that swimming pools make to water safety and to people&rsquo;s wellbeing generally, the individual nature of swimming activity and the structural, spatial characteristics of swimming pools. The Government has accordingly decided that the requirement for proof of immunity does not apply for access to them. This is a highly specific accommodation that the Government was keen to extend to swimming pool activity for the reasons just stated. Other non-swimming activities are not covered, even if they are conducted on the same premises or involve the sharing of reception or changing facilities. </p>  <p>  It is accepted that these differentiated arrangements pose additional challenges in certain instances but the responsibility rests with the owner/operator of such premises to make the necessary operational and logistical arrangements to give practical effect to the differing legal obligations to the different settings. However, it must be recognised that COVID-19 spreads when individuals and groups come into close contact with one another, enabling the virus to move from one person to another. The risk of infection spread is considerably greater in certain environments than others e.g. uncontrolled environments, crowded and noisy places, indoor environments, and poorly ventilated spaces.</p>  <p>  Changing rooms for swimming pools may remain open for mixed immunity groups but subject to appropriate risk mitigation measures. Advice on the safe use of changing rooms, and the kinds of mitigation measures that can be employed is to be found in a guidance note that is available on the website of Sport Ireland at the link below:</p>  <p>  www.sportireland.ie/covid19/return-to-sport-and-physical-activity </p>  <p>  I trust that the foregoing satisfactorily explains the position.</p></reply>

It is open to all and gives those who were not in attendance, other members of the arts community and the public a chance to contribute their thoughts to the ongoing development of the pilot scheme for a Basic Income for the Arts. </p><p>The purpose of the online consultation is to ensure that the general public, artists and those working in the arts and culture sector have the opportunity to contribute to the policy development for the pilot scheme and to offer suggestions from their experiences as artists, arts workers and members of resource organisations on key issues such as the schemes objectives, eligibility criteria, supporting emerging artists and participant responsibilities.</p><p>The selection process, application details and rate of payment for recipients of the Basic Income for the Arts pilot scheme will be finalised following the stakeholder engagement and online consultation, however, I can confirm the following: </p><p>- participation in the scheme will not be based on a means test.</p><p>- it will be a non-competitive process, therefore once a person satisfies the eligibility criteria they will be included in a randomised selection process.</p><p>Proposals for the parameters of the scheme will be finalised in light of the stakeholder engagement.  </p><p>I believe the Basic Income for the Arts pilot scheme will bring new life and support to the Arts and Cultural Sector and I hope it will provide an important legacy for our artists and creatives. In addition to this measure, I also secured continued investment of &euro;130m for the Arts Council in 2022. Combined, these measures will significantly contribute to the development of the arts in Ireland.</p></reply>

The first Scheme, the Strategic Tourism Transport Business Continuity Scheme 2022  was launched on 11 January and aims to support the tourism transport sector. This Scheme is open to Coach Tourism Operators and other strategic tourism transport operators (such as Tourism Chauffeur, Limousine Services, Escorted Private Tours and Hop-on Hop-Off Tourism Operators, Tourism Vehicle Rental Sector, Tourism Aviation &amp;amp; Rail Tour Operators) provided they meet the eligibility criteria which are similar to the 2021 Scheme. Amounts to individual businesses will be informed by the Scheme criteria and may vary accordingly. </p></reply>

The Irish hare is also listed on Annex V of EU Directive 92/43/EEC (the Habitats Directive) and this listing requires member states to manage the species&rsquo; sustainably. The Habitats Directive also requires Ireland to make a detailed report every six years on the conservation status of all listed species, including the Irish hare. Ireland&rsquo;s most recent report in 2019 included a comprehensive assessment of the range, population status, habitat and threats for the Irish hare. The report can be downloaded at www.npws.ie/publications/article-17-reports/article-17-reports-2019</p>  <p>  The 2019 report notes that the Hare is widespread and common in Ireland with a broad habitat niche; it is found throughout the country from coastal habitats to upland heath and bog. The report does highlight some concerns about the loss of habitat quality due to agricultural intensification and afforestation, but overall the species is considered to be in favourable conservation status. In addition, the most recent Red Data List for Mammals in Ireland (2019) confirmed that the species is not threatened; it assessed the Irish hare as &ldquo;Least concern&rdquo;: www.npws.ie/sites/default/files/publications/pdf/Red%20List%20No.%2012%20Mammals.pdf</p>  <p>  The control of live hare coursing, including the operation of individual coursing meetings and managing the use of hares for that activity, is carried out under the Greyhound Industry Act 1958, which is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.

Conserving nature requires a range of strategies to succeed, with designation of conservation areas required under both European (Birds and Habitats Directives) and national laws.</p><p>There are three main types of designations within Ireland - (i) Natural Heritage Areas (NHAs), (ii) Special Areas of Conservation (SACs), and (iii) Special Protection Areas (SPAs). </p><p>NHAs are areas protected under the Wildlife Act 1976 (as amended). They are areas considered important at a national level for the habitats present, or which hold species of plants and animals whose habitat needs protection, and where protection of the site will make a significant contribution to the conservation of one or more species or habitats which are considered vulnerable, rare or endangered.</p><p>Sites of significance at a European level are known as Natura 2000 sites, and designated for protection under the EU Nature Directives. These sites fall into two categories: Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) and Special Protection Areas (SPAs) as set out below.</p><p>SACs are prime wildlife conservation areas, selected under the EU Habitats Directive which was transposed into Irish law by the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011. The Directive lists certain habitats and species that must be protected within SACs.</p><p>SPAs are designated for the protection of listed rare and vulnerable bird species, regularly occurring migratory species and wetlands, especially those of international importance. They are selected under the EU Birds Directive. </p><p>In all cases, sites are evaluated by scientific staff within the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) of my Department before being proposed for designation. Sites should be at least large enough to provide the physical and semi-natural conditions for the maintenance of a particular habitat and/or species.</p><p>Designated sites are fully protected from the time of first notification and advertising. Protection for these sites comes in the form of Activities Requiring Consent (ARCs). These activities require the permission of the Minister before they can be carried out and will be considered based on the level of damage or harm to habitats and/or species that will occur as a result of the activity taking place. Different ARCs apply to each site depending on what habitats and/or species are present.</p><p>Following the decision by the Minister to designate a site, landowners, known to the Department, are notified in writing. Advertisements are placed in National and regional newspapers and notices are broadcast on radio. In addition, notices are displayed in local Government offices, Garda stations and National libraries. Landowners are given three months in which to appeal the designation and/or to object to the Ministerial Order in relation to ARCs. </p><p>Compensation may also be available to landowners in certain circumstances. When the appeals process has been completed, the sites are formally designated by Statutory Instrument.</p><p>Certain other forms of protection may be afforded to sites as set out below:</p><p><b>Nature Reserves </b>- An area of importance to wildlife, which is protected by Ministerial order under the Wildlife Acts. </p><p>The Wildlife Act 1976 empowers the Minister to establish or recognise Nature Reserves on state-owned or private land. The criteria for Nature Reserve Status is as follows:</p><p>(i) includes the habitat or forms the habitat of part of the habitat of one or more species or community of flora or fauna being a species or community which is of scientific interest, or</p><p>(ii) includes or forms an ecosystem which is of scientific interest,</p><p>and (iii) that the habitat or ecosystem is likely to benefit if measures are taken for its protection.</p><p>Section 15 of the Act refers to the Establishment Order for Reserves on lands owned by the Minister or by the State. Section 16 of the Act refers to the Recognition Order for Reserves on land other than land to which Section 15 applies.  The land is managed so as to secure, as best may be, the objective indicated in the establishment/recognition order having regard to and in accordance with the general protection of the natural environment.  In the case of a Nature Reserve on private lands, the owner(s) of the land must commit to managing the land as a nature reserve prior to the issue of a Recognition Order.</p><p>For any suitable land to acquire the status of Nature Reserve, it has to be established or recognised as such by the Minister. Any proposal to establish or recognise a Nature Reserve has to be first assessed by the Scientific Unit of the NPWS. The Scientific Unit has to establish that the area in question meets the criteria as listed above. If the criteria mentioned above are met, the designation process may begin.  </p><p>A Statutory Instrument (S.I.) is drafted, and is accompanied by a map of the proposed reserve, the schedule (i.e. scientific description of the site) and ,in the event of a private nature reserve designation (section 16 of the Wildlife Act 1976)  a commitment letter from the land owner(s) to manage the land as a nature reserve. Relevant statutory bodies are consulted if required. If no objections are expressed, the S.I. is signed  and sealed by the Minister in exercise of the powers conferred on him/her by section 16 of the Wildlife Act 1976. </p><p><b>Refuge for Fauna or Flora</b>- </p><p>Section 17 of the Wildlife Act 1976, provides that where the Minister considers that particular species of fauna or flora should be specially protected on an area of land, the Minister may designate that land as a refuge. The land in question should be, or be contiguous to, a habitat of the species requiring special protection. Or, the land may have features of the landscape which are of major importance to those species as they are essential for migration, dispersal and genetic exchange &ndash; for example ponds or small woods that function as stepping stones. </p><p>The seven refuges designated to date have been to specially protect breeding birds on marine cliffs and small islands. One example is, Refuge For Fauna (Bull Rock) Designation Order, 1991. The land, the subject of the Order, is designated as a refuge to specially protect the Gannet, Kittiwake, Storm Petrel and Razorbill. The Order places restrictions on when a person may climb the cliff face within the refuge. It also prohibits actions such as wilfully disturbing birds for which the land is a refuge;  carrying on any part of the refuge a firearm or other weapon that could be used to hunt the birds; and dumping or disposing of any deleterious matter which could cause death or injury to the birds.  </p><p>Before designating such a refuge, the Minister must conduct prior consultation with public authorities and notify the owner or occupier of the land and the general public, in order to allow for objections to be made. Compensation may be paid to a person with an interest in or over the land for any decrease in its value following designation. </p></reply>

Under this Category, ownership and management should normally be by the highest competent authority of the State. Accordingly, all National Parks in Ireland are fully owned and managed by the State through the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) Division of my Department. It is the policy of my Department to abide by the criteria and standards for the National Parks laid down by the IUCN which can be found at www.iucn.org/theme/protected-areas/about/protected-areas-categories/category-ii-national-park.</p>  <p>  With regard to statutory protection of National Parks, the principal national legislation, providing for the protection of wildlife and the control of some activities that may adversely affect wildlife, is the Wildlife Act 1976, and the Wildlife (Amendment) Act 2000.  Conservation of biodiversity within our National Parks network has been strengthened and expanding by EU law, most notably, EU Directives 92/43/EEC 1992 (Habitats Directive), 2009/147/EC (Birds Directive), 2011/92/EU (EIA Directive) and 2001/43/EC (SEA Directive).  The State Property Act 1954 and the National Monuments Act 1930 make provisions for the vesting and management of state owned property and the protection and preservation of national monuments respectively.</p>  <p>  Through the NPWS, my Department manages an extensive network of natural heritage sites of some 87,000 hectares. The six existing National Parks of Ireland account for circa 65,000 hectares of this network.  I am ever mindful of the need to focus on the core responsibilities relating to the management of these national parks.  Irelands National Parks are managed from a conservation perspective, and attract in excess of 4 million visitors annually.  My Departments on-going commitment to the preservation and protection of our natural heritage can be recognised through the major capital investment programmes, with a strong emphasis on conservation and the protection and preservation of our most fragile environments. </p></reply>

Since its establishment in 2018 the Programme has delivered tools that significantly enhance barrier detection and assessment, and establish an inventory which can inform prioritisation and mitigation of these structures. To date, the national inventory of barrier structures is approximately 30% complete. The National Barrier Database contains approximately 73,000 potential barriers (identified during the first barriers programme cycle between 2018 and 2021); it is estimated that 10,100 of these have a high probability of being barriers to fish passage on the Irish river network. </p>  <p>The second cycle of the National Barrier Programme beginning this year will continue the works required to deliver an inventory of barrier structures on Irish rivers. The National Barrier Programme is supported by applied studies that will inform best practice approaches to barrier mitigation. This data will make a significant contribution to finalising the Programme of Measures to be included in the 3rd   cycle of the River Basin Management Plan for the years 2022-2027.</p>  <p>  This programme will consider barrier structures on all Irish rivers. It will also include the development of a national, regional and catchment-based prioritisation process to identify structures requiring mitigation; and provide supporting information for funding proposals for mitigation works. </p>  <p>  In addition, there is provision for a data-led research and monitoring programme to evaluate the impact of barriers and the effectiveness of various management approaches.</p>  <p>  Funding allocations for barrier removal and remediation will be finalised as part of the proposed hydromorphology measures in the River Basin Management Plan 2022-2027 later in 2022.</p></reply>

One major output from my Department's Strategic Partnership with F&aacute;ilte Ireland, was a Masterplan for the six National Parks and Nature Reserves. This provides a high level and integrated blueprint for the NPWS to invest in and better manage the Parks for conservation, biodiversity and visitor alike. In effect, it enables the aligning of conservation objectives of the Parks with increasing visitor appeal and numbers. The Masterplan guides the phased development of these enhanced visitor facilities and improved visitor experiences based on research into international best practice. My Department intends to produce visitor and management plans for its National Parks on an on-going basis.</p>  <p>  As part of my Department&rsquo;s continuing commitment and contribution to protecting our heritage and recreation product, it has been exploring ways to optimise the sustainable potential of heritage sites under our control in a way that is compatible with conservation objectives. In this context, it should be noted that my Department negotiated the extension of Wicklow Mountains National Park by purchasing almost 4,900 acres of Dublin Uplands at Glenasmole in 2016 at a cost of &euro;800,000. In 2017, the entire Wild Nephin area was consolidated into the ownership of the NPWS. This creates a State &ndash; owned re-wilding project of over 11,000 hectares and aims to provide increased nature conservation benefits and biodiversity as well as enhanced recreational and social benefits through the &lsquo;re-wilding&rsquo; of the forest which adjoins the National Park.</p>  <p>  Given the resources available within our National Parks and Nature Reserves, I am of course mindful of the need to focus on the core responsibilities relating to the management of the existing Parks and Reserves lands; my Department is focused upon conservation objectives for Natura 2000 sites in the first instance. Ireland's 3rd National Biodiversity Plan runs from 2017 to 2021 and captures the objectives, targets and actions for biodiversity to be undertaken by a wide range of stakeholders in government, civil society and private sectors to achieve Ireland&rsquo;s Vision for Biodiversity not just in our own National Parks, but countrywide.</p></reply>

The Task Force adopted a collaborative approach to identify the policies and supports necessary to support breeding Curlew in Ireland. A wide range of stakeholder groups contributed and a series of 26 agreed recommendations was published in 2019.  Good progress has been made in terms of some of the recommendations but as is the case with challenging conservation issues, further progress could be made in other areas.</p>  <p>  To establish how many pairs of Curlew remain breeding in Ireland and where they are, NPWS has completed two national surveys in recent years, the first of which was published in a journal called Wader Study.  The second survey was completed in 2021 and the data is being currently analysed and compiled.</p>  <p>  Approximately &euro;10m in funding has been dedicated to on-the-ground measures for Curlew over the past five years, predominantly through GLAS, which is administered by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p>  <p>  In addition to GLAS, the Curlew Conservation Programme, established in 2017 by NPWS,  operates across nine geographical areas. These combined efforts have supported overall productivity levels that should sustain a stable population of Curlew. However, in some of the nine areas productivity levels are still below the critical threshold.  </p>  <p>  For the nine areas over the five years to date, a total of approximately &euro;1.5m has been spent. In 2022, with the continued partnership of the Department of Agriculture, Food &amp;amp; the Marine, a budget of &euro;0.5m has been allocated.</p>  <p>  The Irish Breeding Curlew European Innovation Partnership operates in two other localities and this is funded by Irish Rural Development Programme, administered by both the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Bird Watch Ireland.  The budget for this project is &euro;1.1m.</p>  <p>  A Memorandum of Understanding between NPWS and RSPB Northern Ireland was signed in 2021 to progress a feasibility study for curlew headstarting on an all-island basis. This is a necessary step in establishing whether headstarting can be a valuable tool in efforts to reverse the decline in Curlew.</p>  <p>  Work by NPWS and UCD is progressing to support the analysis of satellite tracking data for breeding Curlew in Ireland, under a Masters Research Project, to better understand the landscapes that Curlew utilise.</p>  <p>  In terms of the CAP Strategic Plan up until 2027, NPWS and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine are proposing to support Curlew and other breeding waders under a dedicated delivery framework, funded by the CAP and the national exchequer. This will include dedicated survey, nest protection and habitat enhancement across the country in various breeding wader hotspots.</p></reply>

It sets out four key pillars on which our maritime planning system is to be based, namely: forward planning; the establishment of the Maritime Area Regulatory Authority, or MARA; development consent; and enforcement.</p>  <p>  Forward planning happens through the National Marine Planning Framework and comprehensive sub-national planning. Ireland's National Marine Planning Framework (NMPF) was launched on 1 July 2021 and is Ireland&rsquo;s first comprehensive marine spatial planning framework. The NMPF brings together all marine-based human activities for the first time, outlining the Government&rsquo;s vision, objectives and marine planning policies for each marine activity.</p>  <p>  The establishment of MARA will mean that we will have a new regulatory agency to consider applications for Maritime Area Consent (MAC); licence scheduled maritime usages; ensure compliance and enforcement of MACs, licences and offshore development consents; assume responsibility for the management and enforcement of the existing foreshore portfolio of leases and licences; and provide a nexus for inter-agency cooperation and collaboration.</p>  <p>  The legislation provides for consent to development proposals by the Board and local authorities. The Board will examine the merits of projects and will balance their impacts against the relevant environmental objectives. Any project that may give rise to likely significant effects on the environment will need to be accompanied by an appropriate environmental and/or ecological report.</p>  <p>  Comprehensive enforcement provisions are included to copper-fasten these new provisions.</p>  <p>  The NMPF will be a key decision-making tool for regulatory authorities and policy makers into the future in a number of ways, including decisions on individual consent applications which will have to have regard to the provisions of the plan in the same way that terrestrial plans form part of the decision-making tool kit in the on-land planning process.</p>  <p>  The legislation provides for spatial designations for specified areas and uses called Designated Maritime Area Plans, or DMAPs. DMAPs are prepared by a designated competent authority, underpinned by a mandatory Public Participation Statement and subject to Ministerial oversight and Oireachtas approval. Specific DMAPs may include allowed or restricted usages and mitigating or beneficial measures. A DMAP can be used for environmental purposes in order to safeguard certain areas of environmental concern - for example, to promote the safeguarding of fragile habitats.</p>  <p>  It should be noted, however, that this new legislation is just one piece in a suite of maritime legislation, coming after the Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2021 and before forthcoming legislation on Marine Protected Areas.  Work has commenced on development of a General Scheme of a Bill to allow for designation of Marine Protected Areas and is this Bill is expected to come before the Oireachtas in 2022. This will in due course further underpin this new marine planning system while continuing to protect the State's most important asset, our maritime area.</p></reply>

The Programme at that time was directly funded by my Department. In 2009, a request was sent to local authorities, including Clare County Council, to review and prioritise their proposals for new capital works in their areas. I understand that the scheme in question was not among the priority schemes selected for inclusion by Clare County Council in the Water Services Investment Programme 2010-2012.</p>  <p>  Since 1 January 2014, Irish Water has statutory responsibility for all aspects of water services planning, delivery and operation at national, regional and local levels. The scope, prioritisation and progression of individual projects, including the plant referred to, is a matter for Irish Water, and is approved through its own internal governance structures.</p>  <p>  The Water Services Policy Statement 2018-2025 provides clear direction to strategic planning and decision making on water and waste water services in Ireland. The Policy Statement sets out a series of high-level policy objectives across three thematic objective areas of Quality, Conservation and Future Proofing, which must be pursued when planning capital investment and framing current spending plans.</p>  <p>  Taking account of the Water Services Policy Statement, Irish Water delivers its services in accordance with its statutory Water Services Strategic Plan 2015-2040, which sets out a high-level strategy over 25 years to ensure the provision of clean safe drinking water, effective management of waste water, environmental protection and support for economic and social development.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to funding Irish Water's capital investment plan for water infrastructure on a multi-annual basis. The National Development Plan 2021-2030 commits to almost &euro;6 billion capital investment by Irish Water in the period 2021-2025, of which over &euro;4.5 billion will be Voted Exchequer funding in respect of domestic water services.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2022, I secured over &euro;1.57 billion to support water services. This includes &euro;1.459 billion for domestic water services provision by Irish Water. The investment will deliver significant improvements in our public water and waste water services, and support a range of programmes delivering improved water quality in our rivers, lakes and marine area.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government supports the uptake of Irish Water's Small Towns and Villages Growth Programme 2020-2024, which will provide water and waste water growth capacity in smaller settlements that would otherwise not be provided for in Irish Water's capital investment plan.  Complementary to that Programme, my Department is also currently examining waste water requirements in the context of villages and similar settlements that do not have access to public waste water infrastructure. I have instructed the relevant officials in my Department to prepare a report on this topic at a national level.  This process is at an advanced stage, and I will be in a position to consider the matter once I have received the final report.</p>  <p>  In addition, Irish Water has established a dedicated team to deal with representations and queries from public representatives.  The team can be contacted via email to oireachtasmembers@water.ie or by telephone on a dedicated number, 1890 578 578.</p></reply>

Housing for All also recognises the criticality of interagency supports which are required to address the complex combination of social, health and economic needs of homeless persons and those at risk of homelessness, in addition to their specific housing need. </p>  <p>  To this end, I have recently established a National Homeless Action Committee which held its first meeting in December. All of the key Government departments, agencies and stakeholders are represented on the Committee. The new body will bring better co-ordination in driving policy measures and actions. A key first task for the Committee is homelessness.  </p>  <p>  Providing early intervention to people at risk of homelessness is already an existing priority for Government. Local authorities already oversee a range of homeless prevention and tenancy sustainment measures. Many of these services are operated on behalf of local authorities by NGO service delivery partners and are funded by my Department.  </p>  <p>  My Department is also funding Threshold&rsquo;s Tenancy Protection Service. This service provides advice and support to individuals, couples and families living in private rented accommodation experiencing tenancy problems. This service has been instrumental in preventing homelessness in the first instance and supporting people to remain in their homes.</p>  <p>  In addition, the &lsquo;HAP Placefinder Service&rsquo; is playing a vital role in keeping families out of homelessness and in housing families who find themselves in emergency accommodation.  Under the Placefinder service, all local authorities are provided with the options to pay deposits and advance rental payments for any households in emergency homeless accommodation, in order to secure accommodation. Local authorities can offer households in emergency accommodation the option to source accommodation themselves or with the assistance of Placefinder officers.</p>  <p>  The Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (Extension of Notice Periods) Bill 2021 was introduced by Opposition parties on behalf of Simon Communities Ireland and was debated during Private Members&rsquo; time in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on Tuesday, 14 December 2021.</p>  <p>  The contents of the Bill will be considered in the context of the upcoming review of Termination Notice periods, in line with section 16(3) of the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019.</p></reply>

Details of payments to local authorities to fund the commercial rates waiver for 2020 can be found at this link: www.gov.ie/en/publication/3ac02-support-for-businesses-impacted-by-covid-19-through-the-commercial-rates-waiver/ </p><p>A further &euro;424m was recouped to local authorities by Government to fund the cost of a commercial rates waiver for the first nine months of 2021. Details of payments made to local authorities in relation to Q1 to Q3 2021 can also be found at the above link. These are unprecedented measures, which offered support to businesses and financial certainty to local authorities. The Government, in Budget 2022, announced a more targeted commercial rates waiver for Q4 2021 to cover the hospitality, leisure and entertainment, and tourism sectors. &euro;62.3m has been allocated by Government for this waiver. The annual financial statements for 2020 have not yet been audited and published. Therefore it is not possible to provide a post-Covid 19 analysis of the yield to the local authorities from commercial rates.</p><p>The Government recognised the need to modernise the collection of rates and the Local Government Rates and Other Matters Act 2019 was enacted on 11 July 2019. Elements of the Act include a modernisation of rates legislation and practice, including variation of rates payment arrangements; provision that newly valued properties and amendments to valuations of existing properties are effective immediately for rating purposes; the pro-rata levying of rates on occupiers based on period in occupation within a year; provision to enable a local authority to introduce rates waiver schemes to support the implementation of policy objectives, including: local economic and community plans; objectives contained in Development Plans, Local Area Plans and national planning policies; the application of interest payments on unpaid rates; and minimum charges for vacant commercial premises.</p><p>Currently only a portion of the Act has been commenced. Commencement of the remaining elements of the Act has been delayed due to the COVID crisis. The revised aim is to achieve the necessary amendments and make prescribed regulations in 2022 so that the legislation would be operational for the planning of local authority 2023 budgets.</p></reply>

Decisions with regard to the optimum work programme of the Valuation Office, including the selection, sequencing and grouping of rating authority areas for revaluation, are a matter for the independent Commissioner, taking into account the extensive valuation work required in each case and in terms of engaging with ratepayers and other stakeholders.</p>  <p>  In this regard, the Valuation Office is currently engaged in a national revaluation programme. The objective of the programme is to ensure that the first revaluation of all rating authority areas in over 160 years is completed, as soon as possible, on a phased basis.</p>  <p>  Revaluation is a process whereby all rateable properties in a local authority area, rather than in a particular business sector, are valued periodically by reference to a single valuation date. The statutory provisions in the Valuation Acts provide for the revaluation of all rateable property within a rating authority area so as to reflect changes in value due to economic factors, differential movements in property values or other external factors such as changes in the business environment or infrastructural changes in the vicinity of a property. Each local authority area is a legal entity in its own right for the purposes of carrying out a revaluation. This requires the application of a separate valuation order and the publication of a new valuation list for each local authority area.</p>  <p>  The Local Government Act 2001, as amended by the Local Government Reform Act 2014, provides the legislative basis for the local authority budget process. It is a matter for each local authority to determine the total amount of rates to be levied by it in a particular year having regard to both locally identified needs and available resources. The size or aggregate value of rateable properties on a valuation list does not determine the total amount of rates to be collected by a local authority and the sequencing of revaluations does not affect this process.</p>  <p>  Having a modern valuation base is very important for the levying of commercial rates on a fair and equitable basis across all economic sectors. The revaluation reflects changes in value due to economic factors such as business turnover, differential movements in property values or other external factors and changes in the local business environment. The revaluation programme is not designed to benefit any particular business categories.</p>  <p>  Once the first revaluation of all areas is completed, the exercise must be repeated on a recurring basis, with revaluations required no sooner than five years and no later than ten years after the previous revaluation. Where frequent revaluations occur on a rolling basis, this ensures equity and uniformity of the entire valuation system which underpins commercial rates.</p></reply>

The minimum income requirement has a dual purpose - it ensures the scheme is sustainable and the tenant purchasing the house has the financial means to maintain and insure the property for the duration of the charged period. For these reasons, certain social welfare payments, including Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, are not considered when determining an applicant's reckonable income.</p><p>In line with commitments in <i>Housing for All, A New Housing Plan for Ireland</i>, I recently introduced changes to the Tenant Purchase Scheme.

Complementary projects include Moore Street Public Realm Renewal works with the intention of reactivating one of the most important trading streets in the city along with structural and restoration works to the national monument at 14-17 Moore Street which is in my ownership as Minister and which will facilitate the protection and reuse of these historic buildings as an iconic heritage/visitor attraction (1916 Commemorative Centre) alongside the rejuvenation of the historic street. Plans are under way for the sensitive restoration of the national monument.</p>  <p>  The Moore Street Advisory Group produced its final report, which was presented to Minister O&rsquo;Brien and myself, last year. This report included recommendations in relation to the national monument at 14-17 Moore Street as well as recommendations for the future development of the wider Moore Street area. This report was noted by Cabinet in May 2021.</p>  <p>  Much of the property surrounding the national monument is in private ownership.

The scheme is governed by the Housing (Sale of Local Authority Houses) Regulations 2015. These regulations provide for specified classes of houses to be excluded from sale, including those provided to local authorities under Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000.</p><p>The Part V provisions seek to promote social integration and secure mixed tenure, sustainable communities. Accordingly, Part V properties are excluded from the scheme to ensure the original policy goals of the legislation are not eroded over time and the properties remain available for people most in need of social housing support.</p><p>In line with commitments in <i>Housing for All, A New Housing Plan for Ireland</i>, I recently introduced changes to the Tenant Purchase Scheme. These included <i>inter alia </i>revising the minimum income criteria for applicants downwards from &euro;15,000 to &euro;12,500, thereby allowing older tenants in particular (whose only income might be the contributory or non-contributory State pension) to buy their homes if they have the means.</p></reply>

It was confirmed that my Department would support costs being experienced by Kildare County Council where the works relate exclusively to energy efficiency works up to a B2/Cost Optimal BER level and that there has been overall compliance with the programme and that the appropriate supporting documentation is available on all funding claims being made.</p>  <p>  The Council was reminded that the spread of properties under the programme were to include a mix of house types requiring various levels of work in order to ensure the average cost per unit falls within the limits set by my Department. This approach gives local authorities the flexibility to recoup costs of up to &euro;45,400 on some individual homes, as long as the overall claim cost per home does not exceed an average of &euro;27,000.</p>  <p>  Learning from the 2021 programme will inform the 2022 programme.</p></reply>

The making of valuations for rating purposes is the sole responsibility of the Commissioner and I, as Minister, have no function in decisions in this regard.</p>  <p>  Under Irish law there is a distinct separation of function between the valuation of rateable property and the setting and collection of commercial rates. The amount of rates payable by a ratepayer in any calendar year is a product of the valuation set by the Commissioner of Valuation, multiplied by the Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV) decided annually by the elected members of each local authority. The annual setting of the ARV is a reserved function of the elected members of each local authority and the Commissioner of Valuation has no function in that regard.</p>  <p>  The basis of rateable valuation for all property is set out in Part 11 of the Valuation Act 2001. Section 48 provides that the method of determining a property&rsquo;s value generally is &ldquo;net annual value&rdquo;. Net annual value is specifically defined as the rental value for which one year with another, the building might, in its actual state, be reasonably expected to let from year to year, on the assumption, that the probable average annual cost of repairs, insurance and other expenses (if any) that would be necessary to maintain the property in that state, and all rates and other taxes in respect of the property, are borne by the tenant of the property.</p>  <p>  All valuations are carried out in accordance with the provisions of the Valuation Acts, and in keeping with accepted valuation methodologies, best practice internationally and valuation principles and case law arising from the independent Valuation Tribunal and the higher courts and reflect among other things the use and location of the particular property. In the case of a property where its use and/or location might result in a degree of seasonality this is reflected in the valuation of the property and by extension the rates liability.</p>  <p>  There are a number of avenues of redress for an occupier of rateable property who is dissatisfied with a determination of valuation made under the provisions of the Valuation Acts, 2001-2020. Firstly, before a determination is made, there is a right to make representations to the Valuation Office in relation to a proposed valuation. Later in the process, if the occupier is still dissatisfied with the determination, there is a right of appeal to the Valuation Tribunal which is an independent body set up for the purpose of hearing appeals against determinations of the Valuation Office. Finally, there is a right of appeal to the Higher Courts on a point of law.</p></reply>

The Working Group recommended a number of revisions to the existing grant scheme that provided support towards the remediation, repair, or upgrading works to, or the replacement of, domestic waste water treatment systems. The revised and new regulations that underpin the grant schemes were published in May 2020.</p>  <p>  The Water Services Act 2007, as amended, required all owners of premises served by an individual domestic waste water treatment system to have the system entered into a register maintained by local authorities. The prescribed date of 1 February 2013 was appointed by the Water Services Act 2007 and 2012 Domestic Waste Water Treatment Systems (Registration) Regulations 2012, as amended. New houses with domestic treatment systems continue to be required to register.</p>  <p>  The strict cut-off date, together with sanctions for non-compliance, was successful ensuring that an estimated 95% of systems were registered. Amending this provision to allow for retrospective registration would require amendments to primary legislation. It was not possible to do so as part of the introduction of the revised grant schemes which were effected by regulations.</p>  <p>  In implementing the revised arrangements, my Department has undertaken to conduct a review of the grant schemes, to ensure their continued alignment with policy objectives. The specifics of this review are currently being formalised and the issue of the registration cut-off date will be considered, noting, of course, that primary legislation would be required to effect such a change. This review is expected to be completed this year.</p></reply>

In this regard, the Dublin Bay Task Force, chaired by Dublin City Council is carrying out work aimed at improving bathing water quality all year round, including an assessment of inputs to Elm Park Stream. As part of this work the following actions have or will be undertaken:</p> <blockquote> 	Irish Water and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council has recently closed out a sewer overflow at Larchfield after delivering upgrades to the combined drainage infrastructure at that location. This eliminates one source of pollution to the Elm Park Stream;<br /><br />Installation of a flow and water quality monitor near the outlet of the Elm Park stream will provide information on pollutant loads in the stream just before it discharges to the beaches. This will assist in predicting water quality problems in order to protect public health; and <br /><br />A report is being finalised on behalf of the Task Force to identify pollutant sources and prioritise remediation works within the Elm Park Stream catchment. This report will support local authority engagement with private land owners for drainage misconnection identification and infrastructural rectification works. </blockquote></reply>

This strategy provides for a broad suite of measures including for first-time buyers. </p><p>In particular, in the context of addressing vacancy and and efficient use of existing stock, the strategy provides for the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe (Towns) Fund which will be delivered by local authorities for the provision of serviced sites for housing, to attract people to build their own homes and to support the refurbishment of vacant properties, enabling people to live in small towns and villages, in a sustainable way. </p><p>In addition, Housing for All provides for the launching of  a programme of Compulsory Purchase Orders to bring vacant units to the market for sale, as well as activating unused State owned properties for this purpose.  Housing for All also recognises the potential to utilise relevant heritage building stock for residential purposes, and it is also anticipated funding will be made available under the new round of European Regional Development Fund to tackle vacancy and dereliction in towns.</p><p>Separately, my colleague Eamonn Ryan, T.D., Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment recently published the National Retrofit Plan, as part of the Climate Action Plan, which sets out ambitious plan for the retrofitting  of a significant number homes by the end of 2030. The SEAI grant schemes continue to be a central element of the Government&rsquo;s strategy to encourage homeowners to retrofit their homes and a new National Retrofit Scheme is planned to be launched this year.</p><p>Housing for All also commits to ensuring that vacant homes officers, in each local authority, are full-time officers to support the work of a Vacant Homes Office. My Department will be communicating with local authorities, subsequent to the forthcoming launch of the town centre first policy, with a particular focus on tackling vacancy and dereliction to support the regeneration of town centres including to ensure that vacant homes officers are full-time officers. This important resource, at the local level, will act as the single point of contact to deal with enquiries on all of the type of grants available from for the refurbishment of properties.</p></reply>

Under the scheme, a local authority can acquire ownership of properties with unsustainable local authority mortgages, thus enabling the household to remain in their home as social housing tenants.

The property in question must also meet certain eligibility criteria. The concept of the scheme is that a household with an unsustainable mortgage goes from being a homeowner to being a social housing tenant. The borrower surrenders their property to their lender who sells it to a MTR provider which can be either an Approved Housing Body (AHB) or since 2018 a private company, Home for Life.  The AHB or local authority (in the case where the property is sold to a private company) becomes the landlord and the borrower remains in the property as a tenant paying a differential rent to the landlord based on his or her income.</p><p>To the end of September 2021, 1497 households with unsustainable private mortgages have completed the MTR scheme since its introduction nationally in 2013. 951 households had their case completed by an AHB. The Housing Agency publishes, on a quarterly basis, detailed statistical information on the operation of the MTR scheme including a purchaser status report which shows a breakdown of the number of active, completed, ineligible and terminated cases per purchaser, including AHBs. This information is available on the Housing Agency's website at the following link: <i>www.housingagency.ie/housing-information/mortgage-rent-statistics </i></p><p>The Capital Advance Leasing Facility (CALF) funding is capital support provided to AHBs by local authorities to facilitate the funding of construction, acquisition or refurbishment of new social housing units, including units acquired through the Mortgage to Rent scheme. My Department can provide CALF funding of up to 40% in the case of the Mortgage to Rent scheme for eligible projects, with the housing units provided to local authorities for social housing use under long-term lease arrangements known as Payment and Availability Agreements. A nominal interest rate of 2% fixed per annum is charged by the local authority on the initial capital amount. Repayments on either the capital or interest are not required during the term of the loan (between 10 and 30 years), although where an AHB chooses to, repayments can be made during the term. At the end of the term, the outstanding capital amount plus the interest accrued, is owed and repayable to the local authority. The local authority issues the CALF monies to the AHB and the local authority, in turn, recoups same from the Department. The remainder of the capital cost is sourced by the AHB through other borrowings to which the local authorities are not party.  All proposals for CALF are submitted to my Department by AHBs for review, to ensure that each project complies with the terms of the CALF and that there are sufficient funds available.</p><p>My Department does not hold information on the loan agreements under CALF, as the loan agreement, is between the local authority and the relevant AHB.  Accordingly, information on the number and value of CALF loans, including the balance owing, is held by the relevant local authorities. The value and term of each loan varies by project.</p><p>My Department also supports AHBs on MTR projects by providing CALF funding for eligible start-up costs of up to 1.5% of the total capital cost or since March 2018, up to &euro;3,300 (ex. VAT), whichever is lesser. Up to the 30th November 2021, these costs were paid directly from my Department to the AHB. For cases approved from the 1st December 2021, AHBs will submit these claims to the local authority, who will then seek recoupment from my Department for the vouched expenditure. </p><p>The table below shows CALF capital expenditure by my Department for the AHB Mortgage to Rent scheme. It is important to note that owing to the nature of the CALF, expenditure relating to properties may span a number of payment periods. </p><p><b>AHB &ndash;  MTR </b>-  <b>CALF Funding</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Year </th>       <th>Expenditure </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2015 </td>       <td>&euro;0.780m </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016 </td>       <td>&euro;1.795m </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017 </td>       <td>&euro;3.019m </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018 </td>       <td>&euro;4.379m </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019 </td>       <td>&euro;8.902m </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020 </td>       <td>&euro;6.697m </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The Programme for Government and Housing for All includes a commitment to strengthen the Mortgage to Rent Scheme and ensure that it is helping those who need it. Building on the significant improvements already made to the scheme since the last review in 2017, my Department is currently working closely with the Housing Agency and key stakeholders to identify any further improvements required to the scheme. A review of the MTR scheme is due to be published shortly. </p></reply>

Where the cost is prohibitive to upgrade a house to this level, the regulations provide for a cost optimal solution.</p>  <p>  Limerick City and County Council, as the lead agency in the regeneration programme, has carried out surveys of houses in the programme to determine a scope of works for each particular dwelling and determine the most cost optimal solution to meet the target BER rating. The provision of secondary heating systems i.e. stoves, is generally not supported and are only considered in cases where the local authority can justify their inclusion.</p>  <p>  The Council has advised that in the course of the thermal upgrade programme, the issue of the removal of asbestos has arisen. All 53 properties in thermal upgrade Contact 123 have been identified as having asbestos.  Asbestos will typically be removed as part of a thermal upgrade contract only in cases where it represents a particular risk to the occupation of a property or to the completion of the proposed thermal upgrade works. Limerick City and County Council has advised that the asbestos identified in Contract 123 is not considered to represent a risk to occupant health, owing to its stable condition and largely inaccessible location within properties and therefore it is not being removed as part of the contract.</p></reply>

Taken together, these measures will deliver on the Programme for Government commitment to put affordability at the heart of the housing system and prioritise the increased supply of affordable homes. This will be done through (1) delivering affordable homes for purchase via local authority led affordable purchase dwelling arrangements, (2) the introduction of a new form of tenure and delivery of homes under Cost Rental, (3) a new &lsquo;First Home&rsquo; affordable purchase shared equity scheme, and (4) expanding Part V planning requirements to increase the 10% contribution requirement to 20% and to apply it to cost rental as well as social and affordable housing.  </p>  <p>  Specifically, Part 4 of the Act provides the basis for the establishment of the First Home scheme which, as has been acknowledged by the Central Bank of Ireland, is an equity product rather than a loan scheme. </p>  <p>  The First Home scheme will support first-time buyers on moderate incomes to buy a new-build home. The banking sector has confirmed it is committed to working with the State to develop and deliver this scheme. Budget 2022 allocated &euro;44 million to my Department for First Home. The banking sector has agreed in principle to match State equity funding in order to increase the pool of funding available to potential new homeowners under the scheme. Subject to the necessary approvals by all parties, it is anticipated that the First Home scheme will operate for the period 2022 to 2026 utilising overall funding of c.&euro;400m.</p>  <p>  It is intended that the scheme will be operated by a newly-established Designated Activity Company. Significant work on the detailed design and parameters of the scheme is continuing.  Full scheme details will be confirmed on completion of this work. It is anticipated that initial activity on key areas of work including public communications will begin in Q1 and in advance of First Home&rsquo;s first receipt of applications and deployment of equity support scheduled for Q2 this year.</p></reply>

Such a new programme for CPO of vacant properties is expected to support a broader programme of affordable housing in order to maximise opportunities to return vacant properties to productive use.</p>  <p>  The CPO programme is to be supported by a bridging finance facility from the Housing Finance Agency for property acquisitions. In addition, a central advisory service is to be established in The Housing Agency to assist Local Authorities with the process. The objective is for Local Authorities to acquire at least 2,500 vacant units by 2026 and present them to the market for sale.   This advisory support, will be in addition to the Vacant Homes unit being established within my Department, with the Principal Officer already appointed, to co-ordinate the range of measures under the Housing for All pathway to addressing vacancy and efficient use of existing stock.</p>  <p>  The detailed arrangements for this CPO programme are currently being developed, with aim of advancing it this year, and will include any synergies with other measures also being considered.  It will build on the experience of many Local Authorities that already utilise CPO acquisitions in their delivery of new social homes through the Buy and Renew scheme.   As part of this process, my Department is meeting with Vacant Homes Officers later this month, and this will enable targets to be set for 2022 and 2023.</p>  <p>  My Department does not have a scheme that specifically funds CPOs by local authorities and therefore such data is not collated by my Department but may be available directly from the local authorities, but CPO may have been used by authorities as part of their programmes, particularly Buy and Renew.</p></reply>

I am also keen that local authorities and AHBs avoid competing with potential private purchasers for available properties.  </p><p>Given the need to avoid competition and the focus of support on the build programme, I have asked local authorities to limit their acquisitions of privately owned properties, with approximately 200 acquisitions to be undertaken over this year under SHIP and  CALF funding programmes. </p><p>It will be a matter for the local authorities themselves to decide their specific priority acquisitions, including notice to quit to sitting tenants incidents. I have asked that they have particular regard to the following areas: </p><p>- One-bedroom units to deliver on Housing First and meet the short supply in this category;</p><p>- Other properties that allow persons/families to move  from homelessness;</p><p>- Specific housing required for individuals with a disability or other particular priority needs; </p><p>Any acquisition proposed must represent value for money per my Department&rsquo;s acquisitions guidelines.</p><p>Local authorities also have the services of tenancy sustainment officers to intervene at the first response where landlords are selling a property rented to a person or a family in receipt of social housing supports.

These limits were agreed in conjunction with the Department of Social Protection (DSP).  In reviewing the rent limits, my Department worked closely with DSP and monitored data gathered from the Residential Tenancies Board and the HAP Shared Services Centre.  The HAP rent limits were increased significantly, in the order of 60% in some cases. </p><p>Local authorities also have discretion, because of local rental market conditions, to exceed the maximum rent limit by up to 20%, or up to 50% in the Dublin region for those households either in, or at immediate risk of homelessness. It should be noted that it is a matter for the local authority to determine whether the application of the flexibility is warranted on a case by case basis and also the level of additional discretion applied in each case.  </p><p>I am conscious that increasing the current HAP rent limits could have negative inflationary impacts, leading to a detrimental impact on the wider rental market, including for those households who are not receiving HAP support. </p><p>My Department continues to keep the operation of the HAP scheme under review and closely monitors the level of discretion being used by local authorities, taking into account other sources of data, including Residential Tenancies Board rent data published on a quarterly basis. </p><p>The Programme for Government commits to ensuring that HAP levels are adequate to support vulnerable households, while we increase the supply of social housing. Under Housing for All, my Department is undertaking an analytical exercise to examine whether an increase in the level of discretion available to Local Authorities under HAP is required, in order to maintain adequate levels of HAP support. This review is at an advanced stage. </p></reply>

Included in the planning exemptions set out in the Regulations are those applying to the installation of solar infrastructure on a variety of building types, including houses, businesses, industrial and agricultural to which specific conditions are attached.</p>  <p>  My Department, in the context of the Climate Action Plan and in consultation with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, has undertaken a review of the solar panel planning exemptions set out in the Regulations, with a particular focus on facilitating increased self-generation of electricity.</p>  <p>  This review is now complete. Substantial changes to the current planning exemption thresholds for solar panels are proposed, as well as the introduction of new classes of solar panel planning exemptions relating to their use in apartments and in educational/community/religious buildings. </p>  <p>  In light of the need to appropriately address aviation safety concerns arising from the &ldquo;glint and glare&rdquo; impacts of solar panels and the easing of the solar panel planning exemption thresholds, my Department is in the process of commissioning the development of detailed aviation safeguarding maps which will identify and delineate specific but limited areas in the vicinity of airports and aerodromes (referred to as exclusion zones) within which the exemptions will not apply. Project scoping feedback has been received from interested parties through the draft Request for Tender process and has been considered by my Department in the development of the final Request for Tender documentation. My Department intends to publish the call for tender shortly. </p>  <p>  Whilst this work is ongoing, my Department has advanced interim regulations, adopting a temporary, albeit more stringent, radial approach incorporating initial defined exclusion zones around airports and aerodromes. These interim regulations, allowing for increased solar panel planning exemptions, will cover the vast majority of the land area of the country, only excluding those limited exclusion zones around airports and aerodromes.</p>  <p>  The draft interim regulations have been reviewed under the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) Directive 2001/42/EC and it has been determined that they are likely to have significant effects on the environment, necessitating the undertaking of a full SEA on the draft proposals. It is anticipated that the formal SEA process will commence, with consultation with the statutory environmental authorities to inform the content of the Environmental Report, following the completion of the screening for Appropriate Assessment by my Department&rsquo;s Ecological Assessment Unit. The SEA Environmental Report will be published alongside a draft of the interim regulations for a period of public consultation of not less than 4 weeks. This public consultation is expected to commence shortly. A copy of the draft interim regulations and the Environmental Report will be made available for inspection over this period. Written submissions or observations will be taken into consideration before finalisation of the draft interim regulation. </p>  <p>  As required under planning legislation, the proposed exempted development regulations must be laid in draft form before the Houses of the Oireachtas and receive a positive resolution from both Houses before they can be made and the SEA process concluded. </p>  <p>  Accordingly, the process for finalising the interim solar panel planning exemptions as referred to above, with interim exclusion zones around airports and aerodromes, is expected to be completed in Q2 2022. As outlined, pending the finalisation of the aforementioned aviation safeguarding maps, these interim regulations will allow for the vast majority of the country to be covered by the proposed new solar panel exemptions apart from those areas in close proximity to airports and aerodromes.</p>  <p>  Work on the development of the aviation safeguarding maps for airports and aerodromes is expected to be completed in the second half of 2022. The final supplementary set of regulations - delineating the final exclusion areas around airports and aerodromes in which the exemptions will not apply - will be prepared thereafter and, subject to environmental reporting considerations, will subsequently be laid in draft form before the Houses of the Oireachtas for approval in a timely manner.</p></reply>

Once this initial exercise is completed in the near future, my Department remains available to assist in the prompt release of any properties identified as potentially suitable for housing, and no longer required for current uses.</p></reply>

A specific note to that effect appears on the National Land Register. This has been the position since the inception of the title registration system in 1891. </p>  <p>  The registration mapping framework maintained by the PRA is underpinned by its link to Ordnance Survey Ireland topographical data. However, all registrations effected in the PRA are based on the original documents and application map lodged for registration.</p>  <p>  The digitisation of the PRA map record in 2005 transformed property registration in Ireland. It also, in the main, revealed rather than caused non-conformities which were already on the original paper-based mapping system. Once online searching became accessible to all, there was an expected and exponential increase in public queries.</p>  <p>  The PRA receives ongoing enquiries about mapping issues, and each query brought to its attention is investigated fully. The PRA has established a dedicated and robust process for the ongoing evaluation of all mapping and other queries. Original legal deeds and documents of title (including the original map lodged) are retrieved and reviewed to establish if an actual error arises and its origins. There are statutory provisions governing the correction of any errors identified, depending on whether the origins of the error are internal to the PRA or due to an issue arising externally. </p>  <p>  Digitisation of the PRA Map was completed in 2010 and, to date, compensation payments made under Section 120 of the Registration of Title Act 1964, which specifically relate to digital mapping errors, amount to &euro;59,615.</p></reply>

The second will see the introduction of a 'First Home' affordable purchase shared equity scheme for homes in private developments. Both of these schemes are primarily focused on supporting first-time buyers purchasing newly-built homes. In terms of eligibility, they will be targeted at households constrained by the maximum mortgage and deposit available to them. </p>  <p>  Via the provision of equity support, these schemes will bridge the gap between the market value and the household&rsquo;s mortgage capacity. The equity support can subsequently be redeemed at any time at the homeowner&rsquo;s discretion, or remain outstanding until the home is sold or passed on. Regulations under this Act covering the Local Authority Affordable Purchase scheme are currently being finalised and will be published in the near future. </p>  <p>  In relation to Cost Rental, to date I have made three sets of regulations that expand on the policy framework for this new sector as set out in Part 3 of the Affordable Housing Act. On 19 August 2021 I made the Affordable Housing Act 2021 (Cost Rental Designation) Regulations 2021, which came into effect that day. These Regulations govern the process by which the owners of dwellings may obtain the designation of their properties as Cost Rental dwellings. </p>  <p>  On 23 December 2021, I made two further sets of regulations concerning Cost Rental, the Affordable Housing Act 2021 (Cost Rental Letting and Eligibility) Regulations 2021 and the Affordable Housing Act 2021 (Cost Rental Rent Setting) Regulations 2021, which both came into effect on 1 January 2022.  </p>  <p>  The Cost Rental Letting and Eligibility Regulations prescribe how landlords of cost rental dwellings should advertise vacancies in such properties and how interested parties can express an interest in leasing these homes. The Regulations also set out the main eligibility condition for leasing a cost rental dwelling, which is that a household&rsquo;s annual income, less income tax, PRSI, USC and superannuation contributions, must not be greater than &euro;53,000. In cases where the number of applicants exceed the number of available homes, an independently-verifiable lottery will be utilised to select applicants. Landlords should ensure that each property is suitably sized to meet a household&rsquo;s needs based on the number of occupants and that the tenants selected in the lottery meet the income eligibility criteria. </p>  <p>  The Cost Rental Rent Setting Regulations prescribe additional detail and relevant formulae in order to set out how rent reviews under Cost Rental work in practice. Rents can be reviewed annually in line with the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), with formulae set out for how reviews should be undertaken in three specific circumstances: the first rent in any tenancy, the first review of this rent and all subsequent reviews of this rent. All rents calculated are maximum rents, meaning landlords are free to charge the tenant less than this should they so wish.</p></reply>

The Plan also recognises the criticality of the interagency supports required to address the complex combination of social, health and economic needs of homeless persons and those at risk of homelessness, in addition to their specific housing need. In that context, Housing for All commits to establishing a new National Homeless Action Committee.</p><p>In line with this commitment, the National Homeless Action Committee (NHAC) was established in Q4 2021.  The first meeting took place on 20 December 2021. The work of the group is informed by Housing for All and is tasked with overseeing the interagency actions set out in this Plan. The overarching objective of the group is to ensure that a renewed emphasis is brought to collaborating across Government to implement actions in the Plan, along with bringing better coherence and coordination of homeless-related services in delivering policy measures and actions to address homelessness.</p><p>The purpose of NHAC&rsquo;s Terms of Reference is to clearly define the objectives and functions of the group. These Terms mirror the overall objectives set out in Housing for All along with its key actions. The Terms of Reference were discussed and agreed at the inaugural meeting.</p><p>NHAC comprises representatives from the following Government Departments, agencies and bodies:  </p><p>- Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage </p><p>- Department of Justice </p><p>- Department of the Taoiseach </p><p>- Department of Health  </p><p>- Department of Social Protection  </p><p>- Department of Education  </p><p>- Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth </p><p>- The Housing Agency </p><p>- County and City Management Association </p><p>- Dublin Region Homeless Executive </p><p>- Health Service Executive </p><p>- Tusla </p><p>- Threshold </p><p>- Focus Ireland  </p><p>- Peter McVerry Trust </p><p>- DePaul </p><p>- Society of St. Vincent de Paul </p><p>- Dublin Simon </p><p>- Simon Communities of Ireland  </p><p>- Crosscare</p><p>It is planned that meetings of NHAC will take place quarterly, with the second meeting due to be held in the coming month. Details in respect of the Committee and a note of its meetings will be published on my Department&rsquo;s website on an ongoing basis.</p></reply>

However, there have been significant changes in the rental market since the 2015 scheme was first envisaged and designed. For example, the 2015 scheme was intended to be financed by the interest payable on deposits lodged; this is no longer viable, given the current financial market conditions.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government and Housing for All &ndash; a new Housing Plan for Ireland includes an action to examine the creation of a system of holding rental deposits, informed by international experience, by Q2 2023 and my Department is currently considering how best to achieve this.</p>  <p>  Section 7 of the Residential Tenancies (No. 2) Act 2021 inserts a new section 19B into the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 which applies to tenancies created on or after 9 August 2021, to restrict the total amount that a tenant is required to pay to a landlord by way of a deposit or an advance rent payment to secure a tenancy to no more than the equivalent of 2 months&rsquo; rent (i.e. any deposit cannot exceed 1 month&rsquo;s rent and any advance rent payment cannot exceed 1 month&rsquo;s rent). A restriction of the equivalent of 1 month&rsquo;s rent is also placed on the amount that a tenant is obliged to pay as a regular advance rent payment to a landlord during a tenancy. These measures are intended to greatly reduce any financial exposure to tenants, on foot of paying such restricted upfront payments.</p></reply>

All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties comply with these regulations. Responsibility for the enforcement of the Regulations rests with the relevant local authority.</p>  <p>  Housing for All sets a target for the inspection of rental properties, which is 25% of all private residential tenancies. A total of &euro;10 million in Exchequer funding is being made available to local authorities this year to help them meet their targets.</p>  <p>  Full-year rental inspection data is routinely published on an annual basis on my Department's website at the following link:</p>  <p>  www.gov.ie/en/publication/da3fe-private-housing-market-statistics/</p>  <p>  Data in respect of 2021 has been requested by my Department from the local authorities. It will be processed and made available online shortly. It is of course likely that the number of inspections carried out in 2021 will reflect the fact that, in accordance with public health guidelines, and in order to protect tenants, landlords and inspectors, inspections were not permitted for a prolonged period in 2021. </p>  <p>  Since Housing for All was launched in September 2021, officials in my Department have met separately at a senior level with all 31 local authorities to discuss their local authority&rsquo;s inspection performance to date and the effort required to reach their Housing for All target in 2022.</p>  <p>  My officials are now in the process of writing to all 31 local authority Chief Executives advising of the precise 2022 rental inspections target for their local authority areas, based on Residential Tenancy Board tenancy data, and asking them to submit detailed implementation plans, outlining how they intend to achieve their targets. My Department will work closely throughout the year with the sector to support the achievement of these targets.</p></reply>

In line with this commitment, the National Homeless Action Committee was established in Q4 2021 and the first meeting took place 20 December 2021.  The Committee has identified the Youth Homelessness Strategy as one of its first areas for action.   I expect that work on the Strategy will continue throughout the first quarter of 2022.</p></reply>

Firstly, the Reflect Phase as I and my Department consider the outcomes of this work and then synthesize the resourcing gains of the past 18 months with a detailed, expert analysis of governance, organisational structures, communications, data systems and future resourcing, and outline the NPWS&rsquo; specific requirements across those areas. The final, Renew Phase will detail the objectives and prioritised actions required to equip the NPWS to continue to deliver on the ambitious goals, objectives and targets emerging from our Programme for Government &ndash; Our Shared Future  , the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework, the EU Biodiversity Strategy to 2030, Heritage Ireland 2030 and the new National Biodiversity Action Plan.</p>  <p>  None of the component parts of the Review process will be published separately or ahead of a Government decision on the outcome of the Review process.</p></reply>

Lone parents are entitled to access all of the housing support delivery mechanisms on an equal basis with all other citizens.</p>  <p>  However, the Government is determined to ensure that housing policy must address the needs of those who experience social exclusion in our society by taking firm action. The Housing for All plan launched in September 2021 contains a specific commitment to a Fresh Start principle which will be of assistance to lone parents who may wish to apply for affordable housing or a local authority home loan. </p>  <p>  Supporting individuals and families facing homelessness is a key Government priority. Housing for All commits to working to eradicate homelessness by 2030 and provides detail on how the Government is approaching this as a priority. Homelessness is a complex issue, and causal factors and family circumstances vary considerably, as do the responses needed. Homelessness is also inter-related with the other areas of the housing system and with broader social and healthcare policy and service delivery. A new National Homeless Action Committee has been established to lead this whole-of-Government approach. The Committee, which had its first meeting in December, brings together all of the key Government departments, agencies and stakeholders involved. Homelessness prevention is a key priority issue for the Committee.</p>  <p>  An important aspect of Housing for All is to support families and children experiencing homelessness. Family homelessness, including lone parent homelessness, has seen an appreciable reduction since 2019, but still remains a key challenge. The overriding objective is to provide homes to those households at risk of or experiencing homelessness through the various social housing supports available.</p>  <p>  Many families have found themselves trapped in long term homelessness. Housing for All commits my Department to working with Local Authorities and NGOs to identify families experiencing long-term homelessness that have complex support needs. Those that do will be provided with enhanced tenancy sustainment supports to help them exit homelessness and maintain their homes.  Additional supports are to be provided to families by Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.</p>  <p>  Increasing the supply of housing, particularly new build social and affordable homes, is a key priority of this Government.  Under Housing for All there are specific and costed plans to increase supply across all tenure types, including very significant commitments to social and affordable housing, with over 90,000 social homes, and 36,000 affordable and 18,000 cost rental homes to be delivered by 2030. &euro;4 billion in capital is being invested annually on social and affordable housing.  This is the biggest such programme in the history of the State. </p>  <p>  The Government will continue to prioritise responses for all families, including lone parents, affected by housing insecurity and this is being reflected in both strategic policy and in specific actions.</p></reply>

The Residential Tenancies (No. 2) Act 2021 introduced measures in July 2021 to extend the operation of Rent Pressure Zones (RPZs) until the end of 2024. The Act also provides that rent reviews outside of RPZs can, until 2025, occur no more frequently than bi-annually. This provides rent certainty for tenants outside of RPZs for a minimum 2 year period at a time. </p>  <p>  Section 24A of the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004, as amended, provides that the Housing Agency, in consultation with housing authorities, may make a proposal to the Minister that an area should be considered as a Rent Pressure Zone. Following receipt of such a proposal, the Minister requests the Director of the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) to conduct an assessment of the area to establish whether or not it meets the criteria for designation and to report to the Minister on whether the area should be designated as a Rent Pressure Zone (RPZ). </p>  <p>  The criteria to be satisfied by an area under section 24A(4) of the Residential Tenancies Act for designation as an RPZ are as follows: </p>  <p>  - the information relating to the area, as determined by reference to the information used to compile each RTB Rent Index quarterly report, shows that the annual rate of increase in the average amount of rent for that area is more than 7% in each of at least 4 of the 6 quarters preceding the period immediately prior to the date of the Housing Agency's proposal, and </p>  <p>  - the average rent for the area in the last quarter, as determined by reference to the information used to compile each RTB Rent Index quarterly report, is &ndash;  </p>  <p>  - in the case of counties Kildare, Meath and Wicklow or an LEA in any one of those counties, above the average rent in the State, excluding rents in the 4 Dublin Local Authority areas, or  </p>  <p>  - in the case of any LEA outside of the Greater Dublin Area (i.e. Dublin, Kildare, Meath and Wicklow), above the average rent in the State, excluding rents in the Greater Dublin Area. </p>  <p>  Each RTB quarterly Rent Index Report includes a table of the data used to establish whether each Local Electoral Area fulfils the criteria for designation as a Rent Pressure Zone. This ensures transparency in relation to the position of individual areas in terms of average rent levels and increases. </p>  <p>  The Housing Agency and the RTB will continue to monitor national rents and if any LEA meets the designation criteria it will be designated as a RPZ. </p>  <p>  With regard to the number of private landlords selling their properties in RPZs, my Department does not collect the data sought, however the Clerk of the D&aacute;il requested that arrangements be put in place to facilitate the provision of information by State Bodies to members of the Oireachtas. Following the issue of Circular LG (P)05/16 on 20 September 2016 from my Department, the RTB set up a dedicated email address for this purpose. The RTB may be contacted at OireachtasMembersQueries@rtb.ie to establish the extent to which it may hold the information sought.</p></reply>

Complementary projects include Moore Street Public Realm Renewal works with the intention of reactivating one of the most important trading streets in the city along with structural and restoration works to the national monument at 14-17 Moore Street.  Works to the national monument, which is in my ownership, will facilitate the protection and reuse of these historic buildings as an iconic heritage and visitor attraction in the form of a 1916 Commemorative Centre alongside the rejuvenation of the historic street.  The regeneration of the Moore Street Market and street is a matter for Dublin City Council and I am assured that an expert advisory group was appointed in this regard. </p>  <p>  The Moore Street Advisory Group, recommended in its report to me last this year that the process embarked on by the Office of Public Works (OPW) and the National Monuments Service of my Department to restore the national monument and open it up to the public as soon as possible should continue. Officials from both my Department and the OPW have been liaising to progress this.  I understand that the OPW are in the process of appointing a team to carry out phase 1 essential works to the monument, which will ensure stability and provide a pathway for the phase 2 completion works themselves at the monument. The Deputy will, I am sure, appreciate that Minister O&rsquo;Brien and I are keen that these essential works commence as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that plans are under way for the sensitive and respectful restoration of the monument along with a visitor centre to the rear.</p></reply>

It would also be open to households to reapply for social housing support should their circumstances change.</p></reply>

The Maritime Area Planning Act 2021 recently signed into law enables the realisation of these ambitions for ORE by providing the necessary legislative toolset for forward planning, well-regulated development, streamlined consenting, and comprehensive environmental assessment of proposals.  The Act also provides for the establishment of the Maritime Area Regulatory Authority, or MARA, a new state agency under the aegis of my Department which will be responsible for consenting and enforcement functions in the maritime area.</p><p>I am hopeful the agency will be established and operational within twelve months at which point anyone wishing to undertake development in the maritime area will have to apply for a Maritime Area Consent (MAC) from MARA and, if granted, then apply for development permission from the relevant coastal local authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la. MARA will also be responsible for granting licences for certain activities in the maritime area (including environmental surveys), for ensuring robust compliance through enforcement measures, and for managing the existing State Foreshore portfolio of leases and licences. </p><p>The Act also includes specific provisions to enable certain ORE projects (Phase 1 Projects) proceed through the new consenting regime ahead of the establishment of MARA. Recognising that it will take time to establish the new agency, it was decided by Government that the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications should be granted limited powers to invite MAC applications for specific ORE projects for a specified period in advance of establishment. This will ensure the progression of a pipeline of projects under the new regime in order to meet our 2030 climate and energy targets. I understand that work is well advanced within the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications to develop robust processes and guidance for these MAC applications. That Department is expecting to open the MAC application window for these projects in April 2022, with decisions on applications taken by Q3 allowing successful projects to be eligble to apply for development permission.</p><p>Until such time as MARA is operational my Department will continue to manage the existing maritime planning system in accordance with the Foreshore Act 1933 and applications for leases and licenses made in accordance with that Act will be accepted and assessed under that legislative structure. </p><p>There has been a significant increase in the number and complexity of foreshore licence and lease applications made in recent years as is set out in the table below. The majority of this increased application activity is related to ORE infrastructural development, including potential development site investigation activity, Eirgrid cabling development, and port infrastructure improvement. In addition, power and data cable application activity has increased from both commercial and state-led projects. In parallel, emerging case law and enhanced requirements arising from various environmental assessment Directives have added to the complexity of the appraisal process. </p><p>My Department has more than doubled the staffing resources available within the relevant Unit in my Department over the last eighteen months. In addition, a panel of external specialist environmental consultants established to assist in the technical assessment of applications is in operation. While I am satisfied that the appropriate resources are in place, I am keen to keep the arrangements under review. </p><p><b>Foreshore application activity - 2018-2021 to end quarter 3)</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Activity </th>       <th>2018</th>       <th>2019</th>       <th>2020</th>       <th>2021 (to end Q3)</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Pre-application consultations</td>       <td>17</td>       <td>87</td>       <td>119</td>       <td>43</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>New applications received</td>       <td>30</td>       <td>32</td>       <td>59</td>       <td>47</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cases decided by Minsiter</td>       <td>15</td>       <td>21</td>       <td>20</td>       <td>18</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

One such programme that AHBs progress construction projects through is the Capital Advance Loan Facility (CALF).</p><p>CALF funding is capital support provided to Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) by local authorities to facilitate the funding of construction, acquisition or refurbishment of new social housing units.  This loan facility can support up to 30% of the eligible capital cost of the housing project, with the housing units provided to local authorities for social housing use under long-term lease arrangements known as Payment and Availability Agreements. A nominal interest rate of 2% fixed per annum is charged by the local authority on the initial capital amount.<b></b>Repayments on either the capital or interest are not required during the term of the loan (between 10 and 30 years), although where an AHB chooses to, repayments can be made during the term. At the end of the term, the outstanding capital amount plus the interest accrued, is owed and repayable to the local authority. The local authority issues the CALF monies to the AHB and the local authority, in turn, recoups same from the Department. </p><p>With regard to the specific project mentioned by the Deputy, I can confirm that the project did receive conditional CALF funding approval in 2019 for 34 social housing homes.  While my Department has not had any direct engagement with the Loughlinstown Housing Co-Operative, it actively engages with the local authority and Co-Operative Housing Ireland. The most recent update from Co-Operative Housing Ireland is that they are currently working to progress the project to Tender stage, with expected final delivery in 2023. This project is being progressed with the support of the local authority.</p><p>My Department publishes a quarterly Social Housing Construction Projects Status Report, which sets out the continuing progress being made in advancing the national local authority and AHB new-build pipeline.  The latest report, setting out the position at end Q3 2021, can be accessed at the following weblink:  </p><p>www.gov.ie/en/collection/cb885-social-housing-construction-projects-status-reports/</p></reply>

My Department supports fire authorities through setting general policy and national standards, providing a central training programme, issuing guidance on operational and other related matters and providing capital funding support for equipment and priority infrastructural projects. </p>  <p>  The prioritisation of work and effective management of all resources is, in the first instance, a matter for the fire authority, based on its assessment of risk, needs and resources. In relation to the staffing requirements in each local authority, under section 159 of the Local Government Act 2001, it is the responsibility of each Chief Executive to employ such staff and to make such staffing, funding, recruitment and organisational arrangements as deemed necessary for the purposes of carrying out the functions of their local authority. </p>  <p>  Dublin City Council provides fire prevention and fire and rescue services for the four Dublin local authorities: Dublin City, South Dublin, Fingal and D&uacute;n Laoghaire/Rathdown County Councils. It also provides an emergency ambulance service by arrangement with the National Ambulance Service of the HSE.  </p>  <p>  In relation to staffing in Dublin Fire Brigade, the current COVID-19 pandemic has presented challenges in respect of delivery of services to the public.  These challenges have included recruitment and training of new staff, resulting in staffing shortages in recent times.  However, recruitment, training and deployment of new recruits have continued in Dublin Fire Brigade, albeit with the additional difficulties imposed by control and safety measures.  I am aware that the most recent fire-fighter recruitment campaign began in September 2019: </p>  <p>  - The first class of recruits from that campaign began training in April 2020 and have taken up positions across the brigade. </p>  <p>  - A second recruit class began training in June 2021, with recruits recently taking up positions in January 2022.</p>  <p>  - A further third recruit class of 45 will begin training early in February 2022, with provision within the Dublin City Council budget for a fourth and final class of the remaining panelled recruit&rsquo;s later in 2022. </p>  <p>  In recent weeks, in line with trends among the general population, all public and emergency services have experienced heightened disruptions due to the transmissibility of the COVID-19 Omicron variant and close contact related staff absences. Following a Government mandate in late December 2021, authorising the use of a voluntary derogation exempting Fire services staff from COVID-19 close contact isolation requirements under strict conditions, my Department built the derogation into a broader suite of updated guidance and contingency measures for Fire service management. This was to ensure the ongoing provision of Fire services amid the highest rates of COVID-19 infection since the onset of the pandemic. Thankfully, to date Dublin Fire Brigade management has not needed to implement the derogation owing to careful management of resources and the ongoing commitment and professionalism of Dublin Fire Brigade staff.  </p>  <p>  The broader issue of staff shortages is not simply a funding one.  There is an extensive recruitment and training process to follow before suitable candidates are appointed, and this takes time; Dublin Fire Brigade management are following this process and is actively managing staffing in the brigade, on a day-to-day basis, to minimise the effect of the pandemic on delivery of services.   </p>  <p>  Local Authority fire services in Ireland is staffed by over three thousand professional, competent and highly committed personnel in the full-time and retained fire services. Local authorities, as the funders and the employers of fire service personnel, have demonstrated their commitment to this service over the past number of years. The number of frontline fire service staff have been maintained at a consistent high level throughout the economic challenges of the past number of years, even at a time when staffing numbers were of necessity reduced in other areas of the local authorities. </p>  <p>  I understand that Dublin City Council, as the employer, has engaged in an extended process with firefighter representative bodies, F&oacute;rsa and SIPTU at the Workplace Relations Commission.  There has been some progress in a number of areas, some of which would alleviate pressures caused by current staffing arrangements, but no final agreement has been reached. I encourage the parties to re-engage with the established statutory industrial relations machinery in place, to achieve a resolution without delay.  The issues and concerns raised can only be addressed if all sides are speaking to each other.  I strongly urge all parties to re-enter the consultative process and find a common ground, so that we can again focus on the service, and its development.</p></reply>

Crucially Housing for All takes a genuine whole of Government approach to creating a long-term, sustainable housing system for Ireland. Housing For All contains a commitment to support technological universities to develop purpose-built student accommodation where such a requirement exists, through access to appropriate financing, and a specific action in relation to legislating to allow for Technological Universities (TU) to borrow from the Housing Finance Agency.  </p>  <p>  My Department has reviewed the legislation currently in place regarding The Housing Finance Agency Act 1981 (as amended) and is satisfied that it is robust enough to allow any such lending to take place without any further legislative changes.  The Technological Universities Act 2018 amended the Higher Education Authority Act 1971 to include TUs in the definition of "Institutes of Higher Education". As such, the current text of the 1981 Act will allow HFA loans to be advanced to TUs once of course they have gone through the appropriate application procedures etc.</p>  <p>  The Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, is also engaging with all the universities, including the technological universities, to explore further options which may be available to increase the availability of student accommodation, and they are being supported where necessary by officials in my department.</p>  <p>  Much progress has been made in recent years in reforming protections for tenants in student specific accommodation. The Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 provides for relevant obligations and rights under residential tenancies legislation to apply to tenancy and licence agreements in student-specific accommodation, provided by public educational institutions or by private accommodation providers. The operation of the rental market and the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004-2021 are kept under constant review and any necessary legislation will be introduced.</p></reply>

A dedicated unit has been established &ndash; the Wildlife Crime Unit - to further coordinate and support these efforts. The Unit&rsquo;s role is to  support the law enforcement work being done by the rangers and other colleagues throughout the country.</p>  <p>  This will be done through delivery of training and disseminating best-practice guidance, and the provision of direct support to regional investigators. The Unit is and will continue to work closely with both An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Revenue Commissioners, who work to defend against international wildlife trafficking offences.</p>  <p>  The nucleus of the new Wildlife Crime Unit has been put in place and work on securing additional staff is ongoing.</p></reply>

All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties comply with these regulations. Responsibility for the enforcement of the Regulations rests with the relevant local authority. </p>  <p>  Under sections 18A and 18B of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992, a housing authority may issue an improvement notice or prohibition notice, respectively, where a property is found to be non-compliant. Under Section 34 of that Act, any person who by act or omission contravenes the Regulations, fails to comply with an improvement notice, or re-lets a house in breach of a prohibition notice, will be guilty of an offence and will be liable, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding &euro;5,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or both. If the contravention, failure to comply or re-letting is continued after conviction, the person will be guilty of a further offence on every day on which the contravention, failure to comply or re-letting continues and for each such offence will be liable, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding &euro;400 per day.   </p>  <p>  To aid increased inspections of properties and ensure greater compliance with the Regulations, increased Exchequer funding has been made available to local authorities each year since 2018 to enable them to build inspection capacity incrementally, with payments based on the number of inspections undertaken. Significant progress was made across the sector. The number of inspections more than doubled from 19,645 in 2017 to 40,728 in 2019, although pandemic restrictions have impacted on number of inspections undertaken since. A total of &euro;10 million in Exchequer funding is being made available to local authorities in 2022. </p>  <p>  Housing for All sets a target for the inspection of rental properties, which is 25% of all private residential tenancies. Since Housing for All was launched in September 2021, officials in my Department have met separately at a senior level with all 31 local authorities to discuss their local authority&rsquo;s inspection performance to date and the effort required to reach their Housing for All target in 2022. These detailed engagements have also focused on the need for more consistent and greater use of the available enforcement  mechanisms once deficiencies have been identified.</p>  <p>  My officials are now in the process of writing to all 31 local authority Chief Executives seeking detailed implementation plans, outlining their plans for 2022 with a clear focus on for example, how they intend to achieve their targets and the approach they plan to take to ensure proper and effective enforcement. My Department will work closely throughout the year with the sector to support the achievement of these targets.</p></reply>

The Passport Service must validate the true identity of the applicant and take measures to confirm the applicant&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship.</p>  <p>  Passport applications are valid for six months for a number of reasons including International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) regulations on the requirement for a recent photograph. The ICAO is a UN specialised agency which defines in detail the required format for a passport. This timeframe also ensures that a refund of the fees can be processed electronically where required. </p>  <p>  With regard to the specific applications about which the Deputy has enquired, these applications were incomplete and cannot be processed to passport issue under the Passports Act 2008, as amended.  In light of this and given that the validity of the applications has expired, they been cancelled.  The Passport Service has been in direct contact with the applicants' parent to advise them of the situation and to arrange a refund of the passport fees.  In addition, a follow up letter has been issued by the Passport Service to the parents of these applicants to explain in detail the requirements for any future passport application for their children.</p></reply>

I am seriously concerned by the designation of six Palestinian NGOs as terrorist entities by the Israeli Ministry for Defense and I underlined this position to the Israeli Government in person when I visited the region in November 2021. I have recently spoken on this issue in detail  on 30 November in statements in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory.</p>  <p>  We will continue to work closely with our partners on our response to these designations, including in the EU. Ireland is a consistent voice in the EU on the Middle East Peace Process and we work to utilise our influence at all levels. Ensuring that there is space for civil society organisations is a key part of our foreign policy globally and I recognise the particular importance of prioritising this in the context of the occupied Palestinian territory.</p></reply>

At present, certificates issued following a COVID-19 booster dose have no expiration date under the new EU-wide rules. In preparation for this, my colleague the Minister for Health announced on 6 January that following the rollout of the EU Digital COVID Certificate in Ireland and the successful booster vaccination programme, updated EU Digital COVID Certificates will be issued to all those who have received an additional vaccine dose. Over 1.5m new Digital COVID Certificates have issued in the last week to those who have received an additional vaccine dose. </p>  <p>  The French policy change of 15 December 2021 relates exclusively to the domestic health pass (pass sanitaire) introduced by the French government. This pass is interoperable with the EU Digital COVID Certificate. Irish citizens are able to access a French pass for domestic use in France on the basis of their vaccination status when they receive an updated Certificate.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to advise citizens that COVID-related restrictions are subject to change at short notice. I encourage all citizens considering travel to France to regularly consult our Travel Advice, which is available on the Department&rsquo;s website and is updated with the latest information available.</p></reply>

His trial was due to start on 18 November in Lesbos but has since been delayed, following a decision to refer the case to a higher court.</p><p>As Mr. Binder is a German citizen, consular assistance to Mr. Binder is being provided by the German Embassy in Athens and has been since his initial arrest and period of pre-trial detention in 2018. However, given Mr. Binder&rsquo;s very strong ties to Ireland, representatives from the Embassy of Ireland in Athens have been in contact with both Mr. Binder and the German Embassy in regard to the most appropriate means of offering assistance. The Department of Foreign Affairs will continue to follow developments in relation to his case and ongoing trial closely.</p><p>Separate to this specific case, the protection of civil society space and the elimination of reprisals against human rights defenders and civil society activists are key foreign policy priorities for Ireland. In July, Ireland led a resolution at the UN Human Rights Council on the importance of protecting civil society space particularly in the context of COVID. In September, Ireland was one of five countries leading a resolution adopted by consensus denouncing reprisals against civil society activists cooperating with the UN. Moreover, Ireland works closely with the EU as well as with Front Line Defenders, who receive funding from the Irish Aid programme, to support human rights defenders, including for example, to improve physical and digital security or assist with legal fees or medical expenses.</p></reply>

Ease of travel is essential to protect our strong transatlantic connections, be that in business, academia, tourism or maintaining family connections.</p>  <p>  I am aware that adherence to the Government's COVID guidelines by the US Embassy have had an impact on visa operations, resulting in long delays in interview appointments being given in some cases. My Department maintains regular contact with the Embassy on the issue and continues to emphasise the importance of processing visas as efficiently as is feasible to do so.</p></reply>

Nearly 23 million Afghans now face acute food insecurity. In response, the Government through its Official Development Assistance (ODA) programme, Irish Aid, has provided over &euro;4 million in humanitarian support for the people of Afghanistan since mid-August. This funding has been allocated to the UN High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), the UN Afghanistan Humanitarian Fund (AHF) and UNICEF respectively. This includes a donation of &euro;1 million made to UNICEF in December. These emergency response programmes are addressing the urgent needs of the population, including providing food aid, treatment for severe acute malnutrition in children, and other essential services. Ireland&rsquo;s humanitarian funding to Afghanistan increased fivefold in 2021 to over &euro;5 million &ndash; with the remainder provided at the beginning of the year to Concern Worldwide, HALO Trust and the AHF.</p>  <p>  In addition, Ireland contributes to support global funds and provide core funding to key agencies that allocate funding to Afghanistan, including the EU, WHO, UNHCR, IFRC, ICRC and the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF). Ireland was the 9th largest donor to the CERF in 2021, providing &euro;11 million. Since August, the CERF has allocated more than &euro;68.6 million to Afghanistan. This year we will renew our multiyear partnership with CERF and increase our annual contribution from &euro;10m to &euro;11.5m, as announced by Minister Brophy at the CERF pledging conference in December.</p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to engage, including at the UN Security Council, to promote peace and human rights for all Afghans, especially for Afghan women and girls whose rights are being eroded, and in support of initiatives to alleviate the suffering of the Afghan people. In my statement to the Security Council in September, I urged the Taliban to facilitate full, safe and unimpeded humanitarian access to allow life-saving support to reach all Afghans.</p></reply>

The Government does not support boycotts on Israel. Such actions would be ineffective and counterproductive. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s position on the illegality of Israeli settlements in occupied Palestinian territory informs our engagement with the State of Israel across a range of bilateral issues, including our trade, and will continue to do so.

Nearly 23 million Afghans now face acute food insecurity. In response, the Government through its Official Development Assistance (ODA) programme, Irish Aid, has provided over &euro;4 million in humanitarian support for the people of Afghanistan since mid-August. This funding has been allocated to the UN High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), the UN Afghanistan Humanitarian Fund (AHF) and UNICEF respectively. This includes a donation of &euro;1 million made to UNICEF in December. These emergency response programmes are addressing the urgent needs of the population, including providing food aid, treatment for severe acute malnutrition in children, and other essential services. Ireland&rsquo;s humanitarian funding to Afghanistan increased fivefold in 2021 to over &euro;5 million &ndash; with the remainder provided at the beginning of the year to Concern Worldwide, HALO Trust and the AHF.</p>  <p>In addition, Ireland contributes to support global funds and provide core funding to key agencies that allocate funding to Afghanistan, including the EU, WHO, UNHCR, IFRC, ICRC and the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF). Ireland was the 9th  largest donor to the CERF in 2021, providing &euro;11 million. Since August, the CERF has allocated more than &euro;68.6 million to Afghanistan. This year we will renew our multiyear partnership with CERF and increase our annual contribution from &euro;10m to &euro;11.5m, as announced by Minister Brophy at the CERF pledging conference in December. </p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to engage, including at the UN Security Council, to promote human rights for all Afghans, especially for Afghan women and girls whose rights are being eroded, and in support of initiatives to alleviate the suffering of the Afghan people. In my statement to the Security Council in September, I also urged the Taliban to facilitate full, safe and unimpeded humanitarian access to allow life-saving support to reach all Afghans.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-01-19a.1728.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022011900097#WRGG03900"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 643, 644, 645, 646, 647, 648 and 653 together.</p>  <p>My Department is responsible for citizenship by descent through the Foreign Births Register under the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 (&ldquo;the 1956 Act&rdquo;), as amended.</p>  <p>  The processing of Foreign Birth Registration has resumed and will be gradually scaling up in line with the recruitment of additional resources. At present, a total of 36 full time staff work on Foreign Births Registration. Due to the complex nature of the Foreign Birth Registration process, the large increase in applications received following the Brexit vote in the UK, and the pause in the Service due to necessary Covid-19 restrictions, applicants should allow approximately 2 years from the receipt of supporting documentation for processing of Foreign Birth Registration applications at this time. Before this increase in application volumes and Covid-19 restrictions, applications were typically processed within 6-9 months of receipt. Due to Covid-19 restrictions, and the subsequent reassignment of Foreign Birth Registration staff to assist in the provision of essential passport services, the Foreign Birth Registration Service was paused for nearly 15 months across the 2020-2021 period. </p>  <p>  There are currently 32,000 applications for which documentation has been received, and which are awaiting processing. In 2020, documents were received for just over 16,000 applications, with 11,000 received in 2021. Of the applications currently on hand, just over 12,000 have been awaiting processing for more than 18 months. </p>  <p>  ‎As legislative provision for Foreign Birth Registration is made under the 1956 Act, any changes to application requirements would require amendment of the 1956 Act by the Oireachtas. As the Minister for Justice is responsible for citizenship matters, any such amendment would be a matter for the Department for Justice. In the context of the National Development Plan, my Department is making a major investment in the future of the Passport Service.  Over the next couple of years, we will replace the core technology underpinning the service, which will deliver efficiencies and a more resilient passport and Foreign Birth Registration system.  </p>  <p>  Foreign Birth Registration staff continue to provide an emergency service for Foreign Birth Registration in cases of exceptional urgency, such as expectant parents, or stateless persons. In 2021, over 7,000 such applications were processed.  Applicants who require an emergency service may contact the Passport Service directly.</p>  <p>  My Department is fully committed to the continued allocation of additional resources over the coming period to assist with the processing of the Foreign Birth Registration applications currently on hand and the high volume of new applications anticipated this year.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-01-19a.1736.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022011900097#WRGG04700"><p>Passport Service operations have been severely disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, as were many Government services. The Passport Service maintained operations throughout the pandemic, notwithstanding the fact that the processing of passports requires physical attendance on site to deliver this service. </p><p>Despite the disruptions related to the pandemic throughout last year, the Passport Service issued over 634,000 passports in 2021 and 45% of simple adult renewals issued within one business day. </p><p>My Department has been actively working with the Public Appointments Service to recruit additional permanent and temporary staff for assignment to the Passport Service. This recruitment drive has been underway since the last quarter of 2021 and will double the number of staff in the Passport Service from June 2021 levels. Over 180 additional staff are being assigned to the Passport Service in January alone and further staff will be assigned in February.  I am confident that the additional staff currently being assigned to the Passport Service will help to reduce turnaround times and to respond to the current and anticipated high demand for passports in 2022. </p><p>The current passport processing times are:</p><p>-10 working days for Simple Adult online renewals</p><p>-15 working days for Complex or child online renewals</p><p>-40 working days for First Time Applications on Passport Online</p><p>-8 weeks for An Post&rsquo;s mail-in &ldquo;Passport Express&rdquo; service</p><p>The aforementioned passport processing times are based on current average application turnaround times and relate to passport applications submitted to the Passport Service with required supporting documentation. When passport applicants do not provide all of the requisite documentation to the Passport Service, it takes much longer to process the application and issue a passport. Passport Service figures show that 45% of current applications are incomplete and the onus is on the applicant to submit the required documents to the Service. While the Passport Service makes every effort to contact applicants in such circumstances, their experience is that many applicants take weeks and sometimes months to send in the necessary documents. </p><p>The Passport Service continues to experience high demand for first time passports. These first time applications are necessarily complex to process, since they are essentially applications for Irish citizenship. The Passport Service must validate the true identity of the applicant and take measures to confirm the applicant&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship. It is the statutory responsibility of the Passport Service to protect the integrity of the Irish passport. Accordingly, a rigorous analysis process is in place to verify the identity and citizenship status of applicants. </p><p>In the case of first time passport applications for children, the consent of guardians must also be thoroughly validated. Due to the intensive analysis underpinning first time online passport applications, the processing time is 40 working days.</p><p>There are currently 29,000 first time child applications on hand with the Passport Service. Of these, almost 12,000 or 40% are incomplete applications that require additional documentation from the applicants&rsquo; guardians in order to complete the application and ensure that the child&rsquo;s passport can be issued. </p><p>The Passport Service continually examines how to improve processing times and engagement with applicants. Preparation is currently underway for several system and service improvements that will enhance the customer service experience and will improve processing times. </p><p>In the context of the National Development Plan, my Department is making a major investment in the future of the Passport Service.  Over the next couple of years, we will replace the core technology underpinning the service, which will deliver efficiencies and a more resilient passport system.  </p><p>Budget 2022 also included an investment of an additional &euro;10m in passport services in response to the increasing demand for passports both at home and abroad.</p></reply>

It appears that initially peaceful protests at the beginning of the year rapidly escalated into violent clashes between apparently well-organised groups and the authorities. I welcome that calm has now been largely restored.</p><p>However, I am particularly concerned at reports that orders to open fire with lethal force were issued. The UN Special Rapporteur on counter-terrorism and human rights has called for an independent, impartial, effective and public investigation to determine the legality of the use of force and to ensure accountability when lethal force was used by security services, law enforcement or the military. Ireland supports this call. Any domestic investigation must consider Kazakhstan's international human rights obligations.</p><p>Ireland will use our platforms at the EU and the UN to emphasise the importance of protecting the human rights and fundamental freedoms of Kazakhstan&rsquo;s people. If people wish to assemble peacefully and express their wish for democratic or economic reforms, that is their right and it must be protected.</p><p>I have not been in direct contact with the Government of Kazakhstan or civil society organisations in that country in recent weeks, but my officials and I will use any bilateral opportunities that arise to raise Ireland&rsquo;s concerns.</p><p>The Embassy of Ireland in Moscow remains in contact with a number of Irish citizens resident in Kazakhstan.

While the COVID19 pandemic has seen a decrease in travel, Thailand remains a popular destination for Irish citizens. Ireland opened an Embassy in Thailand in 2014. The Embassy, located in Bangkok, is responsible for all consular issues affecting the Irish community likely to arise in Thailand. There are no plans to open a Consulate General office in Phuket. </p>  <p>  In June 2018, the Government launched the Global Ireland initiative, which aims to double the impact of Ireland&rsquo;s global footprint by 2025. To date 14 new missions have been opened, with a further five planned. In considering any further expansion of the Diplomatic network a range of factors will be taken into account including our national, political, economic and trade priorities, as well as the availability of resources. The Government is conscious of the factors that might warrant the opening of new Missions in a number of countries and will keep the matter under active review.</p></reply>

Each year, many thousands of young Irish people visited Australia under this programme which allowed them to work there in order to finance their holiday.  Similarly, we actively encouraged young Australians to visit Ireland under this programme so that a new generation of Australians could become familiar with modern Ireland.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, we had to suspend the operation of this programme in March 2020 due to the pandemic travel restrictions.  At the same time, we made every effort to assist our citizens who were in Australia under this programme. Australians in Ireland under this programme benefitted from pandemic assistance and other support. </p>  <p>  We made clear that we would resume these programmes as soon as circumstances permitted, in line with the processing of other visas and the reciprocal nature of the programme.  In regard to Australia, a general travel restriction was introduced which meant that holders of WHA visas could not enter Australia unless they received a special exemption e.g. on humanitarian grounds. </p>  <p>  This restriction has recently been lifted and I am glad to announce that our Embassy in Canberra is preparing to recommence processing of visa applications as soon as practicable with an expectation of resumption in early February, subject to any further developments in regard to pandemic travel restrictions.</p></reply>

The Passport Service maintained operations throughout the pandemic, notwithstanding the fact that the processing of passports requires physical attendance on site to deliver this service. </p><p>Despite the disruptions related to the pandemic throughout last year, the Passport Service issued over 634,000 passports in 2021 and 45% of simple adult renewals issued within one business day. </p><p>The current passport processing times are:</p><p>-10 working days for Simple Adult online renewals</p><p>-15 working days for Complex or child online renewals</p><p>-40 working days for First Time Applications on Passport Online</p><p>-8 weeks for An Post&rsquo;s mail-in &ldquo;Passport Express&rdquo; service</p><p>The aforementioned passport processing times are based on current average application turnaround times and relate to passport applications submitted to the Passport Service with required supporting documentation. When passport applicants do not provide all of the requisite documentation to the Passport Service, it takes much longer to process the application and issue a passport. There are currently 106,000 passport applications on hand with the Passport Service. Of these, over 47,000 or 45% are incomplete applications that require additional documentation from the applicant in order to complete the application and ensure that the passport can be issued. While the Passport Service makes every effort to contact applicants in such circumstances, their experience is that many applicants take weeks and sometimes months to send in the necessary documents. </p><p>The Passport Service continually examines how to improve processing times and engagement with applicants. Preparation is currently underway for several system and service improvements that will enhance the customer service experience and will improve processing times. </p><p>The processing of Foreign Birth Registration has resumed and will be gradually scaling up in line with the recruitment of additional resources. Due to the complex nature of the Foreign Birth Registration process, the large increase in applications received following the Brexit vote in the UK, and the pause in the Service due to necessary Covid-19 restrictions, applicants should allow approximately 2 years from the receipt of supporting documentation for processing of Foreign Birth Registration applications at this time. Before this increase in application volumes and Covid-19 restrictions, applications were typically processed within 6-9 months of receipt. Due to Covid-19 restrictions, and the subsequent reassignment of Foreign Birth Registration staff to assist in the provision of essential passport services, the Foreign Birth Registration Service was paused for nearly 15 months across the 2020-2021 period. </p><p>There are currently 32,000 applications for which documentation has been received, and which are awaiting processing. Foreign Birth Registration staff continue to provide an emergency service for Foreign Birth Registration in cases of exceptional urgency, such as expectant parents, or stateless persons. In 2021, over 7,000 Foreign Birth Registration applications were processed.  Applicants who require an emergency service may contact the Passport Service directly. My Department is fully committed to the continued allocation of additional resources over the coming period to assist with the processing of the Foreign Birth Registration applications currently on hand and the high volume of new applications anticipated this year. </p><p>My Department has been actively working with the Public Appointments Service to recruit additional permanent and temporary staff for assignment to the Passport Service. This recruitment drive has been underway since the last quarter of 2021 and will double the number of staff in the Passport Service from June 2021 levels. Over 180 additional staff are being assigned to the Passport Service in January alone and further staff will be assigned in February.  I am confident that the additional staff currently being assigned to the Passport Service will help to reduce turnaround times and to respond to the current and anticipated high demand for passports in 2022. </p><p>In the context of the National Development Plan, my Department is making a major investment in the future of the Passport Service.  Over the next couple of years, we will replace the core technology underpinning the service, which will deliver efficiencies and a more resilient passport and Foreign Birth Registration system.  </p><p>Budget 2022 also included an investment of an additional &euro;10m in passport services in response to the increasing demand for passports both at home and abroad.</p></reply>

Since the Foreign Secretary was subsequently assigned responsibility for Brexit in December 2021, we spoke by phone on 21 December, and met in person in London on 6 January. </p>  <p>  During all these engagements, I emphasized that Ireland and the EU remain fully committed to providing certainty and stability for people and business in Northern Ireland. I noted that the Protocol is the joint EU&ndash;UK solution to mitigate against the disruption Brexit causes for citizens and businesses on the island of Ireland and that it can work if we allow it to with flexibility and pragmatism. Furthermore, reaching an agreed approach on the Protocol would be an important factor in allowing open new chapter in a forward-looking EU&ndash;UK partnership. </p>  <p>  The Taoiseach and other Ministers also regularly raise the Protocol in contacts with their UK counterparts.  </p>  <p>  I am pleased that Foreign Secretary Truss and Commission Vice President &Scaron;efcovic had an opportunity to meet in person recently.

Over 180 additional staff are being assigned to the Passport Service in January alone and further staff will be assigned in February.  I am confident that the additional staff currently being assigned to the Passport Service will help to reduce turnaround times and to respond to the current and anticipated high demand for passports in 2022.</p><p>In the context of the National Development Plan, my Department is making a major investment in the future of the Passport Service.  Over the next couple of years, we will replace the core technology underpinning the service, which will deliver efficiencies and a more resilient passport system.  </p><p>Budget 2022 also included an investment of an additional &euro;10m in passport services in response to the increasing demand for passports both at home and abroad.</p><p>The figures requested by the Deputy are outlined in tabular form below.</p><p><b>Passports issued by the Passport Service</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Year </th>       <th>Renewal Passports</th>       <th>First Time Passports</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019 </td>       <td>685,501 </td>       <td>234,008 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020 </td>       <td>358,100 </td>       <td>93,588 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021 </td>       <td>569,334 </td>       <td>72,639 </td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

This is to enable the Defence Forces to carry out the roles assigned by Government, as set out in the White Paper on Defence.  Equipment priorities for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service are being considered in the context of the lifetime of the White Paper on Defence as part of the capability development and Equipment Development Planning (EDP) process.   </p>  <p>  In this context, the principal aim over the period of the White Paper is to replace and upgrade, as required, capabilities in order to retain a flexible response for a wide range of operational requirements at home and overseas. The Department of Defence has received a capital allocation under the National Development Plan of &euro;566m over the 2022-2025 timeframe. Within that capital allocation the Defence annual capital budget for 2022 is &euro;141m. This will enable continued investment in defence equipment, including major platforms, and barracks infrastructure.  </p>  <p>  In relation to air-based capability, my immediate priorities have been the acquisition of three Pilatus PC-12 aircraft in the Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance (ISTAR) role and to acquire two Airbus C295 maritime patrol aircraft.  An additional PC-12 was also acquired in response to the Covid 19 situation.  A contract for the supply of two C295 Maritime Patrol Aircraft was signed with Airbus Defence and Space in December 2019, with delivery of the aircraft expected in 2023. Some &euro;276 million, including VAT, has been committed to the acquisition of all of these enhanced capabilities.  </p>  <p>  It remains Government policy, as per the 2015 White Paper on Defence, that should additional funding, beyond that provided for in existing plans becomes available, the development of a radar surveillance capability will be considered.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Government established an independent Commission on the Defence Forces in December 2020, with a mandate to report within 12 months. The work of the Commission encompasses the consideration of appropriate military equipment capabilities, structures and staffing, and their report will inform decisions regarding the future development of the Defence Forces.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Defence Forces have a modern and effective range of equipment which is line with best international standards, to enable them to meet operational requirements.</p></reply>

Where a school employs a staff member to support those functions those staff are employees of individual schools and responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school.</p>  <p>  The Department previously fully implemented and funded the 2015 recommendations of an independent arbitrator for a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period. F&oacute;rsa trade union has tabled a follow-on claim and officials from the Department and school management bodies have been engaging with F&oacute;rsa on the issues. On the 27th of October 2020, under the auspices of the WRC, an understanding was agreed on a pathway to progress the issues. Several key strands have been identified, and a phased approach is being taken to the development of proposals. </p>  <p>Following intensive discussions at the WRC on 13th September, there has been significant progress in this dispute. Subject to agreement on all elements of the claim, the Department has offered to move School Secretaries&rsquo; pay rates to a scale which is aligned with the Clerical Officer Grade III pay scale within education and training boards on a pro rata basis with an effective date of implementation for these new pay arrangements of 1st   September 2021. Pay rates will be pro rata according to a secretary&rsquo;s current working pattern. The assimilation of School Secretaries to the CO Grade III pay scale will require further dialogue between the parties and further engagement is taking place at present to progress this.   My Department has also offered to improve the conditions for School Secretaries with regard to sick leave, annual leave and maternity provisions for this cohort of staff and engagement has begun on this element.</p>  <p>  Discussions on these elements continue at present and should agreement on an overall package be reached then F&oacute;rsa would have to ballot their members and an implementation process would then begin if the ballot were passed. </p>  <p>  While there is agreement in principle to take the same approach to the consideration of appropriate pay and conditions of grant funded caretakers there remains a deficit of data on working terms and conditions of such staff. When the final package for secretaries has been agreed and an implementation plan is in place for schools and for the Department, similar engagement, on regularising the pay and conditions of grant funded caretakers, will begin.</p></reply>

Arrangements are now being made for the payment of these grants to schools. The Department circular can be accessed here:  www.gov.ie/ga/ciorclan/1f42e-cistiu-breisithe-i-gcomhair-an-deontais-mionoibreacha-le-haghaidh-bunscoileanna-cistiu-eisceachtuil-i-gcomhair-an-deontais-mionoibreacha-le-haghaidh-bunscoileanna-agus-focas-faoi-leith-aige-ar-thacaiocht-don-aerail-feabhsaithe/www.gov.ie/en/circular/db27a-enhanced-minor-works-grant-funding-for-primary-schools-exceptional-minor-works-grant-funding-for-post-primary-schools-with-a-particular-focus-on-supporting-enhanced-ventilation/ </p><p>Managing ventilation is one of a suite of public health measures in place to keep our schools safe.  </p><p>The Department&rsquo;s ventilation guidance for schools is very clear and practical on the steps to be taken by all schools to manage ventilation levels including in relation to the role of air cleaners in helping to deal with poorly ventilated areas.  The practical steps and stepwise approach set out in the guidance are sufficient to ensure good ventilation practices in school while at the same time ensuring an appropriate balance between ventilation and comfort. www.gov.ie/en/publication/ad236-guidance-on-ventilation-in-schools/</p><p>The over-arching approach in the guidance is for schools to have windows open as fully as possible when classrooms are not in use and partially open when classrooms are in use. </p><p>HEPA air cleaning devices are not a substitute for good ventilation but can be considered as an additional measure in conjunction with other methods of ventilation that are available pending the completion of structural interventions to address a poorly ventilated area. This is in line with the Expert Group recommendations. </p><p>There is no one solution that fits all scenarios, each application requires bespoke analysis and selection of the appropriate unit(s) matched to the specific room size and volume. If a school feels that its individual space may require specific technical specialist advice then the assistance of a Chartered Engineer or Registered Architect can be sought.</p><p>The Minor Works Grant announced can be used to address any small-scale ventilation improvement. In the event your engineer/ architect recommends a HEPA air cleaner to address a poorly ventilated area, relevant technical guidance can be found here: www.gov.ie/en/publication/c6578-room-air-cleaner-guidance-for-schools/</p><p>Should schools require larger scale ventilation work they may also apply for emergency works grant assistance in the normal way.&quot;</p></reply>

This site will accommodate a new 1,000 pupil plus 4 SEN Unit post-primary school as a replacement for the Curragh Post-Primary School and to cater for the increased demographic growth at post-primary level due to occur in the Kildare South region over the coming years, the majority of which is projected to occur in Kildare Town. The location of this 8 acre greenfield site is next to two existing primary schools, Kildare Town Educate Together NS and Gaelscoil Mhic Aodha, within the grounds of the former Magee Barracks, Kildare Town. The development of the post primary school on this site will enhance the education facilities available to Curragh PPS and the existing primary schools in a new educational campus arrangement. </p><p>Due to commercial sensitivities it is not possible to provided further information at this time.

My Department&rsquo;s Wellbeing Policy Statement and Framework for Practice sets out the ambition and vision of my Department that the promotion of wellbeing will be at the core of the ethos of every school and centre for education in Ireland and that all schools will provide evidence-informed approaches and support, appropriate to need, to promote the wellbeing of their students. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, I have announced that my Department is commencing a review of my Department&rsquo;s 2013 Action Plan on Bullying and the 2013 Anti-bullying Procedures for Primary and Post-primary Schools. </p>  <p>  The review  will reflect the significant developments and relevant research since 2013, specifically in relation to the areas of cyber bullying and gender identity bullying.  </p>  <p>  The review will also give detailed consideration to the recommendations contained in the Oireachtas Joint Committee Report on School Bullying and the Impact on Mental Health. The report includes recommendations relating to the establishment of a System for the compilation of data on the incidence of Bullying in Primary and Post-Primary Schools and relating to the expansion of the FUSE Programme.</p>  <p>  The 2013 Anti-Bullying Procedures for Primary and Post-primary Schools outline key principles of best practice for both preventing and tackling bullying and require all schools to commit to these principles in their anti-bullying policy. In particular, they emphasise that a cornerstone in the prevention of bullying is a positive school culture and climate. In that regard, the procedures set out the need for schools to encourage and strengthen open dialogue between all school staff and pupils and to ensure that they provide appropriate opportunities for pupils to raise their concerns in an environment that is comfortable for the pupil.</p>  <p>  The anti-bullying procedures also include specific requirements in relation to the use of prevention and education strategies and the consistent investigation, follow up and recording of bullying behaviour.</p>  <p>  All Boards of Management are required to adopt and implement an anti-bullying policy that fully complies with the requirements of the Anti-Bullying Procedures. A template anti-bullying policy which must be used by all schools for this purpose is included in the procedures.</p>  <p>  The procedures for schools put in place important oversight arrangements at school level that involve the school principal reporting regularly to the Board of Management and a requirement for the Board to undertake an annual review of the school's anti- bullying policy and its implementation. Confirmation that the annual review has been completed must be provided to the Parents' Association and published on the school website.</p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s Inspectorate, in the course of their inspection work, gathers information about how schools deal with bullying in a number of ways through:</p>  <p>  - Review of relevant school documentation, including the school&rsquo;s Code of Behaviour and  Anti-Bullying policy;</p>  <p>  - Meetings with parents and  student representatives at which there is an opportunity for parents and  students to raise issues where relevant and;</p>  <p>  - The inclusion, in Inspectorate surveys of parents and students, of items relating to bullying.</p>  <p>  During this school year this work has been extended, with my Department&rsquo;s Inspectorate prioritising monitoring and gathering information about the implementation of anti-bullying measures in schools across all its inspection types. As part of this work, the Inspectorate will also identify and report on examples of effective practice in relation to preventing and tacking bullying in schools. This will help provide evidence of the type of bullying that is occurring in our schools and examples of approaches that can be successful in dealing with it. An important part of the Inspectorate&rsquo;s work is a focus on the priority actions of schools in relation to promoting a positive school culture and climate.</p>  <p>  Between September and November 2021, the Inspectorate conducted a programme of incidental inspections in primary schools, special schools and post-primary schools. Those inspections included a focus on how schools prevent and tackle bullying through promoting a positive school climate and culture.  Over 450 of those inspections were carried out. During 2022, the Inspectorate will also extend its monitoring of anti-bullying to other inspection types. It will also develop a model of inspection that will look in a detailed way at school culture and climate in the context of anti-bullying.</p></reply>

It recommends 12 actions that focus on support for schools, teacher training, research and awareness raising and aims to ensure that all forms of bullying are addressed.  A number of these actions have been implemented in full while others, which by their nature involve continuous action, are the subject of ongoing implementation.</p>  <p>  I attended the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science last September to provide an update on a number of issues including the measures that are being taken to prevent and tackle bullying in schools. During my appearance before the Committee, I announced that my Department will commence a review of the 2013 Action Plan on Bullying and the 2013 Anti-bullying Procedures for Primary and Post-primary Schools. </p>  <p>  The review  will reflect the significant developments and relevant research since 2013, specifically in relation to the areas of cyber bullying and gender identity bullying.  The review will also give detailed consideration to the recommendations contained in the Oireachtas Joint Committee Report on School Bullying and the Impact on Mental Health. </p>  <p>  In relation to funding of anti-bullying measures, my Department provides funding to a number of organisations to raise awareness of safer internet use and for the delivery of support and information through various anti-bullying initiatives. This includes the provision of an annual grant to the National Parents Council (Primary) for anti-bullying training and information for parents.  &euro;31,620 was provided in 2021.</p>  <p>  My Department also provides funding for Stand Up! Awareness Week , an anti-homophobic and anti-transphobic bullying campaign, organised by BeLonGTo, the National Youth Service for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender young people in Ireland. &euro;58,000 was provided to BeLonGTo in 2021. </p>  <p>  An annual grant is also provided by my Department to the National Anti-Bullying Research and Resource Centre (ABC) in DCU towards funding its research and training programmes and to meet the running and development costs of the national anti-bullying website, www.tacklebullying.ie. This website provides a single point of information on the types of bullying as well as supports and information on how to deal with bullying for young people, parents and teachers.  &euro;73,280.04 was provided to the ABC in 2021.</p>  <p>  In addition to direct funding provided to external organisations, I want to reassure you that there are also currently extensive training and curricular supports, including through the Social Personal Health Education (SPHE) curriculum, the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) and the Webwise Programme, to assist schools in the development of policies and practices on the safe use of the internet and on the prevention of bullying including cyber-bullying. </p>  <p>  The PDST and its Webwise team have developed dedicated resources for teachers, parents, children and young people which gives practical information and advice on the safe, ethical and responsible use of the internet and addresses key issues such as cyberbullying, sexting, image sharing, respectful communication, social media, popular apps and more. The Webwise resources are available at www.webwise.ie.</p>  <p>  The Digital Strategy for Schools 2015-2020 also promotes the development of digital literacy in our young people and the importance of respectful online communications. A new digital strategy is under development with planned publication early this year. Online safety will be an important feature of the new strategy. </p>  <p>  In 2021, on Safer Internet Day, the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Act 2020 (Coco&rsquo;s Law) was enacted. On that day, the Minister for Justice also  announced that an agreement had been reached between her  Department, ABC and  my Department, to establish a &lsquo;Research Observatory on Cyberbullying&rsquo; focused on providing up-to-date research, advice and resources related to cyberbullying, cyberhate, and online harassment, and the implementation of Coco&rsquo;s Law.  </p>  <p>  The Observatory team has put together an outline of an online research repository of resources on cyberbullying, cyberhate and online harassment which will be made available in early 2022 for researchers and the general public. It hosted an online webinar last December where national and International experts shared their knowledge on cyberbullying and online abuse with researchers and with the broader general public, including teachers, parents, and young people. The Observatory  is also designing an interview study to collect data on teenagers&rsquo; experiences of cyberbullying, cyberhate and online harassment, within an Irish context. </p></reply>

Updated guidance for schools on Practical Steps for the Deployment of Good Ventilation Practices in Schools was provided at the end of May following the work of an expert group that carefully considered the role of ventilation in managing COVID-19. The updated guidance for schools is also fully in line with the most recent guidance on non-healthcare building ventilation during COVID-19, published by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre November 2021. </p>  <p>  To provide additional support in the context of Covid-19 the payment of a minor works grant totalling &euro;45m for primary schools and special schools, plus a once-off Covid-19 minor works funding of &euro;17m for post-primary schools, was issued in December 2021. All schools in the free scheme have received their grants. To date 3 applications from fee charging schools have been received, these are being assessed. </p>  <p>  Given that each school setting is different, individual schools are best placed to decide how best to use this funding to address their particular needs. Specialist advice/assistance of a Chartered Engineer or Registered Architect is an important source of support for schools.  This will help ensure that appropriate solutions are being put in place to address ventilation issues including advice on whether a HEPA Air Cleaner Unit is required to deal with a poorly ventilated room.  </p>  <p>  Air cleaning devices are not a substitute for good ventilation but can be considered pending the completion of interventions/works where poor ventilation persists. This is in line with the Expert Group recommendations. Air filtration does not negate the need for natural ventilation and opening windows as required. Furthermore Mike Ryan of the World Health Organisation&rsquo;s Health Emergencies Programme has advised schools not to rely solely on air filters.</p>  <p>  In the case where a school has difficulty engaging a Chartered Engineer or Registered  Architect the Department can assist, with a dedicated ventilation team  available to support school principals in this regard.  Schools that identify inadequate ventilation in a room can utilise their minor work grant or apply for emergency works grant assistance to address ventilation enhancements where the minor work grant does not cover the full cost of the works required.</p>  <p>  To date 17 schools have applied for additional funding under the emergency works scheme to assist with ventilation. Of these, 11 have been approved, 1 was returned to the school to review the scope of the application, 2 were incorrectly classified as ventilation related and assessed separately, 1 was rejected as the application form was not fully completed and 2 are currently being assessed by a member of the Department&rsquo;s technical team.</p></reply>

As with previous years, adjustments were developed in conjunction with the Advisory Group on Planning for State Examinations.  This Group includes representation from students, parents, teachers and schools. </p>  <p>  Details of these adjustments were issued to schools on 19 August 2021 to ensure that students and staff could familiarise themselves with any changes.  These arrangements acknowledge the disruption faced by these students because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Minister considers that these arrangements are proportionate to the students&rsquo; experience and loss of learning, and are educationally appropriate. The adjustments ensure that the overall structure of exams remains intact but allows for greater choice for students.  The level of adjustment will be similar to that applied by the Assessment Arrangements for Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate Examinations 2021, as announced in December 2020.</p>  <p>  I made a further announcement on 20 December 2021 regarding the arrangements for Leaving Certificate Oral Examinations in Irish and the Modern Foreign Languages and the practical performance tests in Leaving Certificate Music.</p>  <p>  These examinations will take place outside of school time over the first week of the school Easter holidays, with the examinations running in schools during the six-day period Saturday 9 April to Thursday 14 April inclusive. Working with the State Examinations Commission (SEC), and the SEC examiners assigned to the school in each subject, schools will have some flexibility in scheduling the examinations during this period based on local needs.</p>  <p>  Providing clarity to students on the timing of the examinations will assist them in planning their study and break times. Running the oral examinations before Easter will leave students free over the second week of the Easter holidays.</p>  <p>  All aspects of the examinations will be conducted in accordance with the prevailing Public Health advice.</p>  <p>  Holding these examinations over Easter and outside of school time will minimise disruption for schools and students. </p>  <p>  It is planned that the Junior Cycle Music practical performance test and the Home Economics practical test will take place during school time as normal.</p>  <p>  As part of the adjustments for the 2022 examinations, I also announced that an alternative set of Leaving Certificate examinations would be run in 2022, shortly after the conclusion of the main set of examinations.  These  examinations will be limited to certain students who are unable to sit the main set of examinations due to close family bereavement, COVID 19 illness and certain other categories of serious illness to be determined, with due regard for the principles of equity, fairness and integrity, which govern all aspects of the examinations system.     </p>  <p>  The State Examinations Commission will issue further details regarding the 2022 examinations, guided by prevailing public health advice. </p>  <p>  By way of further information, the Department of Education has provided a suite of guidance materials, agreed with the education partners, to enable schools to mediate the curriculum safely for all pupils/students in a COVID-19 context. These are available at www.gov.ie/backtoschool</p>  <p>  The website also contains information on wellbeing supports for Leaving Certificate students.  This includes a series of supports on managing wellbeing, coping with uncertainty and managing stress and anxiety, developed by the National Educational Psychological Service in the Department, to support students. The webpage has links to more individualised support for students to access, should these be needed. The Department worked with the Department of Health and the HSE to ensure the most appropriate services and resources are clearly signposted for students. These are available here: www.gov.ie/en/publication/af24b-wellbeing-guidance-documents-for-parents-students-and-schools/?referrer=www.gov.ie/en/publication/0722b-wellbeing-resources/</p></reply>

Along with these preventative actions, ventilation further reduces the risk of COVID-19 transmission in schools. </p>  <p>  The over-arching approach in the guidance is for schools to have windows open as fully as possible when classrooms are not in use and partially open when classrooms are in use. </p>  <p>  The Departments Guidance is clear that where the recommended measures in the Practical Steps and poor ventilation continues to exist in a particular room/area, air cleaners may be considered as an additional measure in conjunction with other methods of ventilation that are available.

Pay rates will be pro rata according to a secretary&rsquo;s current working pattern. The assimilation of School Secretaries to the CO Grade III pay scale will require further dialogue between the parties and further engagement is taking place at present to allow this to be finalised.My Department has also offered to improve the conditions for School Secretaries with regard to sick leave, annual leave and maternity provisions for this cohort of staff and engagement is ongoing on these elements.</p><p>Discussions are continuing at present; should agreement on an overall package be reached, F&oacute;rsa would have to ballot their members and an implementation process would then begin if the ballot was passed. </p><p>I encourage all parties to focus on finalising an agreement.</p></reply>

The current development of draft specifications for Leaving Certificate Irish is part of the ongoing cycle of curriculum review and redevelopment.  </p>  <p>  The NCCA has developed draft L1 and L2 curriculum specifications for Leaving Certificate Irish. The L1 specification is aimed at students in Irish medium schools including native speakers and the L2 specification is aimed at students in English medium schools where Irish is taught as a second language. Schools participating in the Gaeltacht recognition scheme will be required to provide at least the L1 specification and English medium schools will have the option of providing the L1 and/or the L2 depending on the needs of students. </p>  <p>  The model of curricular provision provided for in the draft specifications reflects the provision made for Irish in Irish-medium (L1)  and in English-medium (L2) schools at primary and junior cycle levels, and provides learners with continuity in their Irish language learning experience, addressing their language learning needs as they progress along their Irish language learning journey in specific settings. </p>  <p>  In response to concerns raised and requests made by some education stakeholders the NCCA extended the timeframe for the consultation on the Leaving Certificate Irish specifications from the end of August 2021 to 30 November 2021 in order to facilitate greater stakeholder engagement in the process. This extension of the closing date has also allowed the NCCA to commence an early enactment review of the Junior Cycle Irish L1 and L2 specifications. </p>  <p>  Following the consultation closing date for the draft Leaving Certificate specifications the NCCA  commences analysis and consideration of the feedback recorded during the process. It is important to note that the published specification documents are draft and subject to change in the light of the outcomes of this consultation process. The finalised specifications will then be considered by the NCCA Council and if approved, submitted to my Department for consideration, approval and implementation.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-01-19a.2020.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1472" speakername="Josepha Madigan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022011900102#WRMM02500"><p>Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) play a huge role in helping to ensure the inclusion of pupils with significant care needs in education and in school life.  This was acknowledged in the Comprehensive Review of the Special Needs Assistant Scheme (SNAs) published by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) in 2018. </p>  <p>  The Review made a number of recommendations regarding SNAs including referencing the training needs of SNAs.  In this regard, the NCSE recommended that a new national training programme at Level 5 of the National Qualification Framework be developed for existing SNAs who do not have the requisite level of training and for new SNAs on appointment.  The NCSE also recommended that training tailored to the specific complex needs of some students being cared for by SNAs would also be provided.  </p>  <p>  The policy advice has been considered by the Department. It was decided that priority should be given to the development of a training programme for SNAs who may not have had a recent opportunity to access a training programme tailored to their role.  The new first national training course for SNAs provided by UCD aims to enhance the knowledge, skills and expertise of SNAs whose work is central to the inclusion of students with additional care and complex needs in school life. The programme is fully funded by the Department and delivered at no cost to the SNA. </p>  <p>  This is the first national training programme for SNAs employed in schools and is tailored to their needs.  As this is the first programme, it is appropriate to take the time to review outcomes which will inform the future approach to ongoing training and professional development of SNAs. Part of that consideration will include accreditation.</p>  <p>  Raising the minimum qualification for appointment as a special needs assistant has been referred to the Workplace Relations Commission and the Department has been engaging in that process. </p>  <p>  The recruitment and appointment of Special Needs Assistants is a matter for the individual school authority and the Department's circular 36/2020 and 51/2019 sets out the current educational requirements for appointment as a Special Needs Assistant (SNA). In addition, the actual requirements for a post will vary depending on the specific needs of the children and the school to which the SNA is to be appointed. The Department does not believe that the existing minimum qualifications has impacted on the calibre of person appointed and it is also the case that people with experience and/or higher qualifications than the minimum are often the successful candidate in competitions held by schools.</p>  <p>  However, having considered the claim and, in particular, the period of time since they were set, the Department is open to reviewing the position. However, the Department is not yet in a position to indicate when that review might take place but is of the view that the forthcoming review of the SNA contract proposed as part of the Building Momentum national pay agreement should be carried out and implemented first.</p></reply>

My Department acknowledges the commitment of schools in promoting healthy lifestyle choices for students in a number of ways - the curriculum &ndash; for example Physical Education and Social Personal Health Education (SPHE); through schools policy including healthy lunch policies and by the use of resources and programmes chosen by the school. The Active School Flag (ASF) is one such programme. Work by my Department in this area aims to equip students with the skills and knowledge to enable them to make the right choices for healthy lifestyles throughout their lives.  </p>  <p>  My Department supports Agri Aware&rsquo;s Incredible Edibles programme, a healthy eating initiative for Primary School pupils. The programme is also supported by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Department of Health. It encourages schools across the country to grow carrots, lettuce, potatoes, strawberries, turnips and herbs. Schools are supplied with grow packs, activity sheets and videos containing everything needed to grow these foods.</p>  <p>  The Food Dudes Programme is a healthy eating programme developed to encourage children to eat more fresh fruit and vegetables. It is implemented in primary schools and is based on repeated tastings of fruit and vegetables supported by positive role modelling and rewards. The Food Dudes Programme is currently being implemented in Ireland under an EU six-year strategy framework covering the period 1 August 2017-July 2023.</p>  <p>  Throughout school, our young people are educated about the dangers of eating food which is unhealthy during their primary and second level education.  The Social Personal and Health Education (SPHE) programme is a mandatory part of the curriculum in primary schools and in junior cycle. The programme is supported by comprehensive teacher guidelines and curriculum support services, which</p>  <p>  provide training and advice for schools, and also a resource directory.</p>  <p>  At primary level, one of the SPHE strand units 'Taking care of my body' specifically addresses the need for regular exercise and activity as well as the area of nutrition and food and the need for a balanced diet.  This unit is built upon from Infant classes onwards.  By Fifth and Sixth classes, children are encouraged to realise and accept responsibility for making wise food choices and for adopting a healthy, balanced diet, and in that, exploring and examining the food pyramid.</p></reply>
