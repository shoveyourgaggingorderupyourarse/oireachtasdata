The current working arrangements require staff to attend on site at least 2 days per week. In line with the rest of the Civil Service, my Department is in the process of finalising its blended working policy for the longer-term which will be implemented in the coming weeks. </p><p>This policy is being guided by the Central Policy Framework for Blended Working in the Civil Service as published by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and will set out the application process by which staff of my Department can formally request blended working arrangements. In the meantime, remote working alongside attendance on site will continue in line with business needs.</p><p>Under my Department's Blended Working Policy, staff will be required to designate a single address and workstation that meets the required health and safety standard when working remotely.</p></reply>

This landbank will form part of IDA&rsquo;s long term strategic plans to position Drogheda and the wider Mid-East region to compete for FDI investment. </p>  <p>  Since acquiring the landbank IDA has undertaken an infrastructure review with respect to servicing considerations and how to best position the landbank to potential FDI investment opportunities. </p>  <p>  IDA is committed to building an advanced building solution on the new lands. This building project is at concept review stage. A multi-disciplinary design team has been appointed by IDA and this review is ongoing and progressing well.</p>  <p>  The timely provision of appropriate, cost-effective property and infrastructure solutions to meet the needs of MNCs remains essential to winning Foreign Direct Investment (FDI).  IDA&rsquo;s regional property programme ensures the continued supply of land, buildings and infrastructure in regional locations to meet the needs of current and prospective clients.  A robust property and infrastructure ecosystem can be the key differentiator in winning FDI projects.  IDA Ireland is pleased to have acquired these two landbanks enhancing the offering in the Mid-East.  Over the last five years, IDA&rsquo;s Regional Property Programme enabled the winning of capital-intensive projects of significant scale to regional locations. IDA will continue to work with commercial property developers and Local Authorities to market other property solutions across all regions where they exist.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  The FDI performance in the Mid-East Region, which comprises counties Kildare, Louth, Meath and Wicklow, has been strong over the past five years with employment growing among IDA clients within the Engineering &amp;amp; Industrial Technologies, Medical Technologies, Technology, International Financial Services and Life Sciences sectors. There are 103 IDA Ireland client companies in the Mid-East Region employing 18,894 people directly and an additional 15,115 indirect jobs supported. IDA Ireland client employment in the region grew by 5% in 2021 with an additional 933 net jobs created. In recent years, IDA Ireland supported companies including WUXI, Wasdell, Almac, PCI Pharma Services, Amazon Web Services and Simply NUC who have announced investments and expansions for Co. Louth which have driven the demand for property solutions. </p></reply>

Embracing and implementing a Blended Working policy is part of my Department's key strategic actions and represents an opportunity to transform how the Department works and delivers results. It is envisaged that blended working will facilitate and drive the Department and staff to deliver on the Department's vision as set out in our Statement of Strategy Le Ch&eacute;ile 23 for a climate neutral, sustainable, and digitally connected Ireland.   My Department&rsquo;s formal blended working policy was developed in line with the Civil Service Framework for Blended Working and sets out blended working arrangements at minimum 2 days per week or 40% overall monthly office attendance, depending on business needs as determined by the Head of Function. The formal policy was launched in July 2022, and the application process has commenced 1st September 2022. All staff can apply, however, my Department has assessed the suitability for blended working of all roles in our organisation and identified a small number of roles where blended working is not feasible and staff will be required to work fully on site. In general, fully remote working is not available unless under medical or reasonable accommodation needs, in line with medical guidance. To ensure the health and safety of all staff when working from home and in the office, a process has been put in place for all staff applying for blended working to ensure their remote workstation meets the health and safety requirements set out in the Department&rsquo;s policy. Blended working arrangements are also supported by comprehensive training, guidance, and communications. </p></reply>

This includes a new Electricity Cost Emergency Benefit Scheme through which &euro;550.47 (exclusive of VAT) will be credited to each domestic electricity account, including Pay as You Go accounts, in three payments of &euro;183.49 through the November/December 2022, January/February 2023 and March/April 2023 billing cycles.This is in addition to an extension of the 9% VAT rate on electricity and gas until February 2023 and lump sum payments to social welfare recipients of schemes such as the Fuel Allowance, the Living Alone Allowance, and the Working Family payment.The Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU), which was assigned responsibility for the regulation of the Irish electricity and gas markets following the enactment of the Electricity Regulation Act (ERA), 1999. As part of its statutory role, the CRU also has consumer protection functions and sets out the obligations on suppliers in the Electricity and Gas Suppliers Handbooks (further detail is available at www.cru.ie/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CRU21111a-Electricity-and-Gas-Suppliers-Handbook-2021.pdf).As part of Responses 6 and 7 under the National Energy Security Framework CRU have announced enhanced consumer protection measures for implementation this winter. For pay as you go customers these strengthened protections include:- increased emergency credit of no less than &euro;20- an obligation on suppliers to advise their prepayment customers in debt, of other payment options available to them, including billpay- an obligation on suppliers to place their customers who are on financial hardship meters on the most economic tariff</p><p>The obligations set out in the Supplier Handbooks include special provisions for vulnerable customers on billing and disconnection. A vulnerable customer is defined as a household customer who is critically dependent on electrically powered equipment, which includes, but is not limited to, life protecting devices, assistive technologies to support independent living and medical equipment. This category of vulnerable customers cannot be disconnected for non-payment at any time.</p><p>Vulnerable customers are also defined as those who are particularly vulnerable to disconnection during the winter months for reasons of advanced age or physical, sensory, intellectual or mental health. The moratorium on disconnections for this group has been extended to 6 months (1 October to 31 March). The moratorium applies to billpay customers. It is important that people who are in such a situation contact their energy supplier to register with them as a vulnerable customer. Their electricity supplier will then notify ESB Networks. ESBN maintains a Vulnerable Customer Register based on the information provided to them by suppliers.</p><p>The Deputy may wish to note that CRU provides a dedicated email address for Oireachtas members, which enables them raise questions on energy regulatory matters, such as the matter raised in this question, to CRU at oireachtas@cru.ie for timely direct reply.</p></reply>

The payment will be applied to domestic electricity accounts which are subject to distribution use of system charges at the rate for urban domestic customers (DG1) or the rate for rural domestic customers (DG2). This includes accounts with pre-pay meters. The scheme uses the single identifier of the Meter Point Registration Number (MPRN) to ensure it can be administered automatically and without an application/approval process. This means that it is not possible to omit certain types of residence that fall within these distribution groups. </p><p>The Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, will transfer monies, provided by the Oireachtas for the purpose of the scheme to ESB Networks,the electricity distribution system operator, upon notification by ESBN of the estimated total number of MPRNs. The scheme will be operated by ESBN by virtue of its existing interface with all electricity suppliers. ESBN will make payments to the individual energy suppliers, who will then credit individual domestic electricity accounts. The Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU), will be charged with oversight of the scheme.</p></reply>

Maximum grant levels for eligible vehicles depend on the size of the company or enterprise applying for the grant, and on the fuel-type of the vehicle that the applicant wishes to buy. Funding of &euro;3m was allocated to the Scheme this year and I am pleased to say that the scheme will once again be funded in 2023. </p><p>There are positive signs from truck manufacturers regarding the  expected future availability of new Battery Electric truck models on the market. The EU&rsquo;s Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation (AFIR) is currently being finalised, and when completed this Regulation will outline mandatory targets for the construction of alternative fuelling stations, including electric charging points and hydrogen fuel stations, in all Member States. The recently established Zero Emissions Vehicles Ireland Office has responsibility for overall strategy for EV charging infrastructure in Ireland and will consider supports and funding, including for heavy goods vehicles in due course.</p><p>Ireland also has the Low Emission Vehicle Toll Incentive which offers toll discounts for alternatively-fuelled vehicles, up to an annual cap of &euro;1,000.</p><p>With regard to a scrappage scheme for older trucks, the European Green Deal includes a specific commitment for the removal of subsidies for fossil fuels at the national level. Financial support for the uptake of EURO VI and the upcoming EURO VII diesel trucks is not consistent with that commitment and it is not likely to be possible to progress such a Scheme in line with EU State Aid rules.</p><p>However, the Government is committed to increasing the use of biofuels as a means to support emissions reductions for diesel vehicles. Under the Biofuels Obligation Scheme a percentage of the motor fuel in Ireland is obligated to be produced from renewable sources. On 21 January 2022, this percentage was increased from 12.359% to 14.942% by volume. It is intended to raise this percentage to 20% biodiesel by 2030, a move which will help to significantly reduce emissions from the haulage sector. </p><p>My Department is currently finalising research on the sustainability and availability of renewable transport fuels, including Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, which can be used as a direct substitute for diesel in existing vehicle engines and which has been successfully trialled by a number of companies in recent times. </p><p>In addition, my Department is also commissioning a biofuels taxation study that will consider the possible interactions between the proposed revisions to the EU Energy Taxation Directive, which sets out the taxation rates for energy products across Europe, and national transport decarbonisation trajectories. The scope of the study is currently being finalised, and its results will inform renewable transport fuels policy development.  </p><p>Finally, the Programme for Government includes a commitment to publish a ten-year strategy for the haulage sector. This strategy will focus on generating efficiencies, improving standards, and continuing supports to the sector to move to a low-carbon future. The strategy will be published before the end of the year.</p></reply>

An investigator is selected from the panel to carry out an investigation based on the competencies needed to carry out that investigation. </p>  <p>  Cabinet approval has been given to the preparation of draft heads of a General Scheme to provide for a new marine accident investigation unit based on the establishment of a full -time investigative resource to replace the Marine Casualty Investigation Board.  The General Scheme being developed by my Department will include provisions to ensure a smooth transition between the two bodies.  The progress of the proposed legislation will determine the timeline regarding dissolving the Marine Casualty Investigation Board (MCIB) who along with investigators are continuing their valuable work in the area in the interim. My Department will work closely with the Board of the MCIB to ensure a smooth transition to a full time investigation structure.</p>  <p>  An open recruitment competition for the role of the Chief Investigator and the permanent investigators will be conducted by the Public Appointment Service, who are the centralised provider of recruitment services across the Civil and Public Service. This will ensure fair, transparent and merit-based appointments for these key positions within the MAIU. </p></reply>

Irish driver licensing legislation operates within EU law and testing standards are set at EU level. </p>  <p>  An Irish driving licence can be renewed up to 10 years after the date of expiry of the licence. After that, if a  licence is not renewed, a person is no longer considered a qualified driver. </p>  <p>  Ireland may make bilateral agreements on licence exchange with non-EU jurisdictions. This is not a straightforward matter and reaching an agreement is not a matter of political will. The core principle is to ensure the continued safety of Irish road users. Agreements can be made only when the authorities in both jurisdictions have studied and compared the licensing regimes and are satisfied that they are compatible. For Ireland, this is undertaken by the Road Safety Authority (RSA). </p>  <p>  Ireland does not have a licence exchange agreement with the USA. The RSA previously explored licence exchange with the USA. However, US driver licensing operates at state rather than federal level, meaning that there are 50 licensing systems with widely varying standards and road safety performance, many with road fatality levels significantly worse than most EU countries. Agreement with any one state would mean taking into account the exchange relationships between that state and the other 49. The RSA determined at the time that agreements would not be feasible. </p>  <p>  A person resident in Ireland must have an Irish or EU driving licence to drive here. When people come to Ireland with a non-exchangeable licence, they must go through the normal process of obtaining an Irish licence. A person with a full but non-exchangeable licence can avail of shorter Essential Driver Training of 6 lessons instead of the usual 12, and does not have to wait for the minimum of 6 months before taking a driving test. This requirement assists people to adjust to Irish driving rules and conditions and to prepare for the driving test. Further details can be found on the National Driver Licence Service website at www.ndls.ie.</p></reply>

It is not intended that tenants of local authorities, tenants in receipt of the Housing Assistance Payment, tenants who are supported by the Rental Accommodation Scheme or who are renting from Approved Housing Bodies will be entitled to claim the relief. </p><p>A number of the above conditions applied in the past in respect of the previous &ldquo;<i>Allowance for Rent paid</i>&rdquo; measure. </p><p>As mentioned above, the rent tax credit will be available in respect of rent paid during the course of the 2022 year of assessment and subsequent years. I am informed by Revenue that taxpayers will be required to complete an Income Tax Return in order to make a claim in respect of rent paid during the 2022 year of assessment. </p><p>Income Tax Returns for the 2022 year of assessment will be available for completion and submission in early January 2023. Further details in relation to the information and supporting documentation taxpayers will be required to provide when making a claim in respect of rent paid during 2022 will be published to the Revenue.ie website in early January 2023. Details in relation to the claim process for rent paid during the 2023 and subsequent years of assessment will also be published in due course.</p><p>Qualification/compliance requirements are continuing to be worked through at present and the aim is to have them finalised in the coming days in the context of the preparation of the Finance Bill.</p></reply>

The Department of Health leads on all actions and tasks with respect to the Expression of Interest Campaigns. Department of Finance officials provide support to the Department of Health in this matter.</p>  <p>  The first campaign closed on 29th April however this did not result in sufficient suitable candidates coming forward. Therefore, a second round was issued with a closing date of 5th July 2022. From these two campaigns, three suitable candidates have been identified and are completing Garda vetting. Five members are legislatively required for a functional Board with a quorum of three needed for any appeal hearing; it is planned to interview two further candidates shortly.</p>  <p>  Once these processes have been completed for all candidates the Minister for Finance will then be in a position to appoint any suitable Department of Health nominee to the Board. When the new Board is up and running, it will consider the best way of ensuring outstanding appeals are addressed as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  Requests for appeal hearings can be sent to the DDMBA secretary based in the National Rehabilitation Hospital. New appeal hearing dates will be issued once the new Board is in place. Assessments for the primary medical certificate, by the HSE, are continuing to take place. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-10-05a.200.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022100500066#WRE02100"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 102 and 110 together.</p>  <p>At the outset, the Deputy should note that recent Government policy has focused on strengthening the environmental rationale behind company car taxation. Until the changes I brought in as part of the Finance Act 2019, Ireland&rsquo;s vehicle benefit-in-kind regime was unusual in that there was no overall CO2 rationale in the regime. This is despite a CO2 based vehicle BIK regime being legislated for as far back as 2008 (but never having been commenced).</p>  <p>  In Finance Act 2019, I legislated for a CO2-based BIK regime for company cars from 1 January 2023. From that date the amount taxable as BIK remains determined by the car&rsquo;s original market value (OMV) and the annual business kilometres driven, while new CO2 emissions-based bands will determine whether a standard, discounted, or surcharged rate is taxable. The number of mileage bands is reduced from five to four. EVs will benefit from a preferential rate of BIK, ranging from 9 &ndash; 22.5% depending on mileage. Fossil-fuel vehicles will be subject to higher BIK rates, up to 37.5%. This new structure with CO2-based discounts and surcharges will incentivise employers to provide employees with low-emission cars. </p>  <p>  I am aware there have been arguments surrounding the mileage bands in the new BIK structure as they can be perceived as incentivising higher mileage to avail of lower rates, leading to higher levels of emissions. The rationale behind the mileage bands is that the greater the business mileage, the more the car is a benefit to the company rather than its employee (on average); and the more the car depreciates in value, the less of a benefit it is to the employee (in years 2 and 3) as the asset from which the benefit is derived is depreciating faster. Mileage bands also ensure that cars more integral to the conduct of business receive preferential tax treatment.</p>  <p>  I believe that better value for money for the taxpayer is achieved by curtailing the amount of subsidies available and building an environmental rationale directly into the BIK regime. It was determined in this context that reforming the BIK system to include emissions bands provides for a more sustainable environmental rationale than the continuation of the current system with exemptions for electric vehicles (EVs).  This will bring the taxation system around company cars into step with other CO2-based motor taxes as well as the long-established CO2-based vehicle BIK regimes in other member states.</p>  <p>  In addition to the above and  in light of government commitments on climate change, Budget 2022 extended the preferential BIK treatment for EVs to end 2025 with a tapering mechanism on the vehicle value threshold. This BIK exemption forms part of a broader series of very generous measures to support the uptake of EVs, including a reduced rate of 7% VRT, a VRT relief of up to &euro;5,000, low motor tax of &euro;120 per annum, SEAI grants, discounted tolls fees, and 0% BIK on electric charging.</p>  <p>  Finally, it should be noted that this new BIK charging mechanism was legislated for in 2019 and was announced as part of Budget 2020. I am satisfied that this has provided a sufficient lead in time to adapt to this new system before its implementation in 2023. Therefore there are no plans to review it.</p></reply>

These are primarily designed to ensure that such credit is suitable and affordable for the consumer.  </p><p>For example, the European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016 requires lenders to make a thorough assessment of the consumer's creditworthiness and that such an assessment shall take appropriate account of factors relevant to verifying the prospect of the consumer being able to meet his or her obligations under such a credit agreement.  The Central Bank's Consumer Protection Code also provides that regulated mortgage lenders should gather relevant sufficient information from a consumer, such as the consumer's needs and objectives, personal circumstances, financial situation prior to offering a product or service to a consumer including a mortgage.  </p><p>There are also other related requirements associated with the provision of a mortgage such as that contained in section 126 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 which provides that mortgage lenders must ensure that a mortgage applicant has a life assurance policy in place before granting a mortgage loan.  </p><p>This is an important statutory provision which is designed to protect the borrower's dependants and their home should the borrower die before the mortgage has been repaid.  However, the Act also recognises that in certain cases such a protection is not necessary or would not be appropriate and it provides for a number of limited exemptions to this statutory obligation.  These exceptions are: </p><p>- where the house in respect of which the loan is made is, in the mortgage lender's opinion, not intended for use as the principal residence of the borrower or of his/her dependants; </p><p>- loans to persons who belong to a class of persons which would not be acceptable to an insurer, or which would only be acceptable to an insurer at a premium significantly higher than that payable by borrowers generally; </p><p>- loans to persons who are over 50 years of age at the time the loan is approved; </p><p>- loans to persons who, at the time the loan is made, have otherwise arranged life assurance, providing for payment of a sum, in the event of death, that will at least cover the outstanding balance on the mortgage.</p><p>However, it should also be noted that, as a contractual matter outside of the above statutory framework, mortgage lenders could still require that a life assurance policy is put in place as a condition for a mortgage.  In such circumstances that would be a business and commercial matter for the individual lender. </p><p>If an applicant for a mortgage or another financial product, such as life assurance, is not satisfied with the way a regulated firm is dealing with them, or they believe that the regulated firm is not following the requirements of the Central Bank&rsquo;s codes and regulations or other financial services law, they should make a complaint directly to the regulated firm. </p><p>Furthermore, if the person is not satisfied with the response from the regulated entity to that complaint, s/he may then submit the matter to the statutory and independent Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.</p><p>More generally in the area of consumer protection, the Deputy may wish to note that the Central Bank has just launched a review of the Consumer Protection Code and has issued a Discussion Paper to assist this process.  The Central Bank has indicated that the primary purpose of the Discussion Paper is to facilitate an engagement by the Central Bank with a range of interested parties, to enhance broader understanding of the role and work of the Central Bank in terms of consumer protection and to inform the Central Bank as it commences its work on its review of the Consumer Protection Code.</p></reply>

However, the euro is up 5.1 per cent against the pound at the end of September.</p>  <p>  The 13.8 per cent depreciation in the euro relative to the dollar reflects a myriad of factors, including the proximity of and Europe&rsquo;s greater exposure to the war in Ukraine. More broadly, during periods of turbulence and uncertainty, the safe haven effect leads to a general depreciation of currencies against the US dollar. The depreciation of the euro against the dollar also reflects the European and US economies being at different stages of recovery, with US monetary policy tightening happening earlier. </p>  <p>Of course, exchange rate developments impact the European economy and inflation. It is for this reason that my fellow Finance Ministers and I work alongside the European Commission and the European Central Bank (ECB) to regularly take stock of the emerging economic outlook, including exchange rate developments. This issue was last discussed at the Eurogroup on 3rd   October, with the topic regularly occurring ahead of international meetings of the World Bank Group and the IMF. However, it is preferable not to comment in detail on exchange rate movements as they are market determined. In addition, the Deputy will be aware that monetary policy setting in the euro area is the exclusive responsibility of the ECB, with its mandate to maintain price stability. The ECB has communicated clearly that it is monitoring market movements but that the exchange rate is not something that is targeted. </p>  <p>  In terms of government policy, we can act to enhance the resilience of our economies through continued structural reforms and competitiveness improvements and by boosting our productivity at national level. In addition, as set out in the Eurogroup Statement earlier this week, close coordination of economic policies is needed to address the challenges we face. In this regard, the reforms and investments under the Recovery and Resilience Facility will further improve the sustainability and resilience of our economies. </p>  <p>  In short, there is a strong and continued focus at Eurogroup on pursuing the right economic policy mix and further deepening Economic and Monetary Union so as to enhance the international attractiveness of the euro as a global currency.</p></reply>

The European Commission&rsquo;s 'Europe&rsquo;s Beating Cancer Plan' includes an initiative for 2021-2023 to &ldquo;Address fair access for cancer survivors to financial services (including insurance), <i>via</i>a code of conduct and a reflection on long-term solutions&rdquo;. Earlier this year, the Commission published an exploratory study on &lsquo;Access to financial products for persons with a history of cancer in EU Member States&rsquo; as a first step in this process.  </p><p>Following the publication of this study, the Commission has stated that by the end of 2022, it will launch further work that will gather more evidence and insights on the issue. This will serve as a basis to design a first draft of the EU Code of Conduct, which the Commission plans to discuss with stakeholders, as part of implementing 'Europe&rsquo;s Beating Cancer Plan'. </p><p>It is understood that the EU Code of Conduct is planned to be adopted by early 2024. My Department will continue to monitor any outputs from this work, which represents an important contribution to this issue, and will continue to engage with Insurance Ireland and other stakeholders regarding relevant developments in this area. </p><p>Separately, it may interest the Deputy to know that, with respect to mortgage protection insurance, Section 126 of the <i>Consumer Credit Act 1995</i>permits lenders to provide a mortgage in situations where a borrower may be unable to obtain life insurance, or where such insurance is unduly costly compared to that payable by borrowers generally. This is important to note in the context of securing a home loan. </p></reply>

The Standard Rate Cut-Off Point, which is the entry point for the higher rate of income tax, is being increased by &euro;3,200 from &euro;36,800 to &euro;40,000 for a single individual (8.7% increase), with commensurate increases in the bands applying to married persons and persons in civil partnerships. The main personal tax credits (personal credit, employee tax credit and earned income credit) are also being increased by &euro;75 from &euro;1,700 to &euro;1,775 (4.4% increase), and the home carer tax credit is being increased &euro;100 from &euro;1,600 to &euro;1,700 (6.3% increase). </p>  <p>  Furthermore, the 2% rate band ceiling for USC will also be increased in line with the increase in the national minimum wage to ensure that a full-time adult worker who benefits from the increase in the hourly minimum wage rate of &euro;10.50 to &euro;11.30 will remain outside the top rates of USC. Further details can be located at the following link - www.gov.ie/en/publication/ccc22-budget-2023-taxation-measures/</p>  <p>  I will bring forward legislative amendments in Finance Bill 2022 to give effect to the above measures from 1 January 2023. These measures will apply to all taxpayers, including retired persons, as appropriate to their individual circumstances and income levels. </p>  <p>  Separately, there is an income tax age exemption for persons aged over 65 which means that single, widowed or surviving civil partners aged 65 or older do not pay any income tax if they earn less than &euro;18,000 per annum with a threshold of &euro;36,000 in place for a married couple or civil partners where one person is 65 years of age or older. The relevant income thresholds may be increased further if the individual has a qualifying child. The thresholds are increased by &euro;575 in respect of both the first and second child, and &euro;830 in respect of each subsequent child.</p>  <p>  Marginal relief may be available where the individual&rsquo;s or couple&rsquo;s income exceeds the relevant exemption limit but is less than twice that amount. Where marginal relief applies, the individual or couple is taxed at 40% on all income above the exemption limit to a ceiling of twice the exemption limit.  Once the income exceeds twice the exemption limit marginal relief is no longer available and the individual pays tax under the normal tax system.  </p>  <p>  It should be noted, however, that where the individual&rsquo;s income is greater than the exemption limit but below twice that limit, the taxpayer is always given the benefit of the more favourable treatment as between the use of marginal relief or the normal tax system of credits and bands.  </p>  <p>  In the event that the Deputy&rsquo;s question is specifically referring to age exemption for persons aged over 65, Budget 2023 did not include an increase to the current thresholds. While I have no plans to the change the thresholds in relation to exemptions currently granted to persons aged 65 and over, it must be noted that the current tax arrangements for persons aged 65 or older compare favourably with the tax treatment of the generality of taxpayers. </p>  <p>  Persons aged 65 or over may also avail of the age tax credit, which currently amounts to &euro;245 per year for single persons or &euro;490 per year for married couples or civil partners. Reduced rates of USC also apply for persons aged 70 or older where their total income is &euro;60,000 or less.</p>  <p>  Additional guidance on the range of tax credits and reliefs that may be available for individuals over 65 years of age can be found in Tax and Duty Manual Part 15-01-26, which can be located at the following link &ndash; Tax and Duty Manual: www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/tdm/income-tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax/part-15/15-01-26.pdf.</p></reply>

However, VHT is a separate and distinct tax with a different policy aim. The measure aims to increase the supply of homes for rent or purchase to meet demand, rather than raise revenue. Accordingly, the VHT is not expected to yield significant revenue, with estimates in the region of &euro;3-4 million at most. Unlike LPT, which is allocated to Local Authorities, the revenue raised from VHT will accrue to the Exchequer.</p>  <p>  Likewise, while VHT will be charged at a rate equal to three times the property&rsquo;s existing base LPT liability, the charge is unaffected by the Local Adjustment Factor (LAF) which is set by Local Authorities.</p></reply>

The bulk of the savings have been achieved through a large scale staff energy awareness campaign (Optimising Power @ Work). Launched in 2008 the campaign operates in over 275 large Central Government buildings (this covers approximately 80% of the energy usage in the OPW portfolio).  Average energy savings of over 25% have been achieved through this initiative. </p><p>Since 2017, the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communication (DECC) through the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) have provided significant funding for energy efficiency retrofit projects in central government buildings. The programme is a joint venture between DECC/SEAI and OPW.  The energy retrofits carried out, mainly comprised lighting, heating and controls systems upgrades. To date the OPW have completed approximately 120 projects through this initiative. </p><p>The OPW is currently collaborating with SEAI to deliver a &ldquo;Building Retrofit Pathfinder Programme&rdquo; with overall funding of (&euro;30M). The shared objectives of SEAI and OPW is to develop a scalable model for energy management and retrofit investment in OPW&rsquo;s building stock in the achievement of national policy targets. The Parties are planning to implement an initiative in a selection of OPW managed buildings in 2022-2024 to build an evidence base and to grow scale for a larger national programme. The complete approach to energy retrofit will look at a wide range of measure including; insulation improvements, air tightness upgrades, window and door upgrades, the removal of fossil fuel heating systems (i.e. heat pumps etc.), photovoltaic panel installations, LED lighting upgrades and other M&amp;amp;E upgrades. The energy standard that will be required in these projects will be to achieve a minimum BER B after the energy retrofit works are complete.</p><p>Despite an ageing office portfolio, OPW will continuously upgrade and refurbish its buildings with a view to progressively achieving increased energy efficiency and sustainability.  </p></reply>

Once a plan has been agreed, PAS would generally not cancel or postpone a campaign, however this can occur. For example, PAS had to cancel a Consultant Cardiologist competition for St Luke's General Hospital, Carlow/Kilkenny in 2022 as the client wished to make essential changes to the Job Specification after advertisement.  The new Job Specification was provided by the client and the post has since been re-advertised.</p><p>PAS will always try and respond to the needs of core clients by running all campaigns required to meet their resourcing needs and scheduling campaigns to meet urgent and unexpected needs (such as the Temporary Clerical Officer with Ukrainian Language Skills). </p></reply>

If the extension is ratified, funding will be provided through Supplementary Estimates where it cannot be met within existing allocations. This potentially impacts all Votes with a public service pay or pensions element. </p><p>- As part of Budget 2023, Government is providing &euro;2.2 billion worth of additional temporary, targeted cost of living expenditure supports for households. This package comprises &euro;1.2 billion in Electricity Credits for households through the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications; &euro;0.9 billion in additional Social Protection payments; and &euro;0.1 billion in student supports through the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.  </p><p>- A Christmas Bonus payment for eligible social protection recipients in December was also announced which will have a cost of &euro;0.3 billion on the Social Protection Vote Group. </p><p>- In recognition of the unprecedented rise in energy bills being experienced across the economy, Government also made &euro;340 million available in Budget 2023 to support: Local Authorities; Schools; the Further and Higher Education sector; Health funded bodies; and the cultural, sports, community and voluntary sector. </p><p>- A &euro;200 million Ukraine Emergency Response Scheme through the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment will provide funding to help firms faced with liquidity shortages as a result of increased energy costs.</p><p>- Budget 2023 also provided &euro;30m to the Department of Foreign Affairs for 2022 actions to provide additional humanitarian assistance towards the food security crisis in the Horn of Africa.</p><p>As is usual practice the requirement for all Supplementary Estimates will be evaluated, with potential offsetting savings considered.  Supplementary Estimates for certain Departments will also reflect additional costs incurred in responding to the war in Ukraine and in providing for the response to Covid-19.</p></reply>

The Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) was established as an independent statutory body under the Acts to operate a national tenancy registration system and to resolve disputes between landlords and tenants.</p><p>The Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016 introduced the Rent Predictability Measure to moderate rent increases in those parts of the country where rents are highest and rising fastest. The Residential Tenancies (No. 2) Act 2021 introduced measures in July 2021 to extend the operation of Rent Pressure Zones (RPZs) until the end of 2024 and prohibit any necessary rent increase in a RPZ from exceeding general inflation, as recorded by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP).  The Act also provides that rent reviews outside of RPZs can, until 2025, occur no more frequently than bi-annually.</p><p>To address the rent affordability challenges building on foot of the unexpectedly fast rising inflation rate, as recorded by HICP, the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2021 was enacted to provide, from 11 December 2021, a cap of 2% per annum pro rata on rent increases in RPZs where the inflation rate is higher. In all cases, section 19(1) of the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004-2022 (RTA) prohibits the setting of a rent that exceeds market rent. </p><p>Section 16 of the RTA obliges a tenant to pay any charges or taxes in accordance with the lease or tenancy agreement unless they are unlawful or contravene any other enactment. </p><p>In general, the question of whether or not a tenant has to pay charges to a landlord depends on the terms of the lease or tenancy agreement. The amount of any such charges, if applicable, is a matter to be agreed between landlord and tenant.  Contract law governs such arrangements. The specific terms associated with an individual tenants rights and obligations are likely to be set out in a written contract signed by both the tenant and the landlord.</p><p>Comprehensive information including guidance and frequently asked questions in relation to rent reviews and on general tenancy matters is available on the RTB's website - www.rtb.ie. Where there is a disagreement regarding charges payable under a lease or tenancy agreement, the tenant or landlord may refer a dispute to the RTB for resolution.</p></reply>

Many areas of cities, towns and villages of all sizes face the blight of vacant properties, which, if brought back into use, could add real vibrancy and provide new accommodation in those areas.  The Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe (Towns) Fund is a key initiative which underpins these policy objectives set out in Pathway Four of Housing for All.</p><p>Schemes under the Fund, which are delivered by local authorities, will provide new choices for people to live in towns and villages in Ireland, through the provision of a grant to support the refurbishment of vacant properties and by providing serviced sites in towns and villages to people in order to build their own homes.</p><p>On the 14 July, I launched the Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant as part of the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe (Towns) Fund. The grant will benefit those who wish to turn a formerly vacant house or building into their principal private residence. A grant of up to a maximum of &euro;30,000 is available for the refurbishment of vacant properties for occupation as a principal private residence, including the conversion of a property which has not previously been used as residential. Where the refurbishment costs are expected to exceed the standard grant of up to &euro;30,000, a maximum top-up grant amount of up to &euro;20,000 is available where the property is confirmed to be derelict, bringing the total grant available for a derelict property up to a maximum of &euro;50,000.</p><p>On 21 September, I launched the Ready to Build Scheme, also funded by the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe (Towns) Fund.  Under the Ready to Build Scheme, local authorities will make serviced sites in towns and villages available to potential individual purchasers to build their homes. These sites will be available at a discount on the market value of the site for the building of a property for occupation as the principal private residence of the purchaser. </p><p>When the Fund was launched, I committed to ongoing review of the schemes under it. Feedback on the Vacant Property Refurbishment Scheme to date has been overwhelmingly positive, with 169 applications submitted by the start of September.</p><p>Given that a key objective of Pathway 4 of Housing for All is to ensure that the houses we already have are being fully used, I have decided to extend the eligibility for the Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant to vacant properties in both our cities and rural areas.</p><p>Both schemes under the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe (Towns) Fund will continue to be only for those who intend to occupy the property as their principal private residence. Officials in my Department will work with the Vacant Homes Officers (VHO) in each local authority in the coming weeks to update the details of the Grant, with a view to the expanded scheme being available in November.</p><p>The operation of both schemes under the fund is delegated to and managed by local authorities. In 2022, it is not anticipated that there will be a constraint on allocations. Expenditure and associated allocations will be kept under review for 2023, as the schemes roll-out.</p></reply>

With Housing First, the priority is to support a person who has experienced homelessness into permanent housing as quickly as possible, without any preconditions around addiction or mental health treatment. Then, intensive work continues on these issues once they are housed. Housing First has been a key element of Government homelessness policy.</p><p>The Housing First approach to addressing homelessness places direct access to housing first and foremost for vulnerable individuals using homeless services consistently or intermittently over long periods of time, and those unable or resistant to accessing homeless services and who may then become habitual rough sleepers. These individuals often have complex high support needs such as mental or physical health problems, addiction issues or dual diagnosis (the presence of mental ill health and a substance addiction).</p><p>Housing for All - a New Housing Plan for Ireland committed to the further expansion of Housing First. A new National Implementation Plan, which provides for a further 1,319 tenancies covering the period 2022-2026, was published in December 2021. The new Plan outlines the targets for each region and in each year. Budget 2023 provided funding of over &euro;215m, an increase of 10% on last year, for the delivery of homeless services ensuring enhanced funding for Housing First to deliver these tenancies. In 2023, it is aimed to create a total of 269 Housing First tenancies.<b></b></p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-10-05a.370.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1595" speakername="Peter Burke" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022100500069#WRH00900"><p>The Government is making a significant contribution of &euro;333 million in 2023 to support the local government sector, and this represents an increase of &euro;108m year-on-year. </p><p>A significant element of this funding is a contribution to local authorities towards pay costs associated with the unwinding of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (FEMPI) legislation and National Pay Agreements.  There is an increase of &euro;36.8m year-on-year due to the cumulative effect of these increases.  This total allocation of &euro;199m will help local authorities ensure that they have the necessary resources, in terms of people, to perform their functions.  The allocations per local authority are being finalised currently and will be notified to local authorities in the coming weeks. Furthermore, as has happened in previous years, my Department will be engaging with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in respect of any additional pay increases that are confirmed.  </p><p>The other large portion of this figure is to fund LPT equalisation; to ensure that all local authorities, including those with weaker property tax bases, have a minimum level of funding available to them that is separate to programme funding. The increase in funding to &euro;110m from &euro;34.3m is due to the move to 100% retention of Local Property Tax within the local authority area.  As a result, all equalisation funding is now met by the Exchequer.  On the other hand, the move to 100% local retention will increase the surplus available to certain local authorities, and therefore increase the requirement of these authorities to self-fund some level of transport and/or housing or other costs previously met by the Exchequer.  </p><p>My Department has confirmed provisional LPT allocations to local authorities for 2023 as detailed in the table 1 below. As previously, every local authority has the power to vary the basic rate of LPT in their local area and final LPT allocations for 2023 will be confirmed once these decisions are finalised.</p><p>Finally, it should be noted that my Department is aware of the current financial environment in which local authorities are now operating.  In recognition of the ongoing pressures, support of &euro;60m has been recently secured to assist the sector, which is additional to the increases in funding outlined above. Its purpose will be to assist local authorities in meeting the increasing costs involved in providing a wide range of services. The allocations per local authority are being finalised currently and will be notified to local authorities in the coming weeks.</p><p>Table 1 &ndash; 2023 Provisional (pre-variation) LPT allocations to local authorities.  <table>    <tr>       <th><div>Local Authority</div></th>       <th><div>&euro;</div></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Carlow County Council</td>       <td>6,138,657</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cavan County Council</td>       <td>9,480,501</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Clare County Council</td>       <td>9,137,545</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork City Council</td>       <td>21,159,516</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork County Council</td>       <td>31,194,762</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Donegal County Council</td>       <td>25,119,850</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin City Council</td>       <td>94,556,845</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council</td>       <td>57,276,476</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Fingal County Council</td>       <td>40,533,514</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway City Council</td>       <td>8,527,592</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway County Council</td>       <td>14,517,890</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerry County Council</td>       <td>13,776,761</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare County Council</td>       <td>23,161,639</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilkenny County Council</td>       <td>10,673,913</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Laois County Council</td>       <td>8,558,877</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Leitrim County Council</td>       <td>8,956,315</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick City &amp;amp; County Council</td>       <td>17,554,464</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Longford County Council</td>       <td>8,906,648</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth County Council</td>       <td>9,866,198</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mayo County Council</td>       <td>19,812,344</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Meath County Council</td>       <td>18,651,237</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Monaghan County Council</td>       <td>11,238,572</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Offaly County Council</td>       <td>7,656,288</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Roscommon County Council</td>       <td>10,216,232</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Sligo County Council</td>       <td>10,202,627</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>South Dublin County Council</td>       <td>32,263,395</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Tipperary County Council</td>       <td>25,951,602</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Waterford City and County Council</td>       <td>18,678,971</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Westmeath County Council</td>       <td>11,205,507</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wexford County Council</td>       <td>13,547,516</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wicklow County Council</td>       <td>18,506,399</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total</td>       <td>617,028,653</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

These allocations include the Exchequer contribution to equalisation funding of &euro;34.3m. Detailed information in respect of the 2022 LPT allocations broken down by local authority, are available at the following link on my Department's website: <i>www.gov.ie/en/collection/ea27d-local-property-tax-allocations/</i>.</p><p>In line with the commitment in the Programme for Government &ndash; <i>Our Shared Future</i>, the LPT allocation mechanism for 2023 is changed to allow for 100% of the estimated yield to be retained locally within the local authority area where it is collected. All equalisation funding will now be met by the Exchequer, to ensure that all authorities receive, at a minimum, an amount equivalent to their Baseline. Accordingly, no local authority will see any reduction in their pre-variation LPT allocation for 2023. </p><p>In addition, a move to the 100% local retention model will lead to an increased surplus for those authorities with LPT income above their funding baseline. These authorities shall now retain a greater proportion of that surplus for their own use in 2023; an increase from 20% of the overall yield in 2022 to 22.5% next year. The remainder of the increased surplus will be used to self-fund housing, roads or other services in the local area.</p><p>My Department has confirmed provisional LPT allocations to local authorities for 2023 amounting to &euro;617m as detailed in the table below. As previously, every local authority has the power to vary the basic rate of LPT in their local area by up to 15%. If a Local Authority decides to vary the LPT basic rate downwards (by up to 15%), the resultant loss in LPT income is reflected in a proportionate reduction in discretionary income for the Council.  Likewise, if a local authority decides to vary the rate upwards, there will be a proportionate increase in such income.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-10-05a.376.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022100500069#WRH01500"><p>The Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) is a form of social housing support for people who have a long-term housing need. In order for a household to qualify for HAP, they must first be assessed as eligible for social housing support by their local authority. Any household assessed as eligible for social housing is immediately eligible for HAP and those households must source their own accommodation in the private rental sector.  The accommodation sourced by tenants should be within the prescribed maximum HAP rent limits, which are based on household size and the rental market within the area concerned. </p>  <p>  My Department is aware that some HAP recipients are making payments directly to their landlords, beyond the amount of HAP being paid on their behalf. While there is no legislative provision precluding HAP supported households contributing towards the monthly rent required by the landlord, local authorities have a responsibility to ensure that tenancies are sustainable and that households in HAP are in a position to meet the rental costs involved. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to ensuring that HAP levels are adequate to support vulnerable households, while the supply of social housing increases. </p>  <p>  Under Housing for All, the Department was tasked with undertaking an analytical exercise to examine whether an increase in the level of discretion available to Local Authorities under HAP is required.  The Housing Agency undertook to carry out this analytical exercise on behalf of the Department to better understand what level of discretion should be made available to Local Authorities under HAP to maintain adequate levels of support. </p>  <p>  Following receipt and analysis of this review, I, in cooperation with Government colleagues and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, approved an increase in the HAP discretion rate from 20% to 35% and for new tenancies to extend the couple&rsquo;s rate to single person households. This will secure more tenancies and prevent new entries to homelessness.  Both these measures came into effect from 11 July 2022.</p>  <p>  Each local authority now has statutory discretion to agree to a HAP payment up to 35% above the prescribed maximum rent limit to secure appropriate accommodation for a household that requires it, or up to 50% in the case of homeless households in the Dublin region. </p>  <p>  A separate review of the discretion available to Homeless HAP tenancies in Dublin, which is up to 50% above the prescribed maximum rent limits, is currently being undertaken by my Department, in conjunction with the Housing Agency.</p>  <p>  Tenants in the HAP scheme are required to sign a rent contribution agreement to pay a weekly rental contribution to the relevant local authority, in line with the local authority&rsquo;s differential rent scheme. As set out in the rent contribution agreement, this weekly rental contribution must be paid by them so that they remain eligible for the HAP scheme.  Where a person has a change of circumstances, such as a loss of income, they should notify the relevant local authority.  The local authority can reassess those tenants and adjust their differential rent accordingly.</p>  <p>  The HAP Shared Services Centre (SSC) manages the collection of all HAP tenants&rsquo; differential rents, on behalf of the relevant local authority, and the payment of all HAP rents to landlords on behalf of tenants supported by the HAP scheme. The HAP SSC follows a clear communication policy if rental arrears issues arise. This policy includes regular and early written communication with tenants, landlords and the relevant local authority.</p>  <p>  The approach taken by the HAP SSC has been very effective with minimal levels of rent arrears arising for HAP tenants.  At end Q2 2022, the scheme had a 97% differential rent collection rate with minimal arrears arising for tenants or local authorities. Therefore, only a very small number of tenants have fallen into difficulty with their differential rent. </p>  <p>  At the end of Q2 2022, over 104,700 HAP tenancies had been set-up since the scheme commenced, of which there were over 60,700 households actively in receipt of HAP support. My Department continues to keep the operation of the HAP scheme under review.</p></reply>

The purpose of such an amendment would be to bring the new crime within the jurisdiction of the Court. </p>  <p>  As with all proposed amendments to the Rome Statute, it is for States Parties individually to assess the merits of the proposal in the first instance.

Consideration of the proposal by States is still at an early stages and requires careful analysis.  My officials will also continue to engage in discussions on the important implications of this proposal with our international partners, both within the EU and with other States Parties to the Rome Statute.</p></reply>

The Passport Service is currently out-performing its previous busiest year (2019) by 17%. </p>  <p>  Thanks to significant investment by the Government, substantial improvements have been made this year and normal pre-Covid levels of service have resumed.</p>  <p>  Turnaround times for online First Time Applications have halved from 40 working days in March of this year to 20 working days.</p>  <p>  84% of online adult renewal applications are being processed in 3 working days or less. </p>  <p>  Demand for passports from Ulster remains steady. Applications from Northern Ireland are on average 11,000 applications per month or 10% of all applications. This year to date, 87% of applicants from Northern Ireland have applied through Passport Online. </p>  <p>  The Passport Service is pursuing a Digital First strategy and promoting Passport Online as the quickest, most convenient and least expensive channel for applicants. This has allowed for the centralisation of passport processing resulting in greater efficiencies for the Service and for customers. The majority of Passport Service operations take place at the newly expanded Balbriggan Campus that now has capacity for 500 staff. </p>  <p>  Passport Online is available to 97% of applicants around the world regardless of whether they are first time applicants or are renewing their passport. Passport Online has been hugely successful and over 90% of applicants from around the world now apply for their passport using this channel. This has significantly reduced the number of applicants who need to visit the Post Office or the Passport Offices in Dublin or Cork to apply for their passport.</p>  <p>  Currently, 100% of calls to the Customer Service Hub are being answered and customers can easily access the information they need through the Hub. In addition, my Department is implementing a staffing plan to ensure that excellent customer service is maintained during periods of peak demand.</p>  <p>  The Passport Service continuously considers ways to improve its service to all of our citizens.</p>  <p>  The public offices of the Passport Service in Dublin 2 and in Cork operate a four day urgent appointment service for renewal applicants. The Dublin office also offers a one day urgent appointment service. Recent figures for the Urgent Appointment Service show that just 28% of these appointments are being availed of.  Currently, about 1% of all passport applications are processed through the public offices in Dublin and Cork. </p>  <p>  Any expansion of services would need to review the potential demand for an in-person urgent appointment service given the efficiencies built-in to Passport Online and in light of the fact that 84% of online adult renewal applications are currently being processed in 3 working days.</p>  <p>  The Passport Service continuously reviews the range of services it offers while also strategically planning to respond to the future needs of the Service. In considering any expansion of existing services, a number of criteria are examined including the efficiencies that would be gained, whether the proposed expansion would improve the overall quality of the service and whether the potential benefits of expanding the service would justify the significant costs involved. Any proposed expansion would also need to complement the Passport Service's Digital First strategy. </p></reply>

The Home School Community Liaison (HSCL) Scheme is an integral element of the DEIS programme.  It is a school-based intervention provided to DEIS schools to address the needs of pupils at most risk of educational disadvantage. The role of the HSCL Coordinator is to work primarily with the salient adults in the child&rsquo;s life, in order to empower them, so that they can better support their children to attend school, participate in education and develop positive attitudes to life-long learning. Central to the HSCL initiative, is the identification of educational needs and the provision of a tailored and proportionate response to those needs, through a range of interventions, which are evidence-based, focused and structured.</p>  <p>  HSCL supports are provided to all DEIS Urban and DEIS Post-Primary schools. In the 2022/23 school year there are 529 HSCL posts allocated to provide supports to approximately 207,000 students under the DEIS programme. A further 4 posts are allocated to support schools participating in the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy (NTRIS) STAR pilot working with Traveller and Roma students.</p>  <p>  Enabling children with special educational needs (SEN) to receive an education appropriate to their needs is a priority for this Government.  It is also a key priority for me as Minister for Special Education &amp;amp; Inclusion, for my Department and for the National Council for Special Education (NCSE).  This year, my Department will spend in excess of &euro;2 Billion, or over 25% of the Department&rsquo;s budget on providing additional teaching and care supports for children with special educational needs. As a result, the number of special education teachers, special needs assistants and special class and special school places are at unprecedented levels.  Staffing ratios in special schools are significantly lower than in mainstream schools and are intended to ensure that the needs of students can be met effectively.</p>  <p>  While the benefits of having good links between the home and school are acknowledged for all students, there are no current plans to extend DEIS programme measures to special schools. </p></reply>

It is accepted that good connectivity is essential to ensure that schools are facilitated to progress the embedding of digital technologies in teaching and learning and for the implementation of new and revised curriculum. My Department operates the Schools Broadband Programme at an annual cost of some &euro;13m, with at least 98% of schools included in this scheme providing connectivity to these schools through a range of technologies at the best level of connectivity available based on local infrastructure.</p>  <p>  My Department is now implementing a project to provide high speed broadband connectivity through the Schools Broadband Programme for primary schools outside of the National Broadband Plan Intervention Area, and where commercial provision is neither available nor planned. That project is supported by funding under the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP) and is managed by HEAnet on behalf of my Department. My Department is committed to providing all primary schools with high speed broadband in 2023 through the National Broadband Plan, commercial provision, and the NRRP project. The school referred to by the Deputy is currently on a 12mbs dedicated wireless service, however the school is included in the next tender for services under this high speed broadband programme which is due to issue shortly, with high speed connectivity to be provided early in 2023.</p>  <p>  The National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP) has been developed by the Government so that Ireland can access funding under the EU&rsquo;s Recovery and Resilience Facility. Ireland is expected to receive &euro;988 million in grants under the Facility. The Recovery and Resilience Facility is the largest component of NextGenerationEU, the European Union&rsquo;s response to the global pandemic. The aim is to help repair the immediate economic and social damage brought about by the pandemic and to prepare for a post-Covid Europe that is greener, more digital, more resilient and fit to face the future. </p>  <p>  The new Digital Strategy for Schools to 2027 was published on the 17th April and has at its core the aim of empowering schools to further embed digital technologies across their teaching, learning and assessment.  It sets out how the development of digital skills are supported in schools and builds on the key achievements under the previous strategy.  It aligns closely with the EU Digital Education Action Plan 2021-2027 and also takes into consideration the National Digital Strategy &lsquo;Harnessing Digital: The Digital Ireland Framework as well as other relevant policies and strategies. </p></reply>

In the last school year over 121,400 children, including over 15,500 children with special educational needs, were transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;289m in 2021.</p><p>The purpose of my Department's School Transport Scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school.</p><p>As you are aware, in July 2022, Government announced funding for the waiving of school transport scheme fees for the coming school year as part of a wider package of cost of living measures. </p><p>School Transport ticket registration for the 2022/23 school year closed on 29 July by which time almost 130,000 applications/registrations were received for mainstream school transport. This figure includes 44,299 new applications as well as roll-overs from the previous school year.</p><p>There has been an increase in tickets allocated across all counties, with an increase of 18% in the number of tickets issued to eligible pupils compared to start of the 2021/2022 school year and an increase of 27% in the number of tickets issued to concessionary pupils compared to the start of the 2021/2022 school year.</p><p>The normal eligibility criteria of the scheme still apply.</p><p>Pupils at primary level are eligible where they live no less than 3.2 kilometres from and are attending their nearest primary school.</p><p>At post-primary level students who live no less than 4.8 kilometres from and are attending their nearest post-primary school/education centre are deemed eligible.</p><p>All children who are eligible and who completed the application and registration process on time will be accommodated in the 2022 school year.  In addition, pending completion of the outcome of the full review of the School Transport Scheme, temporary Alleviation Measures at post-primary level be continued for the 2022/2023 school year. Under these measures, which were initially introduced in 2019, transport will provided for post-primary pupils who are eligible for transport to their nearest school and are attending their second nearest school and who applied by the 29th April and registered for a ticket by the 29th July.</p><p>Any pupils/students who do not meet these criteria are deemed not eligible, or otherwise known as concessionary, applicants and are allocated a ticket based on the availability of a seat on when all eligible children have been catered for.</p><p>The information cannot be provided in the manner requested by the Deputy as numbers are still being finalised for the 2022/23 school year.  A small number of on time applications are still in the process of being assessed. </p><p>Bus &Eacute;ireann will continue to process applications and to issue tickets as soon as extra buses and drivers are sourced and become available to provide transport for the higher numbers qualifying for the service.  Where additional services may need to be put in place for eligible children, any capacity on these services will be offered to concessionary applicants.</p><p>Following discussions with Minister McGrath and officials in DPER as part of the budgetary process some additional funding has been approved for the scheme which will allow officials in consultation with Bus &Eacute;ireann to consider and evaluate where temporary additional capacity may be available. </p><p>The initial focus will be where families applied on time and who previously held concessionary tickets, to alleviate the impact of the increased demands on the scheme for those families.However, it is important to stress that this is subject to capacity considerations.  Constraints in sourcing vehicles and drivers in certain areas of the country may also mean that it may take a number of weeks to explore solutions for additional capacity.</p></reply>

It is accepted that good connectivity is essential to ensure that schools are facilitated to progress the embedding of digital technologies in teaching and learning and for the implementation of new and revised curriculum.</p>  <p>  My Department operates the Schools Broadband Programme at an annual cost of some &euro;13m, providing broadband connectivity to schools through a range of technologies at the best available connectivity based on local infrastructure. The school referred to by the Deputy is currently on 50mb wireless broadband connection, which is a dedicated service to the school.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy has rightly pointed out the school referred is in the National Broadband Plan (NBP) Intervention Area, implementation of which is underway. My Department is working closely with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications (DECC) on this implementation to prioritise school connectivity, with all schools in the NBP Implementation Area to be provided with high speed broadband infrastructure by 2023. My officials have confirmed that this school, recently connected to the National Broadband Ireland fibre network, has been awarded to a Schools Broadband Programme retail service provider and will be connected to the schools broadband network as soon as possible.</p>  <p>   In the meantime, the school may wish however to contact the Schools Broadband Service Desk (tel. 1800 334466) to ensure that they are receiving the maximum service on their current connection, and to get the latest updates on this upgrade.</p></reply>

This will add an additional &euro;32million to my Department&rsquo;s expenditure on the DEIS progamme from 2023, bringing the 2023 allocation to in the region of &euro;180million.</p>  <p>  Schools were identified for inclusion in the programme through the refined DEIS identification model which is an objective, statistics based model. Schools were not required to apply for inclusion in the DEIS programme and the model has been applied fairly and equally to all schools. </p>  <p>  Officials from my Department reviewed the data submitted by the schools referred to and the application of the refined DEIS identification model and find no change to the outcome. It is important to note that inclusion in the DEIS programme is not based on school location. The DEIS identification process is based on the principle of concentrated disadvantage and the proportion of students from disadvantaged backgrounds within a school. The model uses information from the school&rsquo;s individual enrolment database and 2016 national census data as represented by the Pobal HP Deprivation index. It takes into account the specific enrolment within a school and the proportion of students within that school, with a weighting applied based on the HP index assigned in respect of where the individual student resides or Traveller/Roma ethnicity.</p>  <p>  A detailed paper on the refined DEIS identification model is available on gov.ie at www.gov.ie/en/publication/a3c9e-extension-of-deis-to-further-schools/#how-schools-were-selected-for-inclusion-in-deis</p>  <p>  Schools that were not satisfied with the outcome following the application of the DEIS identification model to their school enrolment data were provided with the opportunity to have that outcome reviewed. The details of the Appeals process is outlined in Circular 0019/2022 which can be found on the gov.ie website. All appeals submitted have now been processed by my Department and schools have been notified of the outcome. The DEIS appeals process was applied fairly across all appellants and the results are final. My Department will continue to support schools to deliver high quality, inclusive teaching and learning to students and young learners. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the extension of the DEIS programme to new schools is just one phase of work in my vision for an inclusive education system which supports all learners to achieve their potential. While the DEIS programme supports those schools with the highest levels of concentrated educational disadvantage, I recognise that there are students at risk of educational disadvantage in all schools. Conscious of this, and recognising the need to target resources to those schools that need them most, the next phase of work will explore the allocation of resources to schools to tackle educational disadvantage. Part of this programme of work will involve consultation with all relevant stakeholders.</p>  <p>  In addition to this, following the National Census 2022 held on the 3rd April last it is envisaged that an updated HP Deprivation Index will be generated by Pobal and will be available in Q3 of 2023. My Department will engage with Pobal in relation to this process. The updated HP Deprivation Index, when available, can be considered by my Department to inform future resource allocation to tackle educational disadvantage. </p></reply>

The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  Only one allowance is paid per household.</p><p>The Job Initiative Scheme provided full-time employment for people 35 years of age or over who had been unemployed for 5 years or more.  Since November 2004, there has been no recruitment to the Scheme.  Since January 2004, participants on the Job Initiative Scheme could no longer retain their entitlement to Fuel Allowance while participating on the scheme.  This decision was taken as the minimum rate of payment to participants on the scheme was significantly higher than the rate of qualifying Social Welfare payments.  </p><p>There has been no change to this decision and participants on the Job Initiative Scheme cannot retain their entitlement to Fuel Allowance while participating on the scheme.</p><p>The minimum rate of payment to a Job Initiative participant is still significantly higher than most Social Welfare primary payments, including payments such as Illness Benefit and Jobseeker's Benefit, which are also non-qualifying payments for Fuel Allowance.  Participants on the Job Initiative Scheme are also considered to be in full time employment and not in receipt of a Social Welfare support payment. </p><p>While consideration is always given to suggested improvements to the Department's schemes, any decision to provide participants on the Job Initiative Scheme with access to the Fuel allowance payment would change the targeted nature of the Fuel Allowance scheme, as it would be awarding the payment to people in full-time employment irrespective of means.</p><p>Finally, the Department of Social Protection provides Additional Needs Payments as part of the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme for people who have an urgent need which they cannot meet from their own resources.  These payments are available through our Community Welfare Officers.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The measures, which were approved by Government, are in response to the recommendations from the Commission on Pensions.  The set of measures represent the biggest ever structural reform of the Irish State Pension system.</p><p>Rather than fixating on the idea of a single State Pension age, a flexible pension system will be introduced in Ireland. Under this new system, which will take effect from January 2024, people will still be able to retire at 66 and draw-down their pension in exactly the same way as they can today.  In addition, there will be new flexibility so that people can choose to defer their pension, work longer and receive a higher pension payment. </p><p>People can draw down their State Pension at age 66 and continue in paid employment if that is what they want to do.  The current position is that a  person aged 66 years of age and over who works in paid employment can receive a contributory State Pension payment, and there is no means testing or retirement condition for this payment.  Furthermore, a person in receipt of the State Pension (Non-Contributory) can also work in paid employment subject to means testing rules.  The State Pension reforms announced in September 2022 will not change that position. </p><p>The flexible State Pension system is about providing people with choice. People will decide for themselves what best suits their needs and circumstances.  For example, in the case of a person who reaches age 66 and does not have sufficient contributions to qualify for a full pension, they will now have the option to work for longer in order to obtain a higher pension payment. A person will also have the option to continue working between age 66 and 70 and receive an actuarially based increase in their weekly payment rate.</p><p>My officials will work to implement the reforms, including the drafting of legislation and development of administrative and IT systems as necessary.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The payment continues to be paid in respect of children until their 18th birthday who are in full-time education, or who have a disability. Child Benefit is currently paid to over 631,000 families in respect of almost 1.2 million children with an estimated expenditure of more than &euro;2.1 billion in 2022.</p><p>To assist families with the cost of living, in Budget 2023, I have provided for Child Benefit recipients to receive a double payment in November. This will benefit approximately 638,000 recipients in respect of approximately 1.2 million children. This measure will cost an estimated &euro;170.4 million.</p><p>There are currently no plans to extend Child Benefit in respect of full-time students in second level education who are over 18 years of age. Such an extension would have significant cost implications.</p><p>Families on low incomes may be able to avail of a number of social welfare schemes that support children in full-time education until the age of 22, including: </p><p>- Increase for a Qualified Child (IQCs) with primary social welfare payments;</p><p>- the Working Family Payment for low-paid employees with children; and</p><p>- the Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance.</p><p>I am pleased that Budget 2023 includes a Social Welfare package of over &euro;2.1 billion. Budget 2023 provides for a &euro;40 weekly increase in the Working Family Payment income limits for families of all sizes from January at a cost of approximately &euro;16.8 million in 2023. I have also provided for a &euro;500 lump sum payment to all families in receipt of the payment in November 2022 at an estimated cost of &euro;23 million.</p><p>I also provided for the weekly rates of the Increase for a Qualified Child to increase by &euro;2 to &euro;42 per week in the case of children under age 12 and by &euro;2 to &euro;50 per week in the case of children aged 12 or over. These increase will take effect from January at an estimated cost of &euro;30.4 million in 2023.</p><p>These schemes provide targeted assistance that is directly linked to household income and thereby support low-income families with older children participating in full-time education.</p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

CIB provides funding to eight CIS companies that operate a national network of Citizens Information Centres. </p><p>It is very important to note that, by law, the CIB is charged with independently overseeing the delivery of its services under its remit. Similarly, each CIS is a limited company governed by a voluntary board of directors. These eight CIS companies make decisions independently on the delivery of services in their own regions.</p><p>The CIS volunteer strategy was developed by the independent regional CIS companies and, as an operational matter, I cannot, as Minister for Social Protection, direct the CIB or the CIS in this regard.</p><p>In light of concerns raised by Deputies on this matter, I have however met with the Chairperson and CEO of CIB seeking further information on the issue of volunteers in CIS companies.</p><p>As Minister, I absolutely recognise and value the good work carried out by volunteers and I have been very clear to CIB that people who have given up their time down through the years deserve to be treated with respect.</p><p>CIB have assured me that the role of volunteers is still seen as central to the delivery of the service. Indeed, volunteers have been returning on a phased basis since mid-2022. To date, CIB reports that 120 volunteers have returned to support the delivery of Citizens Information Centres across the country. And CIB is now urgently engaging with the regional companies in relation to the continued return of volunteers. </p><p>In addition, following our recent meeting, CIB have now confirmed that they have agreed Terms of Reference for an independent review of the volunteer programme, and this has now commenced. This independent review will engage with internal and external stakeholders, including current and past volunteers, to make recommendations on the re-integration of volunteers to the service.</p><p>Both CIS staff and volunteers are vitally important, and both of these roles are focussed on the customer. From the moment a person contacts a CIC, they are treated with respect and empathy by both volunteers and staff. There is no policy within CIB or CIS of removing volunteers from the CIS service.</p><p>There are currently 89 Citizens Information centres open to offer information, advice and advocacy to the public. There are also 60 MABS offices open to provide assistance to those experiencing financial difficulty. The Citizens Information Phone Service and the MABS Helpline is open Monday to Friday 9am to 8pm. CIB&rsquo;s website is also available and provides comprehensive information on a wide range of supports and entitlements.  </p><p>The priority for the Board of CIB is that the service provided to the public is of the highest quality, whether provided in-person, online or by phone.</p><p>I trust this clarifies matters for the Deputy.</p></reply>

To qualify for the fuel allowance payment, a person must satisfy all the qualifying criteria including the household composition criteria.  This ensures that the fuel allowance payment goes to those who are more vulnerable to fuel poverty including those reliant on social protection payments for longer periods and who are unlikely to have additional resources of their own.</p><p>To satisfy the household composition criteria, an applicant who lives with someone other than a qualified spouse / civil partner / cohabitant or qualified child(ren) must only live with:-</p><p>- a person in receipt of a qualifying payment who would be entitled to theallowance in their own right <b>or</b></p><p>- a person who is in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance or carer&rsquo;s benefit in respect of providing full-time care and attention to the fuel allowance applicant or their qualified spouse / civil partner / cohabitant or qualified child(ren) <b>or</b></p><p>- a person receiving short-term jobseeker's allowance (JA) or basic Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) - i.e., less than 312 days for JA and less than 12 months/364 days for SWA).</p><p>If an Employment Support Scheme (ESS) participant has no entitlement to Fuel Allowance in their own right but was in receipt of Pandemic Unemployment Payment, short-term Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance or BASI Supplementary Welfare Allowance immediately prior to commencing the ESS, this does not prevent a household from qualifying for Fuel Allowance.</p><p>Fuel Allowance is not payable if an applicant lives with any person, including a family member that is not covered by the criteria outlined.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Parental leave is one of a range of measures supporting parents to reconcile family and working life.</p><p>Under the Parental Leave Act 1998 (as amended) an employee who is a relevant parent in respect of a child under the age 12 is entitled to 26 weeks unpaid parental leave for each child. Where a child has a disability or long-term illness, the entitlement can continue until the child is 16. A relevant parent is a parent, an adoptive parent, or a person acting in &lsquo;loco parentis&rsquo;. </p><p>In addition to unpaid leave, the suite of paid leaves has also been expanded in recent years. The Parent&rsquo;s Leave and Benefit Act 2019 (as amended), provides working parents with an entitlement to seven weeks of paid parent&rsquo;s leave for each relevant parent, to be taken in the first two years after the birth or adoptive placement of a child. </p><p>The intention of this leave is to enable parents to spend time with their child in the earliest years.  In line with the EU Work Life Balance Directive 2019/1158, the leave is non-transferable between parents to ensure that both parents are encouraged and supported in taking time out from work to bond with their child.  This is further supported through the provision of Parent&rsquo;s Benefit.</p><p>On 21 April the Government gave its approval for the drafting of a Work Life Balance and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill, the Bill was approved on 19 September 2022 and will be introduced to the Houses of the Oireachtas shortly. The main purpose of the proposed legislation is to transpose elements of the EU Work Life Balance Directive and provide new rights to parents and carers in order to support a better work life balance.</p><p>Under the proposed legislation, parents and carers will see a right to request flexible working in line with Article 9 of the Directive and the introduction of five days leave per year for medical care purposes in line with Article 6. The Bill will also extend the current entitlement to breastfeeding/lactation breaks under the Maternity Protection Acts from six months to two years. The proposals will complement family leave and other entitlements already in place and provide additional flexibility to ensure that parents and carers can be supported to balance their working and family lives. </p><p>Provisions relating to family leave entitlements are kept under review to ensure that they are effective and respond to the needs of families. Mindful of the recent significant increase in family leave entitlements, the Government has no plans to make any further amendments to parental leave entitlements.</p></reply>

Our country has never experienced an influx of displaced persons like the one that we have seen over the past months.</p><p>My Department&rsquo;s role is focused on the immediate, short-term accommodation needs of those who have fled here. To date, more than 50,000 people have arrived in Ireland and in excess of 39,000 of those have been referred to us seeking accommodation from the State.</p><p>Overseeing provision of accommodation on this scale during this timeframe for all those who require it remains immensely challenging. Due to the urgent need to source accommodation, a broad range of accommodation types have been contracted, including emergency accommodation. </p><p>The priority is to place people fleeing the conflict in safe and secure accommodation.</p><p>The Government is committed to delivering a humanitarian response to welcome people seeking protection in Ireland as part of the European Union's overall response. The scale of response to this crisis has been unprecedented and Irish people have displayed an incredible level of generosity in their support and pledges of accommodation.</p><p>I thank the Deputy for the clarification that she provided to my officials specifying that this question relates to pledged accommodation only.  </p><p>I can inform the Deputy of the overall position with regard to the involvement of the local authorities in activation of pledged accommodation. </p><p>A total of 10,485 properties were notified to Local Authorities and NGOs working with them to activate them. </p><p>Of these, 5,377 can been excluded because they have been subsequently withdrawn, uncontactable or otherwise deemed unsuitable when investigated. Of the remaining pledges a total of 5,108, 1,680 have been taken up by beneficiaries with the remainder still being progressed by implementation partners, both Local Authorities and NGOs where this is possible. It is expected that not all of those remaining pledges will result in beneficiary placement for various reasons. There are over 4,500 beneficiaries in pledged accommodation to date and this increases every day.</p><p>1,680 properties have been activated, as set out below. <table>    <tr>       <th>Local Authorities and NGO Overview </th>       <th>Total Properties Sent </th>       <th>TOTAL Pledges Activated*</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Carlow County Council </td>       <td>144 </td>       <td>12 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cavan County Council </td>       <td>200 </td>       <td>6 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Clare County Council </td>       <td>357 </td>       <td>10 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork City Council </td>       <td>267 </td>       <td>19 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork County Council </td>       <td>1093 </td>       <td>78 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Donegal County Council </td>       <td>390 </td>       <td>7 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin City Council </td>       <td>776 </td>       <td>242 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>South Dublin County Council </td>       <td>327 </td>       <td>128 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dun Laoghaire - Rathdown County Council </td>       <td>489 </td>       <td>74 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Fingal Council </td>       <td>346 </td>       <td>96 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway City </td>       <td>63 </td>       <td>45 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway County Council </td>       <td>539 </td>       <td>37 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerry County Council </td>       <td>378 </td>       <td>42 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare </td>       <td>559 </td>       <td>62 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilkenny </td>       <td>221 </td>       <td>45 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Laois </td>       <td>171 </td>       <td>10 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Leitrim </td>       <td>106 </td>       <td>15 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick County Council </td>       <td>393 </td>       <td>61 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Longford </td>       <td>99 </td>       <td>5 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth </td>       <td>249 </td>       <td>14 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mayo </td>       <td>348 </td>       <td>34 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Meath </td>       <td>529 </td>       <td>70 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Monaghan </td>       <td>152 </td>       <td>6 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Offaly </td>       <td>142 </td>       <td>7 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Roscommon </td>       <td>186 </td>       <td>13 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Sligo </td>       <td>186 </td>       <td>3 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Tipperary </td>       <td>369 </td>       <td>50 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Waterford </td>       <td>282 </td>       <td>119 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Westmeath </td>       <td>197 </td>       <td>9 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wexford </td>       <td>461 </td>       <td>108 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wicklow </td>       <td>466 </td>       <td>40 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total </td>       <td>10,485 </td>       <td>1,467 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Other Overview </td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Independently Arranged reported to IRC </td>       <td></td>       <td>213 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Other Total </td>       <td></td>       <td>213 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Grand Total </td>       <td></td>       <td>1,680 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>*Activation refers to placement of Beneficiaries of Temporary Protection into pledged properties</p></reply>

The overall objective of the Action Plan is to improve access to high quality and affordable early learning and care and school-age childcare through childminding.</p>  <p>  A key objective of the National Action Plan for Childminding is to enable parents who use childminders to benefit from State subsidies through the National Childcare Scheme. The National Childcare Scheme is only available to providers who are registered with Tusla, which is the statutory regulator for both early learning and care and school-age childcare. Childminders who are currently minding four or more preschool children or seven children of any age, are required to register with Tusla and can access the subsidies for parents. </p>  <p>  A programme of actions is already under way during Phase 1 of the National Action Plan for Childminding to support a much wider cohort of childminders to come into the scope of regulation and supports. Actions under way include the development of new, childminder-specific regulations that are proportionate and appropriate to the home environment in which childminders work, as well as the development of new, bespoke training for childminders. </p>  <p>  The National Action Plan for Childminding commits to opening the National Childcare Scheme to childminders at the earliest possible opportunity, though it will be necessary first to develop and introduce childminder-specific regulations, and to give childminders adequate time and support to meet regulatory requirements. Phase 1 of the Action Plan, which began in 2021, is expected to take 2 &ndash; 3 years to complete. </p></reply>

Since 1999,  Ireland has undertaken investigations into allegations of abuse in several institutional settings. These investigations have sought to establish the facts relating to the operation of the institutions, as well as the manner in which those who were resident in them were treated. </p><p>In establishing the independent statutory Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes in February 2015, the then Government sought to ensure an independent and thorough investigation of what happened to vulnerable women and children in these institutions during the period 1922 to 1998. Notably, the Commission was specifically tasked with investigating concerns related to systematic discrimination within these institutions.</p><p>Following publication of the Final Report of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes, An Taoiseach offered a formal apology on behalf of the Government, the State and its citizens to all those who spent time in these institutions. In this apology, An Taoiseach acknowledged the failings of the State, over many decades, to protect vulnerable citizens, and to uphold their fundamental rights. The State apology recognised the <i>&ldquo;additional impact which a lack of knowledge and understanding had on the treatment and outcomes of mothers and children with different racial and cultural heritage, those who faced mental health challenges, or those with physical and intellectual disabilities&rdquo;.</i></p><p>It was further acknowledged that <i>&ldquo;such discriminatory attitudes exacerbated the shame and stigma felt by some of our most vulnerable citizens, especially where opportunities for non-institutional placement of children were restricted by an unjust belief that they were unsuitable for placement with families&rdquo;.</i></p><p>This State apology marked a starting point for further measures designed to address the needs and concerns of survivors and their families.</p><p>I am acutely aware that there is no financial payment which could make up for the immense pain and suffering endured by so many of our citizens whose lives have been affected by these issues.</p><p>The Mother and Baby Institutions Payment Scheme is just one aspect of the overall redress package of supports and measures set out in the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Survivors and Former Residents of Mother and Baby and County Homes Institutions which seeks to provide an inclusive and enduring response to the priority needs of all survivors. </p><p>The proposed structure of the Scheme, with increasing financial payments depending on length of stay, recognises that higher payments should be made to those who were subjected to institutional conditions for a prolonged period.</p><p>This allows for a simple and non-adversarial application process, in which applicants will not have to prove abuse and the State can shoulder much of the administrative burden. </p><p>My Department and other state authorities are working to ensure survivors see tangible results as early as possible.</p></reply>

I am conscious of the extremely positive impact these organisations have on improving outcomes for children, young people and families all over Ireland. </p><p>The arrangements that Tusla enters into with a person or organisation for the provision of child and family services are subject to the provisions of Part 8 of the Child and Family Agency Act, 2013.</p><p>Section 56 (14) is clear that Tusla's arrangements with such providers do &quot;not give rise to an employment relationship between a service provider, its employees or agents on the one hand and the Agency on the other'.</p><p>Organisations commissioned to deliver services under Section 56 Service operate independently of Tusla and are responsible for their own internal resource management, including the terms and conditions under which their staff are employed. The remuneration of the staff of these bodies is therefore a matter for these organisations as employers. </p><p>Neither Tusla nor my Department are in a position to determine the pay of workers in Section 56 organisation as they are not public sector employees. </p></reply>

Data captured earlier this year parallels the pre-Covid-19 context, whereby the supply of ELC and SAC is meeting demand though there is evidence of undersupply for certain age groups and in certain areas.</p><p>The network of 30 CCC across the country, including Dublin City, are in a position to match children and families to services operating with vacant places. In addition, CCC have been mobilised to engage proactively with services to identify vacant places and to explore possibilities for expansion among services, particularly where there is unmet need.</p><p>In addition to this, a range of steps are being taken to address issues of under supply.</p><p>Some &euro;70m has been allocated to my Department through the revised National Development Plan (NDP) &ndash; with the majority of this funding earmarked for new places.</p><p>Under the National Action Plan for Childminding, I have committed to opening up access to the NCS to parents who use childminders following the extension of regulation to childminders, which is expected to happen within the first 2-3 years of the Plan.</p><p>My Department, in partnership with the Department of Housing Planning and Local Government, is in the process of updating the 2001 Planning Guidelines for Local Authorities on Early Learning and Childcare Settings.</p><p>Finally, since the introduction of Core Funding, there has been a significant expansion of capacity. Initial analysis shows this increased capacity is the type of capacity that is in highest demand relative to supply (including SAC places) and in areas where there has been pressure on places, including all four Dublin local authority areas.</p><p>To meet the cost of this expanded capacity, I recently announced that the original allocation for Core Funding will be increased to &euro;259m for Year 1 of the Scheme. In addition, the full year value of Core Funding will increase by &euro;28m to &euro;287 million in Year 2 of the Scheme. &euro;24m of this additional allocation in Year 2 is earmarked for developments to Core Funding informed by the emerging data from Year 1 of operation. Developments may focus on promoting further capacity expansion, investing more in the base rate or to taking more targeted initiatives to invest in specific parts of the sector.</p><p>Parents experiencing difficulty in relation to their ELC and SAC needs should contact their local City/County Childcare Committee (CCC) for assistance. Contact details for CCCs may be found on www.myccc.ie.</p></reply>

However, all capital projects advanced by publicly funded Higher Education Institutions must comply with the provisions of the Public Spending Code. I understand following detailed consideration on a number of matters, including the risk associated with continuing with a project that would breach the Public Spending Code, the Governing Authority decided to terminate the contract.</p><p>Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) are governed by the Universities Act 1997, the Institutes of Technologies Acts 1992 to 2006 and the Technological Universities Act 2018. Within the meaning of these Acts, HEIs are autonomous bodies and are responsible for their own day-to-day management and operational affairs including dealing with policy and procedure in relation to any levy payable by students for services or campus facilitates. </p><p>The expenditure that has been incurred to date on the project will be met by the University from financial reserves. No financial contribution is being sought from the exchequer and there will be no impact on the student levy collected from the MU student body. Maynooth University are considering the most appropriate means of meeting the need for additional student spaces on campus, in the short and long term, in the overall context of achieving value for money in any future investment.</p><p>I would strongly encourage the University to continue engagement with the student representative body, on the next steps for this project. </p></reply>

To qualify for student supports under the scheme, students must be attending an &lsquo;approved course&rsquo; at an &lsquo;approved institution&rsquo;. </p><p>The definition of an approved institution is set out in Section 7 of the Student Support Act 2011 and Regulation 3 of the Student Support Regulations 2022. In this regard, the inclusion of any new institutions require the Minister to have regard to the policies and principles as set out in section 7 of the Student Support Act 2011 and seek the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>The list of approved institutions is predominantly populated by publicly funded institutions. While there are a small number of private institutions who have certain courses approved on the list these are categorised as &lsquo;not for profit&rsquo; institutions.  Apart from the new Technological Universities prescribed under the Technological Universities Act 2018, no additional institutions have been added to the scheme since the passing of the 2011 Act. </p><p>As the college referred to by the Deputy is a private educational institution, it does not come under the remit of the Student Grant Scheme. In the context of limited public funding and competing priorities, student support funding is currently targeted at full-time students undertaking study in approved publicly funded institutions.  Any consideration to extend the list of approved institutions would not only have to consider the potential impact on existing approved institutions but also other institutions both in Ireland and across the EU. </p><p>It is open to higher education institutions that operate on a 'for profit' basis to use their own resources to provide financial supports to any of their students that they consider to be in particular need.</p><p>Tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education including approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in EU Member States and in non-EU countries. Further information on this tax relief is available from a student's local Tax office or from the Revenue Commissioners website www.revenue.ie</p></reply>

Undergraduate students eligible for SUSI supports have this contribution paid, in part of in full, on their behalf under my Departments Student Grant Scheme.</p><p>The once off &euro;1,000 support relates specifically to the student contribution payable by student&rsquo;s eligible for free tuition fees under the Department free fees schemes in academic year 22/23. It will reduce the student contribution payable from &euro;3,000 to &euro;2,000 in 22/23. This additional level of support towards free tuition fees will benefit c.94,000 additional students.</p><p>The reduction will be administered with the assistance of the Higher Education Institutions a student is attending. It is anticipated that students paying the student contribution in instalments will have the amount reduced from their next instalment by the HEI. Students who paid their 2022/23 student contribution in full will receive a refund or credit from the HEI attended. Officials are working with the HEA and the sector to finalise the details of this allocation and HEIs will communicate with students directly.</p><p>Furthermore I have been clear and consistent in stating that I believe the value of the student contribution share, as paid by students and families compared to the states contribution, is too high.</p><p>As part of Budget 2023, I made two changes to student contribution thresholds reduce the cost of education for students and families (for college year 2023/24):</p><p>-increased the income limit from &euro;55,240 to &euro;62,000 for students to avail of the 50% Undergraduate Student Contribution;</p><p>- new support to the value of &euro;500 for families on qualifying incomes earning between &euro;62,000 and &euro;100,000. </p><p>Additionally, for any student experiencing difficulties currently, there is a significant allocation to the Student Assistance Fund (SAF). The SAF assists students in a sensitive and compassionate manner who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis and I would encourage students to contact their access office to avail of these funds.</p><p>Overall, the cost of living package, to take effect before the end of 2022, includes:</p><p>- A once-off &euro;1,000 state financial support towards the undergraduate student contribution fee for higher education students eligible for the free fees initiative;</p><p>- A once-off reduction of up to 33% in the contribution fee for apprentices;</p><p>- A once-off extra payment for all student maintenance grant recipients;</p><p>- A once-off increase of &euro;1,000 in the support to SUSI qualified Post Graduate students, increasing from &euro;3,500 to &euro;4,500;</p><p>- A further &euro;8 million investment in the Student Assistance Fund  for the 2022/23 academic year</p></reply>

To further encourage the recycling of waste, individual desk bins have been removed to promote separation of waste in the centralised areas. Waste disposal is currently separated into general, recyclable and organic materials similar to the black, green and brown bin systems found in many homes across the country. In addition, my staff bring recyclable material that is currently not catered for by waste collection providers, such as glass bottles, to local bring centres.

The Irish Prison Service provides primary care services for the assessment, treatment, and support of prisoners. It also facilitates a range of commissioned and collaborative in-reach services, including stakeholders such as HSE Community Services and the National Forensic Mental Health Service. </p>  <p>  In the event of a medical emergency, the healthcare team forms a critical component of the first response team and all healthcare personnel are fully trained in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).</p>  <p>  As the Prison Service employs medical personnel in all locations the Prison Service only trains a small number of prison officers in CPR, primarily gym officers and prison officers undertaking driving duties when escorting prisoners to court.  Prison officers working in Open Centres are also trained in CPR, as 24 hour healthcare cover is not provided in Shelton Abbey and Loughan House.  </p>  <p>  I am further advised that there are 137 Prison Officers trained in CPR across the Irish Prison Service as well as 98 Prison Nurses.  These figures reflect staff whose qualification in CPR is current.</p>  <p>  The impact of COVID on staff training has been significant.  However, the Prison Service has developed a training programme to provide refresher CPR certification to those officers whose certification has lapsed as a result of COVID and to provide initial training to officers who have been newly appointed to gym officer, prison escort or Open Centre roles. This programme is ongoing in order to balance training needs against operational commitments.  </p></reply>

The rate of assessment for rental properties will be reduced from 80% to 40% for income from all principal residences. This will be reviewed after six months of operation, with the potential for further amendment after that point. This policy change addresses the commitments made under Housing for All Action 19.8.</p>  <p>  The change was made through Committee-Stage amendment to the Regulation of Providers of Building Works and Building Control (Amendment) Bill 2022. The Bill was approved by the Oireachtas on 30th June and signed into law by President Higgins in July. The necessary administrative and operational changes are currently being made.

The two satellite centres are open and operational. </p>  <p>  Works on the main site are progressing well, with the NCH clearly visible on the Dublin skyline as external scaffolding is coming down. The major focus throughout 2022 has been, and continues to be, the internal fit-out. The most advanced areas have finished floors, walls, ceilings and joinery, such as nursing stations installed, and plumbing of the ensuite bathroom fittings. Other areas such as the Emergency Department, Imaging, Critical Care and Therapy areas are progressing at pace.  The NCH was connected to a permanent supply of power from the ESB network earlier this year. Other key milestones expected in 2022 include the completion of the main biome glazed structure encasing the feature stairway and lifts, completion of the rooflights and ward end glazing to the Level 4 Rainbow Garden.  </p>  <p>  Nevertheless, this remains a very complex project with over 40,000 activities detailed in the contractor&rsquo;s programme, to complete over 6,000 spaces within the new building. The first of the rooms will be complete in the coming weeks and ready for system commissioning, while the rest of 4,600 clinical rooms will follow in a detailed and planned sequence. </p>  <p>  The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board (NPHDB) has advised that the main contractor&rsquo;s own schedule suggests completion of the project can be achieved by March 2024 which would mean the NCH at St James&rsquo;s could open in the second half of 2024, after the necessary commissioning period. The NPHDB is working to ensure that contractor will meet its own schedule.</p>  <p>  In 2018, Government approved a capital budget of &euro;1.433bn for the NCH project. This included the capital costs for the main hospital at St James's Hospital campus, the two satellite centres, equipment for the three sites, and the construction of the carpark and retail spaces. To date, just over &euro;1.1bn of the &euro;1.433bn budget has been drawn down for works on the project across the three sites.</p>  <p>  There are a number of items not included in this investment figure as there was no price certainly for them and nor can there be, for some, for the duration of the project. These include the sectoral employment order, recovery by the contractor for construction inflation greater than 4%, the impact of Covid-19, statutory changes, any change in scope resulting in healthcare policy changes, provisional sums, the impact of Covid-19, the contractors right to claim for additional true costs in line with public works contract provisions, and implementation of the 2019 PwC report recommendations.</p>  <p>  Brexit, the pandemic, and the invasion of Ukraine have severely impacted supply chains, energy and transport costs, and the NCH project is not immune to these external challenges. Every effort is being taken to mitigate the risks but these externalities beyond the control of the contractor and the NPHDB make speculation and more definitive forecasting unwise at this point in time.</p></reply>

Transport is not considered a core health service and as such Day Service funding does not include transport.</p>  <p>  Some transport supports are provided by the HSE or funded agencies on a discretionary basis, and a variety of transport solutions are pursued in different CHO areas. These include travel training to enable public transport to be used upon commencement of a day programme (where applicable), local transport such as Local Link, private bus transport providers and taxis, funded via a combination of service provider, HSE funding, service user contribution, and / or combined funding; and some service providers provide transport where capacity exists.</p>  <p>  In general, day service users are in receipt of disability allowance and are automatically entitled to the Free Travel Pass.</p>  <p>  There are a range of transport supports available to persons with disabilities in the State, for example the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers scheme, operated by the Revenue Commissioners; the Free Travel Scheme operated by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection; and CL&Aacute;R funding, approved by the Minister for Rural and Community Development, to voluntary organisations providing transport for people with significant mobility issues. </p>  <p>  Under the National Disability Inclusion Strategy 2017 - 2021, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has responsibility for the continued development of accessibility and availability of accessible public transport.  Action 104 of the National Disability Inclusion Strategy contains a commitment to review all Government-funded transport and mobility supports, and to develop proposals for better coordination in this space going forward, and as such a Transport Working Group has been established under the NDIS. The Action 104 Transport Working Group is co-ordinated by the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. </p>  <p>  The outcomes of the work being progressed by the Action 104 Transport Working Group will provide a valuable evidence base for future policy development, which will progressed through appropriate structures going forward, including the successor strategy to the National Disability Inclusion Strategy.</p></reply>

In the coming weeks, the HSE will be adopting a more targeted approach for COVID-19 testing which will be based on a clinical assessment where a clinician requires the result to contribute to the diagnosis and management of an individual patient, or where deemed necessary by Public Health in relation to the management of an outbreak or specific public health risk. </p><p>The approach to COVID-19 testing is facilitated by the high level of vaccine-induced and naturally acquired population immunity in Ireland. This is mitigating against the worst impacts of infection. </p><p>The HSE is also enhancing existing infectious disease surveillance systems so that we can ensure effective monitoring and signalling of what is happening with the virus at population level, and so that we can understand disease transmission and severity along with population immunity and risk.</p><p>The pandemic is not over and COVID-19 is still a concern so testing remains an important part of our ongoing response to the disease for individuals vulnerable to its effects and for whom testing is indicated. For everybody, continuing to follow our public health advice available on hse.ie is still important. Anybody who has symptoms of COVID-19 should self-isolate until 48 hours after the symptoms are mostly or fully gone. </p><p>Anybody who has concerns about an underlying condition or their level of risk in relation to COVID-19 is advised to seek advice from their GP or treating clinician.</p><p>My Department, the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) and the National Virus Reference Laboratory (NVRL), overseen by the interim Chief Medical Officer, continue to review the COVID-19 epidemiological situation in Ireland and internationally. This includes the on-going close monitoring of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants and assessment of any potential threat to population health.</p></reply>

The Department of Health&rsquo;s Disability Consultative Committee meets generally three to four times a year. The Health Service Executive holds regular meetings with disability representatives through its Disability Consultative Forum. These meetings are an opportunity to hear from disability representatives on their priorities for services. </p>  <p>  These fora are an integral part of a wider consultative process with disability stakeholders which oversees and monitors the implementation of the National Disability Inclusion Strategy, including the Department of Health&rsquo;s commitments under that strategy.</p>  <p>  The National Disability Inclusion Strategy Steering Committee, comprising disability representatives from the Disability Stakeholder group and departmental officials meet around three times a year. The National Disability Inclusion Strategy in turn was developed following three separate phases of consultation with disability stakeholders.</p>  <p>  Direct submissions were also sought from disability representative organisations during the consultation on the Disability Action Plan. Overall, 15 detailed submissions were received, many from disability representative organisations. </p>  <p>  The Department also engages with a variety of advocacy, umbrella and representative organisations as appropriate through meetings, conferences and other fora. It would not be possible to provide an exhaustive list of organisations with whom the Department and HSE engages, as formal and informal consultation is ongoing. </p>  <p>  Disability Service providers are engaged with on a continuous basis by both the Department and the HSE largely pertaining to matters related to service provision and operations. </p>  <p>  The Government welcomes the widespread engagement of disability representative organisations in ongoing discussion of policy and resource matters through channels including those listed above, which ensure the voice of people with disabilities is heard in matters affecting them.</p></reply>

Diabetes is one of the Long Term Illness (LTI) conditions for which eligible LTI persons can access their medicines to treat their diabetes free of charge.</p><p>Controls are in place within the Primary Care Reimbursement Service scheme management systems (and are put in place and updated as required) on claiming processes to ensure that only HSE approved indications are reimbursed across a range of medicines.

The rate of assessment for rental properties will be reduced from 80% to 40% for income from all principal residences. This will be reviewed after six months of operation, with the potential for further amendment after that point. This policy change addresses the commitments made under Housing for All Action 19.8.</p>  <p>  The change was made through Committee-Stage amendment to the Regulation of Providers of Building Works and Building Control (Amendment) Bill 2022. The Bill was approved by the Oireachtas on 30th June and signed into law by President Higgins in July. The necessary administrative and operational changes are currently being made. Once these are in place, the amendments will be commenced imminently.</p></reply>

Prices paid to farmers or charged to consumers are not controlled by Government and are, obviously, subject to market demands. </p><p>It is, critically important that operators along the supply chain recognise their mutual dependency. Farmers are small businesses and are vulnerable to price volatility. They need to make a reasonable economic return for  their output if the supply of high quality pigmeat and poultry is to be maintained. </p><p>It is critically important that farm families and food producers are treated fairly. The establishment of the Office for Fairness and Transparency in the Agri-Food Supply Chain is one of my priorities as Minister, and I am confident it will be an advocate and provide a voice for farmers, fishers, growers and other food businesses all along the agricultural and food supply chain. </p><p>I am pleased to have announced this week that the recruitment process for the CEO of the new Office has begun.

The policy recognises the opportunity for rural rejuvenation that remote working presents and commits to establishing a comprehensive and integrated national network of 400 remote working hubs by 2025.</p><p>In furtherance of this commitment, my Department&rsquo;s focus to date has been on strategically developing the National Hub Network, the Network's shared online booking platform connectedhubs.ie, adding capacity to Ireland's existing remote working infrastructure, and supporting the establishment of new hubs.</p><p>There are currently 290 remote and co-working facilities across the country on-boarded to the connectedhubs.ie platform. This number is growing all the time meaning we are well on track to meet our target of 400 remote working hubs nationwide by 2025.</p><p>Over &euro;100m has been invested by my department in the development of remote working facilities through programmes such as the Town and Village Renewal Scheme and the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund. Successful projects are developed in collaboration with local authorities and communities with many projects seeing vacant and derelict buildings in rural towns and villages converted into remote working hubs.</p><p>On 8 June, I announced that 81 projects across the country were successful in securing funding via the Connected Hubs Call 2022, allocating &euro;5 million in funding to add additional capacity to the existing remote working infrastructure in remote working hubs and Broadband Connection Points throughout the country. This follows the award of almost &euro;9 million under the Connected Hubs Call in 2021.</p><p>In addition to the National Hub Network, my department is working closely with officials at the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications (DECC) to establish the nationwide network of Broadband Connection Points (BCPs).</p><p>BCPs are publicly accessible facilities, typically community centres and sports clubs, in predominantly rural and isolated areas. These facilities offer onsite internet access for a variety of community uses, including skills training and STEM activities for children and young people, eHealth initiatives and remote working. To date 282 of 300 sites are live, with the remainder scheduled for completion this year.</p><p>To date my focus has been on establishing the National Hub Network and the BCP network and on achieving the initial critical mass. Following strong progress on the establishment phase of both projects, my focus has now shifted to the next stage of development. To this end, my officials have been consulting with hub managers across the country, with local authorities and communities, and with other stakeholders, to better inform the future strategic direction of the National Hub Network, the connectedhubs.ie platform and the BCP program.</p></reply>

The LIS supports the improvement of rural roads and laneways that are not normally maintained by local authorities. The scheme makes an important contribution to connectivity in rural Ireland. </p><p>The Scheme was reintroduced in 2017 following a number of years with no dedicated funding. From 2017 to 2021, improvement works have been completed on over 3,000 non-public roads and lanes benefiting over 13,300 landowners and residents in these rural areas. </p><p>Since the LIS was reintroduced in 2017 the aggregate investment has now surpassed &euro;100 million.</p><p>In 2022, the base funding for the Scheme was increased from &euro;10.5 million to &euro;11 million. I announced details of the first round of funding under LIS in April, which included &euro;716,560 allocated to Donegal County Council. </p><p>To address demand, and following the identification of savings in other capital areas, I was delighted to be in a position to double the overall provision for the Scheme to &euro;22 million this August. As a result, the initial funding of &euro;716,560 allocated to Donegal was increased to some &euro;1.71 million. This brings the total allocated to County Donegal since 2017 to just under &euro;9.43 million, the largest allocation to any county since the scheme was reintroduced. </p><p>As part of Budget 2023, I was pleased to announce a further increase in the base funding from &euro;11 million to &euro;12 million. </p><p>Set out in the table below is the funding allocation and the associated number of LIS roads upgraded in Donegal under the Scheme over the period 2017 to 2021. <table>    <tr>       <th>YEAR</th>       <th>FUNDING</th>       <th>NO.

These efforts are led by our internal Green, Energy and Organisational (GEO) Committee, which oversees a number of initiatives to promote recycling and ensure energy conservation and environmental sustainability as part of our work.</p><p>In terms of our offices in Trinity Point, Dublin 2 and Government Buildings in Ballina, our waste collection procedures require waste streams to be segregated and placed in designated bins, such as general waste, paper, plastic, aluminium/steel/tin, compost, glass, toners, batteries etc.</p><p>In terms of ICT hardware, my Department seeks to fully utilise all our computer hardware until it has reached end of life, subject to value for money assessments, with a view to reducing our consumption of resources in this area.  However, my Department also has recycling arrangements in place for ICT hardware once end of life is realised. </p></reply>
