I have been informed by Fingal County Council that the assessment of options will be followed by extensive public consultation, and environmental assessment and consent processes, which are likely to take several months to conclude.  The Council has confirmed that it is probable, therefore, that the study, and the associated approved plan for the peninsula, will take at least until the middle of 2020 to complete.</p>  <p>  My Office continues to co-operate and assist Fingal County Council and accordingly my officials met with Fingal County Council and their consultants on 5  November 2019 to receive an update on the progress of the study. </p>  <p>  If a viable option is identified, the Council may submit a further application for funding to the OPW or other Government Departments as appropriate.</p></reply>

Further technical guidance building upon these central elements will follow in 2020. </p>  <p>  In the context of updating the Public Spending Code, my Department has given consideration to the potential benefits of more structured scrutiny of major public investment projects, focusing in particular on the robustness of planned delivery, accuracy of cost forecasts, and consideration of risk.  My Department is developing a new governance and assurance process for major projects with an estimated cost of over &euro;100 million. This new process is being informed by international best practice and will involve consultation with all major public sector stakeholders. It is likely to involve an independent external review of major projects at key stages, drawing from international best practice approaches, and the modalities of such an approach in an Irish context are currently receiving careful attention. The detail of the process and arrangements for implementation will be scoped and developed with a target operational date of mid-2020.</p></reply>

The development of digital services and eGovernment is particularly important in this regard, as well as making better use of data and sharing data more effectively between organisations.</p><p><b>Innovating for Our Future</b>targets the development of innovative, robust and joined-up strategies and policies related to the delivery of public services, as well as promoting a culture of evaluation. </p><p><b>Developing Our People and Organisations</b>seeks to improve human resources by focusing on sharing best practice and experience in areas such as strategic human resource management, workforce planning, employee engagement, public service culture and values, and equality, diversity and inclusion. </p><p>Information and up-dates on the full range of OPS2020 activities can also be accessed at the website OPS2020.gov.ie. </p><p>Reform is underway in organisations right across the Civil and Public service.  My Department&rsquo;s People Strategy for the Civil Service 2017-2020 sets strategic direction for Human Resource Management across the Civil Service (while recognising that each organisation is unique and has its own challenges) while the Department&rsquo;s Office of the Government Chief Information Officer leads the implementation of the Public Service ICT Strategy in cooperation with departments and agencies across the Public Service.</p><p>We understand that the Civil Service of the future will necessarily be different in terms of its skills mix, use of technology and geographical footprint, and so we are now seeking to develop a longer-term vision and strategy to succeed the current Civil Service Renewal Plan, which has already allowed us to mark significant progress.  </p><p>Some of the areas that we are now pursuing for the next stage of Civil Service Renewal are: </p><p>- Building our capability in policy analysis and investing in analytic and data analytic capability for the future; </p><p>- Creating a culture of innovation across the Civil Service;  </p><p>- Reviewing the structure of the Civil Service so that we can be more agile and responsive;</p><p>- Setting out our ambition for digital transformation; </p><p>- Building our data infrastructure;  </p><p>- Building the Civil Service workforce of the future; </p><p>- Maintaining a robust Civil Service institution in Ireland in the face of the increasing threats to democracy and truth across the globe.</p><p>- Reviewing our Civil Service culture and building for the 21st century; and</p><p>- Moving to the next generation of shared services.</p><p>In today's world, we can never stand still and so the Government continues to drive and support significant reform and innovation across the Civil and Public Service.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-11-14a.26.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019111400048#WRA01900"><p>This issue relates to a claim by community employment supervisors and assistant supervisors who have been seeking, through their union representatives, the allocation of Exchequer funding to implement a 2008 Labour Court recommendation relating to the provision of a pension scheme.</p>  <p>  The matter was the subject of extensive discussion at the Community Sector High Level Forum which was reconvened to examine certain issues pertaining to the Community Employment sector and in particular to ensure that the matter was fully examined having regard to both costs and precedent in the context of the wider Community and Voluntary sector.  </p>  <p>  The membership of this Forum includes public service management and union representatives. It will be appreciated that the implications arising from this claim extend well beyond the CE Supervisors and Assistant Supervisors cadre and impact across the entire Community and Voluntary sector. It is accordingly appropriate that the wider sector implications should be fully taken into account in considering the cost implications arising from this  issue.</p>  <p>  Taking this important consideration into account it is accordingly the position that a  detailed scoping exercise was carried out by my Department in 2017 in order to comprehensively examine and assess the full potential implications of the issues involved.</p>  <p>  The scoping exercise clearly illustrated that this matter presents very significant issues for the Exchequer, with a potential cost exposure for the State of between &euro;188 million per annum and &euro;347m depending on the size of the sector which is difficult to ascertain, were consequential demands to be made to fund employer pension contributions for all similar State funded Community and Voluntary organisations whose employees are in a similar position to the Community Employment scheme supervisors.  This excludes any provision for immediate ex-gratia lump sum payment of pension for those imminently retiring, as sought, which could, depending on the size of the sector, give rise to a further Exchequer cost exposure of up to &euro;318 million.</p>  <p>  To fund an employer pension contribution for CE Supervisors and Assistant Supervisors alone would cost the State an estimated &euro;6m per annum, excluding any provision for immediate ex-gratia lump sum payments, estimated at a further &euro;19.2m before administration/implementation costs. </p>  <p>  While CE supervisors and assistant supervisors represent only a very small part of the wider community and voluntary sector, any explicit provision of State funding for such a scheme in respect of those employees would inevitably give rise to claims for similar schemes and funding provision on the part of those  many thousands of workers in the broader sector.  My Department has to have regard to the full potential Exchequer exposure associated with setting such a precedent.</p>  <p>  It continues to be the position that state organisations are not the employer of the particular employees concerned and accordingly it is not for the State to provide funding for occupational pension scheme provision.</p></reply>

This is a national scheme of humanitarian assistance, targeting aid at those worst affected properties, for which there are no alternative feasible measures. </p><p>The Scheme specifies that a homeowner had to meet a number of conditions to be eligible for assistance under the Scheme, including:</p><p>That floodwater entered and damaged the building during or as a result of flooding during relevant dates such as to render it uninhabitable.</p><p>That the property was the homeowner&rsquo;s primary residence at the time of the floods.</p><p>That the affected property must have a significant probability of the recurrence of the flood depth, duration or frequency on a scale that could cause further serious and similar damage to the home.</p><p>That the property is not due to or may not benefit from a planned or possible future major, minor or individual flood defence scheme.</p><p>That the property may not be protected adequately from being flooded in the future, at an economically feasible cost, through other flood mitigation works including minor works, individual property protection or other possible measures that can be considered at this time.</p><p>That the homeowner is unable to obtain flood risk insurance.</p><p>The OPW has been working in partnership with the relevant Local Authorities to undertake comprehensive assessments of 169 properties. An important element of the administrative arrangements for this scheme is an option for remedial works where a viable engineering solution is possible or known to protect homes from future flooding.  To date, engineering solutions have been identified to protect some homes from future flooding and work is continuing to explore possible engineering solutions for a further 35 homes.</p><p>Where an engineering solution is not feasible, and informed by a site inspection and a recommendation by a Relocation Committee, the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland do make financial assistance, equivalent to the cost to the relevant local authority, on a like for like basis.</p><p>It is estimated that &euro;0.5m will be expended on the Scheme in 2019, with a further &euro;9.5m over 2020 and 2021.</p></reply>

Under this framework, proposals to implement environmental considerations in public procurement are being developed through the Social Considerations Advisory Group which is chaired by the Office of Government Procurement (OGP). </p>  <p>  Circular 20/2019: Promoting the use of Environmental and Social Considerations in Public Procurement was published in October. The circular, an action under the Government&rsquo;s Climate Action Plan, was developed by the OGP in conjunction with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment (DCCAE). The circular directs Government Departments and Agencies to consider including environmental criteria in their procurements, where such clearly defined, quantifiable, verifiable and measurable criteria have been developed. These criteria should, if they are relevant to that procurement, be met within a Department&rsquo;s existing budget without impacting on service delivery.</p>  <p>  An overarching objective of all public procurement is the achievement of value for money. In implementing environmental considerations in public procurement, it is crucial that an approach is adopted that will further Government policy while also ensuring a competitive market place where suppliers can compete resulting in the desired pricing outcome.  In areas where the market is not yet sufficiently competitive, a phased approach to environmental considerations in public procurement may be necessary to encourage the emergence of new suppliers with innovative solutions. Care should also be taken to ensure that the addition of environmental considerations to public contracts is done in a manner that does not mitigate against small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) as they may not be in a position to bear the additional costs or administrative burden.</p>  <p>  The public service must demonstrate its commitment to sustainable development and use its influence to persuade others of the changes required to reduce our impact on the environment. By providing leadership in terms of environmental considerations in public procurement, public bodies can underpin the credibility of national environmental policy objectives and enhance Ireland&rsquo;s image as a 'green' economy.</p></reply>

Two notable examples are the establishment of a centralised Office of Government Procurement with responsibility (together with the key sectors of Health, Defence, Education and Local Government) for sourcing goods and services on behalf of the Public Service, and the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer, established to lead the implementation of the Public Service ICT Strategy, in cooperation with departments and agencies across the Public Service. </p>  <p>  Let me assure the Deputy that the reform agenda continues to be an integral part of this Government&rsquo;s economic strategy to improve outcomes for the public on a value-for-money basis and we are now developing further ambitious proposals for the reform agenda in 2020 and beyond.</p>  <p>  The current framework for public service reform and innovation, Our Public Service 2020 (OPS 2020), builds on earlier reforms while expanding their scope to focus on delivering better services for our customers and building innovative and responsive public sector organisations that are resilient and agile.  </p>  <p>  Our Public Service 2020 has a particular focus on evaluation and on the importance of building a reform evaluation culture and in developing indicators to support an outcomes focus. With this goal in mind, a Reform Evaluation Unit has been established within my Department to focus on monitoring and evaluating the outcomes of reform as well as create greater links between expenditure and reform.</p>  <p>  Looking beyond 2020, the Civil Service of the future will necessarily be different in terms of its skills mix, use of technology and geographical footprint, and so we are now seeking to develop a longer-term vision and strategy to succeed the current Civil Service Renewal Plan, which has already allowed us to make significant progress.  </p>  <p>  The areas that we are pursuing for the next stage of Civil Service Renewal that will particularly support prudent expenditure and value for money in the both the Civil and Public Services include: </p>  <p>  - Building our capability in  policy analysis and investing in analytic and data analytic capability for the future; </p>  <p>  - Creating a culture of innovation across the Civil Service;  </p>  <p>  - Setting out our ambition for digital transformation; </p>  <p>  - Building our data infrastructure;  and</p>  <p>  - Moving to the next generation of shared services.</p>  <p>  As Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, I must ensure that our fiscal and public expenditure policy is sustainable and that Public Sector policy continues to facilitate good economic performance in the future. There are a number of budgetary reforms introduced in recent years to guide my decisions on overall fiscal policy in this regard, including fiscal rules, expenditure ceilings and spending reviews. </p>  <p>  The actions in Our Public Service 2020 and the proposals now in development for future reform will help ensure that the focus of the public service continues, both in 2020 and beyond, to be on delivery of quality public services thereby supporting and enhancing our country's overall economic performance.</p></reply>

Funding for coastal erosion risk management studies may also be applied for under this scheme. Funding of up to 90% of the cost is available for projects which meet the eligibility criteria including a requirement that the proposed measures are cost beneficial. The OPW has published guidelines for coastal erosion risk management measures and funding applications under the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme, available on the OPW website.</p>  <p>  I am advised that OPW has not received an application under this scheme for the area mentioned in the Deputy&rsquo;s question, but I understand works in this area are being addressed by a project commissioned directly by Irish Rail.</p>  <p>  I am further advised that a detailed study commissioned by Wexford County Council, which fully investigated the problem of coastal erosion and flood risk at Rosslare Strand, is nearing completion.  This study examined the full range of management options to address the issue, and a submission based on the completed study findings will be made shortly by the Council to the OPW in relation to coastal protection proposals for the Rosslare Strand area.</p></reply>

PAS has also had a stand at some targeted recruitment fairs, including one organised by the Central Bank targeting people living in north east inner city Dublin.  </p>  <p>  As part of its commitment to diversity and inclusion, a Diversity and Inclusion Lead was appointed to the Public Appointments Service in April 2019 to develop a Diversity and Inclusion Strategy and lead a team in the support of this aim.  This strategy is under development following a rigorous and extensive consultation process with representative groups pertaining to ethnic minorities, people with disabilities and other interests from civil society.  This included representatives from the Immigrant Council of Ireland, National Disability Authority, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, the Irish Refugee Council, Pavee Point, Rehab, Ahead, Dyslexia Ireland, Wheel, St. Stephens Green Trust, the Higher Education Authority, Pobal, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Property Registration Authority of Ireland, WALK, Empowering People in Care, Irish Prison Service, Ruhama, the Women's Council, the Arts Council, Science Foundation Ireland, the Central Bank, Government Departments and county councils. </p>  <p>  The Diversity and Inclusion Strategy aligns with the Civil Service Renewal Plan and the People Strategy for the Civil Service (2017 &ndash; 2020) which seek to achieve greater diversity and build a Civil Service that reflects the society in which it works and the communities it serves.  It also takes account of national strategies such as the Migrant Integration Strategy, the National Traveller and Roma Integration Strategy, the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities and others.</p></reply>

A key element of such a mandate will be using public procurement to deliver change. This circular demonstrates the Government&rsquo;s priority in promoting Green Public Procurement by asking Departments and Offices to consider the inclusion of green criteria in their procurements in the context of its wider commitments under the Climate Action Plan. </p><p>The Office of Government Procurement (OGP) and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment have been working collaboratively on developing this initiative. The procurement of goods and services by Government departments and bodies, in line with the Government&rsquo;s own policies, will underpin the credibility of the national policy objectives themselves and enhance Ireland&rsquo;s image as a green economy.  </p><p>Green public procurement (GPP) is about leveraging the State&rsquo;s purchasing power to choose more environmentally friendly goods, services and works and help contribute to more sustainable consumption and production.  It has a key role to play in the EU's efforts to become a more resource-efficient economy. To be effective, GPP requires the inclusion of clear and verifiable environmental criteria for products and services in the public procurement process. </p><p>The circular highlights the Government's priority in promoting green public procurement in the context of the wider commitments under the Climate Action Plan.  The circular instructs Departments/Offices to consider the inclusion of green criteria in their procurements.  The Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment is developing this criteria which will support the effective implementation of this initiative.  There will be a phased introduction of green criteria across Government and Public Sectors targeting priority products and services as well as building appropriate green criteria into OGP frameworks as they arise and providing support and guidance to procurers. </p><p><b>Social Considerations Advisory Group</b></p><p>The Social Considerations Advisory Group was established earlier this year and had its inaugural meeting in March. Managed and chaired by OGP, the group&rsquo;s membership is drawn from across Government departments and OGP&rsquo;s sector partners in Education, Health, Local Government and Defence. </p><p>The purpose of the group is to promote and facilitate the incorporation of social considerations (which include environmental considerations) into public procurement projects. The group meets quarterly and has met three times to date. The group is currently considering what social policy objectives could be advanced through public procurement, matching these with suitable procurement opportunities, which could be trialled on a pilot basis. This approach will ensure a consistent and co-ordinated approach to the incorporation of social considerations into public procurement procedures.</p><p><b>Information Note on Incorporating Social Considerations</b></p><p>The Office of Government Procurement (OGP) is keen to explore the opportunity for the inclusion of social considerations in public contracts where they are suited to the objective of the contract and would have the greatest impact. In this regard, in December 2018, it published an Information Note on Social Considerations. </p><p>The purpose of the note is to help policy makers and practitioners understand how procurement can be used to facilitate the advancement of existing social policy objectives as well as the wider context and implications of including them in particular procurement projects. It sets out the &lsquo;how&rsquo; in procurement process but the &lsquo;what&rsquo; is a matter for policy Departments. </p><p>The range of policy areas which come under the heading of social considerations is wide and includes, for example, environmental sustainability, disability access, training for young or disadvantaged people, labour standards etc. </p><p>OGP, as a central purchasing body, cannot decide for other contracting authorities or at a whole-of-Government level what social considerations should be included in the frameworks and contracts that it puts in place on their behalf. However, it can help facilitate the process of incorporating those objectives, once agreed, into planned procurement projects.</p></reply>

I also announced that this measure will raise &euro;90 million in 2020, all of which will be ring-fenced to fund new climate action measures. </p>  <p>  Details of the specific measures to receive funding were published on Budget Day. These are increases that would not have taken place in the absence of an increase to the carbon tax and the increased funding is additional to that provided for in the National Development Plan.</p>  <p>  Further detail on the measures receiving this funding will be detailed in a table in the Revised Estimates Volume for Public Services 2020. This will be published in December 2019. The Revised Estimates Volume is referred to the Oireachtas on an annual basis and is approved by the various D&aacute;il Select Committees responsible for each vote, ensuring that there is democratic oversight on the use of Exchequer funds. </p>  <p>  Approval of the Revised Estimates Volume requires Departments to use the funding allocated for the specific purpose of its allocation. This will also be confirmed in the capital sanction that each Department will receive in 2020.  In the event of any underspend of these carbon tax proceeds in 2020, the remaining balance will be given priority over other Departmental savings for the purposes of capital carryover arrangements in 2020, so that they can be allocated to future climate-related expenditure.  Collectively, these arrangements guarantee that all funds raised by the carbon tax increase in 2020 will go towards expenditure on climate action measures as committed to in Budget 2020.</p></reply>

Supplementary Estimates are an important element of our expenditure management toolkit, allowing for the proper alignment of resources with allocations.</p><p>Expenditure Report 2020 outlined the requirement for Supplementary Estimates for a number of Votes in 2019, as a result of policy decisions - including in relation to the provision of a 100 per cent Christmas Bonus - and expenditure pressures, in particular in the Health sector. At that point, it was estimated that the aggregate amount required for Supplementary Estimates would be approximately &euro;660 million.  </p><p>At this week&rsquo;s Government meeting, eleven Supplementary Estimates were agreed. With the agreement of the Business Committee it is proposed that these Supplementary Estimates will be presented to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann next week for referral to the relevant Committees before returning to the D&aacute;il to be voted on in December. Of these, eight are substantive Supplementary Estimates, relating to:</p><p>- Vote 6 &ndash; Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office;</p><p>- Vote 7 &ndash; Finance;</p><p>- Vote 20 &ndash; Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na;</p><p>- Vote 24 &ndash; Justice and Equality;</p><p>- Vote 31 &ndash; Transport, Tourism and Sport;</p><p>- Vote 35 &ndash; Army Pensions;</p><p>- Vote 37 &ndash; Employment Affairs and Social Protection; and</p><p>- Vote 40 &ndash; Children and Youth Affairs.</p><p>The remaining three are technical Supplementary Estimates, relating to:</p><p>- Vote 28 &ndash; Foreign Affairs and Trade</p><p>- Vote 29 &ndash; Communications, Climate Action and Environment; and</p><p>- Vote 32 &ndash; Business, Enterprise and Innovation.</p><p>The total amount being sought in these Supplementary Estimates is &euro;204 million. </p><p>The Expenditure Report outlined that there would be a requirement for Supplementary Estimates in Health, Education and to fund Brexit-related expenditure to ensure that the relevant authorities would be in a position to carry out necessary compliance checks at the ports and Dublin Airport. The aggregate amount outlined in the Expenditure Report across these three headings was &euro;450 million. It is planned to seek Government agreement for presentation of these Supplementary Estimates next week when the amounts required are finalised. In addition, any further Supplementary Estimates of a minor or technical nature would also be finalised for next week.</p><p>Although the risk of a disorderly Brexit in 2019 has receded, considerable uncertainty still remains as regards the final outcome.  Consequently, the Budget 2020 underlying assumption of a No Deal Brexit ensures the Government has the necessary resources at its disposal to meet the impact of this exceptional challenge, whilst preserving the longer-term sustainability of the public finances. This would allow the sectors and regions most effected by a disorderly Brexit to be supported through timely, temporary and targeted support measures. The contingency funding outlined in Budget 2020, which would need to be borrowed, would only be made available in the event of a No Deal Brexit and would be provided if required in 2020 either by way of Further Revised Estimate or Supplementary Estimate.</p></reply>

A new public procurement model was established that resulted in a shift to a new more-centralised model of procurement for government's goods and services spend. The Office of Government Procurement (OGP) commenced operations in 2014 and, since then, has made significant progress in driving value-for-money, enabling compliance, promoting business participation, increasing communication and guidance, professionalising the service and promoting transparency.  Results from an independent survey of Government Departments and public bodies in 2018 recorded a high level of satisfaction with the services of the OGP.</p><p>Earlier this year, I wrote to Government Ministers asking for their views on the implementation of the procurement reform programme, in relation to good governance and compliance, and for their recommendations to refine the reform programme, based on the lessons learned to date. This review is in line with the commitments in the Programme for Government and the Ministers and Secretaries Act.  </p><p>Views of Government Ministers and their Departments, including bodies under the aegis, were sought on:</p><p>- Progress on the implementation of the procurement reform programme </p><p>- The experience of using central procurement arrangements put in place by the OGP and the Local Government, Defence, Health and Education sectors (framework agreements)</p><p>- Whether the central arrangements are meeting the Department&rsquo;s procurement requirements</p><p>- The steps taken to promote good governance in relation to public procurement and eliminate bad practices </p><p>- Suggestions for improving and refining the public procurement model.</p><p>This review has also involved consultation with opposition spokespersons on procurement and members of the SME Advisory Group including industry representative bodies.  Responses are now being considered.</p><p>A full list of all the OGP Frameworks currently in place is available on the OGP website .</p></reply>

The overarching purpose of the Group is to monitor and oversee the effective control of Health expenditure and staffing in line with the Budget allocation and to act as an early warning mechanism for any deviations.  It also helps develop an understanding of the trends in health expenditure and the factors driving it which in turn help to inform budget-related and on-going policy discussions. </p>  <p>  Under its National Service Plan, the HSE identified &euro;499.9m of savings measures to be achieved during the course of 2019. The HSE produces monthly &lsquo;Savings Measures&rsquo; reports, which provide an update on the HSE&rsquo;s Savings Measures Implementation Plan. These reports outline actual savings in the year to date, and compare them to a monthly savings profile, based on the total amount of savings deemed achievable by the HSE. These reports are shared with members of the Health Budget Oversight Group, which can examine and provide commentary on the savings performance.  The HSE are forecasting that by the end of 2019, &euro;312m of the NSP target of &euro;500m will have been achieved. This overall savings performance has contributed to an improved budgetary performance in 2019 within the Health sector, relative to the previous year, albeit the shortfall in the overall savings objective has contributed to the requirement for a supplementary estimate for the Health Vote in 2019.</p></reply>

Our new Embassy in Bogot&aacute; has been engaging on these issues in Colombia, including in La Guajira and has maintained regular contact with all relevant stakeholders in order to gain a greater understanding of the circumstances and issues that have been raised previously with regard to the Cerrej&oacute;n mine. </p>  <p>  I remain concerned at reports of the activities of the mine having a detrimental impact on the environment and on local communities. Taking into account security and other considerations, a visit by the Embassy to the Department of La Guajira, where the Cerrej&oacute;n mine is located, was possible in late September 2019. The visit took place on 23 and 24 September and was led by Ireland's Ambassador to Colombia, Ms Alison Milton. </p>  <p>  The programme included a tour of the mine itself, which was also attended by NGOs and local-community groups, as well as meetings with all stakeholders involved with the Cerrej&oacute;n mine, including Cerrej&oacute;n management, local communities, local government, religious leaders, academics and NGOs, including the local human rights group Fuerzas Mujeres Wayuu. </p>  <p>  The La Guajira region has a near-majority indigenous population (over 40% compared to 3.4% nationally), the largest of which is the Wayuu people, who number around 270,000 and for whom the exploitation of La Guajira&rsquo;s natural resources is a major grievance as they maintain a deep spiritual and ancestral connection to the land. It is also one of Colombia&rsquo;s poorest regions, where the needs of local communities are acute. </p>  <p>  The mine generates almost half of the region&rsquo;s income and is one of its largest employers providing over 13,000 jobs. While the mine owners attest to their compliance with local and international standards, challenges exist in relation to local governance, leading to a lack of trust between the local authorities, local communities and the mine. </p>  <p>  The Embassy has reported on the range and complexity of issues, not least evolving public opinion in relation to the extraction and consumption of fossil fuels, and concluded that efforts should be made to improve communication between the local communities and the mine, and to include the local community in plans for closure of the mine by 2033. </p>  <p>  The Embassy will hold meetings with national Government, with national and international NGO partners, and with Cerrej&oacute;n management in order to share feedback on the visit. Some of these meetings have already taken place. </p>  <p>  As I have indicated previously, I wrote to the ESB in September requesting further information regarding the ESB's sourcing of coal from Cerrej&oacute;n. I received a response in October in which the ESB outlined a recent assessment of the mine carried out by Bettercoal. </p>  <p>  Bettercoal is an organisation established by major coal buyers to ensure coal is being sourced via responsible supply chains, which the ESB joined in 2014. This assessment indicates that the Cerrej&oacute;n mine's operating principles are essentially in line with the Bettercoal best practice code. Bettercoal has made a number of recommendations to Cerrej&oacute;n for improvement and increased compliance, on which the mine has been actively engaging. </p>  <p>  Addressing the risks of adverse impacts of business activities on human rights is a priority of this Government. Ireland is one of only 22 countries worldwide that has adopted a national action plan on Business and Human Rights to give effect to the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.  </p>  <p>  Since its launch at the end of 2017, my Department has implemented a number of key commitments including the establishment of the Business and Human Rights Implementation Group, to oversee progress on delivery of the Plan and the completion of an independent baseline assessment of the current legislative and regulatory framework for business and human rights in Ireland.  Both the National Plan and the baseline assessment are available on the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade&rsquo;s website. Work is now proceeding on the formation of three sub-groups, each tasked with prioritising and delivering key actions under the three pillars of the UN Guiding Principles, namely, the State duty to protect, corporate responsibility to respect and access to remedy. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to monitor developments on this matter closely and to engage with all relevant stakeholders.</p></reply>

However, to date Revenue has not established that business models and contractual arrangements exist or are common in this sector that create the conditions for the generation of a systematic excess of flat-rate addition payments to farmers over their VAT input costs.  A flat-rate farmer involved in a business in which cattle are bought from other flat-rate farmers and reared for a further limited period before being supplied to a VAT registered business such as a beef processor would normally receive a flat-rate addition payment that exceeded his or her VAT input cost; however, the payment might not exceed the total VAT input costs associated with rearing the animal incurred by all the farmers involved in the process. It would be expected that the price paid to flat-rate famers supplying to another flat-rate farmer would take account of the flat-rate &lsquo;credit&rsquo; being transferred with the animal. I will however continue to monitor the beef sector and other agricultural sectors to ensure that the flat-rate addition scheme does not operate to give rise to overcompensation of farmers at the aggregate level for VAT on input costs. </p>  <p>  If the Deputy has information of particular contractual arrangements in the beef sector that could give rise to a systematic excess of flat-rate addition payments to farmers involved in beef production, he should provide it to Revenue.</p></reply>

It is also important to note that the Probate Office of the High Court deals with matters relating to probate and as such is the responsibility of the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p>  <p>  However, the Deputy may wish to note that under section 21 of the Credit Union Act 1997 (1997 Act) as amended, a credit union member may nominate a third party (e.g. a family member) to be the recipient upon the death of the member to the whole or part of the member&rsquo;s property that they have in the credit union at the time of their death.  </p>  <p>  The 1997 Act (as amended) imposes a statutory limit of &euro;23,000 on the amount that can be passed by way of a nomination. Thus, if at the date of the nominator's death the amount of the member&rsquo;s property in the credit union exceeds &euro;23,000, the credit union may only dispose any property up to the value of &euro;23,000. The effect of these provisions are that any nomination up to &euro;23,000 will pass outside the terms of any will. Any sum in excess of this will revert to and be an asset of the estate, which needs to be distributed under the terms of the will or the rules of succession where there is no will.</p>  <p>  Ordinarily the production of a grant of probate would be required to release funds from a bank account to the personal representative, irrespective of the amount. However, if a person dies leaving small amounts of money in a bank, the bank may agree to release the funds without the necessity for a grant of probate.</p>  <p>  While most applicants instruct a solicitor to process their application for a grant of probate, personal applications can also be made to the Probate Office of the High Court for a grant of probate.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that if an individual is not satisfied in any of their dealings with a financial services provider the individual may make a complaint to the provider&rsquo;s internal complaint resolution process. If they are not satisfied with the outcome of the complaint, they can then make a complaint to the independent Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman. Investigations by the Ombudsman are free of charge to the complainant. Further information on the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman can be found at www.fspo.ie.</p></reply>

As I am sure the Deputy will appreciate, this is a complex piece of legislation and the Bill's provisions must be constitutionally sound in the event of legal challenge.</p>  <p>  My Department and the Central Bank have been engaging in order to provide for the Individual Accountability Framework on the basis of sound principles so as to drive a better culture in the banking sector, and wider financial sector.  My officials will be engaging further with the Attorney General's Office in advance of submitting draft heads of Bill to Government so as to ensure that the correct balance between additional powers for the Central Bank and the protection of individuals' constitutional rights is struck.</p>  <p>  It remains my intention to bring forward draft heads of Bill to Government for approval before the end of the year and then to progress the Bill for debate in the Houses, including pre-legislative scrutiny.  This timetable is subject to other competing legislative priorities, including any Brexit-related matters that may arise.</p></reply>

This can be accessed at: .</p><p>These are increases that would not have taken place in the absence of an increase to the carbon tax and the increased funding is additional to that provided by the National Development Plan.  All funds are ring-fenced for these schemes only.

This guarantees that all funds raised by the carbon tax will go towards climate action.</p><p>I am satisfied that this approach will enable the continued ringfencing of additional carbon tax revenues to just transition and climate mitigation areas in future years.</p></reply>

However, it is important to bear in mind that each EFSI loan entered into by the State pre-commits funding for the repayment of such loans, and so has to be considered in the context of the expenditure benchmark under the EU's fiscal rules.</p><p>In general, Government Departments with project related responsibilities have existing relationships with the EIB. On this basis it has been a matter for each Department concerned to advance their projects in coordination with the Government's Capital Plan as coordinated by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. The Department of Finance has no role in assessing either public or private projects which may be the subject of applications for EFSI loans/guarantees.</p><p>I am happy to inform the Deputy that there is a publicly available list of projects which have been approved for EFSI support by the EIB in the State (). For convenience I am providing a spreadsheet prepared by the EIB which contains lists of signed, approved and pre-approved Irish projects for your convenience. </p><p>The EIB&rsquo;s website advises that there have been 33 transactions covering &euro;1.5bn of approved EFSI financing and &euro;7.1bn expected investment related to EFSI in Ireland since inception. As I mentioned in previous PQ responses on this topic, the Deputy should be aware that the EIB&rsquo;s EFSI Irish project list contains both private and public sector projects, and it also includes cross-border projects between Irish entities and entities in other Member States. On the other hand, the list may not reflect Irish private sector project promoters participating in a project that could receive funding from EFSI loans/guarantees but which is led or based in another EU Member State. <table>    <tr>       <th>Title</th>       <th>Country</th>       <th>EFSI financing</th>       <th>Total investment related to EFSI</th>       <th>Sector</th>       <th>Approval date</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Aerogen Investment Programme</td>       <td>Ireland</td>       <td>30.00m</td>       <td>63.17m</td>       <td>RDI</td>       <td>21/07/2017</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Amryt Pharma</td>       <td>Germany;

This amount might come from public or private sources, and it includes EFSI financing provided by the Bank.  Signed projects are listed with the actual amounts agreed in the contract, which may differ from the amounts initially authorised by the EIB Board of Directors.</p><p>Pre-Approvals: These are umbrella operations that have been approved under EFSI but which cannot be counted towards the EFSI objective until concrete sub-projects have been signed.</p></reply>

In light of this discussion, it called on the Presidency to submit a Negotiating Box with figures ahead of the European Council in December 2019.</p>  <p>  The October discussion largely reiterated the differences between Member States on the key issues. There was no narrowing of views on the overall level of expenditure, with a number of net contributors reiterating the need to keep the overall level at 1% of EU GNI, while there was strong push back from the net recipients on the Presidency proposals which they consider too low, they argue for an overall level of 1.11% of EU GNI. On the allocation of volumes between areas, net recipients expressed strong dissatisfaction regarding proposals on the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and Cohesion which they see as requiring further increases to the Commission&rsquo;s proposals, for Cohesion in particular. </p>  <p>  Given that Member States did not move beyond their traditional positions on the above, it is not possible to say who would be willing to increase contributions in order to fund CAP under a given scenario. A key element for consideration in the upcoming negotiations will be the nature of adjustments to the CAP, or any other policy area. For instance, all the cuts applied to CAP could be made up without any commensurate increase to contributions, if adjustments are made elsewhere in the MFF.</p>  <p>  For Ireland, the CAP remains the a key national priority for the negotiations. Expenditure in the area of agriculture helps support 44 million jobs across the EU, while contributing to European Added Value (EAV) through rural sustainability, food safety, animal welfare, and environmental standards. </p>  <p>  In relation to contributions, in his intervention at the October European Council, the Taoiseach noted that while Ireland&rsquo;s contribution is likely to increase significantly, we need to focus on the benefits and not just the costs of EU membership, including access to the Single Market which vastly outweighs EU Budget contributions. While Ireland has not yet finalised a view on the appropriate overall level of expenditure in the next MFF, we support the efforts of the Presidency to progress negotiations towards agreement and will continue to engage constructively.</p></reply>

Significant progress has been made in delivering this ambitious programme of reform. Achievements include:</p><p>-  The establishment of the Civil Service Management Board which has collective responsibility for the delivering the actions in the Civil Service Renewal Plan.</p><p>-  The development of a Common Governance Standard for the Civil Service.</p><p>-  Further implementation of the Shared Services Programme; the Public Service ICT Strategy and Government Communications Programme. </p><p>-  The Civil Service People Strategy was launched in October 2017, setting the strategic direction for Human Resource Management across the Civil Service while also recognising that each organisation is unique and has its own challenges.</p><p>-  Open recruitment competitions have been held for a wide range of general service, professional and technical grades.</p><p>-  A wide range of initiatives to improve gender balance across the Civil Service have been developed and are being implemented within Departments and Offices. These include an action plan to improve gender balance at senior levels.</p><p>-  OneLearning has been established to centrally operate and maintain the new Learning &amp;amp; Development (L&amp;amp;D) model and to manage the delivery the new common suite of L&amp;amp;D programmes.</p><p>-  Introduction of structured and transparent talent management programmes to develop future leaders.</p><p>-  A more effective and simplified performance management system (PMDS) has been delivered, including training for line managers to support and improve the management of performance.</p><p>-  A new scheme for recognising innovation and excellence across the Civil Service was introduced through the Civil Service Excellence and Innovation Awards. The awards celebrate the significant contributions that civil servants make to the Civil Service and recognise innovations in policy and service delivery across the Civil Service.</p><p>-  An approach to professionalisation has been agreed in the areas of HR, ICT and Finance, with most progress made in the HR and ICT areas.</p><p>-  A new Civil Service-wide mobility scheme has been introduced for Clerical Officers and Executive Officers which will be extended to other grades up to Assistant Principal level in due course.</p><p>-  A standardised project management approach has been introduced and supported with the establishment of a Project Managers&rsquo; Network and training from OneLearning.</p><p>-  A new system of Organisational Capability Reviews to assess and strengthen performance and capacity across Departments is being implemented</p><p>-  Guidelines and a handbook in relation to the transfer of functions has been published to assist in implementing Government Decisions to establish new Departments or restructuring of existing Departments.</p><p>-  Significant progress in relation to the development of a National Data Infrastructure.</p><p>-  Organisation of two Civil Service Employee Engagement Surveys to date which asks civil servants for their views on working in the Civil Service, focusing on areas such as employee engagement, well-being, coping with change and commitment to the organisation. Departments/Offices are tasked with responding to the challenging areas arising from the findings. </p><p>As I announced in Budget 2020, demographic changes and the next wave of technological change will place new demands on our key offices and Departments.  The Civil Service of the future will be different in terms of its skills mix, use of technology and geographical footprint.  We are therefore developing a longer term vision and strategy for the Civil Service which will be announced in due course.</p><p>Implementation of the wider public service reform programme, Our Public Service 2020, the framework for development and innovation for the public service to 2020 and beyond, is continuing.

Total gross expenditure will increase by 5 per cent to just over &euro;70 billion. After taking account of potential expenditure arising from the no-deal Brexit, expenditure in 2020 would rise to over &euro;71 billion. </p>  <p>   In 2020, core voted Government expenditure on the delivery of public services, excluding costs relating to the need to respond to a disorderly Brexit will be &euro;61.9 billion. Maintaining the approach of recent years, additional resources will be focused on incrementally improving the scope and availability of public services which will impact on all sectors and regions of the economy. Details of the services to be delivered by all Departments are set out in Part II of the Budget 2020 Expenditure Report.</p>  <p>  In relation to Capital expenditure, Project Ireland 2040 is the Government&rsquo;s long-term overarching strategy to make Ireland a better country for all of its people. The plan changes how infrastructure investment is made. Project Ireland 2040 supports business and communities across all of Ireland in realising their potential.</p>  <p>  Capital expenditure funding for 2020 represents a significant increase of almost &euro;800 million or 10.8% over the 2019 allocations.  This investment will be delivered in line with the National Planning Framework as part of Project Ireland 2040. Targeted and sustainable investment will enable ambitious growth in our regional cities which can complement the continuing importance of Dublin to the national economy.</p>  <p>  In order to safeguard this significant investment, a range of reforms have been put in place over the last number of years with the aim of focusing attention on achieving value for money. For example, the Performance Budgeting initiative seeks to shift focus away from simply looking at the quantum of spend towards examining what is being delivered through public expenditure. As part of this initiative, the third Public Service Performance Report was published earlier this year and provided outturn performance information for 2018 as well as trend data for the previous two years. My Department also finalised year three of the Spending Review process in 2019. The Spending Review aims to place evidence at the centre of policy development, through the examination of existing policies and programmes to assess their efficiency and effectiveness. This systematic examination of existing expenditure can support the re-allocation of funding to meet expenditure priorities.  </p>  <p>  Managing the delivery of public services within allocations is a key responsibility of each Minister and Department. There are important measures are in place to ensure that our budgetary targets are being met. My Department is in regular contact with all other Departments and offices to ensure that expenditure is being managed within the overall fiscal parameters and there is regular reporting to Government on expenditure levels. Expenditure profiles are published for each month and the drawdown of funds from the Exchequer is monitored throughout the year and reported on against profile on a monthly basis in the Exchequer Statement.</p></reply>

The National Strategy for Women and Girls 2017-2020 also contains a related commitment.  </p>  <p>  The elements that make equality budgeting work such as impact analysis and evaluation are important in any good budgetary process. Equality budgeting should not to be seen as something separate from the budget process; the intention is to embed equality perspectives across the whole-of-year budgetary process. A pilot programme of equality budgeting was introduced for the 2018 budgetary cycle, anchored in the existing performance budgeting framework. International experience has shown the importance of setting specific and measurable targets. This approach works well in terms of transparency around objectives and measuring progress. For the first cycle of equality budgeting, a number of diverse policy areas were selected with associated objectives and indicators published in the Revised Estimates Volume (REV) 2018. Progress towards achieving those targets was reported on in the Public Service Performance Report 2017.  </p>  <p>  Responsibility for proofing expenditure programmes, the selection of indicators, and making progress towards achieving the high level goals articulated is a matter for the individual spending Departments in the first instance. The role of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is to facilitate the initiative and provide support for Departments to fulfil the Programme for Government commitment. The Government&rsquo;s performance and equality budgeting programmes are solely concerned with public sector activities; they have no remit in the private sector.</p>  <p>  Following the achievements of the pilot programme, Equality Budgeting was expanded in 2019 to further develop the gender budgeting elements and to broaden its scope to other dimensions of equality including poverty, socioeconomic inequality and disability. In addition to the six equality objectives identified in the pilot (Phase 1), a further eight objectives were added for 2019 (Phase 2). This means nine Government Departments are now actively engaged with Equality Budgeting. An update in the Public Service Performance Report 2018 outlined progress in the pilot.</p>  <p>  To further guide the roll-out of equality budgeting, an Equality Budgeting Expert Advisory Group was established, holding its first meeting in September 2018. This group is comprised of a broad range of relevant stakeholders and policy experts to provide advice on the most effective way to advance equality budgeting policy and progress the initiative.</p>  <p>  My Department, in liaison with the Department of Justice and Equality, commissioned the OECD to undertake a Policy Scan of Equality Budgeting in Ireland. This was published on October 8th, in tandem with Budget 2020. The report reviews Ireland&rsquo;s equality budgeting programme and provides recommendations on its further development, in light of international experience. This ongoing process is further guided by the work of the Equality Budgeting Expert Advisory Group.  Once these recommendations have been fully considered by my Department, in conjunction with the Expert Group, I will outline future plans for Equality Budgeting.</p></reply>

This figure would, of course be offset by retirements and other people leaving the Civil Service.</p>  <p>  An open CO competition was advertised recently and an EO competition for posts outside Dublin was also advertised this year.

However, I can confirm that the Commission published their cohesion policy legislative package in May 2018 with an initial indicative allocation of Structural and Cohesion fund support for Ireland of approx.  &euro;1.088 bn for the period 2021-2027. It is important to bear in mind that this figure has not been finalised, and there is no breakdown on the final allocation of funding between the ERDF, European Social Fund+ (ESF+), and European Territorial Cooperation (ETC)/INTERREG programme. As in the present round of funding, Ireland is not eligible for Cohesion Funding in the next round as Gross National Income (GNI per inhabitant) in Ireland is more than 90% of the EU average. </p></reply>

I wish to advise the Deputy that the assessment process to determine the school&rsquo;s permanent accommodation needs is nearing completion. The provision of any additional accommodation on the site must be carefully planned considering the limitations of the site. A decision will be conveyed to the Patron as soon as the assessment process is completed.</p>  <p>  I also wish to advise that in order to meet the immediate accommodation needs of the school, interim accommodation has been approved. I can confirm the Patron is currently tendering for the interim accommodation approved and it is expected to have all interim accommodation in place for September 2020.</p>  <p>  In relation to school admissions, parents can choose which school to apply to and where the school has places available, the pupil should be admitted. However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available, a selection process may be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice. The Deputy will note however that the selection process procedures and enrolment policy are the responsibility of the individual school authorities.</p></reply>

In the 2018/2019 school year over 117,500 children, including over 13,000 children with special educational needs, were transported in over 5,000 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country covering over 100 million kilometres at a cost of over &euro;200m in 2018. </p><p>The 1975 Summary of Accounting Arrangements form the basis of the payment to Bus &Eacute;ireann for the operation of the School Transport Scheme. In this regard, the Department reimburses Bus &Eacute;ireann for a range of costs incurred in the operation and administration of the scheme.  Re-imbursement to Bus &Eacute;ireann is on a cost recovery basis and the Department does not pay any profit to Bus &Eacute;ireann relating to the School Transport Scheme.  Actual expenditure is finalised in the Bus &Eacute;ireann annual statement of account which is independently audited by the Bus &Eacute;ireann auditors in accordance with the 1975 <i>Summary of Accounting Arrangements</i>.  </p><p>With regard to maintenance, on an annual basis Bus &Eacute;ireann provides the Department with the projected cost of school transport services together with a provisional spread of payments.  These costs are broken down under the headings agreed in the 1975 arrangement which include maintenance costs. Bus &Eacute;ireann report the maintenance costs to the Department on a monthly basis as part of the monthly operational meetings.</p><p>The Comptroller and Auditor General (C&amp;amp;AG) carried out an examination of the provision of school transport and completed its report in August 2017, the C&amp;amp;AG Special Report 98.  The C&amp;amp;AG report referenced a surplus in the Transport Management Charge element of the costs. This amount was held by way of an uncommitted reserve by Bus &Eacute;ireann to be used solely for the purposes of the School Transport Scheme.  Any surplus was sealed in the school transport scheme and the uncommitted reserve was repaid fully to the Department in December 2018.</p><p>Since the publication of the C&amp;amp;AG report the Department has undertaken a review of the apportionment methodology utilised by Bus &Eacute;ireann for the School Transport Scheme. An independent expert was appointed to carry out a review of the apportionment methodology for the transport management charge that is paid by the Department to Bus &Eacute;ireann each year. This report was completed in March 2018 and has provided us with a detailed analysis and classification of costs incorporated into the transport Management Charge.</p></reply>

However, once an equivalent period of study has been completed on the new course, the student may be eligible for student grant assistance for the remainder of the course. </p><p>In addition, under Article 15(8) of the Student Grant Scheme 2019, the awarding authority SUSI (Student Universal Support Ireland) has discretion to award a grant for a repeat period of study in exceptional circumstances which impacted on a student completing a particular period of study or undertaking exams. SUSI treats each application for repeat funding on a case-by-case basis, and it is it is a matter for the individual student to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the awarding authority that there were exceptional circumstances.</p><p>Apart from the Student Grant Scheme, students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the third level institution attended.</p><p>Also, tax relief (at the standard rate of tax) may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education.

This includes responsibility for personnel matters and the distribution of personnel across the various Garda Divisions.  As Minister I have no direct role in these matters. </p>  <p>  I am assured however that Garda management keeps the distribution of these resources under continual review, to ensure their optimum use.</p>  <p>  I understand from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that it already employs a wide range of operational measures aimed at tackling public-order offences and anti-social behaviour. These measures are underpinned by the existence of a comprehensive legal framework, which assists the Garda&iacute; in tackling this type of crime, including provisions under:</p>  <p>  -  the Criminal Damage Act 1991;</p>  <p>  -  Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994;</p>  <p>  -  the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003; and </p>  <p>  -  the Intoxicating Liquor Acts 2003 and 2008.</p>  <p>  I understand from the Garda authorities that it is not proposed to establish a specialist or dedicated public transport policing unit and that effective local community policing can meet the policing needs of the rail network and its stakeholders. </p>  <p>  I am advised by Garda management that it engages extensively with transport operators and that a range of regional and local operations have been put in place to address incidents and issues that have arisen at specific locations.  I am further informed that there is ongoing communication between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the respective control centres, and access to good quality CCTV can provide assistance to Garda&iacute; when investigating serious incidents.</p>  <p>  In terms of safety on public transport generally, I am advised by the Garda authorities that Operation Twin Track is a Community Engagement &amp;amp; Rail Safety Policing Initiative conducted in partnership between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other Public Transportation stakeholders such as Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, DART Services, and Transdev [Luas]. The purpose of this is to provide High Visibility Policing of Rail and Light Rail transport within the DMR region and nationwide and to deliver crime prevention advice.</p>  <p>  I am informed that a multi-agency review was conducted to examine the effectiveness of this operation and that it is agreed that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to proactively engage with public transportation stakeholders and providers to conduct further similar operations.</p>  <p>  For its part, the Government remains committed to ensuring that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have all the necessary resources to tackle all forms of criminality in our communities.  A total budget of &euro;1.76 billion has been provided to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2019, increased to &euro;1.882 billion in 2020.  The provision of these additional resources and the ongoing Garda recruitment is a key component in this Government's approach to improving public safety throughout the country which will undoubtedly also benefit policing of transport services.</p></reply>

It also represents an alternative source of investment to venture capital funding. </p><p>The term &ldquo;Business Angels&rdquo; refers to high net worth individuals who invest on their own, or as part of a syndicate, in high growth businesses. In addition to capital, they often make their own skills, experience and contacts available to the company concerned to help it grow and develop. The individual amounts invested by Business Angels are usually in the range of &euro;25,000 to &euro;250,000, although syndicated deals (where a group of angels invest together) can be up to &euro;1m. </p><p>I understand there is no maximum limit set by ITI on an investment through the initiative, as this is a matter for the investor and the company to determine themselves. I am informed as well that those that invest in companies are not considered as &ldquo;participants&rdquo;, given that they engage directly with the firms on the nature of their investment. </p><p>The Network has achieved positive results.

Supports available included access to finance, management development, mentoring supports, business development programmes, marketing supports and trade promotion. </p>  <p>  I want to ensure that all our indigenous enterprises have the correct supports available to assist their development into sustainable businesses for future growth.</p>  <p>  That is why in the 2019 Budget I allocated an additional &euro;3m to Enterprise Ireland and &euro;5m to the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs).  This extra funding assists our Agencies to reach more of our entrepreneurs and SMEs and provide tailored and targeted supports as applicable to the needs of businesses in their respective environs.</p>  <p>  During the compilation of the review, the OECD met with representatives of the both Enterprise Ireland and the Local Enterprise Network to discuss their roles and were very appreciative of their enthusiasm, expertise and endeavours to support enterprise development.</p>  <p>  The OECD report recognises that each LEO maintains its own local panel of mentors and it is this which is the main source of mentors to LEO clients. The LEO Network&rsquo;s approach on a local and regional basis to the provision of mentoring expertise is monitored and, where matters arise in regard to demand, this is met through the shared use of mentors from other LEO offices together with addressing any shortfalls through the issuing of tenders for specific mentoring requirements. </p>  <p>  Observing the remit of EI and the LEOs, there was further discussion regarding the potential to aid small businesses in the category of those having between ten and fifty employees, who are not currently exporting but who have the ability to grow and create further sustainable employment. </p>  <p>  The OECD addressed the possibility of the Local Enterprise Office network expanding its activities beyond the range of micro-enterprise. The OECD acknowledged that the LEOs' geographical spread and their knowledge of their local environment increases their ability to respond to local demands and tailor their services to facilitate enterprise growth. </p>  <p>  The recently received OECD Report on SME and Entrepreneurship Policy in Ireland has provided us with considerable food for thought as to how best to steer and progress the availability of supports to service the needs of an ever-changing business ecosystem. </p>  <p>  My Department in conjunction with its agencies will be examining how to progress the recommendations to best fit the future needs of our indigenous enterprises.</p></reply>

The Report identified around 4,000 people (based on 2008 census) with disabilities in Ireland living in congregated settings, defined as a residential setting where people live with ten or more people.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Partnership Government contains a commitment to continue to move people with disabilities out of congregated settings, to enable them to live independently and to be included in the community.  The objective is to reduce this figure by one-third by 2021 and ultimately, to eliminate all congregated settings.</p>  <p>  By the end of this year, we will have exceeded this target and under 2,100 people with a disability will remain living in congregated settings. I want to emphasise that the appropriate supports and resources are being put in place to ensure that people are supported as they move out of residential centres. The model of care for individuals will be based on a person centred plan (PCP). The PCP may change over time in line with an individual&rsquo;s needs and circumstances and the model of service delivery applicable at a particular time.</p>  <p>  Any opportunity for residents to live in smaller settings in the community will come after considerable planning and discussion with those residents and their families. It will be on the basis that it will enhance their life, and anyone who moves will continue to access the services they require.</p>  <p>  The HSE has prioritised the transition of a further 160 people from congregated settings in 2019 under its Service Plan, and I am informed that 78 people have moved into their homes in the community at the end of September this year.   </p>  <p>  As the HSE is responsible for leading out on the recommendations of "Time to Move on from Congregated Settings - A Strategy for Community Inclusion", I have asked the HSE to reply directly to the Deputy in relation to the questions posed.</p></reply>

Of particular note is the commitment by the HSE to develop a National Traveller Health Action Plan to continue to address the specific health needs of Travellers. The Plan is expected to be finalised by the end of this year.</p>  <p>  Regarding eligibility for health services in Ireland, this is based primarily on residency and means, in accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended). The Act provides that persons who are unable, without undue hardship, to arrange GP services for themselves and family can qualify for full eligibility (a medical card). The HSE's Expert Group on Medical Need and Medical Card Eligibility examined the issue of awarding medical cards and concluded that a person&rsquo;s means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card. This position remains unchanged.</p>  <p>  However, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card or general practitioner card, even though an applicant exceeds his or her income threshold, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness. Social and medical issues are also considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services.</p>  <p>  Sl&aacute;intecare provides the framework within which a system-wide health reform programme will be advanced, including a phased expansion of eligibility to move towards universal healthcare. To that end, it will be necessary to review the current eligibility framework for all services and consider different options that will enable a phased expansion of universal access to a prescribed range of services. These options will take account of the ability of the health system to meet the increase in demand that would be expected, including the resource requirements needed from a workforce and service delivery perspective, as well as the impact on the effective management of the financial resources of the total health service.</p></reply>

An overpayment of &euro;107.967.70 was raised for this period.  This appeal was partially upheld by the Appeals Officer, who stated in their report that the overpayment amount 'should be reduced by the amount that the person would have been entitled to on Carer's Allowance' for the period from 2004 to 2009. Subsequently my Department wrote to the person in question on 25 September 2019 advising that as per the Appeals Officers determination, CA was awarded for that period (17 June 2004 - 6 January 2010) but the funds would be held against the debt. The letter also stated that our Debt Recovery Unit (DRU) would make contact. DRU have since made contact with the person in question to discuss repayment of the debt. A letter was issued on 3 October 2019 detailing the debt of &euro;47,286.37.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, the person concerned had a separate appeal (18/06890) following a decision dated 23 January 2019, stating that she had no entitlement to Carers Allowance for the period 2 January 2014 - 1 November 2017 on the grounds that her means exceeded the limit.  This appeal was disallowed and a further debt is now owed to my department for an overpayment of CA for the period concerned, for &euro;47,357.80. In light of this new development, DRU wrote to the person in question on 7 November 2019 advising that the new amount owing was a combination of the two debts, totalling &euro;94,516.42 on that date.</p>  <p>  Quite separate from the above, the person in question had made a new application for CA which was received on 23 July 2019, and my Department wrote to her on 23 October 2019 to advise that this was approved. The first payment  on this claim issued to her nominated bank account on 7 November 2019.</p>  <p>  In relation to the debt still outstanding, my Departments DRU will continue to discuss repayment options with the person in question. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

In the context of the scheme&rsquo;s success my Department engaged with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Finance with regard to the allocation for 2019.</p><p>I engaged early as I said I would. While discussions commenced in October 2018 on additional funding, the first tranche of &euro;200m was only fully drawn down in August of this year. My Department wrote to all 31 local authorities on 15 August 2019 sanctioning an additional &euro;363 million in funding for the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan. This brings total funding for the Loan to over &euro;563 million for 2018 and 2019 combined. </p><p>The RIHL is funded by financing provided to the local authorities by the Housing Finance Agency (HFA). As an on-balance sheet entity, the HFA's borrowing from  the non-Government sector forms part of General Government Debt. RIHL loans, however, do not impact on the General Government Balance as the RIHL scheme is treated as a loan under the European System of Accounts 2010 framework.  </p><p>Furthermore, the ESRI have been commissioned to conduct a review of the operation of the RIHL. The output of the review will be used to inform the development of the RIHL product and identify any reforms to be introduced if necessary to local authority mortgage lending via the RIHL in 2020 and beyond. </p><p>The Housing Agency provides a central support service which assesses applications for the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan on behalf of local authorities and makes recommendations to the authorities to approve or refuse applications. Housing Agency recommendations are then considered by the Credit Committee in each local authority, which issues loan approvals.  </p><p>Each local authority must have in place a Credit Committee and it is a matter for the Committee to make the final decision on applications for loans, in accordance with the regulations, and having regard to the recommendations made by the Housing Agency. The value of pending applications is not tracked by my Department.</p><p>I have asked the Agency to compile figures on the numbers of applications that it has assessed and recommended to approve since the scheme began.  In 2018, the Housing Agency assessed 3,036 valid applications.  Of these, it recommended 1,550 for approval. In 2019, the Housing Agency have assessed 2,271 valid applications of which 1,133 have been recommended for approval. <table>    <tr>       <th>Local Authority</th>       <th>Total Applications Assessed</th>       <th>Total Applications Recommended for Approval</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Carlow County Council</td>       <td>73</td>       <td>28</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cavan County Council</td>       <td>24</td>       <td>9</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Clare County Council</td>       <td>87</td>       <td>36</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork City Council</td>       <td>217</td>       <td>96</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork County Council</td>       <td>414</td>       <td>209</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Donegal County Council</td>       <td>51</td>       <td>22</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin City Council</td>       <td>610</td>       <td>368</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>D&uacute;n Laoghaire - Rathdown County Council</td>       <td>142</td>       <td>78</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Fingal County Council</td>       <td>756</td>       <td>424</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway City Council</td>       <td>109</td>       <td>58</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway County Council</td>       <td>194</td>       <td>63</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerry County Council</td>       <td>144</td>       <td>59</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare County Council</td>       <td>200</td>       <td>107</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilkenny County Council</td>       <td>61</td>       <td>31</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Laois County Council</td>       <td>125</td>       <td>61</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Leitrim County Council</td>       <td>19</td>       <td>5</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick City &amp;amp; County Council</td>       <td>143</td>       <td>85</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Longford County Council</td>       <td>55</td>       <td>26</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth County Council</td>       <td>152</td>       <td>59</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mayo County Council</td>       <td>82</td>       <td>32</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Meath County Council</td>       <td>324</td>       <td>212</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Monaghan County Council</td>       <td>64</td>       <td>21</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Offaly County Council</td>       <td>58</td>       <td>23</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Roscommon County Council</td>       <td>59</td>       <td>23</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Sligo County Council</td>       <td>72</td>       <td>34</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>South Dublin County Council</td>       <td>373</td>       <td>194</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Tipperary County Council</td>       <td>152</td>       <td>67</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Waterford City &amp;amp; County Council</td>       <td>115</td>       <td>39</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Westmeath County Council</td>       <td>56</td>       <td>34</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wexford County Council</td>       <td>161</td>       <td>80</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wicklow County Council</td>       <td>215</td>       <td>100</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total </td>       <td>5307</td>       <td>2683</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>My Department publishes information on the overall number and value of (i) local authority loan approvals and (ii) local authority loan drawdowns. Local authority approval means that an official letter of offer has been sent to a borrower (and therefore relates to a specific property and loan amount). Information on the RIHL for Quarter 2 2019, including in relation to the number and value of mortgage approvals and drawdowns, is available on the Department's website at the following link: www.housing.gov.ie/housing/statistics/house-prices-loans-and-profile-borrowers/local-authority-loan-activity.</p></reply>

Action 25 contains two measures for which my Department has lead responsibility and which require input from a range of other Departments and agencies:</p>  <p>  1. Completion of the National Marine Planning Framework in a manner to give priority to key national policies such as the overall decarbonisation of the economy and Ireland&rsquo;s renewable energy ambitions, and</p>  <p>  2. Finalise the revised General Scheme of the Marine Planning and Development Management Bill.</p>  <p>  The Draft National Marine Planning Framework (NMPF) and associated environmental reports were published on 12 November for a period of public consultation closing on 28 February 2020. Section 11 of the Draft NMPF is devoted to offshore renewable energy (ORE) and contains a range of objectives and planning policies that support the decarbonisation and renewable energy ambitions of the Climate Action Plan. In all there are eleven separate planning policies devoted to ORE, the first of which states that "Proposals that assist the State in meeting the Government&rsquo;s target of generating at least 3.5GW of offshore renewable electricity by 2030 and proposals that maximise the long-term shift from use of fossil fuels to renewable electricity, in line with decarbonisation targets should be supported". </p>  <p>  The NMPF is on target for completion and adoption by end 2020. </p>  <p>  Government approved a General Scheme of the Marine Planning and Development Management (MPDM) Bill in July 2019 and finalisation of the Bill is expected in the coming weeks. </p>  <p>  My Department is continuing to work with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel on the drafting process. The finalisation of the Bill will be subject to engagement with the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government in relation to pre-legislative scrutiny.</p>  <p>  The Bill will require further enabling measures following enactment to bring the new regime into operation, including regulations, statutory guidelines and transitional arrangements.</p></reply>

The review is addressing a number of key aspects including sound or noise, visual amenity setback distances, shadow flicker, community obligation, community dividend and grid connections. </p>  <p>  As part of the overall review process, a strategic environmental assessment (SEA) is being undertaken on the revised Guidelines before they come into effect, in accordance with the requirements of EU Directive 2001/24/EC on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment, otherwise known as the SEA Directive. SEA is a process by which environmental considerations are required to be fully integrated into the preparation of plans and programmes which act as frameworks for development consent, prior to their final adoption, with public consultation as part of that process.</p>  <p>  While the revised draft guidelines had been expected to be published in Quarter 1 2019, some delays to the planned schedule arose, due to the publication of updated World Health Organisation (WHO) noise standards and the need to focus on certain Brexit-related planning issues. </p>  <p>  As part of the SEA process, there will shortly be an eight-week public consultation on the revised draft Guidelines, together with the comprehensive environmental report. Finalised Guidelines will be prepared following detailed analysis and consideration of the submissions received during the consultation phase, and the conclusion of the SEA process. My Department is aiming to commence the public consultation in December.</p>  <p>  When finalised, the revised Guidelines will be issued under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.  Planning authorities and, where applicable, An Bord Plean&aacute;la, must have regard to guidelines issued under section 28 in the performance of their functions generally under the Planning Acts.

However, trends indicate the continued expansion of supply.  For example, in the year to end September 2019, the number of new homes becoming available for use increased further to 23,554, a 15% increase on the same period last year. In the year to the end of September 2019, the number of new homes in respect of which commencement notices were served reached just over 26,000, a 27.5% year on year  increase. Furthermore, the rolling annual total of planning permissions for residential dwellings has exceeded 30,000 units for the first time since early 2010,  up more than 21% year on year. There has been particularly strong growth in apartment planning permissions, which is very welcome given the policy thrust toward more compact urban growth. </p>  <p>  The Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan has been in operation since 1 February 2018. The scheme allows low-income first time buyers aged between 18 and 70, who cannot secure a mortgage from a commercial lender, to access sustainable mortgage finance that is designed to enable them to purchase a new or second-hand property, or undertake a self-build, within a suitable price range. The Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan scheme is not limited to new builds, and the &euro;563m allocated to the scheme for 2018 and 2019 can be used for both new and second hand homes, as well as self build, as determined by the applicants' preferences.</p></reply>

My Department supports fire authorities mainly through providing a national legislative framework, setting national policy and developing guidance on operational and other fire service related matters and through capital funding towards appliances and buildings.  </p>  <p>  A Fire Safety Certificate (FSC)  indicates that a building is designed in a way that prevents and limits the spread of fire and that adequate escape facilities are in place. Part III of the Building Control Regulations 1997-2018 provides for the requirements for FSCs in respect of new buildings and for certain works to existing buildings. </p>  <p>  Applications for FSCs are examined by Fire Officers, from the Fire Service in each local authority, for compliance with Part B of the Building Regulations. In Dublin, the FSC applications are processed by Dublin Fire Brigade for all four local authorities in the Dublin region. </p>  <p>  The relevant authority typically aims to process a FSC application within the statutory timeframe of eight weeks. However, as the processing/issuing of FSCs is a demand led function, linked to economic activity in the construction sector, I understand that meeting this target can be challenging at times.</p>  <p>  It is critically important that we have a robust FSC regime in place and that certificates are issued within statutory timelines to the greatest extent possible. It is a matter for each local authority to ensure that adequate resources are in place to meet its statutory obligations in the context of the annual budgetary process.  </p>  <p>  In this regard, the elected members of a local authority have direct responsibility in law for all reserved functions of the authority, which includes adopting the annual budget, and agreeing spending priorities. Under Section 159 of the Local Government Act 2001 staffing and organisational arrangements within a local authority are a matter for the Chief Executive.</p></reply>

The charging regime for the provision of connections is determined by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) acting in accordance with that Act. The CRU is required to perform its functions in a manner that best serves the interests of customers of Irish Water. </p>  <p>  On this basis, the CRU, informed by a multi-stage public consultation process, published its Decision Paper on Irish Water&rsquo;s Proposed Connection Charging Policy on 18 December 2018 and the policy came into effect on 1 April 2019. The relevant public consultation documentation continues to be publicly available on the CRU&rsquo;s website and the Decision Paper in particular can be accessed at the following weblink -</p>  <p>  www.cru.ie/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/CRU18262-CRU-Decision-on-Irish-Waters-Connection-Policy.pdf.</p>  <p>  The CRU decision details the reasoning for the charging regime and sets out further actions that the CRU has directed must be taken by Irish Water in response to stakeholder concerns, which include addressing the waiting times faced by customers seeking to obtain a connection quotation.</p>  <p>  The statutory functions in relation to this matter have been assigned to Irish Water and the CRU, as outlined above, and I, as Minister do not have any role in determining connection charging policy.</p>  <p>  On the broader issue of resources, the Irish Water Strategic Funding Plan 2019-2024, which I approved in November 2018 following its consideration by Government, sets out Irish Water&rsquo;s multi-annual strategic business plan funding requirement of &euro;11bn to 2024, comprised of a &euro;6.1bn investment in infrastructure and assets and &euro;4.9bn in operating costs.  This significant multi-billion euro investment Plan will support the continued operation, repair and upgrading of the country&rsquo;s water and wastewater infrastructure to support social and economic development across the State and protection of the water environment.</p>  <p>  It may also be helpful to note that Irish Water has established a dedicated team to deal with representations and queries from public representatives. The team can be contacted via email to oireachtasmembers@water.ie or by telephone on a dedicated number, 1890 578 578.</p></reply>
