The report also indicates that Ireland met all current EU targets in 2019, with the exception of a newly introduced WEEE separate collection target.  Notwithstanding these successes, significant challenges remain.  As the report states, waste generation in Ireland increased in 2019, while recent changes in EU legislation have introduced stricter targets for recycling and for landfilling of waste.</p>  <p>  The Waste Action Plan for a Circular Economy, which was published in September last year, contains over 200 measures that will be instrumental in meeting the challenges identified in the EPA report, with a key focus on minimising waste generation and extending the productive life of the materials we use.  Some measures have been delivered already, such as the inclusion of soft plastics in the household recycling bin. A large number of transformational measures, such as the introduction of a Deposit and Return Scheme, are well-advance and others will be introduced through the forthcoming Circular Economy Bill, such as provisions to improve segregation of waste in the commercial sector, and a national food waste prevention roadmap. </p>  <p>  A new National Waste Management Plan will be published in 2022 which will set out the further actions at local and regional levels required to deliver on the Waste Action Plan and support Ireland's circular economy transition. </p></reply>

The significantly strengthened legally binding framework under the Act with clear targets and commitments set in law, will help ensure that Ireland achieves its national, EU and international climate goals and obligations in the near and long-term. </p>  <p>  The transition to climate-neutrality will require changes across all sectors of our society and economy, involving collaborative effort by Government, business, communities, and individuals to implement new and ambitious policies, technological innovations, systems and infrastructures. This will also require changes in individual behaviours, including how we work, heat our homes, travel, consume goods and services, and manage our waste. Delivering this is the responsibility of everyone in society.</p>  <p>  The CCAC report highlights that a significantly increased climate mitigation effort is required across the agriculture, land-use, built environment and transport sectors, while also recognising the significant progress already made in decarbonising our electricity generation. The Climate Action Plan 2021 sets out a range of new policies, measures and actions to address these sectors, including enhancing organisational capacity to do so. </p>  <p>  The National Development Plan has allocated significantly increased funding to climate action, including public transport and retrofitting over the next decade. Government recognises that climate action will require a targeted balance between Exchequer-supported expenditure, taxation policies and regulation. Private investment will be needed to work alongside public funding to achieve our targets. </p>  <p>  The National Dialogue on Climate Action will create a comprehensive support structure for widespread public and stakeholder engagement on climate change, empowering people across all areas of society and the economy to adopt more sustainable behaviours, and participate in all aspects of the transition.</p>  <p>  The Government also recognises the need for a renewed focus on adaptation to deal with an increase in extreme weather events, as highlighted by the CCAC. Four Government funded Climate Action Regional Offices are supporting Local Authorities in their adaptation efforts.</p>  <p>  The CCAC report also emphasises that it is important to acknowledge that the transition will have a cost and preparations will be required to reduce the impact on the most vulnerable. Building on the successful approach in the Midlands, a Just Transition Commission will be established to further support Government in this area.</p></reply>

It sets out the specific terms of the NBP contract with National Broadband Ireland in respect of the rollout of the high speed broadband network under the State led intervention, which covers 1.1 million people living and working in the over 554,000 premises, including almost 100,000 businesses and farms along some 679 schools. </p>  <p>  To protect the State investment and ensure that the NBP milestones and deliverables are met, the contract has been designed to include extensive protections, quality checks, reporting and monitoring obligations.</p>  <p>  The NBP Contract provides specific protections in relation to a change in ownership, sale, or change in control of shareholders of NBI. Under the Contract, and up until 12 months after the network build is complete, the prior approval of the Minister is required for any of these events. In the event of a sale of NBI, any new owners will continue to have the same obligations as the original owners.</p>  <p>  The Contract also requires the written consent of the Minister prior to the transfer of any interest, direct or indirect, in NBI held by Mr David McCourt. Again, this requirement is in place until 12 months after the network build is complete.  It should be noted, however, that approval under these provisions cannot be unreasonably withheld.   </p>  <p>  In the event that the investors sell the majority of their shareholding in NBI in the first ten years of the Contract, the State will be entitled to clawback a proportion of any profit on sale based on the value of the business at the time of sale.</p></reply>

The best long-term approach for Ireland to insulate consumers from volatility on international wholesale energy markets is to invest in energy efficiency, renewable energy and to expand interconnection with our European and neighbouring markets and to deepen internal electricity market integration.</p>  <p>  Government&rsquo;s immediate response to address the increase in domestic energy prices has been to utilise the tax and social welfare system to counter rising costs of living. Budget 2022 increased the weekly rate of the Fuel Allowance so that &euro;914 will be paid to eligible households over the course of this winter. Increases to the Qualified Child Payment, the Living Alone Allowance and an increase to the income threshold for the Working Family Payment were also announced.</p>  <p>  Consumers should continue to switch or engage with their energy supplier and many households could still save on their bills if they did so. As recently as the 9th December, switching supplier could save a customer consuming the average amount of electricity up to &euro;313.</p>  <p>  CRU has in place a suite of protections against disconnection that are set out in the Supplier Handbook. In brief, priority customers cannot be disconnected, while vulnerable customers are protected over winter months from 1 November to 31 March each year while a CRU moratoria on disconnections for all customers comes into effect over the Christmas period. Additionally, under the supplier led voluntary Energy Engage Code, suppliers will not disconnect a customer who is engaging with them at any time.  Furthermore, due to the ongoing pressure on households, the Government agreed today to provide a once off credit of &euro;100 to every domestic electricity account holder, through their electricity supplier in quarter one of 2022.</p></reply>

The solution proposed by NBI involved predominantly re-using the eir pole and duct infrastructure. </p>  <p>  The NBP has been designed to ensure that as much as possible of the network infrastructure will comprise the re-use of existing poles and ducts which NBI will lease from existing infrastructure owners. Infrastructure re-use in this manner ensures the State complies with State Aid Guidelines and environmental sustainability best practice.</p>  <p>  As part of the final contract tender National Broadband Ireland included some &euro;900m for infrastructure rental of which circa &euro;800m is forecast to be paid to eir for the rental of poles and ducts over 25 years. These rental charges are fully regulated by ComReg. In the event that there are any price reductions during the 25 years of the NBP Contract, the State will recoup 100% of any reductions to such rentals.</p></reply>

I continue to work towards meeting that deadline and the Separate Collection (Deposit Return Scheme) Regulations 2021, which provide the legal framework for the scheme, in particular the terms under which a scheme operator may be approved, were recently signed. The regulations also set out the obligations that will fall to producers, retailers and return point operators under the scheme.</p>  <p>  The introduction of a Deposit Return Scheme will assist in reducing single use plastics, thus helping Ireland meet EU targets while promoting a wider circular economy. Materials to be included in the scheme will be those for which Ireland faces immediate, challenging EU recycling and separate collection targets. The scheme will therefore focus on plastic bottles and aluminium beverage cans. Recycling rates in Ireland for glass are significantly above current EU targets. </p>  <p>  The Regulations provide that other materials may be considered for inclusion in the Deposit Return Scheme when the scheme is fully established.</p></reply>

These proposed terms and conditions include a requirement for each successful project in ORESS 1 to headquarter its operation and maintenance facilities on the island of Ireland. As offshore renewable energy remains an emerging sector in Ireland, successful projects in ORESS 1 will also be required to complete a Project Delivery Plan Questionnaire, with particular emphasis on domestic supply chain development, to better inform Government policy and design of future ORESS auctions.  </p>  <p>  As referenced in the Climate Action Plan, a cross-Departmental Offshore Renewable Energy Team, chaired by my Department, is also being established to capture the wider economic and business opportunities associated with the development of offshore renewables in Ireland. This will be set up in conjunction with the Marine2040 groups to ensure consistency across the State maritime planning system. It will include the identification of supporting infrastructure and supply chain opportunities as Ireland&rsquo;s offshore wind industry becomes established. </p>  <p>  As part of this work, my Department has been working closely with the Department of Transport and the Irish Maritime Development Office to examine the potential to ensure that Irish ports are in a position to benefit from the offshore wind development programme. The Department of Transport, in conjunction with the Irish Maritime Development Office, has conducted an assessment of the options for Irish State ports to facilitate development of offshore renewable energy in Ireland, and will shortly publish an associated policy statement. The statement will outline the proposed strategy for the provision of infrastructure at ports to facilitate development and future operation of offshore renewable energy projects.</p>  <p>  In addition, my Department has also been working with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, who are finalising plans to establish a Shannon Estuary Taskforce. This Taskforce will consider the potential of the Shannon Estuary in terms of regional economic development across transport and logistics, manufacturing, renewable energy and tourism, and will develop a strategy to achieve this potential in 2022. </p>  <p>  The offshore renewable sector also has the potential to result in commercial and employment opportunities for Irish firms operating beyond Ireland.

The NBP roll out is currently a 7 year plan under the contract and deployment is due to be complete by the end of 2026.</p>  <p>  Despite the unprecedented challenges presented by the Covid-19 pandemic, NBI has made steady progress on delivery of the new high speed fibre broadband network under the National Broadband Plan. The first fibre to the home connections are successfully connected with over 27,000 premises passed and available for immediate connection. In total, almost 35,000 premises can order or pre-order a connection on the network as of 3 December. This includes residential and commercial premises. NBI has confirmed that over 3,900 premises have been connected as of 6 December and this is increasing on a daily basis. Connections have been made in 11 counties including Carlow, Cavan, Clare, Cork, Galway, Kerry, Limerick, Louth, Monaghan, Roscommon and Tipperary.  To date, the level of connections are in line with projections and some areas are exceeding targets, for example, one area has seen almost a 25% take up after only a few months of going live.</p>  <p>  In line with a remedial plan to address Covid-19 related delays which was agreed with the Department earlier this year, NBI was to have almost 60,000 premises passed and available for immediate connection by the end of January 2022 (the end of Contract Year 2). As would be expected with a large scale infrastructure build of this nature, challenges have been encountered as a result of Covid-19 and also planning and build related issues. NBI is actively working with its network and build partners to address these issues as they arise and has recently confirmed to my Department that the number of premises passed by the end of December will be in the order of 35,000, while between 50,000 and 60,000 premises will be able to order or pre-order a service by the end of the year. For more than another 120,000 premises, I am advised build work is underway demonstrating the project is reaching scale. </p>  <p>  I met with the Board of NBI on 19 November last to restate the priority the Government attaches to this project and the need for urgent resolution of build related issues. I met with the Chair and CEO of both NBI and eir yesterday to reinforce that message. </p>  <p>  The focus for 2022 is to continue to build momentum in the build, catch up on the delays experienced and plan for acceleration. Final targets for 2022 are expected to be agreed early in the new year. </p></reply>

There is a further commitment in the Programme for Government to develop a longer-term plan to utilise the potential 30GW of offshore floating wind power in our Atlantic waters. The 5GW target will be primarily met through development of offshore renewable energy (ORE) in Ireland&rsquo;s eastern and southern coastal regions. This reflects the suitability of water depths in these regions for deployment of conventional fixed bottom offshore wind turbines and existing electricity grid infrastructure to connect these projects to the onshore grid. </p>  <p>  Subsequent cost-effective deployment of renewables in deeper waters off the west coast, to take advantage of stronger and more consistent wind speeds, should be increasingly feasible through future advances in floating turbine technology.</p>  <p>  Development of the Maritime Area Planning Bill is being led by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, with my Department providing input on provisions specific to ORE. The enactment of this Bill will provide a modern, up-to-date regulatory framework that will enable ORE developments beyond the limits of the current foreshore regime. The Bill completed Final Stage in the D&aacute;il on 1 December 2021 and Second Stage in the Seanad on 7 December 2021, with enactment anticipated by the end of the year.</p>  <p>  Work on a revised Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan (OREDP) has also been initiated by my Department. This will provide an evidence base for the identification of areas most suitable for the sustainable development of both fixed and floating wind, wave, and tidal technologies, and will include an assessment of other maritime activities and marine biodiversity setting out the path-way for the development of ORE beyond 2030. In tandem with the OREDP, a comprehensive analysis of long-term routes to market will be undertaken by my Department in 2022.</p></reply>

Recognising the growing dependence on digital services and the evolving global cyber threat landscape, earlier this year Minister Ryan commissioned external consultants to conduct a Capacity Review and to benchmark the NCSC with similar agencies in Europe and internationally. Minister Ryan and I received the consultants&rsquo; report in June and in July the Government agreed a number of measures to support the continued development of the NCSC over the coming five years, including: </p><p>-Increasing the overall fulltime staffing complement of the NCSC to at least 70 over the next 5 years with a first tranche of an additional 20 staff recruited by end 2022 bringing the serving complement to 45. </p><p>-That the General Scheme of a Bill be prepared for Government approval, to establish the NCSC on a statutory basis and provide for related matters including clarity around its mandate. </p><p>-That the new role of Director of the NCSC be established at a salary level equivalent to that of Deputy Secretary in the Civil Service. </p><p>-That the existing cross-Government group overseeing the implementation of the  National Cyber Security Strategy 2019-2024, chaired by the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications be tasked with developing an action plan for key elements of the capacity review, sponsoring implementation of the review, and reporting to the Minister/Government as necessary. </p><p>-That the future capital budget for the NCSC be informed by a 5-year NCSC technology strategy.</p><p>-The NCSC will be accommodated within the Department&rsquo;s new Headquarters (HQ) in Beggars Bush.</p><p>-In addition to the creation of 20 new permanent posts in the NCSC, a cyber security graduate training programme would  be initiated.</p><p>Implementation of the programme of work to deliver on these measures is well underway. </p><p>My Department has recently published a baseline cyber security standard to be applied by all Government Departments and key agencies.

The RESS supports communities in a variety of ways, including through a separate category for community projects and a mandatory community benefit fund for every project supported in the scheme.  </p>  <p>  The Climate Action Plan includes a target for at least 500 MW of renewable electricity to be supplied by local community-based projects, meaning approximately 100 community projects will be needed to meet this ambition. In order to ensure such a pipeline of community projects I have allocated &euro;2 million in capital funding in Budget 2022 to the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI). This funding will enable SEAI to deploy a range of capacity-building supports including an information warehouse, trusted intermediary and advisor services, and financial grant supports, all of which are vital to support community-owned RESS projects development. Some of this enabling framework is already in place with additional elements to be delivered in early 2022.</p>  <p>  To ensure genuine community participation for future RESS auctions, only projects 100% owned by a Renewable Energy Community (REC) will be eligible for the separate community category, ensuring that all of the benefits of the project stay in the local area. The REC definition employed in RESS was derived from the REC definition provided through the EU&rsquo;s Clean Energy Package, with particular reference to Article 22 of the recast Renewable Energy Directive (EU) 2018/2001. Accordingly, a REC must be open to all potential local members and its primary purpose should be to provide environmental, economic or social community benefits for the local areas where it operates, rather than financial profits.</p></reply>

It also sets out how green hydrogen could address some of the challenges faced by the energy sector, such as providing a back-up for intermittent renewables, and key actions including carrying out a work programme to identify a route to deliver one to three TWh of zero emissions gas (including green hydrogen) by 2030. </p>  <p>  To help inform national policy development, the SEAI is currently undertaking a National Heat Study, including consideration of the role of green hydrogen, which is expected to be published early next year. </p>  <p>  At a European level, the European Commission is proposing a range of changes to European gas markets with a strong focus on hydrogen. This follows on from the hydrogen strategy which they published last year. </p>  <p>  My Department continues to work with relevant Departments, agencies and stakeholders to carry out research and develop policies to support the uptake of green hydrogen. I expect a detailed strategy focussing on the development of green hydrogen to be included in Climate Action Plan 2022.    </p></reply>

This new capacity will only run when needed, with renewable generation dispatched in the market first, and therefore the level of associated emissions will be minimised. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Department is carrying out a review of security of energy supply of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity and natural gas systems focussing on the period to 2030 in the context of ensuring a sustainable pathway to net zero emissions by 2050. </p>  <p>  I expect the technical analysis will be published and the public consultation commenced early next year. It is planned to complete the overall review in mid-2022 following which it will be submitted to Government.</p></reply>

Among the best ways to reduce emissions from private vehicles across the road network as a whole, is to remove older more polluting vehicles from our streets, and to encourage a modal shift to sustainable travel options, including walking and cycling, and electric vehicles.  </p>  <p>  The interim report of the Urban Transport-Related Air Pollution Group, which was published earlier this year, made a number of recommendations on how to reduce vehicle emissions in our towns and cities and highlights some of the actions Local Authorities can take, including traffic flow management, and changes to speed limits. In addition, the Five Cities Traffic Demand Management Study published recently by the Department of Transport proposes a range of measures to combat overreliance on cars. The report also includes a toolkit that Local Authorities can use to help them to reduce emissions, tackle congestion, and improve air quality as well as the overall urban environment in our five major cities.</p>  <p>  Further actions to reduce transport-related air pollutant emissions are being developed as part of the Clean Air Strategy, and the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications continues to work in conjunction with the Department of Transport on these matters.</p></reply>

The Act commits Ireland to achieve a climate neutral economy by no later than 2050,  and provides for a 51% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 2018 levels.  </p>  <p>  The significantly strengthened legally binding framework under the Act with clear targets and commitments set in law, including embedding a process of carbon budgeting and sectoral emissions ceilings, will help ensure that Ireland achieves its climate goals and obligations in the near and long-term. Establishing these requirements in legislation places a clear obligation on this and future governments for sustained climate action. </p>  <p>  At EU level, the EU Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR) sets binding emission reduction targets for Member States for the period 2021-2030. The current target for Ireland is a 30% reduction in emissions by 2030 compared to 2005 levels. The Climate Action Plan 2019 set out the policies and measures that Ireland must take to meet this target and avoid any costs arising from not meeting the target. Our EU target is expected to increase through the European Commission's 'Fit for 55' package.</p>  <p>  The recently published Climate Action Plan 2021 sets out the practical measures that we need to take to meet a higher-level ambition of reducing our emissions by 51% versus 2018 levels. The plan provides a detailed roadmap for meeting our climate ambition under the Act and sets out indicative ranges of emissions reductions for each sector of the economy. These ranges will become specific ceilings in the Climate Action Plan 2022, following the legal adoption of carbon budgets and sectoral emissions ceilings.</p>  <p>  Monitoring of compliance with national and sectoral progress towards each carbon budget and sectoral emissions ceiling will be informed by the Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s annual inventory and projection reports. To ensure greater scrutiny and accountability is provided, relevant Ministers will be required to give account to an Oireachtas Committee on progress in implementing the Climate Action Plan and adhering to the sector's emission ceiling for the associated carbon budget period.</p></reply>

Almost 35,000 premises are available to order and pre-order across 12 counties as of 3 December.  I am advised by NBI that, over 10,000 premises in County Mayo have been now surveyed. Surveys are complete in the Deployment Areas of Newport, Killadoon, and Carrowmorelacken. Surveys are ongoing in the Deployment area of Liscarney. I am further advised that pre build works are on going in the Deployment Areas of Castlebar and Athlone (in which over 2,100 premises are in County Mayo) with anticipated dates for connection in H1 and H2 of 2022 respectively.</p>  <p>  Further details are available on specific areas within County Mayo through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. NBI has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries. Given the scale and complexity of delivery of the new high speed broadband network under the NBP, I am advised that any dates provided by NBI on its website are based on the best available information at the time and may be subject to change.</p>  <p>  In addition to the challenges to the delivery of the NBP due to the Covid-19 pandemic, NBI has faced a range of other challenges due to the sheer scale and complexity of rolling out fibre to the home in a rural environment. These include significant tree trimming to ensure cable can be placed on overhead poles, remediation of ducting that has been in place for many decades, the co-ordination of hundreds of contracting crews and addressing the many issues arising week on week which could not have been foreseen until the build crews commenced work on the ground. My Department has worked closely with NBI to put in place a remedial plan under the Contract. This plan addresses delays experienced by NBI, primarily arising as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, and re-baselines milestones for 2021. Work is underway to re-baseline milestones for 2022 and beyond. </p>  <p>  It remains the ambition of the Government to rollout the National Broadband Plan as quickly as possible. My Department continues to engage with NBI to explore the feasibility of accelerating aspects of the NBP rollout to establish the possibility of bringing forward premises which are currently scheduled in years 6 and 7 of the current plan to an earlier date. However, the primary focus must be on addressing the delays which have arisen and ensuring that the National Broadband Ireland build programme gets back on track and is building momentum month on month.</p>  <p>  Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network.

Delivery of the ADI is co-ordinated by the three Waste Enforcement Regional Lead Authorities (WERLAs) and supported projects are selected based on their impact on four key criteria - prevention, abatement, enforcement, and awareness. Since its introduction, funding of over &euro;9 million has been provided by my Department under the Initiative, which has supported the delivery of over 1,000 projects across all 31 local authorities. Full details of funding, broken down by local authority and individual project, for each of the years 2017-2020 are available on the gov.ie website at the following link:</p>  <p>  www.gov.ie/en/publication/e27ac-anti-dumping-initiative/​</p>  <p>  A further &euro;3m has been allocated to local authorities under the 2021 ADI. Payments are currently being processed and details will be made available on the gov.ie website when the process is complete. Allocations under the ADI for 2022 have yet to be finalised, but it is likely that a similar amount will be made available to local authorities in 2022 under the Initiative.</p>  <p>  My Department also continues to invest significantly in the local authority waste enforcement network under the Local Authority Waste Enforcement Measures Grant Scheme, with the intention of maintaining a visible presence of waste enforcement personnel on the ground across the State. Over &euro;7.7m was provided to local authorities under the scheme in 2021, in order to support the recruitment and retention of over 150 local authority waste enforcement staff across the country.</p></reply>

The Act commits Ireland to achieve a climate neutral economy by no later than 2050,  and provides for a 51% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 2018 levels. </p>  <p>  The significantly strengthened legally binding framework under the Act with clear targets and commitments set in law, including embedding a process of carbon budgeting and sectoral emissions ceilings, will help ensure that Ireland achieves its climate goals and obligations in the near and long-term. Establishing these requirements in legislation places a clear obligation on this and future governments for sustained climate action. </p>  <p>  In order to deliver upon this ambition, the Government published Climate Action Plan 2021 in November 2021, which identifies the actions necessary to achieve our emissions reductions targets. The Plan sets out indicative ranges of emissions reductions for each sector of the economy based on their respective starting points, and the relative difficulty, cost, speed, and benefits, of reducing emissions.  All sectors, including agriculture will reduce emissions by an ambitious and achievable percentage, each playing a vital role in meeting our targets. </p>  <p>  The plan builds on the significant progress made since CAP 2019, in particular in the areas of climate governance, renewable electricity, ensuring a just transition, the development of a National Residential Retrofit Plan and the increasing levels of bio-fuels in the transport sector. The National Development Plan has allocated significantly increased funding to climate action, including public transport and retrofitting over the next decade.</p>  <p>  With regard to the agriculture sector, the core measures outlined in the Climate Action Plan 2021 include efficiencies across the agriculture sector and diversification measures, including increasing organic production and the production of biomethane. Further measures will be required to meet the targets set for this sector and include the introduction of a model for carbon farming, exploring feed-related methane reduction solutions, and conducting a diversification review which will include an assessment on the wider production of biomethane. The Government is committed to finding the balance between environmental, climate and biodiversity needs, and supports for farmers. </p>  <p>  Failure to rapidly decarbonise our economic model will have far reaching negative impacts on the economy and the public finances; undermine the long-term, sustainable competitiveness of the economy; and lock Ireland into a redundant fossil-fuel based economic model.

The report highlights that a significant ramp-up of mitigation effort is required across the agriculture, land-use, built environment and transport sectors. It also emphasises the importance of climate resilience, while also recognising the significant progress already made in decarbonising our electricity system. Additionally, it stresses that the transition will have a cost and preparations will be required to reduce the impact on the most vulnerable.</p><p>We have delivered key elements of our climate policy framework in the last year, including the milestone Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021, and the Climate Action Plan 2021 which identifies the policies,measures and actions necessary to achieve emissions reductions of 51% by 2030 and net zero emissions by no later than 2050.The Government will shortly publish an Annex of Actions, which will set out the detailed steps that must be taken to deliver on our climate commitments. </p><p>We will shortly have in place a system of legally binding economy-wide carbon budgets and sectoral emissions ceilings, with relevant Ministers required to give account to the Oireachtas on performance on implementing the Climate Action Plan and adhering to the sector's emission ceiling for the carbon budget period.</p><p>The National Development Plan published in October allocated significantly increased funding to climate action, including public transport and retrofitting over the next decade.</p><p>The National Dialogue on Climate Action will create a comprehensive support structure for widespread public and stakeholder engagement on climate change, empowering people across all areas of society and the economy to adopt more sustainable behaviours, and participate in all aspects of the transition.</p><p>Following the enactment of the Climate Act in July, and the publication of the Climate Action Plan 2021 in November, we will in the coming period finalise Ireland&rsquo;s Long-term Strategy to reflect this increased ambition.. The Strategy will be brought to Government for consideration and approval, ahead of being submitted to the European Commission.</p></reply>

It is also needed to meet growing demand from large energy users, such as data centres, and the electrification of the heat and transport sectors. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the development of flexible gas-fired generation is to provide security of supply and support increased levels of renewable electricity generation.

It is proposed as a 575km long, with 500km of this being subsea, 700MW cable connecting the north-west coast of France to the south coast of Ireland. At this scale it would be able to provide electricity for some 450,000 homes.</p>  <p>  The Celtic Interconnector will provide a reliable high-capacity electricity link between Ireland and France that will have significant benefits for electricity consumers in Ireland. The project will provide access to the European internal energy market, leading to expected increased competition and lower prices in Ireland. It will also enhance security of electricity supply and facilitate increased capacity for renewable energy here via export access to the mainland European markets.     </p>  <p>  In late 2019, the European Commission announced a grant of &euro;530 million towards the construction of the interconnector under the Connecting Europe Facility fund. Following extensive planning and multiple periods of public consultation over the past number of years, EirGrid decided earlier this year on the interconnector&rsquo;s route in East Cork. EirGrid have further decided to establish an enhanced community benefit scheme for neighbouring communities.

My Department as the contracting authority manages all of the elements of contract governance and engages with NBI on an ongoing basis across all elements of the programme to deliver the new high speed broadband network. </p><p>In addition to the challenges to the delivery of the NBP due to the Covid-19 pandemic, NBI has faced a range of other challenges due to the sheer scale and complexity of rolling out fibre to the home in a rural environment. These include significant tree trimming to ensure cable can be placed on overhead poles, remediation of ducting that has been in place for many decades, the co-ordination of hundreds of contracting crews and addressing the many issues arising week on week which could not have been foreseen until the build crews commenced work on the ground. My Department has worked closely with NBI to put in place a remedial plan under the Contract. This plan addresses delays experienced by NBI, primarily arising as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, and re-baselines milestones for 2021. </p><p>NBI has implemented a number of measures to help lessen the impact that these challenges have had on the rollout including:-</p><p>-Increasing the rate of pole replacement and duct remediation per month;</p><p>-Bringing in additional NBI resources;</p><p>-Earlier procurement of material used in the build stages; and</p><p>-Bringing in additional subcontractors.</p><p>National Broadband Ireland has made steady progress on delivery of the new high speed fibre broadband network under the National Broadband Plan with almost 35,000 premises available to order and pre-order in 13 counties across Carlow, Cavan, Clare, Cork, Galway, Kerry, Limerick, Louth, Monaghan, Roscommon, Tipperary, Wexford and Wicklow. In total, over 282,000 premises in the Intervention Area across all counties have been surveyed, with over 150,000 premises under construction or complete with activity now underway in all 26 counties.</p><p>While delivery of the Programme is the responsibility of NBI under the Contract, my Department continues to monitor delivery very closely in accordance with the Department&rsquo;s role under the contract. In parallel with the ongoing oversight of the contract with NBI, the Department has also been working with the 31 Local Authorities, the County and City Management Agency (CCMA), the Roads Maintenance Office (RMO), Broadband Officers and other Government Departments, where appropriate, to ensure that any possible barriers that might delay the rollout are addressed as soon as possible. This also includes engagement with other bodies such as Transport Infrastructure Ireland, Irish Rail and ComReg.</p></reply>

Funding of over &euro;9 million has been provided by my Department under the Initiative, which has supported the delivery of over 1,000 projects nationwide. Details of funding, broken down by local authority and individual project, for each of the years 2017-2020 are available on the gov.ie website at the following link:   www.gov.ie/en/publication/e27ac-anti-dumping-initiative/​</p>  <p>  &euro;3m has been allocated to local authorities under the 2021 ADI. Payments to each local authority are currently being finalised and details will be made available on the gov.ie website when complete. Allocations for 2022 have yet to be finalised, but it is likely that a similar amount will be made available in 2022.</p>  <p>  As regards the Dublin mountains, my Department continue to provide support to the Protecting Uplands and Rural Environments (PURE) project, which was established in 2006 to combat illegal dumping and fly-tipping in the Wicklow/Dublin Uplands. PURE is a partnership project incorporating statutory and non-statutory organisations, including Wicklow, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown and South Dublin County Councils, Coillte, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, and the Wicklow Uplands Council..</p>  <p>  &euro;115,000 has been allocated in support of the PURE Project in 2021 and my Department has committed to maintaining this figure for at least a further two years to end 2023. My Department has also separately approved an allocation of up to &euro;150,000 in 2021 to enable the purchase of a PURE Project truck. This purchase will help to provide greater certainty for the operational work of the Project in the coming years.</p></reply>

It is critically important that citizens and local communities are recognised as best placed to understand their own needs and concerns, as well as enabled to effectively participate in implementing the changes required. Local communities will be central to the decision-making processes of community engagement initiatives as part of Ireland&rsquo;s offshore renewable energy journey. </p>  <p>  The Maritime Area Planning (MAP) Bill, which has been passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and is currently before Seanad &Eacute;ireann, will enable the realisation of our offshore renewable energy ambition by establishing a well-regulated and inclusive consenting process, with comprehensive environmental assessments and consultative processes to better enable meaningful community engagement.</p>  <p>  My Department has also just completed a public consultation on the draft terms and conditions for the first offshore wind auction under the Renewable Electricity Support Scheme, ORESS 1, which will support the first phase of offshore wind development in Ireland.  Projects successful at this auction will be required to make significant community benefit contributions from an early stage in the lifecycle of an offshore wind project. There has been a tremendous response from local communities to this consultation and my Department will now carefully consider all submissions before issuing a formal response early next year. I look forward to working harmoniously with local communities and the offshore renewable energy industry to make this happen together in a way that is successful for everyone involved.</p></reply>

The proposal is targeted and pragmatic and aims at ensuring that governments can resort to compulsory licences, including to export to countries with no or limited manufacturing capacities, in the most effective manner adapted to the circumstances of a pandemic.  </p>  <p>  The EU is of the view that there is no single solution and that a multi-pronged approach is needed and that discussions should concentrate on how the Intellectual Property system can contribute towards increasing the manufacturing capacity and the equitable access to vaccines around the world.</p>  <p>  Despite the postponement of the WTO Ministerial Conference, WTO members will continue to engage in a solution-oriented manner to find an outcome on how the WTO can contribute to an effective response to any pandemic, not just the current one.</p>  <p>  Ireland will engage with the European Commission and other member states on the EU position for the WTO discussions including discussions on how the flexibilities within the TRIPS Agreement can contribute towards increasing the manufacturing capacity and the equitable access to vaccines around the world. </p>  <p>  The global production of vaccines is increasing rapidly and it is estimated that 12 billion doses of COVID vaccines will be produced by the end of 2021. The EU considers that the COVAX Facility is the mechanism that is best placed to ensure that high-income countries finance the vaccines and support the developing countries to secure their share of global supply. </p>  <p>  Europe has committed 200 million doses to reach low and middle-income countries by the end of this year, mainly through the COVAX initiative and is investing &euro;1 billion to ramp up mRNA production capacity in Africa.</p>  <p>  Ireland has contributed &euro;7 million in funding to COVAX in 2021 and will donate 1.3 million vaccines this year to low-income countries as part of the COVAX programme.  The first 500,000 Irish doses donated through the facility reached Nigeria on the 29th of November with further donations of Irish vaccines taking place in the coming weeks.  In addition, Ireland has delivered on its commitment to donate 335,000 COVID-19 doses to Uganda.</p></reply>

We are integrating climate action into all aspects of the Department and its agencies&rsquo; activities and assisting enterprises in doing so too. </p>  <p>  The Department is facilitating a drive toward the green economy through its agencies. Earlier this year, Enterprise Ireland launched a Climate Enterprise Action Fund to assist Irish companies to build the capabilities required to deliver sustainable products, services and business models. </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s forthcoming Strategy for the next four years will set out actions to embed sustainability and climate action as a fundamental part of its approach to company development and engagement with their clients. </p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise offices run the &ldquo;Green for Micro&rdquo; programme on a national scale. The programme is designed to provide small businesses with tailored expert advice on how to drive sustainability. Qualifying businesses can access two days of intensive mentoring including a sustainability audit and action plan, designed to help "green" their operations.</p>  <p>  The Department and the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications recently launched the Climate Toolkit 4 Business. The Climate Toolkit 4 Business allows SMEs to input some simple information and get an estimate of their carbon footprint and a personalised action plan to reduce it. Each tailored action plan will include straight-forward practical instructions and highlights the relevant help that is available from Government, through agencies such as Enterprise Ireland, the Local Enterprise Offices and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland. The Toolkit will be particularly useful for SME and Micro enterprises at the beginning of their decarbonisation journey.</p>  <p>  Ensuring all enterprises have the assistance they require to decarbonise is essential to maintaining resilience and competitiveness, particularly as consumer preferences change over time. My Department, in conjunction with its agencies, will ensure all enterprises have the opportunity to continue to grow while making the green transition.</p></reply>

Section 11A of the Act provides that, where an employee believes the employer to be in breach of sections 9 or 10, they may pursue a complaint to the Workplace Relations Commission. It is also an offence under section 11 of the Act where an employer fails to comply with sections 9 or 10.</p>  <p>  There is also an obligation under section 12 which makes it mandatory on employers proposing a collective redundancy to notify the T&aacute;naiste, as the Minister for Enterprise Trade and Employment, of the proposed collective redundancy.  An employer is prohibited from issuing any notice of redundancy during the mandatory employee information and consultation period (required by the l977 Act) and until 30 days have elapsed from the date on which the T&aacute;naiste has been notified. I can confirm that the notification regarding proposed collective redundancies at Celbridge Manor Hotel (Clann Hospitality) was received in the T&aacute;naiste's office on the 11th of October.</p>  <p>  The Redundancy Payments Act 1967 places a legal obligation on employers to give notice of redundancy and make a statutory redundancy lump sum payment to an eligible employee.  However, the Social Insurance Fund provides a safety net for employees in situations where the employer cannot pay due to financial difficulties or insolvency. Negotiations on enhanced redundancy are a voluntary matter between the employer and former employees.</p>  <p>  If an employer has failed to pay redundancy entitlements they can refer a complaint to the Workplace Relations Commission for an adjudication and redress where appropriate.</p>  <p>  I understand that issues have arisen in relation to the employees' Pandemic Unemployment Payments (PUP). This matter is appropriate to my colleague Heather Humphreys, Minister for Social Protection.</p></reply>

I am taking it that the issue the Deputy is referring to relates to the requirement, as per Section 137 of the Companies Act 2014, that a company on the register of companies must have at least one EEA resident director. As an alternative, a company can either put a bond in place pursuant to Section 137(2) of the Companies Act 2014, or obtain a certificate, in accordance with Section 140, from the Registrar of Companies certifying that the company has a real and continuous link with one or more economic activities that are being carried on in the State. </p>  <p>  As a consequence of the UK leaving the European Union, and the ending of the transition period on 31st December 2020, with effect from 1st January 2021, UK (including Northern Ireland) resident directors of companies registered in Ireland are not considered resident in the EEA for the purposes of Section 137. Companies that previously relied on having a UK (including Northern Ireland) resident director to meet the requirements of Section 137 are required to either appoint an EEA resident director or else pursue one of the alternative options.  </p>  <p>  I understand that the number of companies impacted by this issue is not readily available but that in the region of 2,000 bonds have been received by the Companies Registration Office in 2021 in relation to the EEA residency requirement. </p></reply>

The Strategy includes 20 separate measures to safeguard public sector networks and essential services, to facilitate the development of the cybersecurity industry and to promote awareness raising and international cooperation. A number of measures are being led by my Department, and I am pleased to report that good progress is being made on their delivery.  </p>  <p>  As part of the implementation of the Strategy, earlier this year external consultants were commissioned to conduct a Capacity Review and to benchmark the NCSC with similar agencies in Europe and internationally. The report on the Capacity Review was received in June 2021 and in July the Government agreed a number of measures to support the continued development of the NCSC over the coming five years.The measures agreed include increasing the overall fulltime staffing complement of the NCSC to at least 70 over the next 5 years. with a first tranche of an additional 20 staff recruited by end 2022 bringing the serving complement to 45. A cyber security graduate training programme will also be introduced. In addition, the General Scheme of a Bill will be prepared for Government approval, to establish the NCSC on a statutory basis and provide for related matters including clarity around its mandate.</p>  <p>  My Department has also recently published the baseline cyber security standard to be applied by all Government Departments and Agencies. The NCSC has worked with colleagues across Government to develop the standard which will support public bodies to identify cyber risks, deploy appropriate mitigation measures, and protect personal and other important data. </p>  <p>  At the time of its publication, a commitment was made to conduct a mid-term review of the Strategy. This was also a recommendation in the recent NCSC Capacity Review. It is intended that this review will be conducted in the second half of 2022 and will take account of the evolving global threat landscape, EU cybersecurity policy developments such as the review of the Network and Information Services Directive, as well as lessons learned from the HSE cyber security incident in May 2021.</p></reply>

These targets represent a very significant increase in both the volume and depth of retrofit activity in Ireland. </p><p>COVID-19 related restrictions on construction activity in the residential sector between January and April have had a significant impact on activity this year. The SEAI estimates that approximately 16,000 retrofits will be supported by SEAI in 2021. Of this number 2,350 will be energy poverty retrofits and 4,700 will be B2 retrofits. To the end of October, 11,418 retrofits had been delivered, including 3,103 B2 retrofits and 1,625 energy poverty homes. </p><p>Budget 2022 commits &euro;202 million in carbon tax revenue to fund the SEAI residential and community retrofit schemes and a further &euro;10 million from the Exchequer for the Solar PV scheme. This investment will support over 22,000 home energy upgrades, including over 6,000 homes to a Building Energy Rating (BER) of B2 and over 4,500 upgrades under the SEAI energy poverty schemes. It will deliver warmer, healthier and more comfortable homes with lower energy bills. It will also reduce emissions from the residential sector and improve air quality.  </p><p>The detailed current and capital allocations for 2022 are being finalised as part of my Department's annual business planning process. The final Programme allocations will be included in the Revised Estimates Volume to be published later this month. These will be reflected in the SEAI business planning process. </p><p>The Department of Housing, Local Government &amp;amp; Heritage will invest a further &euro;85m as part of the Local Authority Retrofit Programme in 2022. This will deliver approximately 2,400 B2 / cost optimal retrofits next year. </p><p>The total spend that is attributable to labour costs and the average spend per unit of housing is not readily available. However, retrofitting homes is highly labour-intensive and creates quality sustainable jobs in local communities throughout the country, it is estimated that up to 60% of total retrofit cost can be labour. The request for detailed information has been sent to the SEAI and available data will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as possible upon receipt. </p><p>The SEAI's total spend and no. of homes completed on retrofitting schemes* for 2018 - 2020 were: </p><p>- 2018&euro;91.5m21,478</p><p>- 2019&euro;104.1m24,742</p><p>- 2020**&euro;78.25m17,671 </p><p>*Includes Better Energy Homes, Better Energy Warmer Homes, Warmth and Wellbeing, Deep Retrofit, Communities Energy Grants, Solar P.V and Better Energy Finance schemes. </p><p>** In 2020, in line with public health and Government guidelines in place to stop the spread of COVID-19, all works under SEAI funded schemes were advised to pause for a period of time.</p></reply>

The Strategy includes 20 separate measures to safeguard public sector networks and essential services, to support the development of Ireland's cyber security industry and ensure we play our part in defending a free, open, secure and stable cyberspace. A number of measures are being led by my Department, and good progress is being made on their delivery. For instance, my Department has recently published the baseline cyber security standard to be applied by all Government Departments and key agencies. The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has worked with colleagues across Government to develop the standard which will support public bodies to identify cyber risks, deploy appropriate mitigation measures, and protect personal and other important data. In addition, the Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) based within the NCSC has developed and deployed technology on the infrastructure of Government Departments to detect and warn of certain types of threat. </p>  <p>  Recognising the growing dependence on digital services and the evolving global cyber threat landscape, earlier this year Minister Ryan commissioned external consultants to conduct a Capacity Review and to benchmark the NCSC with similar agencies in Europe and internationally. Minister Ryan and I received the report in June 2021 and in July the Government agreed a number of measures to support the continued development of the NCSC over the coming five years. These measures include increasing the overall fulltime staffing complement of the NCSC to at least 70 over the next 5 years with a first tranche of an additional 20 staff recruited by end 2022 bringing the serving complement to 45. The Government also approved the preparation of a General Scheme of a Bill, for Government approval, to establish the NCSC on a statutory basis and provide for related matters including clarity around its mandate. </p></reply>

It was also informed by a public consultation and call for expert evidence. Outputs from the modelling have assisted in developing indicative ranges of emissions reductions for each sector of the economy by 2030 to achieve the 51% reduction, and set us on a pathway to achieving net zero emission by 2050. This included indicating the types of actions needed to deliver on our climate targets. The indicative sectoral ranges will be replaced by legally binding specific sectoral ceilings in the 2022 Climate Action Plan, following their adoption by Government once the economy-wide carbon budgets are approved by the Oireachtas.</p>  <p>  Some of the experts that fed into the preparation of the Climate Action Plan may separately have provided analytical input to the CCAC as part of its work on the carbon budgets. However, it is important to note that the CCAC acts as an independent advisory body, and any research or modelling undertaken by the CCAC is carried out under that mandate. This includes the development of the CCAC&rsquo;s recently proposed carbon budget programme. Details of the specific analysis used by the CCAC is outlined in its carbon budget technical report, which can be found at www.climatecouncil.ie.</p></reply>

CAP 2021 did not, however, include either cumulative or annual emissions savings on the specific contribution of the Plan&rsquo;s retrofit or heat pump deployment targets.</p><p>CAP 2021 also set out an ambitious National Retrofit Plan detailing how the targets to retrofit 500,000 dwellings and to deploy 600,000 heat pump installations would be met. CAP 2021 also included the following key commitments for the residential and commercial buildings sectors: </p><p>- Strengthening the existing NZEB requirements for new dwellings to effectively ban fossil fuels in new dwellings;</p><p>- Ramp-up of zero emissions heat in commercial buildings; and </p><p>- Increased targets for the roll-out of district heating.  </p><p>Aside from reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, residential retrofit brings additional benefits, including reduced energy costs, improved comfort and health, less dependency on fossil fuels, and improvements in indoor and outdoor air quality.</p><p>The National Retrofit Plan estimates that, between 2019 and 2025, almost 185,000 home energy upgrades will be delivered with over 83,000 to a B2/cost optimal level. When the emissions savings from the non-B2 upgrades are included, this is the equivalent of 120,000 B2 upgrades over the period.  As a result, there will a need to deliver, on average, approximately 75,000 B2-equivalent home upgrades per year from 2026 to 2030 to achieve the overall target of 500,000 by 2030.</p></reply>

It strikes a balance between increasing climate ambition, delivering on calls for increased climate finance and adaptation supports, and concrete actions to take forward in each of these areas. Focus must now turn to delivering on these commitments.In this regard, I welcome the work programme adopted in the COP26 Decision aimed to cut emissions in this decade. International cooperation is essential to effective climate action. Ireland will continue to work alongside our EU colleagues and with all Parties to accelerate climate action and ambition to deliver on the goals of the Paris Agreement.</p>  <p>  In Ireland, we are already taking decisive action. The Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021 commits Ireland to achieve a climate neutral economy by no later than 2050, and provides for a 51% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 2018 levels. The Act significantly strengthens the overarching climate governance framework and embeds a process of carbon budgeting, including sectoral emissions ceilings. Establishing these requirements in legislation places a clear obligation on this and future governments for sustained climate action. The recently published Climate Action Plan 2021 provides a detailed roadmap for meeting our climate ambition under the Act and sets out indicative ranges of emissions reductions for each sector of the economy. These ranges will become specific ceilings in the Climate Action Plan 2022, following the legal adoption of carbon budgets and sectoral emissions ceilings.</p>  <p>  Together these initiatives will ensure we deliver on our national commitment to achieve the targets agreed at COP 26.</p></reply>

The NDCA work programme annual cycle will be implemented in a manner that facilitates the analysis of insights gained from research and from engagement activity. These insights will constitute an evidence base to inform the NDCA, sectoral plans, and the Climate Action Plan. To facilitate this, a behavioural study will be carried out every two years, together with ad-hoc qualitative research. A national climate change behavioural insights and implementation unit has been established in the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and a national social and behavioural advisory group on climate action will also be established.</p>  <p>  In this regard, my Department has provided funding for the EPA&rsquo;s &ldquo;Climate Change in the Irish Mind&rdquo; project, the first report of which was launched last week. This project is a baseline study of climate change beliefs, policy preferences and behaviour of the Irish public to climate change, and is based on a survey of more than 4,000 Irish people during the summer of 2021 conducted by Behaviours and Attitudes.</p>  <p>  Key findings of the research are:</p>  <p>  - Irish people are in almost full agreement that climate change is happening and 85% are worried about it.</p>  <p>  - 91% of people say climate change is important to them personally, and 79% say climate change should be either a &ldquo;very high&rdquo; or &ldquo;high&rdquo; priority for the Government of Ireland.</p>  <p>  - Irish people strongly support a range of policies to address climate change. People also think that climate action will increase jobs, economic growth and quality of life (78%).</p>  <p>  This, as part of the wider research programme, will provide valuable insights to inform the development of policies, measures and actions that will support people in order to drive necessary sectoral demand shifts and behavioural change .</p></reply>

Since 2019, ocean and offshore energy research and innovation has been funded through SEAI&rsquo;s RD&amp;D programme.</p>  <p>  SEAI has developed and funds test and demonstration facilities for ocean energy technologies in Ireland. The LiR National Ocean Test Facility, based in Ringaskiddy, Co. Cork consists of state-of-the-art wave tanks and electrical rigs that allow for scaled testing in a controlled environment.</p>  <p>  The Marine Institute is collaborating with SEAI, MaREI (UCC) and Bluewise Marine to develop a national test and demonstration facility in north Galway Bay, near Spiddal. This ocean energy test site is for marine energy and technology. The Atlantic Marine Energy Test Site (AMETS) is being developed by the SEAI to facilitate testing of full-scale wave energy converters in an open ocean environment. AMETS will be located off Annagh Head, in County Mayo and will be connected to the national grid. SEAI runs the Ocean Energy Ireland Portal, which offers a guide to marine renewable energy development in Ireland. SEAI is also part of a pan-European research consortium, funded by EU Interreg, focused on Ocean Power Innovation Network (OPIN). </p>  <p>  To deliver on the Climate Action Plan, the SEAI is commencing the preparation of an offshore/ocean roadmap to support the development and rollout of the technologies. The roadmap will outline targets, develop pathways and establish timelines for the deployment of the technologies. It will highlight key decision points, identify enablers and establish owners of each task. </p></reply>

These targets represent a very significant increase in both the volume and depth of retrofit activity in Ireland.</p><p>COVID-19 related restrictions on construction activity in the residential sector between January and April have had a significant impact on activity this year. The SEAI estimates that approximately 16,000 retrofits will be supported by SEAI in 2021. Of this number 2,350 will be energy poverty retrofits and 4,700 will be B2 retrofits. To the end of October, 11,418 retrofits had been delivered, including 3,103 B2 retrofits and 1,625 energy poverty homes. </p><p>Budget 2022 commits &euro;202 million in carbon tax revenue to fund the SEAI residential and community retrofit schemes and a further &euro;10 million from the Exchequer for the Solar PV scheme. This investment will support over 22,000 home energy upgrades, including over 6,000 homes to a Building Energy Rating (BER) of B2 and over 4,500 upgrades under the SEAI energy poverty schemes. It will deliver warmer, healthier and more comfortable homes with lower energy bills. It will also reduce emissions from the residential sector and improve air quality.  </p><p>The detailed current and capital allocations for 2022 are being finalised as part of my Department's annual business planning process. The final Programme allocations will be included in the Revised Estimates Volume to be published later this month. These will be reflected in the SEAI business planning process. </p><p>The Department of Housing, Local Government &amp;amp; Heritage will invest a further &euro;85m as part of the Local Authority Retrofit Programme in 2022. This will deliver approximately 2,400 B2 / cost optimal retrofits next year. </p><p>The total spend that is attributable to labour costs and the average spend per unit of housing is not readily available. However, retrofitting homes is highly labour-intensive and creates quality sustainable jobs in local communities throughout the country, it is estimated that up to 60% of total retrofit cost can be labour. The request for detailed information has been sent to the SEAI and available data will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as possible upon receipt. </p><p>The SEAI's total spend and no. of homes completed on retrofitting schemes* for 2018 - 2020 were: </p><p>- 2018&euro;91.5m21,478</p><p>- 2019&euro;104.1m24,742</p><p>- 2020**&euro;78.25m17,671 </p><p>*Includes Better Energy Homes, Better Energy Warmer Homes, Warmth &amp;amp; Wellbeing, Deep Retrofit, Communities Energy Grants, Solar P.V and Better Energy Finance schemes. </p><p>** In 2020, in line with public health and Government guidelines in place to stop the spread of COVID-19, all works under SEAI funded schemes were advised to pause for a period of time.</p></reply>

The NBP will ensure that in all such cases a future proofed high speed broadband network will be built to serve these premises and work to deliver on this is underway.  </p>  <p>  Despite the unprecedented challenges presented by the Covid-19 pandemic, NBI has made steady progress on delivery of the new high speed fibre broadband network under the National Broadband Plan with almost 35,000 premises available to order and pre-order across 13 counties (Carlow, Cavan, Clare, Cork, Galway, Kerry, Limerick, Louth, Monaghan, Roscommon, Tipperary, Wexford and Wicklow). NBI has advised that over 282,000 premises in the Intervention Area across all counties have been surveyed and build work is underway for more than 120,000 premises, demonstrating the project is reaching scale. </p>  <p>  In addition to the challenges to the delivery of the NBP due to the Covid-19 pandemic, NBI has faced a range of other challenges due to the sheer scale and complexity of rolling out fibre to the home in a rural environment. These include significant tree trimming to ensure cable can be placed on overhead poles, remediation of ducting that has been in place for many decades, the co-ordination of hundreds of contracting crews and addressing the many issues arising week on week which could not have been foreseen until the build crews commenced work on the ground. My Department has worked closely with NBI to put in place a remedial plan under the Contract. </p>  <p>  NBI has implemented a number of measures to help lessen the impact that these challenges have had on the rollout including:-</p>  <p>  - Increasing the rate of pole replacement and duct remediation per month;</p>  <p>  - Bringing in additional NBI resources;</p>  <p>  - Earlier procurement of material used in the build stages; and</p>  <p>  - Bringing in additional subcontractors</p>  <p>  The focus for 2022 is to continue to deliver momentum in the build programme, catch up on the delays experienced and plan for acceleration. Final targets for 2022 are expected to be agreed early in the new year. </p></reply>

Following on from the enactment of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act in July, I recently published the Climate Action Plan 2021 which sets out how Ireland will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 51% by 2030 relative to 2018, and puts us on a pathway to achieving climate neutrality no later than 2050.     </p>  <p>  My Department is also currently preparing a Whole-of-Government Circular Economy Strategy which will set out policies, measures and actions to support moving away from today's 'take-make-waste' model of production to more sustainable production and consumption, which will support climate mitigation - an OECD study of four countries' greenhouse gas emissions found that emissions from materials management accounted for between 55% and 65% of national emissions.   </p>  <p>  I am also finalising a new Clean Air Strategy, and developing a comprehensive regime for the regulation of domestic solid fuels. The Strategy will outline how we will enhance and protect the quality of the air we breathe and realise the full environmental and health benefits of cleaner air. It will set out a pathway, based on a comprehensive cross-Government  programme of policies and measures, that will tackle all sources of air pollution, including those from transport, agriculture, and the commercial and residential sectors.</p>  <p>   In addition, my Department is active in setting policies and standards for radiation and noise, and is responsible for the environmental aspects of policy on soils, genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and chemicals. The Department also funds the work of the Environmental Protection Agency which is responsible for protecting and improving the environment as a valuable asset for the people of Ireland.  </p></reply>

Ireland will continue to work alongside our EU colleagues and countries outside the EU to accelerate climate action and ambition to deliver on the goals of the Paris Agreement. The &lsquo;Glasgow Climate Pact&rsquo;, while reflecting a compromise of positions and adopted by consensus of all Parties concerned, keeps alive the ambition of restricting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees. Focus must now turn to ensuring real emission reductions by 2030. In this regard, I welcome the work programme adopted in the COP26 Decision aimed to cut emissions in this decade. </p>  <p>  The EU will play its part and aims to be climate-neutral by 2050. This objective is at the heart of the European Green Deal and in line with the EU&rsquo;s commitment to global climate action under the Paris Agreement. The EU and its Member States, acting jointly, submitted an updated Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to the UNFCCC on 17 December 2020, which confirmed a commitment to a binding target of a net domestic reduction of at least 55% in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 1990. Legislative proposals to implement the new EU 2030 target have been presented by the European Commission in their "Fit for 55" package, and additional effort will be asked of all Member States, including Ireland. </p>  <p>  Ireland has welcomed and supports the increased EU ambition. It is consistent with the national approach, as the Government is committed to achieve net zero emissions by no later than 2050 and a 51% emissions reduction by 2030. These commitments have now been given legal force by the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021.</p></reply>

The plans and strategies established on a statutory footing under the Act will require that policies are put in place to ensure carbon budget ceilings are not breached. Putting these requirements in legislation places a clear obligation on this and future governments for sustained climate action.</p>  <p>  The Climate Change Advisory Council (CCAC) has recently proposed its initial carbon budget programme comprising three consecutive five-year economy-wide carbon budgets for the periods 2021-2025 and 2026-2030, and a provisional budget for 2031-2035. Not less than 12 months prior to the expiry of each carbon budget the Advisory Council shall prepare and submit to me, or my successor(s), a proposed carbon budget in respect of the period following the third such budget in the carbon budget programme. In this manner, the carbon budget framework will support long-term planning and policy continuity, but similarly ensure that budgets and policies are developed in accordance with the most up-to-date scientific evidence.</p>  <p>  The Act explicitly provides for evolution in national climate policy in line with developments in scientific evidence and best practice. When preparing the annual Climate Action Plan and National Long-Term strategy which set out the practical policies and measures that we must implement to achieve our national climate objective, the Minister for Climate Action is required under the Act to account for the relevant scientific or technical advice and any recommendations or advice of the Advisory Council. Furthermore, the Act specifically provides for &ldquo;the fact that the means of achieving a climate neutral economy and other measures to enable the State to pursue the national climate objective may not yet be fully identified and may evolve over time through innovation, evolving scientific consensus and emerging technologies&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  We have introduced an ambitious and robust best practice climate action framework, which will enable Ireland to continue to develop and implement effective climate action policy, now and into the future, in line with our national climate objective.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-12-14a.355.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021121400078#WRJ00400"><p>The Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Acts 2015 to 2021, commit Ireland to achieve a climate neutral economy by no later than 2050, and provide for a 51% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 2018 levels. The significantly strengthened legally binding framework under the Acts, with clear targets and commitments set in law, will help ensure that Ireland achieves its climate goals and obligations in the near and long-term.  </p>  <p>  To deliver upon the ambition set out in the Acts, the Government published Climate Action Plan 2021 in November. The 2021 Plan identifies the actions necessary to achieve our emissions reductions targets for each sector of the economy, based on their respective starting points, and the relative difficulty, costs, speed, and benefits, of reducing emissions. The recently announced &euro;165 billion National Development Plan (NDP) has been designed to ensure it supports the Government's climate ambitions. For the first time in Ireland, climate and environmental assessment of the NDP measures has been undertaken, along with an assessment of the alignment of the NDP as a whole with the principle of a green recovery. </p>  <p>  Far from negatively impacting the economy, embracing and properly managing this necessary transition, including in the areas the retrofitting and renewable energy sector, the circular economy, clean mobility, green and blue infrastructure, sustainable agriculture and the bio-economy, will create high quality employment opportunities that will be a source of significant employment growth over the coming decades, as well as supporting a stable tax base.</p>  <p>In fact the reality we face is that failure to rapidly move to a carbon-neutral economic model will have far reaching negative impacts on the economy and the public finances; undermine the long-term, sustainable competitiveness of the economy; and lock Ireland into a redundant fossil-fuel based economic model. This will cause the most significant disruptions to the Irish economy that have ever been experienced, and will certainly strain all of our Governmental and societal structures, resulting in significant cost and inequitable outcomes.   </p></reply>

This consultation sought submissions from operators who wished to have their existing high speed broadband networks or plans to invest in high speed broadband networks over the following 7 years to be included on the Department&rsquo;s High Speed Broadband Map. The Map shows the areas targeted by commercial operators to provide high speed broadband services and the areas included in the State Intervention Area under the National Broadband Plan. The High Speed Broadband Map is available at www.broadband.gov.ie and is colour coded and searchable by address and Eircode. The map indicates those premises that are in the AMBER area and will be served by the new high speed broadband network being delivered by NBI on behalf of the State and those in the BLUE area that will be served by commercial operators.</p>  <p>  Despite the unprecedented challenges presented by the Covid-19 pandemic, National Broadband Ireland has made steady progress on delivery of the new high speed fibre broadband network under the National Broadband Plan with over 282,000 premises surveyed or with survey underway across all counties and almost 150,000 premises with build currently underway or complete. NBI has advised that  almost 35,000 premises are available to order and pre-order across 13 counties as of 3 December.  I am advised by NBI that, over 7,000 premises in County Kildare have now been surveyed. Surveys are complete in the Deployment Areas of Curragh Camp and Donedea covering areas including Suncroft, Kildare, Pollardstown, Rathbride, Martinstown, Johnstown, Curryhills, Allenwood North, Downings North and Brockagh. I am further advised that over 3,000 premises in County Kildare currently have build underway as part of the Blessington, Carlow and Dunboune/Clonee Deployment Areas. </p>  <p>  Further details are available on specific areas within County Kildare through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. NBI has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries. Given the scale and complexity of delivery of the new high speed broadband network under the NBP, I am advised that any dates provided by NBI on its website are based on the best available information at the time and may be subject to change.</p>  <p>  Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 3 December, 424 BCP sites have been installed by NBI across the country and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for schools. BCP locations in each county were selected in conjunction with the Broadband Officer in each Local Authority, in order to find the appropriate mix of locations to reap the maximum benefits. There are 3 BCP sites installed and connected in County Kildare at Crookstown Further Education and Training and Community Centre, Lullymore Heritage Park and Bigstone Community Hall. Further details can be found at nbi.ie/bcp-map. I am advised that no further public BCPs are planned for Co Kildare at this time but it is worth noting that Kildare already has a significant number of hubs that fall outside the Intervention Area. </p>  <p>  My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband, within the Intervention Area, for connection over the term of the NBP. In this regard, an acceleration of this aspect of the National Broadband Plan was announced in December which will see some 679 primary schools connected to high speed broadband by 2022, well ahead of the original target delivery timeframe of 2026. Saint David's National School and Rathmore National School in County Kildare were included as part of this initiative and have since been connected. Scoil N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta Cill Cae, Scoil N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta Na Cloiche Moire, Killashee National School, Churchtown National School, Scoil N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta Naomh Iopseh, North Kildare Educate Together School, St Anne&rsquo;s National School and Kilberry National School are due to be connected in the coming months. Further details are available on the NBI website at nbi.ie/primary-schools-list/</p></reply>

The Government is committed to a just transition in the Midlands region and has dedicated significant funding to supporting workers, companies and communities affected by the closure of the peat-fired power stations and the end of peat harvesting by Bord na M&oacute;na. </p><p>As part of this commitment, the Just Transition Commissioner was appointed in November 2019 with the mandate to engage with those affected by the accelerated exit from peat for electricity generation, and to recommend to Government the essential elements of a just transition for those workers and communities. The Commissioner has made an important contribution to the Government's overall just transition response in the region, helping to facilitate dialogue, and bringing forward concerns from affected communities, residents, workers, and businesses. </p><p>The Government has responded to the Commissioner&rsquo;s recommendations by publishing an Implementation Plan for the Midlands Region, as part of the 2021 Climate Action Plan.  The key responsibilities, steps and timelines to deliver the actions under this Implementation Plan will shortly be published as part of the Annex of Actions to the Climate Action Plan. </p><p>I have had various engagements with the Commissioner during 2021, most recently in July in a meeting with both the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste. We have discussed a range of matters including the Department&rsquo;s proposed response to the Commissioner&rsquo;s recommendations in his progress reports, progress with the delivery of funding into the region, and the Commissioner&rsquo;s work for the remainder of 2021. In addition, the work of the Commissioner continues to be supported by my Department on an ongoing basis. </p><p>As I have noted previously, given the significant progress that has already been achieved, the Government does not propose to continue the Commissioner's term beyond the end of his current mandate which concludes at the end of this year. I look forward to receiving the Commissioner&rsquo;s final report and recommendations and being further briefed by the Commissioner at that stage.</p><p>The Midlands Regional Transition Team, which is convened by the Midlands Local Authorities, continues to provide an important forum for the Local Authorities, State Agencies and others to coordinate their ongoing work and to engage with Government in relation to just transition in the region. My Department will continue to engage with and support the work of this group into the future as the Midlands Implementation Plan is delivered.  <i></i></p></reply>

It will also facilitate the achievement of the goal to generate up to 80% of our electricity from renewable sources by 2030. A resilient and well-connected energy infrastructure is vital for Ireland's economic well-being and the ability to respond to the future needs of energy consumers. </p>  <p>  The option of undergrounding the North-South Interconnector has been comprehensively assessed on several occasions. Most recently, the key finding from the International Expert Commission's report of October 2018 was that an overhead line remains the most appropriate option for this critical electricity infrastructure.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, I decided to commission a further short review to assess if the overall finding from the 2018 report remains valid. The terms of reference for this study were published on my Department's website on 21 April. On 7 May, my Department initiated a procurement process to appoint an independent expert to undertake the review. International consultants were subsequently engaged and their work is well advanced at this stage. I expect the review will be completed shortly.</p>  <p>  The system operators, EirGrid and ESB Networks, always seek to work in close collaboration with landowners and stakeholders in the delivery of electricity infrastructure. Both companies are engaging with those living closest to the route of the interconnector. EirGrid has already activated a variety of engagements locally, including the appointment of community liaison officers and a mobile information unit active in the area. I expect such engagements will assist in ensuring that communities are fully engaged in the delivery of the project as consented.   </p></reply>

It is estimated that Irish airports and airlines will have received approximately &euro;440 million under these measures by the end of 2021.  </p>  <p>  Government recognises that Aviation makes significant direct and indirect contributions in the regions, providing for high quality jobs within the aviation sector as well as through the various ancillary services that are provided to airports, the airlines, and in the local economy. </p>  <p>  Given this, in addition to these horizontal supports, over &euro;165 million in aviation specific supports will have been allocated to Irish Airports this year, including PSO air services, by the end of 2021.  &euro;21.3 million was made available to  Donegal, Ireland West and Kerry Airports under the Regional Airports Programme 2021-2025. A further &euro;32.1 million was made available to Cork and Shannon Airports under a bespoke COVID-19 Regional State Airports Programme in 2021. This investment in our regional airports will ensure airport compliance with EU safety and security related obligations.  The PSO Air Service between Donegal and Dublin and Kerry to Dublin (until Ryanair began operating the Kerry route in July) was also supported by Exchequer funding</p>  <p>  Furthermore, it was recognised in the National Economic Recovery Plan that additional support may be required to support the aviation sector&rsquo;s recovery as European and international air transport resumed.  Given this, by end 2021 a  further &euro;116 million will have been  distributed under a Covid Supplementary Support Scheme to our airports.  Funding under this Scheme will compensate our smaller regional airports for the damage caused to them by Covid, as well as providing our State airports with flexibility to roll out route incentives/charge rebates with a view to supporting recovery and growth of connectivity.</p>  <p>  In 2022, funding of &euro;36 million will be provided by Government under the Regional Airports Programme 2021-2025, supporting regional airports of Shannon, Cork, Ireland West, Donegal and Kerry.  This budget allocation represents a significant increase in funding available under the Programme in 2022 which takes account of the broadening of the Programme to include Shannon and Cork Airports.</p>  <p>  Government is fully cognisant of the ongoing and deep impact of the pandemic on the aviation sector. This level of funding provided to date, clearly demonstrates Government&rsquo;s commitment to this sector and to those whose livelihoods have been so negatively impacted by this crisis. As was the case in 2021, Government will continue to keep Aviation Supports under review in 2022.</p></reply>

The reasons this settlement exceeds the original construction contract price include the fact that the Public Works contract makes provision for compensation events and for additional works to be instructed. There were several instructions issued over the course of the works.  Additionally, upgrading the existing M7 carriageway to 3 lanes during live traffic required significant traffic management and the project experienced multiple delays due to this challenge.  Also, the Osberstown interchange and Sallins Bypass sections of the project involved the construction of a new interchange over live motorway traffic which created additional complexities. There were also accommodation works involving multiple stakeholders and alteration works by Statutory Undertakers and adapting to their required timelines caused unforeseen delays. </p>  <p>  A number of disputes arose between the Council and the main contractor and while some disputes were resolved by means of the Contract Disputes Management Procedures, a significant number were referred to conciliation. Following an extensive process the Conciliator recommended a final account settlement agreement which was accepted by both parties to the Contract.</p></reply>

There are no waiting area facilities available in any of the centres for either the learner or the instructor. The learner is contacted by phone while he or she is outside the centre and is then invited inside by the driver tester. </p>  <p>  The decision to close public toilet and waiting facilities has been taken by the Road Safety Authority in the interests of public safety and as part of its overall Covid 19  Resumption of Services Protocols and in line with Health and Safety risk assessment procedures which had to be adopted as part of the RSA's resumption plans. </p>  <p>  Allowing additional persons to enter the test centre would mean potentially doubling the number of attendees at any given time.  The only way to do this without risk to public health would be to reduce the number of tests being provided.  In a situation where the RSA is already working to reduced backlogs built up during the pandemic, this would not be in the public interest.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to 7% average annual emissions reduction to 2030; ultimately, the goal is for a zero-emission mobility system by 2050. The national car and van fleet accounts for almost 60% of all land transport emissions, and so a transition to low emissions vehicles, including EVs, is a necessary step-change to effect a substantial reduction in transport emissions. </p><p>The Government has already committed significant funding to support low emitting vehicles through the National Development Plan, which currently includes an allocation of almost &euro;500 million for the period 2021-2025 and additional support from the Climate Action Fund.  </p><p><b>Budget 2021</b></p><p>Responsibility for electric vehicle policy transferred to my Department in 2021 along with the EV programme allocation which can be broken down as follows:  <table>    <tr>       <th>Capital</th>       <th>Current</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&euro;36,500,000</td>       <td>&euro;600,000</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>In addition, my Department allocated &euro;15m to support the uptake of electric vehicles, in the taxi, hackney and limousine sector via the eSPSV grant scheme in 2021.  <table>    <tr>       <th>Scheme</th>       <th>Budget Allocation (Capital)</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>eSPSV grant scheme</td>       <td>&euro;15,000,000</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>In addition, an alternatively fuelled heavy-duty vehicle grant scheme was launched earlier this year to encourage operators in making the move towards more environmentally friendly models. &euro;3m has been committed to this scheme with further funding to become available in 2022. </p><p>The Electric Vehicle Toll Incentive Scheme was launched in 2018 to encourage private car commuters who regularly use tolled roads to consider switching to an EV. Under the Scheme, BEVs and PHEVs qualify for 50% and 25% toll reductions respectively up to a maximum &euro;500 annual threshold for private vehicles and &euro;1,000 for commercial vehicles. The Scheme received &euro;2m in funding in 2021 and it will continue to be funded in 2022. </p><p><b>Budget 2022</b></p><p>&euro;100m has been allocated in 2022 to ensure the continued transition to electric vehicles.  This is an almost doubling of the provision made available in 2021 and underpins the Government&rsquo;s commitment to making electric vehicles accessible to all. This funding will continue to incentivise the switch to electric vehicles as well as enabling the expansion of a fast and rapid electric vehicle charging network to stay ahead of demand. </p><p>Preparations are underway to establish an appropriately staffed and resourced Office of Low Emission Vehicles.  Dedicated funding will be allocated to the OLEV as a part of the funds allocated to supporting a switch to electric vehicles in 2022.</p></reply>

Of those five projects, two &ndash; DART+ Fleet and DART+ Coastal North &ndash; are of particular relevance to the current Northern Line. </p><p>This week, following Government approval, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has signed a new ten-year framework with Alstom to provide new trains for DART. This DART+ Fleet project will benefit the current Northern Line as 65 of the 95 units ordered this week are for delivery to the Northern Line and will enter service by 2025. These new DART trains will bring Northern Line passengers a greater level of comfort and accessibility than existing fleet and also mean a consistent use of DART fleet across the Northern Line to Drogheda by 2025.  </p><p>In relation to the overhead electrification as part of DART+ Coastal North, the next significant milestone in that project is next year&rsquo;s launch of the non-statutory public consultation process. That process will inform the overall development of the project. Once the non-statutory public consultation process has been completed I would expect the DART+ Coastal North project to be submitted for Decision Gate 1 approval under the <i>Public Spending Code</i>, just as the DART+ West project was recently submitted and approved by Government. I look forward to seeing citizens and public representatives input into those non-statutory consultation processes next year. </p><p>Ultimately cost and schedule estimates for DART+ Coastal North will not be set until Decision Gate 3 stage and the focus at the moment is on the consultation processes next year and also welcoming the new DART+ Fleet to the Northern Line by 2025. </p></reply>

Exemptions from VAT for certain activities in the public interest are set out in Chapter 2 of Title IX of the Directive. These provisions are transposed into Irish legislation in Part 1, Schedule 1, VAT Consolidation Act 2010. Paragraph 2(5) of Schedule 1 provides for an exemption in respect of the supply of professional dental services.</p>  <p>  The exemption from VAT in respect of dental services is not dependent on the legal form of the taxable person supplying the service. It is the nature of the service that informs the VAT treatment. The legislation which transposes Article 132 of the Directive, and Revenue&rsquo;s interpretation of the legislation, ensures that the exemption from VAT to the supply of dental services is applied consistently and in a manner which is not dependent on the legal form of the person supplying the service. In accordance with the Directive and CJEU jurisprudence the VAT exemption applies to dental services provided by a clinic, a principal dentist, or by an associate dentist, where those services are provided to a patient.</p>  <p>  Where a principal dentist receives consideration in respect of fee sharing arrangements and the nature of services consists of the supply of facilities for the carrying on of a dental practice, Revenue views this as a taxable supply of services within the scope of VAT. The final consumer in this fee sharing arrangement is not a patient availing of a supply of dental services to which the exemption applies.</p>  <p>  Revenue has been clear at all times regarding the VAT treatment of dental fee sharing arrangements and has outlined its position in correspondence and meetings with the Irish Dental Association.</p></reply>

The EWSS has been a key component of the Government&rsquo;s response to the Covid-19 crisis. It is an economy-wide scheme that operates across all sectors.  </p><p>In money terms, the overall support provided to-date (9<sup>th</sup>December) by EWSS is over &euro;6.6 billion comprising direct subsidy payments of almost &euro;5.73 billion and PRSI forgone of &euro;902 million to 51,700 employers in respect of over 696,900 employees.  </p><p>The eligibility criteria for EWSS are based on self-assessment principles and the legislation provides that an employer must be able to demonstrate that his or her business will experience a 30% reduction in turnover or customer orders between 1 January and 31 December 2021, by reference to the corresponding period in 2019, as a result of business disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.  </p><p>Following the agreement of Government on 3 December 2021, my Department and Revenue sought to develop a proposal to modify the Covid Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS) to provide for a supplementary subsidy (in addition to EWSS) for businesses which are subject to the latest restrictions on operating.  The objective of the modified scheme was to provide targeted, timely and sector-specific support to supplement the reduced EWSS payments to the sector.  </p><p>However, on further consideration and analysis of the data on CRSS, it proved to be administratively complex to design such a scheme and it would not be possible to have it operational ahead of Christmas as was hoped.  The proposed modifications which included a change to both the turnover threshold and the rate, as well as consideration of a higher weekly cap, had the potential to significantly increase the cost of the scheme, particularly in the context of uncertainty around the trajectory of Covid-19 and the impact of the Omicron variant.  </p><p>Instead, maintaining the enhanced rates of subsidy under the EWSS offers a relatively more efficient and effective way to support affected businesses in the immediate term. As such, the Government decided, and it was announced on Thursday last (9<sup>th</sup>December), that the enhanced rates of EWSS subsidy would apply for a further two months, December 2021 and January 2022. This will give certainty to businesses when they need it most.  </p><p>The Government and I have been clear that there will be no cliff edge to supports for employers but we have also been clear that the EWSS cannot run indefinitely, nor is it sustainable to continue with the enhanced rates for a prolonged period of time given the very substantial costs to the Exchequer.</p><p>As such, from 1 February 2022, the original two-rate structure of &euro;203 per week and &euro;151.50 per week will apply; for March and April 2022 the flat rate subsidy of &euro;100 per week will apply and the scheme will end on 30 April 2022.</p><p>The CRSS will remain in place to support businesses who are required to close or significantly restrict customers from accessing their business premises, and who meet the qualifying criteria.  Under the relevant legislation, the CRSS was due to end on 31 December 2021 but is now being extended to the end of January 2022 under the same Government decision of 9 December as mentioned above.  Provision is also being made to allow me, as Minister for Finance, to extend the CRSS up to 30 April 2022 by Ministerial Order if deemed necessary. </p><p>Amendment to the Finance Bill 2021 are being brought forward this week to give effect to the EWSS and CRSS changes mentioned.</p><p>Finally, as has been the case throughout the pandemic, the Government will continue to monitor developments closely.</p></reply>

While Finance Act 1990 had introduced anti-avoidance rules that are known as the &ldquo;offshore funds&rdquo; regime, Finance Act 2001 (section 72) amended the offshore funds regime to provide for gross roll-up in certain offshore funds that were similar to the Irish funds within the gross roll-up regime.</p><p>The general thrust of the regime is that there is no annual tax on income or gains arising within the investment. However, exit tax must be deducted on the occurrence of a &ldquo;chargeable event&rdquo;. Exit tax applies to the profit element of each chargeable event, and chargeable events originally included &ndash;</p><p>- the making of relevant payments (which includes any dividend),</p><p>- the redemption of the investment, and</p><p>- the transfer by an investor of their investment.</p><p>Finance Act 2006 introduced the eight-year deemed disposal for all investments that benefited from gross roll-up: that is, investments in Irish funds, investments in life policies and investments in offshore funds that were similar to Irish funds.  The eight-year deemed disposal was introduced as a new category of &lsquo;chargeable event&rsquo; and is designed specifically to prevent the indefinite deferral of taxation.</p><p>In relation to a deemed disposal, the amount to which exit tax applies is the growth in value of the investment.  When calculating the amount on which exit tax applies for a deemed disposal, any amounts already paid out as dividends are excluded.  Any tax collected on a deemed disposal is available as a credit against any tax arising on a subsequent actual disposal. </p><p>Tax on chargeable events is returned to Revenue in three ways:</p><p>1. The majority of Irish funds will deduct what is known as &ldquo;Investment Undertaking Tax&rdquo;, or IUT, on the happening of a chargeable event;</p><p>2. Irish life companies will deduct what is known as &ldquo;Life Assurance Exit Tax&rdquo;, or LAET, on the happening of a chargeable event; and</p><p>3. Irish individuals account, through their Form 11, for exit tax on the happening of a chargeable event in respect of offshore funds and certain Irish funds that could not have deducted exit tax (such as Irish Exchange Traded Funds where the chargeable event is the sale of the share on a stock exchange).</p><p>I am informed by Revenue that they can identify the amounts of IUT, LAET and income tax accounted for in respect of chargeable events, but it is not possible to provide a breakdown of the tax as between the amount relating to the eight-year deemed disposal and the amount relating to the other types of chargeable events. Therefore, it is not possible to provide information on how much tax would be forgone if the eight-year deemed disposal was to be removed.</p><p>The table below provides an estimated amount of overall exit tax, including IUT, LAET and income tax on certain offshore investments. <table>    <tr>       <th>Year </th>       <th>Investment Undertaking Tax </th>       <th>Life Assurance Exit Tax </th>       <th>Income Tax* </th>       <th>Total </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&euro;m </td>       <td>&euro;m </td>       <td>&euro;m </td>       <td>&euro;m </td>       <td>&euro;m </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020 </td>       <td>121 </td>       <td>124 </td>       <td>** </td>       <td>245 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019 </td>       <td>53 </td>       <td>128 </td>       <td>22*** </td>       <td>203 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018 </td>       <td>45 </td>       <td>165 </td>       <td>14 </td>       <td>224 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017 </td>       <td>40 </td>       <td>184 </td>       <td>20 </td>       <td>244 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016 </td>       <td>37 </td>       <td>228 </td>       <td>17 </td>       <td>282 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>* The estimate of Income Tax is derived by multiplying the reported gains relating to Offshore Funds in Panel E, row 322, in Form 11 regarding Gains taxable at 41%</p><p>** 2020 income tax amounts are not yet available</p><p>*** 2019 income tax amount is provisional</p></reply>

To date (9 December 2021), payments of approximately &euro;5.73 billion and PRSI credit of over &euro;902 million have been granted to 51,700 employers in respect of some 696,900 workers.</p>  <p>  The EWSS is operated on a self-assessment basis with the onus on applicants to satisfy themselves that they fully meet the eligibility criteria for the scheme as set down in the legislation and to self-declare to Revenue that they correctly qualify. </p>  <p>  Generally, for pay dates on or between 1 July 2021 and 30 April 2022,  to qualify for EWSS, a business must experience a minimum 30% reduction in turnover or customer orders in the period 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2021, due to Covid-19. A business must also have a valid tax clearance certificate. </p>  <p>  The reference period for businesses that started trading prior to 1 January 2019, is 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2019. However, some businesses may have only commenced operations during 2019, therefore, the EWSS provides alternative reference periods for those businesses, with a view to ensuring that they would have the opportunity to qualify for the scheme. </p>  <p>  The reference period for businesses that started trading between 1 January 2019 and 31 October 2019 is from their commencement date to 31 December 2019. For businesses that started trading on or after 1 November 2019, the reference period is the projected turnover or customer orders from 1 January 2021 (or when the business started, if later) to 31 December 2021, i.e. as if the pandemic had not occurred. The latter arrangement was put in place because no turnover, or relatively little turnover, in respect of 2019 exists, which should not be the case for businesses that were trading prior to 1 November 2019. </p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that the business in question started trading in August 2019 and as such is required to compare its turnover or customer orders for the period August to December 2021 against the equivalent period in 2019 in respect of pay dates falling between 1 July 2021 and 30 April 2022. The information provided by the business to Revenue in respect of 2021 (to date) confirmed an increase in turnover, rather than any reduction, when compared to 2019, thereby rendering it ineligible for the EWSS for the period in question. </p>  <p>  Finally, I am satisfied that the eligibility criteria for the EWSS, as provided for in the legislation, is sufficiently inclusive to cover the different scenarios that arise for businesses in fair and reasonable manner for the majority of businesses and I have no current plans to review the eligibility criteria.  </p></reply>

Adjusting PRSI to eliminate the very high marginal PRSI rate on additional income in the PRSI Transition Zone from &euro;18,304 to &euro;22,048 per annum.</p>  <p>  2. Set the basic rate for qualifying for the medical card at more than 30% above the comparable Jobseekers assistance rate. </p>  <p>  3. Replace the child element in Jobseekers payments and all other welfare schemes by substantially increasing Child Benefit, phasing out Working Family Benefit, and at the same time making the Child Benefit taxable. </p>  <p>  4. Significantly increase the income thresholds for access to social housing. Reform or remove the link between income and local authority rent.</p>  <p>  I would note that the above recommendations are beyond my policy remit as the Minister for Finance and as such it would not be appropriate for me to comment directly on these findings. As the Deputy will be aware, my colleague Minister Humphreys and her Department are responsible for social welfare issues while my colleagues Minister Donnelly and Minister O&rsquo;Brien have responsibility for medical cards and social housing, respectively. </p>  <p>  In relation to the suggestion to make Child Benefit payments taxable, at present Child Benefit payments are exempt from tax under section 194 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. I have no current plans to deviate from this position.  </p>  <p>  More generally in relation to the taxation of moderate to lower paid employees, I would draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to Budget 2022 income tax and USC measures. This included a substantial income tax package comprising of an increase of &euro;50 in each of the main tax credits &ndash; personal tax credit, employee tax credit and the earned income credit &ndash; from &euro;1,650 to &euro;1,700. An increase of &euro;1,500 in the income tax standard rate band for all earners was also announced. Further, the 2% rate band ceiling for USC will be increased for 2022 in line with the increase in the national minimum wage to ensure that a full-time adult worker who benefits from the increase in the hourly minimum wage rate of &euro;10.20 to &euro;10.50 will remain outside the top rates of USC.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-12-14a.495.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021121400081#WRM00500"><p>Section 28B of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 provides for the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) which is an economy-wide enterprise support for eligible businesses. EWSS provides a flat-rate subsidy to qualifying employers, based on the number of qualifying employees on the payroll. </p><p>As an economy-wide support, the EWSS has played a central role in supporting businesses, encouraging employment and helping to maintain the link between employers and employees since July 2020. To date (9 December 2021), payments of over &euro;5.73 billion and PRSI credit of over &euro;902 million have been granted to 51,700 employers in respect of some 696,900 workers.</p><p>The Finance (Covid-19 and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2021, signed into law on 19 July, provided for the extension of EWSS to 31 December 2021. It also provided that for employers to be eligible for the EWSS, they must be able to demonstrate that their business will experience a 30% reduction in turnover or customer orders for the calendar year 2021 compared to the calendar year 2019 and that this disruption to normal business is caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>As part of my Budget Day announcement I outlined that the EWSS will remain in place in a graduated form until 30 April 2022. While the scheme will be closed to new employers from 1 January 2022, eligible employers who are availing of EWSS at 31 December 2021 will continue to be supported by the scheme, if they so choose, until 30 April 2022. Therefore, in relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s question, if hospitality businesses were eligible in December 2021, remain registered for EWSS and received EWSS payments, they will continue to qualify for the EWSS supports in January 2022.  There is also the legislative requirement that employers must have a tax clearance certificate to be eligible to join the EWSS and, must continue to meet the requirements for tax clearance for the duration of the scheme.</p><p>The EWSS legislation requires that immediately at the end of each month, from the introduction of the scheme in August 2020 onwards, each employer availing of the scheme must carry out a self-review of its business circumstances and if it is manifest to the employer that it no longer meets the eligibility test for qualification for the scheme, then the employer must immediately cease claiming wage subsidy payments. </p><p>To assist employers in conducting a monthly review of its continuing eligibility for the scheme, Revenue have provided an <i>EWSS Eligibility Review Form</i>through its Revenue Online Service (ROS). From 21 July 2021, completing and submitting an <i>EWSS Eligibility Review Form</i>to Revenue has been necessary to avail of EWSS supports, with details of an employer&rsquo;s monthly eligibility review check to be submitted by the 15<sup>th</sup>of the following month.  For EWSS claims in 2022, the eligibility review undertaken on the last day of December 2021 will need to be completed and submitted to Revenue by 15 January 2022.  </p><p>Finally, as announced on 9 December last, it has been decided to extend the enhanced rates of EWSS for the months of December 2021 and January 2022 to give certainty to businesses when they need it most  and to help maintain the link between employers and employees in sectors adversely affected by the most recent public health restrictions.  From 1 February 2022, the original two-rate structure of &euro;203 per week and &euro;151.50 per week will apply; for March and April 2022, a flat rate subsidy of &euro;100 per week will apply and the scheme will end on 30 April 2022.  These changes are being provided for in Finance Bill 2021. </p><p>The Government and I have been clear that there will be no cliff edge to supports for employers but we have also been clear that the EWSS cannot run indefinitely, nor is it sustainable to continue with the enhanced rates for a prolonged period of time given the very substantial costs to the Exchequer.</p><p>At the same time, as has been the case since the start of the pandemic, the Government will continue to monitor developments closely. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-12-14a.501.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021121400081#WRM01100"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 213 to 215, inclusive, and 219 together.</p>  <p>  The Covid Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS) is a targeted support for businesses significantly impacted by restrictions introduced by the Government under public health regulations to combat the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. The support is available to companies, self-employed individuals and partnerships who carry on a trade or trading activities, the profits from which are chargeable to tax under Case I of Schedule D, from a business premises located in a region subject to Covid restrictions as set out in the relevant legislation. </p>  <p>  To qualify under the scheme a business must, under specific terms of the Covid restrictions, be required to either prohibit or significantly restrict, customers from accessing their business premises to acquire goods or services, with the result that the business either has to temporarily close or to operate at a significantly reduced level. For the purposes of CRSS, a qualifying &ldquo;business premises&rdquo; is a building or other similar fixed physical structure in which a business activity is ordinarily carried on.</p>  <p>  The CRSS applies to businesses carrying on trading activities from a business premises located in a region subject to restrictions, which requires the business to prohibit or considerably restrict customers from accessing their business premises and as a result, is operating at less than 25% of turnover in 2019.</p>  <p>  It is not sufficient that the trade of a business has been impacted because of a reduction in customer demand as a consequence of Covid-19.  The scheme only applies where, as a direct result of the specific terms of the Government restrictions, the business is required to either prohibit or significantly restrict access to its business premises. </p>  <p>  The cash payment is 10% of the average weekly turnover of the business in 2019 up to &euro;20,000 and 5% thereafter, subject to a maximum weekly payment of &euro;5,000, for each week that the business is affected by the Covid restrictions. </p>  <p>  With the easing of Covid restrictions in recent months many businesses are no longer significantly restricted from operating and therefore are no longer eligible for the CRSS. However, eligible businesses have been able to claim enhanced restart week payments to assist them with the costs of reopening.  A total of &euro;704m has been paid out under the CRSS in respect of 25,500 premises. </p>  <p>  The public health restrictions currently in force, require nightclubs and discotheques to remain closed until 9 January 2022 and they will be eligible to receive the CRSS until then.</p>  <p>  Under the relevant legislation, the CRSS was due to end on 31 December 2021 but is now being extended to the end of January 2022. Provision is also being made to allow the Minister to extend the CRSS up to 30 April 2022 by Ministerial order if deemed necessary. </p>  <p>  Following the agreement of Government on 3 December 2021, my Department and Revenue sought to develop a proposal to modify the CRSS to provide for a supplementary subsidy (in addition to EWSS) for businesses which are subject to the latest restrictions on operating.  The objective of the modified scheme was to provide targeted, timely and sector-specific support to supplement the reduced EWSS payments to the sector.  </p>  <p>  However, on further consideration and analysis of the data on CRSS, it proved to be administratively complex to design such a scheme and it would not be possible to have it operational ahead of Christmas as was hoped.  The proposed modifications which included a change to both the turnover threshold and the  rate, as well as consideration of a higher  weekly cap, had the potential to significantly increase the cost of the scheme, particularly in the context of uncertainly around the trajectory of Covid-19 and the impact of the  Omicron variant.  </p>  <p>  Therefore a decision was taken that a restoration of the higher EWSS rate was a relatively more efficient and effective way to support businesses in the immediate term. The CRSS  will remain in place to support businesses who are required to close or significantly restrict customers from accessing their business premises, and who meet the qualifying criteria.  </p>  <p>  I propose to introduce amendments to the Finance Bill 2021 to give effect to these changes in the Seanad this week. </p></reply>

In order to qualify for relief, the applicant must hold a Primary Medical Certificate issued by the relevant Senior Area Medical Officer (SAMO) or a Board Medical Certificate issued by the Disabled Driver Medical Board of Appeal. </p>  <p>  I have no role in relation to the granting or refusal of PMCs and the HSE and the Medical Board of Appeal must be independent in their clinical determinations. </p>  <p>  Certain other qualifying criteria apply in relation to the vehicle, in particular that it must be specially constructed or adapted for use by the applicant.</p>  <p>  To qualify for a Primary Medical Certificate an applicant must be permanently and severely disabled, and satisfy at least one of the following medical criteria, in order to obtain a Primary Medical Certificate:</p>  <p>  - be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs;</p>  <p>  - be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs;</p>  <p>  - be without both hands or without both arms;</p>  <p>  - be without one or both legs;</p>  <p>  - be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg;</p>  <p>  - have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.</p>  <p>  The current medical criteria medical criteria were included in the Finance Act 2020, by way of amendment to Section 92 of the Finance Act 1989.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-12-14a.509.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021121400081#WRM01900"><p>Section 28B of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 provides for the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) which is an economy-wide enterprise support for eligible businesses. EWSS provides a subsidy to qualifying employers, based on the number of qualifying employees on the payroll. </p>  <p>  As an economy-wide support, the EWSS has played a central role in supporting businesses, encouraging employment and helping to maintain the link between employers and employees since July 2020. To date (9 December 2021), payments of approximately &euro;5.73 billion and PRSI credit of over &euro;902 million have been granted to 51,700 employers in respect of some 696,900 workers.</p>  <p>  The EWSS legislation provides that for employers to be eligible for the EWSS, they must be able to demonstrate that their business will experience a 30% reduction in turnover or customer orders for the calendar year 2021 compared to the calendar year 2019 and that this disruption to normal business is caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.   I would also draw attention to the fact that, despite the exit from most public health restrictions during the summer, the eligibility criteria was not tightened in the Finance (Covid-19 and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2021 which was enacted in the summer and which extended the scheme beyond end-June 2021. In fact, the reference period to which the metric must be applied was broadened out in the above Act to span a full year thus effectively relaxing the conditionality to qualify to benefit from the scheme in most cases. </p>  <p>  Therefore, for most businesses, eligibility is determined by comparing the actual turnover or level of customer orders of the business for the calendar year 2021 with the turnover or level of customer orders of the business for the calendar year 2019. Many businesses were fully closed or limited in their capacity to trade due to the public health restrictions in place for the earlier months of 2021. This change in the EWSS assessment period meant that such businesses could generate the equivalent of up to 70% of their calendar year 2019 turnover or customer orders for the remainder of 2021 and still remain eligible to claim support under the scheme.  </p>  <p>As the Deputy will be aware, as part of my Budget Day announcement I outlined that the EWSS will remain in place in a graduated form until 30 April 2022 and that there will be no changes to the eligibility review period. While the scheme will be closed to new employers from 1 January 2022, eligible employers who are availing of EWSS at 31 December 2021 will continue to be supported by the scheme, if they so choose, until 30   April 2022.   </p>  <p>  As announced on 9 December last, it has been decided to extend the enhanced rates of EWSS for the months of December 2021 and January 2022 to give certainty to businesses when they need it most and to help to maintain employer/employee links.   From 1 February 2022, the original two-rate structure of &euro;203 per week and &euro;151.50 per week will apply; for March and April 2022 the flat rate subsidy of &euro;100 per week will apply and the scheme will end on 30 April 2022.</p>  <p>  As part of the deliberations associated with this most recent change, consideration was given to amending the reference period so that all businesses would have to demonstrate eligibility for EWSS in the period January to April 2022 by way of a 30% decrease in turnover compared with the same period in 2019.  However, for a number of reasons, including the fact that such a change could have the effect of excluding certain businesses who, in line with my Budget Day announcement, might have otherwise expected to be eligible for EWSS and who have planned accordingly, such an approach was not proceeded with.  Accordingly, I intend to follow the course outlined in Budget 2022, so that businesses who qualify for EWSS as at 31 December 2021 may continue to be supported by the scheme until 30 April 2022. </p></reply>

Under the EU VAT Directive and Irish VAT legislation the supply of building materials is liable to VAT at the standard rate, currently 23%.  Member states are not permitted to apply a VAT rate lower than the standard rate to building materials.  By way of special derogation from the general rule, however, Ireland is permitted to continue its long-standing practice of applying a reduced rate, currently 13.5%, to the supply of ready-to-pour concrete and certain concrete blocks but there are strict restrictions on this derogation, including that the rate cannot be reduced below 12%.  </p>  <p>  On the suggestion of a VAT compensation mechanism for purchasers, I am advised by Revenue that this is generally contrary to the operation of VAT. It is for this reason that Ireland has not introduced any new VAT refund orders since the 1980&rsquo;s and any changes to VAT refunds since then have been either by EU requirement or making minor changes to existing orders.</p>  <p>  As a general point of EU law, VAT is a tax on consumption and is applied to supplies being made by a person and not to supplies received by a person.  For that reason, it is not permissible to apply different VAT rates to different customers.  Therefore, it would not be possible to accept the proposal to apply a different rate of VAT to building materials supplied to particular categories of buyers, such as individual self-builders.</p>  <p>  In relation to self-build properties, substantial support is already available through the tax system for first-time buyers, including those self-building their first home. The Help to Buy (HTB) incentive gives a refund of Income Tax and Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) paid in Ireland over the previous four years, subject to limits outlined in legislation. Section 477C Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 outlines the definitions and conditions that apply to the HTB scheme. </p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy has raised the matter of the VAT rate on new builds in Northern Ireland. When it was within the EU, the UK, by way of special derogation from the general rule, was permitted to continue its long-standing practice of applying a zero rate of VAT to the supply of certain residential buildings.  </p></reply>

This relief is set out in section 825A of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997.</p><p>The relief effectively removes the foreign employment income from a liability to Irish tax where foreign tax has been paid on that employment income. In simple terms, the effect of the measure is that Irish tax will only arise where the individual has income other than income from a foreign employment.</p><p>The relief applies subject to certain conditions, which include the requirement that the duties of a qualifying employment are performed wholly outside the State in a country with which Ireland has a Double Taxation Agreement.  There is an exception in respect of merely incidental duties which may be performed in the State. </p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, the operation of this relieving measure is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.  Revenue understands that due to COVID-19, certain individuals whose duties of employment are normally performed outside the State, may be required to work from home in the State, which would result in them being ineligible for relief under Section 825A TCA 1997.  In recognition of this, on 23 March 2020, Revenue issued updated guidance on the COVID-19 hub of its website and notified by eBrief No. 046/20, to provide for a concession in respect of this relief as follows - &ldquo;<i>where employees are required to work from home in the State due to COVID-19, such days spent working at home in the State will not preclude an individual from being entitled to claim this relief, provided all other conditions of the relief are met. For example, the employment income must be fully subject to non-refundable foreign tax</i>.&rdquo; This concession initially applied in respect of the 2020 tax year and was later extended (on 21 December 2020) to the 2021 tax year.</p><p>Revenue continues to regularly review all COVID-19 related matters and, provided all other conditions of the relief are met, Revenue&rsquo;s temporary concession will be further extended into 2022, for the period that public health measures require employees to work from home. </p><p>The COVID-19 concessional treatment is only relevant to those individuals whose employment enables them to perform their duties from home.  Certain service type employments requiring in-person attendance at the workplace would not fall into this category and as such, these individuals would presumably not seek to claim the concession, as they would already qualify for the relief. </p><p>Further guidance on the relief and the extension of the concession in 2022 may be found in Tax and Duty Manual www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/tdm/income-tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax/part-34/index.aspx - Transborder Workers&rsquo; Relief.</p><p>I am aware that there have been calls to place this concessional treatment on a statutory footing so that individuals who are resident in the State but work outside the State for a non-resident employer can continue to avail of the relief if they exercise their duties of employment in the State. </p><p>During the debates on Finance Bill 2020, I undertook that this matter would be examined as part of the work of the Tax Strategy Group (TSG) for 2021. The resultant paper was discussed by the TSG as part of its deliberations on 8 September last.  The examination encompassed very detailed consideration of all relevant matters including the equity of treatment between Irish residents who pay tax in the State, the competitive position of Irish employers and the established principles of international tax. The review identified a number of significant concerns from a policy perspective when having regard to the interest of the wider body of taxpayers encompassing Irish resident employees and employers. The full TSG paper (TSG Paper 21/04) can be located here  - www.gov.ie/en/collection/d6bc7-budget-2022-tax-strategy-group-papers/. </p><p>This matter was discussed at both the Committee and Report Stages of Finance Bill 2021 in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and, in fact, it was during the Report Stage debate that I informed the House of Revenue's proposed extension of the temporary concessionary treatment into next year as already mentioned.  I and my Department continue to monitor the issue having regard to the comprehensive review carried out under the auspices of the TSG and the fundamental points which the TSG paper raises. </p><p>The Deputy may also wish to note that Ireland is exceptional in having a domestic relief such as Transborder Workers&rsquo; Relief. There is no comparable measure in the United Kingdom nor in many countries in mainland Europe that share land borders.</p></reply>

As of November this year, corporation tax receipts stood at &euro;13.6 billion.</p><p>These receipts are welcome, and a reflection of the success of our industrial policy in attracting high-quality firms to Ireland. There is evidence that, in particular, the pharmaceutical and ICT sectors have contributed to the record level of receipts received over the last two years. The continued strength in corporation tax revenues means that we are borrowing less than would otherwise be the case.</p><p>However, as I have stated on many occasions, corporation tax receipts are subject to exceptional volatility and unpredictability because, as the Deputy notes, receipts are vulnerable to the business decisions of a relatively small number of large, multinational firms, with the top ten payers accounting for more than half of all receipts in 2020. </p><p>Additionally, Government is planning for changes to the international tax environment which may impact upon revenues. Despite the recent clarity offered by Ireland signing up to the political agreement at the OECD Inclusive Framework, at this point it is too early to make any determination on the net costs or otherwise of implementation. There are numerous issues that remain to be addressed, negotiated and resolved at OECD and EU level, as well as within signatory countries.</p><p>Given the absence of such relevant information, Budget 2022 forecasts maintained the previous assumption of a &euro;2 billion net loss in corporate tax receipts by 2025 relative to baseline. This assumption will, of course, be kept under constant review and amended as appropriate as negotiations continue.</p><p>The volatility and unpredictability of corporation tax receipts underlies the importance of the medium-term framework set out in the <i>Summer Economic Statement</i>, which anchors budgetary policy via an expenditure rule. Keeping core spending growth in line with the trend growth rate of the economy will help ensure that expenditure policy is de-coupled from windfall tax revenue, such as any potential over-performance in corporation tax receipts in the years ahead. This will assist in reducing the over-reliance on corporation tax receipts going forward.</p><p>Finally, I have noted the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council&rsquo;s recommendation in its <i>Fiscal Assessment Report</i>in relation to the Rainy day fund and I will take this advice under consideration.</p><p>I will formally respond to the <i>Fiscal Assessment Report</i>in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

The current spike in energy prices arises principally from the global recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic in conjunction with supply constraint issues and is being witnessed across the European Union as well as many other regions. </p>  <p>  Wholesale electricity prices both in Ireland and across Europe have risen substantially in 2021, with high international gas prices, low levels of wind, increasing carbon prices (Emissions Trading System), a lingering 2020 winter, low gas storage reserves and gas supply issues in Europe all contributing to rising wholesale electricity prices.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Government today approved the establishment of the Electricity Costs Emergency Benefit Scheme under which a payment of &euro;100 will be made to each domestic electricity customer as a once off measure to mitigate the effects of the unprecedented rise in electricity prices on domestic electricity customers. </p>  <p>Separately, with regard to home heating fuels and taxation, the Deputy will be aware that a reduced rate of VAT applies to all home heating fuels.    In relation to the Carbon Tax increase, I have delayed its application on home heating fuels until May 2022 to allow for the passage of the winter heating season.  In addition, in line with Government policy, the additional revenues raised from the increase in carbon tax have been allocated to expenditure measures which ensure a just transition through targeted social welfare measures, investment in energy efficiency and through funding for the agricultural sector.  </p>  <p>  In light of the current upward trend in energy costs, an additional &euro;174 million in carbon tax revenues is being made available to the Department of Social Protection in 2022, an increase of &euro;105 million on the 2021 allocation of &euro;69 million.   </p>  <p>  This package of welfare measures is informed by ESRI research which finds that the net impact of the measures is progressive.   Analysis undertaken by the ESRI shows that as a result of this targeted policy approach, households in the bottom four income deciles will see all of the cost of the carbon tax increase offset, with the bottom three deciles being better off as a result of these measures. This is a tangible demonstration of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to achieving a Just Transition.    </p>  <p>  I would like to remind people that there are still very significant savings to be had by shopping around energy suppliers.  I would also note that the most effective way to reduce a household&rsquo;s energy bills permanently is through improving the energy efficiency of their home. The Government is providing a record level of support for energy efficiency this year. This will continue in 2022 with further investment. </p>  <p>  In the long run, the best way to protect Ireland from the impact of international fossil fuel prices is to reduce our dependence on them. We will achieve this through the progressive decarbonisation of Irish society and through the steps that will be taken to meet the Government&rsquo;s commitment to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.</p></reply>

The outcomes of Eurogroup discussions are communicated through the post Eurogroup press conferences and summing-up letters at:</p>  <p>www.consilium.europa.eu/en/council-eu/eurogroup/eurogroup-documents-register/.</p>  <p>  While the euro area has performed extremely well and the outlook is positive, we are very alert to the recent rise in prices, much of which reflects energy price developments. In fact, I invited the Director of the EU Agency for the Coordination of Energy Regulators (ACER), Christian Zinglersen, into our October Eurogroup meeting to discuss energy prices. At our most recent meeting in December, it is still firmly our view that the rise in prices is temporary and that inflation will ease in 2022.</p>  <p>  In relation to the Government&rsquo;s response to rising energy prices, in Budget 2022 the Minster for Public Expenditure and Reform announced a range of measures to tackle the rise in prices. These measures included increases to the fuel allowance as well as core welfare rates, which were also designed to counteract the impact of the carbon tax on low income households.  The specific measures were: </p>  <p>  -  An increase to the Qualified Child Payment of &euro;2 per week for children under 12 and &euro;3 per week for children over 12, which will protect low income families and reduce child poverty.</p>  <p>  -  An increase in the Living Alone Allowance of &euro;3 per week as people living alone are likely to have higher energy needs than average.</p>  <p>  -  An increase to the Fuel Allowance of &euro;5 per week to compensate a broad range of lower income households. This is combined with a broadening of the threshold for Fuel Allowance eligibility and an increase in the income allowed for the means test that is applied to applicants.</p>  <p>  -  An increase in the income threshold for the Working Family Payment of &euro;10 per week. </p>  <p>  The total cost of these interventions is projected at &euro;146 million in 2022.  Cumulatively, these measures will protect the most vulnerable but I would re-iterate the views of the European Institutions and the International Monetary Fund that the recent spike in prices is transitory. </p></reply>

The project was funded as a pathfinder initiative in the area of data analytics on the non-profit sector. Benefacts was initially co-funded with philanthropy, however in recent years the Department has been providing the majority of funding to the entity.</p>  <p>  In 2019, DPER received an independent report which it commissioned to provide analysis of the market for data on the non-profit sector. This report examined, inter alia, issues around the demand for the data concerned; methodologies and technologies used; the potential for direct provision by the State of these services itself, and; the maturity of the market to provide these services efficiently. On foot of this report, DPER undertook a review in 2020 which found that the business case for its continued funding of Benefacts was no longer justified and accordingly the decision was made to terminate funding. This decision was notified to the Chairperson of the Board of Benefacts and other relevant stakeholders in June 2020.</p>  <p>  Recognising that other public service bodies with direct policy involvement in the not-for-profit sector may have wished to consider whether they had an appreciable business case to continue funding Benefacts, my Department agreed to fund the initiative up to the end of 2021. This provision was made to facilitate relevant public service bodies to consider their position and to assess all of the options in relation to their respective business needs concerning data on the not-for-profit sector. </p>  <p>  In April 2021, my Department reaffirmed its 2020 decision to all of the parties concerned. Furthermore, in acknowledgment of the impact of Covid19 on this deliberative process, DPER sanctioned a final three month extension of funding to Benefacts up to the 31st March 2022.  As of December 2021, no alternative funding source from among the Departments and agencies who directly avail of the service provided by Benefacts has been identified.</p>  <p>  The factors influencing the original decision of April 2020  have not changed materially and, consequently, the decision of this Department to terminate funding remains unaltered. </p>  <p>  My officials are continuing to work closely with the executive and Board of Benefacts to ensure that all necessary requirements under the funding agreement will be met, including those which may arise under a wind-up scenario.</p></reply>

In its <i>Fiscal Assessment Report</i>, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council welcomed this innovation to Ireland&rsquo;s fiscal framework. I further note the Council&rsquo;s view that the Government&rsquo;s fiscal stance for next year strikes the appropriate balance between continuing to provide the necessary fiscal support to the economy while returning the public finances to a sustainable trajectory. </p><p>I note the Council's comments in relation to Departmental expenditure ceilings in respect of current expenditure not being published beyond 2022. In line with last year's Budget, technical current expenditure ceilings for 2023 and 2024 will be published before the end of the year, with the final ceilings for these years being fixed as part of the estimates process in the respective years, within the overall expenditure parameters set out in the SES and Expenditure Report 2022. This approach reflects the need to consider in Estimates settlements the unwinding of Covid-19 related expenditure and the allocation of funding from the Brexit Adjustment Reserve.  </p><p>As usual with the <i>Fiscal Assessment Report</i>.

This will see core expenditure grow each year by just over 5 per cent on average over the period to 2025, broadly in line with the trend growth rate of the economy. The average annual growth rate in current expenditure is just under 4&frac34; per cent with total capital spending, including that funded by the National Recovery and Resilience Plan, growing by an annual average of over 8&frac12; per cent.</p>  <p>  This strategy sees an annual average of &euro;3.2 billion being made available for increases in core current expenditure over the period 2022 to 2024.  This includes a provision of 3% of the core current expenditure base in respect of existing level of service costs with the balance in funding being available for priority new current expenditure measures. </p>  <p>  The increases in core capital spending, consistent with the amounts set out under the revised National Development Plan, will see increases ranging between &euro;0.8 to &euro;1.1 billion in the period from 2022 to 2024. </p>  <p>  In looking at the Health expenditure, it is important to take into account the additional funding allocated in Budget 2021 and Budget 2022. Core current expenditure of &euro;20.4 billion is provided in 2022 for the Department of Health, an increase of &euro;2.9 billion compared to the amount set out in the pre-Covid Revised Estimates Volume for 2020. This has allowed for significant funding to be allocated to new measures including for additional staffing and capacity improvements, with Sl&aacute;intecare measures being budgeted as part of the new measures allocation to the Department of Health. </p>  <p>  As outlined, there are significant increases provided for capital investment. The revised National Development Plan set new five year rolling Departmental capital allocations and overall ten year capital ceilings out to 2030. The NDP sets out a total public investment of &euro;165 billion over the period 2021 to 2030. Looking at the Government&rsquo;s climate ambitions, extensive efforts have been made to ensure that the National Development Plan will support these ambitions. </p>  <p>  The level of resources being set aside for core spending is significant - almost &euro;93 billion in 2025 compared to just over &euro;70 billion in 2020. This additional spending will provide for new expenditure measures, including for priorities such as Sl&aacute;intecare and Climate Action, with allocations of the additional current funding being decided each year as part of the estimates process.</p></reply>

As the Deputy is aware, new necessary measures to protect public health were introduced from 7 December. This included certain restrictions on capacities for live indoor performance.  These restrictions impact on the viability of live performances and in this context, Government recently extended supports under the Covid Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS) and the Employee Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) to protect employment in impacted sectors.  The Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) has also been reopened for a limited time to support people who lose their employment as a result of the new COVID-19 public health restrictions from Tuesday 7 December 2021.  </p>  <p>  I have also introduced &euro;50m in sector specific supports, including a support for events that were due to take place in December and January to minimise cancellations and to provide support where these are unavoidable. The supports announced for the sector include:</p>  <p>  - &euro;5m for the seasonal musical theatre and pantomime scheme (LPSS 2), funding will increase from &euro;2m to &euro;5m and the turnover requirement is being reduced to &euro;100,000 from &euro;300,000 with applications being accepted until the end of January 2022. This scheme is now open for applications</p>  <p>  - &euro;20m for another strand of the Live Performance Support Scheme (LPSS 3), specifically to support performances in December and January which may need to be cancelled, curtailed or rescheduled. This scheme will open for applications on Friday 17 December. Venues, including nightclubs that stage live performances, producers and promoters can apply for up to 50% of their eligible costs</p>  <p>  - A minimum of &euro;14m for another strand of the Live Performance Support Scheme (LPSS 4), to support performances being staged from February 2022 to June 2022. This scheme will open in January 2022. If further funds are required the Minister will seek additional funding from the Covid Contingency Fund</p>  <p>  - &euro;5m for Local Authorities to support local artists and performances through the LLPSS (Local Live Performance Support Scheme). This will include funding for community and local pantomimes</p>  <p>  - &euro;5m to continue the capital supports scheme (CECGS) to venues, including for ventilation upgrades and other COVID adaptations</p>  <p>  - &euro;1m for the Saint Patrick's Festival 2022</p>  <p>  A further extension of the Music and Entertainment Business Assistance Scheme (MEBAS) which supports businesses in the music sector will be announced in January. </p>  <p>  The rationale behind these schemes is to provide employment opportunities for artists, musicians and crew.  Thousands of days of employment were generated by the LLPSS and the LPSS over the summer and autumn when other activity was restricted due to public health measures.  I am confident that the new strands of the schemes will give much needed employment to musicians, artists and arts workers again, including in the nightclub sector. </p>  <p>  I am committed to supporting the live performance and nightclub sector as they journey through this difficult phase and these schemes aim to be as flexible, responsive and timely as possible in that regard.</p></reply>

This is a welcome funding source and the Government tries wherever possible to ensure an enabling environment for sporting bodies to further develop these funding opportunities.  </p>  <p>  On 29 November I published a Sports Action Plan for the period 2021 to 2023 which sets out the key initiatives that we are going to pursue on our continuing journey to get more people involved in sport and to enhance the way that sport is managed and administered. </p>  <p>  With a planned doubling of investment in sport to an annual level of more than &euro;220 million by 2027, the State intends to take the lead in delivering more investment but others will increasingly need to play their part through, for instance, corporate and philanthropic finance. Taxation reform can assist this drive for more funding diversity in Irish sport, not just for high performance sport but also for grassroots sport. </p>  <p>  The Action Plan includes several actions relating to funding for sport, including Actions 3.4 and 3.7. </p>  <p>  Action 3.4 commits to the introduction of a scheme for the attraction of corporate and philanthropic finance to support Ireland&rsquo;s high-performance programme, modelled on the &ldquo;Black Gold&rdquo; programme in New Zealand.</p>  <p>  Action 3.7 commits to the preparation of business cases for possible taxation reform for (a) the granting of charitable status for NGBs (b) the lowering of the &euro;250 eligibility threshold for capital reliefs on individual donations to sports capital projects (c) the extension of the zero-rated VAT regime (d) the extension of taxation reliefs on capital donations to include donations for sports participation/coaching programmes, and (e) the incentivisation of personal exercise opportunities.</p></reply>

Stakeholder engagement has been central to my Department's response to the pandemic and this forum will ensure that the arts sector, those working in it and the resource bodies and representative organisations are given the opportunity to feed into the policy development for the scheme. The selection process for recipients of the Basic Income Guarantee pilot scheme will be finalised following this forum, however, I can confirm the following: </p><p>- Participation in the scheme will not be based on a means test</p><p>- It will be a non-competitive process, therefore once a person satisfies the eligibility criteria they will be included in a randomised selection process</p><p>Proposals for the parameters of the scheme will be finalised in light of the stakeholder engagement.</p><p>In relation to the Deputy's specific concern, the receipt of social welfare payments will not be a disqualifying criteria.  </p><p>I believe the Basic Income Guarantee pilot scheme will bring new life and support to the Arts and Cultural Sector and I hope it will provide an important legacy for our artists and creatives.

An Taisce estimate that a minimum of 1,350 tonnes of litter was removed by groups in local coastal clean ups in 2021.  In addition to the regular clean ups, 405 groups registered for the annual <i>Big Beach Clean</i>event in 2021 removing  further estimated 42 tonnes of litter from beaches. </p><p>Since 2015 to Quarter 3 2021, the <i>Fishing for Litter</i>programme, part of  Bord Iascaigh Mhara's <i>Clean Ocean Initiative,</i>has retrieved and disposed over 670 tonnes of marine litter through a national network of 12 ports with voluntary participation of 144 fishing vessels.  In addition, since 2018  the aquaculture sector has retrieved  over 165 tonnes of marine litter from commercial shore sites.  Further information on the Clean Ocean Initiative is available from the Department of Agriculture food and the Marine.</p><p>As well as removing marine litter it is vital to reduce inputs of marine litter into the marine environment in the first place.

My Department supports fire authorities through setting general policy, providing a central training programme, issuing guidance on operational and other related matters and providing capital funding support for equipment and priority infrastructural projects. </p>  <p>  Attacks on emergency services personnel are completely unacceptable, and this is reflected in the specific legislation dealing with assaults on, or threats to, emergency workers in front line positions as contained in section 19 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 (as amended by section 185 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006).  Section 19 provides that any person who assaults a person providing medical services at or in a hospital, or a peace officer acting in the execution of their duty, is guilty of an offence and is liable on summary conviction to a fine or a term of imprisonment not exceeding 12 months or both or, on conviction on indictment, to a fine or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 7 years, or to both.   A peace officer refers to a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, a prison officer, a member of the fire brigade, ambulance personnel or a member of the defence forces.  The offences in section 19 were extended to hospital, ambulance and fire brigade personnel by means of section 185 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 in order to address the problem of assaults and obstruction of personnel engaged in providing emergency services. </p>  <p>  In addition to the special offences under section 19 of the 1994 Act, the general criminal law applies. For example, in the case of an assault causing serious harm to an emergency worker, the offender may be prosecuted under the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Fire Service, the provision of a fire service in its functional area is a statutory function of individual fire authorities under the Fire Services Act, 1981 and 2003. Any queries relating to assaults perpetrated against members of the fire service staff, or successful prosecutions taken against those who committed such assaults, should be referred to individual fire authorities.  As Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, I have no function in the matter and the information sought is not available in my Department.  </p>  <p>  Individual fire authorities have engaged with communities in areas where incidents occur with a view to reducing the number of these types of violent attacks. Nonetheless, decisions taken to proceed in specific situations, to avoid incidents, and how to proceed with prosecutions are appropriately made by the relevant authorities, in consultation with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></reply>

In April this year the LDA was granted planning permission for this site and the LDA have advised my Department that a tender for enabling works was recently issued. These enabling works are expected to commence in Q1/Q2 2022, with the first homes delivered in 2023. This is predicated on successful procurement of building contractors through an open tender process.</p>  <p>  In line with Part V of the Local Government Act 2000, as amended by Part 6 of the Affordable Housing Act 2021, a minimum of 20% of this site will be developed for local authority social and affordable housing.

They are subject to ongoing review in the interests of safety and the well-being of persons in the built environment and to ensure that due regard is taken of changes in construction techniques, technological progress and innovation.</p><p>The Building Regulations (Part M Amendment) Regulations 2010, and the accompanying Technical Guidance Document M &ndash; Access and Use (2010), which came into effect on 1 January 2012, set out the minimum statutory requirements that a building must achieve in respect of access. Part M aims to foster an inclusive approach to the design and construction of the built environment. While the Part M requirements may be regarded as a statutory minimum level of provision, the accompanying technical guidance encourages building owners and designers to have regard to the design philosophy of universal design and to consider making additional provisions where practicable and appropriate.</p><p>Housing needs of people with disabilities are addressed in the National Housing Strategy for People with a Disability (NHSPWD) 2016-2021. A new NHSPWD, is currently being developed by my Department and the Department of Health, with a view to publishing by the end of 2021. The strategy is about facilitating the provision of housing options and related services to disabled people to allow individual choice and support independent living.</p><p>In accordance with the vision and strategic aims of the current NHSPWD to achieve a coordinated and integrated approach to meeting the housing needs of people with a disability at local level, Housing and Disability Steering Groups (HDSGs) have been established in all local authority areas.  These are chaired by the Directors of Housing with membership including the Health Service Executive (HSE) and disability representatives.</p><p>Each HDSG has prepared a local Strategic Plan for its own City/County area, to develop specific local strategies to meet the identified and emerging housing needs of people with disabilities in their areas with a view to developing annual targets for the delivery of housing to people with a disability on their housing waiting lists. </p><p>Separately, Action 97 of the National Disability Inclusion Strategy 2017-2021 states &ndash; &ldquo;<i>We will prepare policy advice on ways of achieving universal design solutions for new housing so that new homes can be accessed and used by all persons, irrespective of size, age, ability or disability. We will advise on any implications of same for stakeholders including designers, builders, homeowners and tenants.&rdquo;</i>I understand that the National Disability Authority (NDA), which falls under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration, and Youth, is working on this policy advice. The NDA are an independent statutory body that provides information and advice to the Government on policy and practice relevant to the lives of persons with disabilities.</p><p>The NDA also provides comprehensive guidance on how to design, build and manage buildings and spaces so that they can be readily accessed and used by everyone, regardless of age, size, ability or disability. 'Building for Everyone, A Universal Design Approach', a NDA publication, may be accessed at www.nda.ie. </p><p>The <i>&lsquo;Programme for Government Our Shared</i><i>Future&rsquo;</i>commits to ensuring that there is an appropriate mix of housing design types provided, including universally designed units, and accommodation for older people and people with disabilities. </p><p>The joint policy statement <i>Housing Options for Our Ageing Population</i>, launched by my Department and the Department of Health in 2019, includes an Action on universal design to <i>&ldquo;In partnership with industry, introduce measures to ensure that over a five year period delivery is increased to ensure that 30% of all new dwellings are built to incorporate universal design principles to accommodate our ageing population.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Appropriate analysis to identify delivery approaches to address this commitment is currently being undertaken by the NDA.</p></reply>

Following receipt of such a proposal, the Minister requests the Director of the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) to conduct an assessment of the area to establish whether or not it meets the criteria for designation and to report to the Minister on whether the area should be designated as a Rent Pressure Zone (RPZ). For the purpose of the Act, &lsquo;area&rsquo; is defined as either the administrative area of a housing authority or a Local Electoral Area (LEA) within the meaning of section 2 of the Local Government Act 2001. There is no provision for any other type of area to be designated as a Rent Pressure Zone.</p>  <p>  The criteria to be satisfied by an area under section 24A(4) of the Residential Tenancies Act for designation as an RPZ are as follows:</p>  <p>  the information relating to the area, as determined by reference to the information used to compile each RTB Rent Index quarterly report, shows that the annual rate of increase in the average amount of rent for that area is more than 7% in each of at least 4 of the 6 quarters preceding the period immediately prior to the date of the Housing Agency's proposal, and  </p>  <p>  the average rent for the area in the last quarter, as determined by reference to the information used to compile each RTB Rent Index quarterly report, is &ndash; </p>  <p>   in the case of counties Kildare, Meath and Wicklow or an LEA in any one of those counties, above the average rent in the State, excluding rents in the 4 Dublin Local Authority areas, or  </p>  <p>   in the case of any LEA outside of the Greater Dublin Area (i.e. Dublin, Kildare, Meath and Wicklow), above the average rent in the State, excluding rents in the Greater Dublin Area. </p>  <p>  Each RTB quarterly Rent Index Report includes a summary table of the data used to establish whether each Local Electoral Area fulfils the criteria for designation as a Rent Pressure Zone. This ensures transparency in relation to the position of individual areas in terms of average rent levels and increases. </p>  <p>  The RTB Rent Index measures rent increases in LEAs using the 2019 boundaries for these LEAs and there is no specific measure to calculate rental increases broken down to any lower level (i.e. part of an LEA). </p>  <p>  The Housing Agency and the RTB will continue to monitor national rents and if any LEA in Donegal meets the designation criteria it will be designated as a RPZ. </p></reply>

I have acknowledged that the current scheme was  challenging for all stakeholders and did not operate as intended for homeowners. I have listened to homeowners and the core issues identified in the report of the Working Group will be addressed through a combination of immediate actions, medium term legislative changes and important research and reviews to encompass ongoing critical research and new learnings.</p>  <p>  The Government agreed an enhanced &euro;2.2bn Defective Concrete Block scheme on 30 November 2021. The comprehensive changes which target the core issues include:- </p>  <p>  - A revised application process will be introduced which will only require the homeowner to submit an initial &lsquo;Building Condition Assessment&rsquo; at minimal cost recoupable on entry to the Scheme. The Housing Agency will take over testing, sampling and categorisation of remedial works.</p>  <p>  - The current 90% maximum grant payable will be increased to a 100% grant for all remediation options 1-5 </p>  <p>  - The maximum grant cap for option 1 (demolition and rebuild) will be increased to &euro;420,000 from &euro;247,500 </p>  <p>  - The grant calculation methodology will be based on the cost per square foot (psf) of rebuilding the existing home, with costings to be set by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage in consultation with the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland (SCSI).

Opportunities for the State to acquire such rental properties for social housing purposes will also be examined.</p>  <p>  The Housing Agency's role in the enhanced scheme will be significant. They will act as agents on behalf of the local authorities. Applications received by a local authority will be referred to the Housing Agency to review the &lsquo;Building Condition Assessment Report&rsquo;. Once the criteria has been met for entry to the scheme, the Housing Agency will arrange the assessment, testing and categorisation process as required and recommend the appropriate remediation option and grant amount. This approach removes the financial barrier faced by some homeowners and was one of the key issues discussed at the Working Group meetings. It will also give homeowners the flexibility to manage their own projects and allow them to deal directly with their chosen supervising engineer and building contractor.</p></reply>

My officials have begun the process of engaging with a number of bodies in order to move the recommendations forward.</p>  <p>  Further to this, my Department undertook a National Gull Survey in 2021, the results of which will also inform ongoing work with stakeholders and communities to address concerns or conflict issues.   </p>  <p>  In terms of schools, Section 42 of the Wildlife Acts allows applications to be made to apply for a licence to remove nests and eggs from buildings, on a case by case basis, where serious damage has occurred. A licence may also be applied for under Section 22(9)(d) to take the nests or eggs of protected wild birds for other purposes. Applications are investigated by local staff and recommendations made on the most practical method of stopping or controlling the problem.  As the Deputy will also be aware, a pilot derogation declaration is in place for a specified area in relation to the taking of nests and eggs, and my Department is considering the implications of extending same.  </p>  <p>  My Department is reviewing the Wild Birds Declaration wording in particular around the legal aspects of its implementation.</p></reply>

The published report, enclosed for convenience, sets out the spatial focus of the surveys (Figures 2 and 4), including for a number of specific towns. In addition, Dublin City Centre and adjacent coastal suburbs also received additional survey effort.</p><p>This has allowed modelling work to be undertaken to derive preliminary estimates of the gull populations in the seven focal towns. This preliminary analysis focused on estimating the size of the breeding gull population, i.e. Apparently Occupied Nests (AON) and enables the quantification of gulls nesting in these towns.  This will allow my Department to continue to work with stakeholders and communities with a view to reducing any conflict issues.</p><p>The analysis of the Irish and UK data is ongoing for the relevant gull species, as well as for other breeding seabird species; it is intended to derive population estimates at the country scale, for the Seabirds Count publication due in 2023. Comparisons of historical data of Herring Gull populations will be part of the overall analysis and reporting under the Seabirds Count initiative.</p><p>The recent European Red List of Birds uses the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria and has classified the extinction risk of Herring Gull at the European level as &lsquo;Least Concern&rsquo;, an improvement from the previous assessment of &lsquo;Near Threatened'.</p></reply>

It would not be appropriate to lend when there is an identifiable risk that the person&rsquo;s income and ability to pay might not return to the level required to support the borrowing requested. This is both for the protection of the lender and the borrower, in particular to seek to ensure that borrowers are not left with unsustainable debt burdens, given that a mortgage is a long-term commitment. </p>  <p>  Under the RIHL Scheme, where an applicant&rsquo;s employer is availing of EWSS and an applicant is approved for an RIHL, drawdown would not usually commence until their unsupported income post EWSS has returned to the level specified in the original application for a period, usually up to three months.</p>  <p>  However, given the ongoing COVID-19 situation, I issued a further direction to Local Authorities on 1 December 2021 in Circular 41/2021 for applicant(s) who have an approval in principle and wish to draw down their mortgage. Local Authorities now have discretion, on a case-by-case basis, to allow drawdown for applicant(s) whose employer is availing of EWSS, if repayment capacity can be assured based on the applicant(s)&rsquo; income and if a letter of assurance from the employer availing of EWSS confirming the sustainability of the applicant(s) employment is submitted</p>  <p>  The final decision on Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan applications is a matter for the relevant local authority. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-12-14a.715.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1512" speakername="Malcolm Noonan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021121400085#WRQ02900"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 295 to 299, inclusive, together.</p>  <p>  Article 16 of the Constitution sets out clearly and distinctly the overarching requirements that apply to the membership of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  In addition, and complementary to the constitutional provisions of Article 16.2 in particular, Part II of the Electoral Act 1997 (as amended) provides for a constituency review following each Census of Population and establishes, among other things, the terms of reference of a Constituency Commission.</p>  <p>  In very broad terms, the publication of preliminary census results triggers the establishment of a Constituency Commission under section 5(1) of the Electoral Act 1997 with the Commission required, under section 9(1) of that Act, to present its report on D&aacute;il and European Parliament constituencies to the chairman of the D&aacute;il within three months of publication of final census results.  The timing for the publication of both preliminary census results and final census results are matters for the Central Statistics Office but typically have taken place within approximately 3 months and 12 months respectively of the holding of the census. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the above, in January of this year, Minister O'Brien and I published the General Scheme of the Electoral Reform Bill. The general scheme addresses a number of commitments in the Programme for Government - Our Shared Future including the commitment to establish a statutory Electoral Commission.  The general scheme has been published on my Department's website at www.gov.ie/en/publication/34cf6-general-scheme-of-the-electoral-reform-bill-2020/. The Bill is included on the list of priority legislation in the Government's current legislation programme and I expect that it will be published and will commence its progress through the Oireachtas in the new year.</p>  <p>  The Electoral Commission will be independent of Government and will report directly to the Oireachtas.  Following its establishment, it will, among other matters, take on several existing statutory electoral functions from the outset, including the work currently undertaken by Constituency Commissions.</p>  <p>  In September 2020, the Government, on the advice of the Central Statistics Office, decided to postpone the 2021 Census due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The next census is now due to take place on 3 April 2022. The next review of D&aacute;il and European Parliament constituencies will commence following the publication of preliminary census results, will be undertaken in compliance with our constitutional requirements and will be completed in accordance with the statutory timeframe.</p>  <p>  Unlike the position for D&aacute;il and European Parliament constituencies, there is no constitutional or legislative requirement for the revision of local electoral areas.</p>  <p>  Section 23 of the Local Government Act 2001 empowers the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage to divide a local authority area into local electoral areas and to amend those areas.  However, in advance of deciding to make an order under section 23 of the Act, the Minister must, in accordance with section 32(2) of the Local Government Act 1991, request a boundary committee to make a report having regard to such matters as may be specified by the Minister. The publication of Census of Population data is one of a number of factors that informs the preparation of terms of reference for any review of local electoral areas to be undertaken and provides a basis for the work of any Local Electoral Area Boundary Committee(s) which may be established by the Minister from time to time. The Minister must publish the report of the boundary committee and must have regard to the report of that committee when deciding to make an order in relation to the revision of local electoral area boundaries.</p>  <p>  Similar to the approach outlined above for the review of D&aacute;il and European Parliament constituencies the General Scheme of the Electoral Reform Bill provides that, following its establishment, the Electoral Commission will take on the work currently undertaken by Local Electoral Area Boundary Committees.  No decision has been taken at this point in time in relation to a review of local electoral area boundaries in advance of the next local elections in 2024. </p></reply>

The review is addressing a number of key aspects including noise, setback, shadow flicker, community obligation, community dividend and grid connections.</p>  <p>  Guidance on the noise aspect is currently being finalised by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications (DECC), which has primary responsibility for environmental noise matters. Significant work has been undertaken on the noise elements and the two Departments recently met to discuss new developments in this regard including consideration of the impact of the revised 2030 target to generate up to 80% of our electricity from renewable sources and the need to ensure that proposals regarding the measurement and assessment of noise from wind turbines are fit for purpose. These aspects are currently being considered and further engagement between the Departments is expected imminently. Following this inter-departmental engagement, I will be in a better position to provide an update on the expected publication date of the revised Guidelines, the finalisation of which remains a priority.</p>  <p>  It should also be noted that the review and finalisation of the Guidelines has been included as a specific action in the recently published Climate Action Plan.</p>  <p>  When finalised, the revised Guidelines will be issued under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.  Planning authorities and, where applicable, An Bord Plean&aacute;la, must have regard to guidelines issued under section 28 in the performance of their functions generally under the Planning Acts.  In the meantime, the current 2006 Wind Energy Development Guidelines remain in force.</p></reply>

The Group is comprised of senior officials from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Met &Eacute;ireann, and the County and City Management Association. The Group met for the first time on 3 September 2020.</p>  <p>  Further to the initial meeting of the Steering Group in September 2020, a technical working group was also established under the stewardship of the OPW. The work of this group has focused on the identification and initial analysis of data sources, to underpin the work of the Steering Group.</p>  <p>  Since the initial meeting in September, the work of the Steering Group was progressed through a series of bilateral meetings to scope out the extent of the issues, including, inter alia, the threats and effects of coastal change as they relate to the remit of the individual Steering Group members and the wider stakeholders. </p>  <p>  The intention of these bilateral meetings has been to give an opportunity to discuss the emerging work of the Group and to stimulate the most effective engagement of these key stakeholders. The meetings to date have been very useful in allowing for issues relating to coastal change management to be reflected upon and explored in the context of the particular operations of the participating organisations.</p>  <p>  The findings of the Steering Group are currently being finalised and a scoping report will be presented to Government for consideration early in 2022.  The scoping report on a National Coastal Change Management Strategy is intended to provide a framework for key decisions to be taken on how Ireland could best manage its coastline in light of the future risks.</p></reply>

A breakdown of costs associated with the Report was received on 28 September 2021. </p>  <p>  In order to progress matters a meeting was held on 9 November 2021 between officials from my Department and Clare County Council to review issues which require further elaboration in order to evidentially support an extension of the defective concrete blocks grant scheme to County Clare. </p>  <p>  Clare County Council undertook to review their submission in light of the discussion which took place and address the gaps in evidential data which have been identified by my Department.  In that regard, the relevant local authority are to continue to take the lead, build on the good work to date and demonstrate damage which has been documented has manifested due to the presence of reactive pyrite, which is crucial for applicants in the existing scheme. </p>  <p>  My Department is eager to progress this matter and to that end, issued a correspondence to Clare County Council on the 6 December 2021 outlining formally the nature of clarifications sought.</p>  <p>  Any extension of the Scheme to Clare and indeed other local authority areas was considered as part of wider deliberations on the Scheme by Government. To that end, I brought a memorandum to Government on 30 November 2021, setting out proposals for improvements to the existing Scheme. Included as part of these improvements, I as Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, may, with Government approval, extend the scheme beyond the counties of Donegal and Mayo to additional counties, where the evidence supports such an extension.</p>  <p>  On receipt by my Department of the clarifications sought, progress can be made on the requested extension of the scheme to County Clare.</p></reply>

This meant that for eligible businesses their commercial rates were funded by Government for nine months of 2020.  &euro;480m was allocated by Government to fund the cost of the nine month waiver this year.  These are unprecedented measures, which offered support to businesses and financial certainty to local authorities.  </p>  <p>  The Government, in Budget 2022, announced a more targeted commercial rates waiver for Q4 2021 to cover the hospitality and tourism sectors and &euro;62.3m was allocated by Government for this purpose.  On 3 December an extension of the current targeted waiver covering the hospitality and tourism sectors was announced.  These waivers are intended to assist specific sectors as they continue to be severely impacted by COVID-19 restrictions beyond September 2021 and need support to get back up and running.</p>  <p>  Local authorities levy rates on property used for commercial purposes in accordance with the details entered in the valuation lists prepared by the independent Commissioner of Valuation under the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015.  Valuation lists identify categories of commercial property.  Because of this, commercial rates and consequently eligibility for the rates waiver schemes, are based on property categories. Eligibility for the Q4 waiver is mainly based on hospitality and tourism property categories.  </p>  <p>  Government has the challenge of balancing competing demands for finite resources.  The Q4 2001 and Q1 2002 targeted rates waivers are separate, standalone schemes and in recognition of the resources available, many businesses that benefited from previous waivers are no longer eligible. As with all public health measures and associated supports, the waiver of commercial rates will be kept under review. However, there are no current plans to extend the scope of the commercial rates waiver. </p></reply>

However, a civil remedy is available through the Courts concerning branches or roots of neighbouring trees encroaching on a person&rsquo;s property.</p>  <p>  The possibility of providing a broader civil law remedy for parties affected by high trees and hedges on adjoining properties was raised previously with the Minister for Justice.  In this regard, advice was sought on the possibility of legislative provision being made, whereby a person substantially deprived of the enjoyment of their property, such as the deprivation of light caused by high trees on a neighbouring property, could apply to the Courts for an order, and that the Courts could make an order as they see fit, for example, to cut the trees back to an appropriate height. Safety considerations relating to overhanging trees could also potentially be addressed in any such provisions.</p>  <p>  In response, the Minister for Justice suggested that disputes of this nature between neighbours could perhaps be more appropriately dealt with through mediation, which is being increasingly used internationally as a tool for the resolution of civil disputes, rather than through the Courts.  Legislation subsequently introduced by the Minister for Justice has been enacted as the Mediation Act 2017 (the Act).</p>  <p>  The Act, which came into operation on 1 January 2018, contains provisions to underpin a comprehensive statutory framework to promote the resolution of disputes through mediation as an alternative to court proceedings which should ideally be only used as a last resort.  In essence, the underlying objective of the Act is to promote mediation as a viable, effective and efficient alternative to court proceedings, thereby reducing legal costs, speeding up the resolution of disputes and reducing the stress and acrimony which often accompanies court proceedings, including those involving adjoining property owners. </p>  <p>  In relation to dangerous trees, section 70 of the Roads Act 1993 - which is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Transport &ndash; provides that, where a tree, shrub, hedge or other vegetation is a hazard or potential hazard to persons using a public road or where it obstructs or interferes with the safe use of a public road or with the maintenance of a public road, a road authority may serve a notice in writing on the owner or occupier of the land on which such tree, shrub, hedge or other vegetation is situated, requiring the preservation, felling, cutting, lopping, trimming or removal of such tree, shrub, hedge or other vegetation within the period stated in the notice.</p>  <p>  I also understand that under Section 58 of the Communications Regulation Act 2002 &ndash; which comes under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications - an electronic communications network operator or any person authorised by the operator may lop or cut any tree, shrub or hedge which obstructs or interferes with any physical infrastructure of the network operator.</p>  <p>  With regard to tall and dangerous trees on local authority property, local authorities - as with all landowners - are responsible for the safety and maintenance of trees on their land.</p></reply>

Since the programme commenced in 2013 over 73,500 units of social housing stock have been retrofitted with a total exchequer spend of &euro;161 million under the scheme. Homes owned by Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) are not part of the local authority owned housing stock and therefore are not eligible to apply for funding under a budget dedicated to the retrofit of local authority owned homes. </p>  <p>  The Energy Efficiency Programme has been revised in 2021 with an increased Budget of &euro;65 million, to include the Midlands Retrofit Programme, and focuses on ensuring that the fabric of the home is upgraded and an energy efficient heating system is provided. This revised programme will see a significant upscaling to &lsquo;deeper retrofit&rsquo; on what has been completed by local authorities in previous years and will target 2,400 social homes for upgrade works in 2021, 750 of which relate to the Midlands Retrofit Pilot. </p>  <p>  Under the new programme costs on individual homes could vary from &euro;13,000 to &euro;45,000. The final cost on a home will depend on its pre-works building standard and energy performance. It is a matter for each local authority to choose which properties to select for retrofitting from the allocation notified to them by my Department. </p>  <p>  An annualised breakdown of the units retrofitted under the Energy Efficiency Retrofit programme for the years 2013-2020, is available on my Department's website at the following link. Details in respect of labour costs attributed to the Programme are not captured.  www.gov.ie/en/publication/668c1-energy-efficiency-retrofitting-programme-expenditure-output/.</p></reply>

However, further information may be available directly from the Housing Agency.</p>  <p>  A key theme of Housing for All is to build local authority and AHB capacity to cater for increased output levels and complexities of development and delivery processes.

From this figure, there will be 36,000 affordable purchase and 18,000 Cost Rental homes.</p>  <p>  The delivery of affordable housing under Housing for All is being facilitated through a number of affordable schemes. These schemes will assist potential purchasers and renters in making housing more affordable.

The Guidelines are available on the Government&rsquo;s website at the following link: www.gov.ie/en/publication/23809-sustainable-rural-housing-development-guidelines/.</p>  <p>  Since 2018, the National Planning Framework (NPF) is the national planning policy document providing overall strategic policy for the future development of Ireland. National Planning Objective (NPO) 19 aims to ensure that a policy distinction is made between areas experiencing significant &lsquo;overspill&rsquo; development pressure from urban areas within the commuter catchment of cities, towns and centres of employment, on the one hand, and remoter rural areas where population levels may be low and or declining, on the other. </p>  <p>  NPO 19 is aligned with the established planning approach as per the 2005 Guidelines, whereby considerations of social (intrinsic part of the community) or economic (persons working full or part-time) need may be applied by planning authorities in certain rural areas under urban influence in order to prevent urban sprawl.</p>  <p>  National Policy Objective (NPO) 15 of the NPF fully supports the concept of the sustainable development of rural areas by encouraging growth and arresting decline in areas that have experienced low population growth or decline in recent decades, while simultaneously indicating the need to manage certain areas around cities and towns.</p>  <p>  Updated Rural Housing Planning Guidelines are currently being prepared by my Department to ensure consistency with new requirements and legislation at national and EU level introduced in respect of areas related to rural housing such as environmental protection, the Gaeltacht and climate action. The new guidelines will ensure a more consistent approach between counties and alignment with NPF objectives, and will be prepared in draft in quarter one of 2022. </p></reply>

The preferred approach is to focus on greater reuse of previously developed &lsquo;brownfield&rsquo; land, consolidating infill sites, which may not have been built on before, and the development of sites in locations that are better serviced by existing facilities and public transport. </p>  <p>  The NPF also acknowledges that there is a need for a more proportionate and tailored approach to residential development, especially in the context of regional cities and towns.  This means that it is necessary to adapt the scale, design and layout of new housing according to the type of settlement in which it is located, and its proximity to centres and public transport services.</p>  <p>  Statutory &lsquo;Section 28&rsquo; ministerial guidelines for planning authorities on Sustainable Residential Development in Urban Areas (the &lsquo;Sustainable Residential Development Guidelines&rsquo;) were last issued in 2009, having been first introduced in 1999. </p>  <p>  Further, related guidance has been subsequently issued in the form of updates to the Sustainable Urban Housing: Design Standards for New Apartments Guidelines for Planning Authorities, most recently in 2020, and the Urban Development and Building Heights Guidelines for Planning Authorities in 2018.</p>  <p>  While the principles, approaches and general requirements of the Sustainable Residential Development Guidelines continue to be applicable to the objectives of the NPF for the development of compact, sustainable and liveable settlements, it is necessary to review guidance to take account of more varied development contexts, given the emphasis that the NPF places on tailored, plan-led and design-focused compact growth.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently undertaking an update of the Sustainable Residential Development Guidelines with new Sustainable and Compact Settlement Guidelines (SCSG).  In the meantime, my Department issued a Circular in April 2021 to Planning Authorities, Regional Assemblies and to the Planning Regulator to provide clarity in relation to the interpretation and application of current statutory guidelines, particularly with regard to the density of development in certain town contexts.</p>  <p>  A preliminary draft of the SCSG is currently being prepared for the purposes of screening for Appropriate Assessment and Strategic Environmental Assessment.  Following the completion of the AA/SEA process, the Draft SCSG will be subject to a period of consultation.  Submissions made during the public consultation period will be taken into consideration and thereafter, the draft guidelines will be finalised for publication.  It is intended that the review can conclude by mid-2022 and that final Guidelines will be issued under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended).</p></reply>

The property in question must also meet certain eligibility criteria. The concept of the scheme is that a household with an unsustainable mortgage goes from being a homeowner to being a social housing tenant. The borrower surrenders their property to their lender who sells it to a MTR provider which can be either an Approved Housing Body (AHB) or since 2018 a private company, Home for Life Ltd. The AHB or local authority (in the case where the property is sold to a private company) becomes the landlord and the borrower remains in the property as a tenant paying a differential rent to the landlord based on his or her income.</p>  <p>  From the start of 2021 to the end of September 2021, 493 households, with unsustainable private mortgages have completed the MTR scheme. Since its introduction nationally in 2013, a total of 1497 cases have been completed up to the end of September 2021. As of that date, 850 active cases were also being progressed under the scheme. The Housing Agency publishes, on a quarterly basis, detailed statistical information on the operation of the MTR scheme which shows a breakdown of the number of active, completed, ineligible and terminated cases. This information is available on the Housing Agency's website at the following link: www.housingagency.ie/housing-information/mortgage-rent-statistics.</p></reply>

Dublin with rents ranging between &euro;900 and &euro;1,250, an average of 40% below comparative market rates. A further 40 CREL-supported Cost Rental units will be tenanted before year-end (Barnhall, Co Kildare, with rents starting from &euro;900 per month). Additionally, under the first round of CREL funding alone, 325 Cost Rental units will be delivered in 2022, across 4 local authorities.</p>  <p>  In relation to SSF/AHF supported housing developments, notwithstanding the impact of Covid-19, 50 Cost Rental two bedroomed homes supported through the SSF/AHB have reached completion, with the tenanting process being finalised (Enniskerry Road, Co. Dublin, with rents of &euro;1,200 per month). The first SSF/AHF-supported affordable homes for purchase will be available to purchase in Cork city in Q1 2022 (Boherboy, Cork City Council indicated prices to be &euro;218,000 for a 2-bedroom and &euro;243,000 for a 3-bedroom dwelling). This will be followed by a Fingal County Council supported affordable purchase development (Dun Emer, Fingal County Council have indicated these will cost &euro;166,000 for a 2-bed apartment and between 206,000 and &euro;258,000 for 3-bed dwellings). </p>  <p>  In addition to the CREL and SSF/AHF supported affordable homes, in 2021 several Local Authorities have collaborated with &Oacute; Cualann Co-Housing Alliance to deliver affordable homes for purchase. Under such arrangements, Local Authority-owned development land is provided at nominal cost and development levies are reduced or eliminated. The most recently completed phase through such arrangements will deliver a total of 37 affordable homes for purchase by year-end (Oile&aacute;in na Crann&oacute;ige extension).</p>  <p>  Under the Government&rsquo;s Housing for All strategy, the AHF and CREL scheme are two important components in delivering the 54,000 affordable homes targeted between now and 2030. But additional delivery streams will also be required. Recognizing this, the Government brought forward first standalone affordable housing legislation in the Affordable Housing Act 2021.  This will support the implementation of a multi-faceted approach which, combined with unprecedented levels of funding, will allow a huge scale-up in the near and medium delivery of affordable homes.</p>  <p>  Examples of new affordable housing interventions include;</p>  <p>  - A second round of CREL funding was launched on 22 October, and applications for this are currently being assessed. Approval-in-principle will be issued to successful applications before year-end. </p>  <p>  - The Land Development Agency initiated a call under Project Tosaigh on 12 November focused on kick-starting stalled private developments and securing additional affordable homes.  This call targeted scale in excess of 150 affordable units per development.</p>  <p>  - Similarly, the Housing Delivery Coordination Office (within the LGMA) issued a call to secure additional affordable homes across key local authorities from stalled private developments, targeting smaller scale private developments.</p>  <p>  - Significant progress is being made in establishing the First Home Affordable Purchase Shared Equity scheme. The First Home scheme is designed to support first-time buyers purchasing homes on the private market, and will be available at a national level for applications next year.</p>  <p>  - The Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe initiative is in the final stages of design. This initiative focuses on overcoming the viability challenges associated with un-activated planning permissions in urban brownfield areas, estimated at 80,000 dwellings nationally. It is intended that the first calls under this initiative will be made in January.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-12-14a.819.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1595" speakername="Peter Burke" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021121400088#WRT01000"><p>My Department has noted the increasing number of judicial review cases being taken against decisions of An Bord Plean&aacute;la (the Board) over the last couple of years, as well as the number of cases that have been lost arising from such legal challenges, many of which relate to Strategic Housing Development (SHD) cases but also cases involving  environmental related issues. This upward trend in the number of judicial review challenges has led to significantly increased legal costs having to be met by the Board in defending these actions. My Department is engaging with the Board on the steps that might be taken to improve the situation. </p>  <p>  The Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016 introduced new arrangements to enable planning applications for SHDs of 100 housing units or more, or student accommodation or shared accommodation developments of 200 bed spaces or more, to be made directly to the Board for determination. The sole mechanism for appealing against SHD decisions made by the Board has been by the way of judicial review challenge to the High Court, which has been a factor in the recent increased number of judicial review challenges taken against the Board.</p>  <p>  The SHD arrangements were a temporary measure and had a legislative expiry date of 31 December 2021. This end date was subsequently extended to 25 February 2022 arising from the Covid-related extension of statutory deadlines within the planning system by 8 weeks in respect of the period March to May 2020. </p>  <p>  However, new planning arrangements in respect of large-scale residential developments (LRDs) - as proposed in the Planning and Development (Amendment) (Large-scale Residential Developments) Bill 2021 which has recently completed all stages in the Oireachtas legislative process and is expected to come into effect in the coming days - will restore primary decision-making in respect of such developments to the local planning authorities with the possibility of subsequent appeal to the Board.  It is anticipated that these new arrangements in respect of LRDs and allowing appeal to the Board will lead to a reduction in the number of judicial review challenges in this area in the future.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, proposals to reform the judicial review provisions in sections 50 to 50B of the Planning and Development Act 2001, as amended, were published in the General Scheme of the Housing and Planning and Development Bill 2019 which were subsequently the subject of public consultation. The General Scheme is now expected to undergo pre-legislative scrutiny in the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage in Q1 2022 to be followed by legislative drafting and the publication of a Bill with a view to the subsequent coming into effect of the new judicial review reforms on the establishment of the proposed dedicated Environmental and Planning Court, as committed to in the Programme for Government - Our Shared Future. Similar to the introduction of the new LRD planning arrangements, it is anticipated that these reforms - combined with the reform of the case management procedures in the High Court arising from the Report of the Review Group on the Administration of Civil Justice chaired by the former President of the High Court, Justice Peter Kelly and wider reforms to improve the effectiveness of the planning system, including through increased digitalisation - will lead to both a reduction in the number of judicial review challenges against planning decisions, as well as the more timely determination of such challenges, in the future.    </p></reply>

The Water Services Policy Statement 2018-2025 sets out the range of policy objectives across the key thematic areas of quality, conservation and future proofing which are aligned with Project Ireland 2040 (the National Planning Framework and the National Development Plans).</p>  <p>  The National Development Plan 2021-2030 provides for almost &euro;6bn investment by Irish Water, in the period 2021-2025, with over &euro;4.5 billion of that total being Voted Exchequer funded.  This investment includes the projects and programmes committed to in Irish Water&rsquo;s Capital Investment Plan 2020-2024, which projects spend of circa &euro;6bn for capital expenditure and circa &euro;5bn for operational expenditure.  </p>  <p>  In addition, the National Development Plan 2021-2030 includes an allocation of over &euro;243 million in funding for the period 2021 to 2025 for non-Irish Water investment in water services infrastructure. This includes &euro;175 million funding for the Multi-Annual Rural Water Programme, and &euro;68.5 million funding for legacy issues in relation to Developer Provided Water Services Infrastructure, and lead pipe remediation which is a feature of public water supplies. </p>  <p>  Following on from the recommendations contained in the 2017 Report, the Rural Water Working Group was established in 2018 to conduct a review of the wider resources and investment needs relating to the rural water sector.  </p>  <p>  In February 2019, my Department announced the Multi-Annual Rural Water Programme 2019-2021, the composition of this programme was based on recommendations from the Working Group.  As part of these recommendations, the grant scheme to support improvement works for a private water supply was revised.  The revised scheme, which opened for applications on 04 June 2020, brought into effect the following changes:</p>  <p>  - A maximum grant for rehabilitation works of &euro;3,000, an increase of 47% on the previous maximum grant level of &euro;2,031;</p>  <p>  - A maximum grant of &euro;5,000 in cases where the local authority agrees that the most appropriate solution is to provide a new well.</p>  <p>  The maximum percentage of approved costs was increased from 75% to 85%, subject to the total maximum costs of either &euro;3,000 for well rehabilitation or &euro;5,000 for a new well.  </p>  <p>  Recognising the role of the grant in improving quality, the water quality treatment element (typically filtration and UV treatment) qualifies for 100% funding up to a maximum of &euro;1,000.</p>  <p>  In implementing the revised arrangements, my Department has undertaken to conduct a review of the grant schemes, to ensure their continued alignment with policy objectives. The specifics of this review are currently being formalised. In finalising the structure and timeline for the review, consideration will be given to the most appropriate timing in order to ensure best engagement from relevant stakeholders. This review is expected to be completed next year. </p>  <p>  The schemes are administered by the local authorities on behalf of my Department. Further details can be found on my Department&rsquo;s website or from each local authority.</p></reply>

Since then, Waterways Ireland has developed and maintained facilities for boats at a number of key locations including a significant marina development at Cleighran More and harbour facilities at Spenser Harbour.</p><p>Waterways Ireland has recently received planning approval for the development of a boat slipway at Spenser Harbour, which will complement and augment the harbour as a boating amenity and will provide much needed access to that area of Lough Allen. At the same time, Waterways Ireland in association with Leitrim County Council has developed the Shannon Blueway utilising the Lough Allen Canal and the wider north Shannon area which is bringing increasing numbers of visitors to the canal and to the wider area in general. </p><p>With regard to the extension of navigation to Dowra, Waterways Ireland does not have immediate plans to progress this proposal. Waterways Ireland, together with F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the 10 Local Authorities, including Cavan and Leitrim, has formulated and is currently implementing the Shannon Tourism Masterplan. </p><p>The Masterplan is the first time a single, holistic and dedicated plan of any type has been undertaken on the Shannon Region. Based on three core themes, seven strategic signature initiatives are proposed that will when delivered, position the Shannon Region as a distinctive and sustainable tourist destination. </p><p>The initiatives are as follows:</p><p>1.  Communicating a clear and consistent message;</p><p>2.  Enhancing the on-water experience;</p><p>3.  Enhancing the waterside experience;</p><p>4.  Animating and enhancing the Shannon towns and villages;</p><p>5.  Protecting and enhancing the Shannon Environment;</p><p>6.  Improving connectivity; and</p><p>7.  Building networks.</p><p>The potential restoration of disused navigations for recreational purposes including their expanded and wider use forms part of Strategic Signature Initiative 3 (Enhancing the on-water experience). However no firm proposals in relation to this have yet been progressed.</p></reply>

This strategy contains a number of measures to ensure that more Irish people secure roles in the EU&rsquo;s Institutions over the coming years. Many Irish officials have shaped policies and decisions that have had a positive impact on our lives in Ireland and on the lives of all EU citizens. With a number of Irish officials set to retire over the coming years, this new strategy seeks to safeguard the presence of Irish voices in the Union for years to come.</p><p>The strategy contains a number of commitments that will promote career opportunities in the EU and equip Irish people with the skills they need to succeed in obtaining positions in the EU institutions. In particular, the Government commits to expand the existing EU Jobs campaign, provide tailored support and training to Irish candidates, provide additional resources dedicated to supporting the use of Irish as an EU language, increase the funding of the Centrally Funded Scheme for Seconded National Experts, expand the current scholarship programme in the College of Europe and create a stream within the Irish civil service for EU specialists.</p><p>Implementation of this new strategy began over the summer with a number of meetings with other Government Departments and stakeholders. Following discussions with the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, it was agreed that the number of annual scholarships for Irish students to the College of Europe would be increased from three to six for the academic year 2022-23. I would hope that this will increase to 10 scholarships thereafter.</p><p>Actions linked to the strategy have been expanded, including outreach to third level institutions and regular webinars on forthcoming job opportunities in EU Institutions which have been hosted by Ireland&rsquo;s Permanent Representation to the EU. Training and supports for Irish candidates applying for permanent positions in the EU are also available from the Department&rsquo;s EU Jobs website. These supports are now available in Irish and further resources are currently being translated into Irish. Funding for the Centrally Funded Scheme for Seconded National Experts, which provides for the secondment of Irish civil servants to the EU Institutions, has been  increased from &euro;2 million to &euro;3 million. From 24 Seconded National Experts under the scheme last May, the CFS now supports 35 and is building towards 50. This scheme is vitally important for building and expanding our EU expertise across the civil service and in areas of strategic priority for Ireland in the EU.</p><p>Preliminary work on the establishment of an EU specialist stream within the Irish civil service is also underway. Such a stream will develop expertise of European policy within the civil service, as well as providing a supply of Irish candidates qualified to sit the EU graduate level <i>concours</i>competitions. The Department, through the Permanent Representation in Brussels, is also campaigning for reform of the EU recruitment process in order to address geographical imbalances across Member States. We are following closely developments on the European Commission&rsquo;s new HR Strategy and are working alongside like-minded Member States to make the case for reforms, including nationality-based competitions.</p></reply>

It has been the consistent position of the Government that the Stormont House Agreement provides a balanced and comprehensive framework to address the legacy of the Troubles and it should be implemented for the benefit of the families and in support of reconciliation in Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  The approach to be taken in legislation by the two Governments was the subject of extensive further discussion with the political parties in the talks that led to the Fresh Start Agreement in 2015 and in the talks at Stormont Castle in 2017. A detailed draft of UK legislation was developed, and the British Government held a public consultation on this in 2018-9. However, the legislation process stalled at tat  point. The now published proposals of the British Government with respect to legacy and a statute of limitations is not something that the Government can support. We have consistently said that we are ready to engage with concerns or issues to do with the implementation of the Stormont House Agreement but any such changes must be discussed and agreed by the parties and both Governments. </p>  <p>  It is vital that any approach is collective if it is to work, and crucially, that it meets both the needs of victims and our shared international human rights obligations.</p>  <p>  We will continue to work for the implementation of this collectively agreed framework, in order to support wider societal reconciliation, build greater community confidence in policing and meet the legitimate needs of victims and survivors in Northern Ireland and across the island of Ireland. All recommendations, ideas and concerns with regard to the Agreement&rsquo;s implementation, including those of Dr. Thomas Leahy, are valuable contributions to this debate and have been considered as we have worked for the implementation of the agreement; such contributions will continue to be of importance and value as we seek to make progress on these very sensitive issues.</p></reply>

The former Ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva met with the individual concerned on 2nd March 2016. The current Ambassador met with the individual concerned on 29 July 2019 and again on 16 September 2021. In the intervening periods the Department has also communicated with the individual concerned by email and telephone.</p>  <p>  Ireland has raised the issue of the release of the names of NGO delegates to UN Member States and received assurances directly from the Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights (OHCHR) that, while there had been a historical practice whereby the names of participants were occasionally confirmed to States in limited circumstances, this practice has since ceased.</p>  <p>  Ireland provides un-earmarked funding to the OHCHR for its core development-related work. &euro;1.865 million of un-earmarked funding was provided each year for 2019 and 2020, rising to &euro;1.965 million in 2021. An additional earmarked grant of &euro;300,000 was provided to the OHCHR this year to specifically support work on civil society space and reprisals against human rights defenders. </p>  <p>  This support is part of Ireland's strong advocacy and leadership at the UN and globally on the protection of civil society space and the prevention of reprisals against Human Rights Defenders which engage with Human Rights bodies at the UN. In 2013, Ireland led a new resolution at the Human Rights Council entitled &ldquo;Civil society space: creating and maintaining, in law and in practice a safe and enabling environment&rdquo;. This resolution addressed the issue of civil society space as a human rights concern for the first time at the Human Rights Council. Ireland continues to lead on the renewal of this resolution, most recently in July 2021. In September 2021, Ireland led a successful resolution at the Human Rights Council condemning acts of intimidation or reprisals against Human Rights Defenders engaging with the United Nations.</p>  <p>  In common with other European Union Member States, Ireland has raised our concerns with China regarding the situation in Xinjiang on a number of occasions, both bilaterally and in multilateral fora. Most recently, at the 48th session of the UN Human Rights Council, Ireland joined an EU Group Statement of 26 Member States, which called on China to comply with its obligations under national, and international law to respect and protect human rights, including in Xinjiang. On 21 October, Ireland joined a cross-regional statement on Human Rights in China at the Third Committee of the UN General Assembly, which calls on China to allow immediate, meaningful and unfettered access to Xinjiang for independent observers, including the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.</p>  <p>  We have also raised our concerns bilaterally with the Chinese authorities at senior official level and I discussed the issue with Chinese State Councillor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi during our meeting on 30 May. In that discussion, I outlined Ireland and the EU's position on the treatment of Uighurs and other minorities in Xinjiang. I emphasised the importance of allowing unrestricted access to the region to independent observers in order to make an objective assessment of the situation, particularly through the office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.</p></reply>

The Passport Service maintained operations throughout the pandemic, notwithstanding the fact that the processing of passports requires physical attendance on site to deliver this service. Passport Service staff assisted citizens who required passports for a range of emergency and urgent personal, business or legal reasons, or who had compelling humanitarian needs to travel. As a result of well-implemented safety protocols, 67,000 passports were issued between January and May of this year.</p>  <p>  In the context of the Government&rsquo;s &ldquo;COVID-19 Resilience and Recovery 2021&rdquo;, I recognised that scaling up of our services was necessary and so categorised the Passport Service as an essential service within that framework. I advised Government of my decision on 29 April 2021. Passport Service operations began scaling up on 4 May 2021. </p>  <p>  The Passport Service has issued almost 600,000 passports to date in 2021 and 45% of simple adult renewals issue within one business day. </p>  <p>  I am aware that many applicants wish to have their passport application processed in time for travel over the Christmas season. I wish to assure the Deputy that the Passport Service is attaching particular priority to processing passport applications that are fully in order and complete and have an expected issue date before the Christmas holidays. </p>  <p>  The current passport processing times are:</p>  <p>  - 10 working days for Simple Adult online renewals</p>  <p>  - 15 working days for Complex or child online renewals</p>  <p>  - 40 working days for First Time Applications on Passport Online</p>  <p>  - 8 weeks for An Post&rsquo;s mail-in &ldquo;Passport Express&rdquo; service</p>  <p>  The aforementioned passport processing times are based on current average application turnaround times and relate to passport applications submitted to the Passport Service with required supporting documentation. When passport applicants do not provided all of the requisite documentation to the Passport Service, it takes much longer to process the application and issue a passport. Passport Service figures show that a high proportion of applications are incomplete and the onus is on the applicant to submit the required documents to the Service. While the Passport Service makes every effort to contact applicants in such circumstances, their experience is that many applicants take weeks and sometimes months to send in the necessary documents. </p>  <p>  The Passport Service is currently experiencing a high demand for first time passports. These first time applications are necessarily complex to process, since they are essentially applications for Irish citizenship. The Passport Service must validate the true identity of the applicant and take measures to confirm the applicant&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship. It is the statutory responsibility of the Passport Service to protect the integrity of the Irish passport. Accordingly, a rigorous analysis process is in place to verify the identity and citizenship status of applicants. </p>  <p>  In the case of first time passport applications for children, the consent of guardians must also be thoroughly validated. Due to the intensive analysis underpinning first time online passport applications processing time is 40 working days.</p>  <p>  My Department has been actively working with the Public Appointments Service to recruit additional permanent and temporary staff. This recruitment drive is well underway and will double the number of staff in the Passport Service from June 2021 levels to a total of 920 staff by the end of January. I am confident that the additional staff currently being assigned to the Passport Service will help to reduce turnaround times and to respond to the current and anticipated high demand for passports in 2022</p>  <p>  The Passport Service continually examines how to improve processing times and engagement with applicants. Preparation is currently underway for several system and service improvements that will enhance the customer service experience and will improve processing times. These improvements will be rolled out in the coming weeks and months.</p>  <p>  In the context of the National Development Plan, my Department is making a major investment in the future of the Passport Service.  Over the next couple of years, we will replace the core technology underpinning the service, which will deliver efficiencies and a more resilient passport system.  </p>  <p>  Budget 2022 also included an investment of an additional &euro;10m in passport services in response to the increasing demand for passports both at home and abroad.</p></reply>

Ireland condemns the politically motivated verdicts and believe they represent another step towards the dismantling of the rule of law and a further violation of human rights in Myanmar. </p>  <p>  The proceedings appear to be an attempt to exclude democratically elected leaders, including Aung San Suu Kyi, from future political engagement and the inclusive dialogue process called for by ASEAN&rsquo;s Five Point Consensus. The military&rsquo;s actions show contempt for the will of the people, expressed clearly in the November 2020 elections. Ireland joined statements issued by both the European Union and United Nations Security Council expressing concern at the sentencing and reiterating their calls for the release of those who have been arbitrarily detained since 1 February 2021. </p>  <p>  The coup in Myanmar is a reversal of the progress made towards democracy and rule of law in Myanmar that has taken years to establish. I am gravely concerned by the escalation in violence and displacement in the country and the humanitarian and human rights situation. </p>  <p>  Ireland is actively engaging at the European Union and United Nations to call on all sides to refrain from violence, and to fully respect human rights and comply with international law including international humanitarian and human rights law. </p>  <p>  Ireland, along with our European Union colleagues, has been a steadfast supporter of Myanmar&rsquo;s civilian and democratic transition, its peace process and national reconciliation, and its inclusive socio-economic development. We are currently working with the European Union to consider further actions to restore the democratic path in Myanmar. Through the UN and our Embassy network, we are encouraging those who have influence on the military leadership, including ASEAN and countries within the region, to use it to find a political resolution to this crisis and protect the human rights of the Myanmar people.</p>  <p>  The situation remains on the agenda of the United Nations Security Council and we will continue to work with partners in search of a resolution to the deepening crisis.</p></reply>

Entry into Australia and the issue of visas are matters solely for the Australian authorities. However, I am very conscious of the impact which these travel restrictions are having on many Irish people both here and in Australia, especially those who have not seen family and friends for a very long time, and often in very difficult situations. This was something that I raised with my Australian counterpart, Foreign Minister Marise Payne, when we met virtually in June. </p>  <p>  A Bridging Visa is a temporary Australian visa granted in certain circumstances, for example, while a substantive visa application is being considered. Bridging visas were issued to the holders of temporary Australian visas when those visas expired during the pandemic. This enabled the holders, including many Irish citizens, to remain in Australia and to work there. In general, however, these bridging visas do not give the holder a right to return to Australia if they leave. I fully appreciate that this has left many Irish citizens in Australia in a very difficult position during the pandemic. Full information on bridging visa applications is available on the Australian Department of Home Affairs website at www.homeaffairs.gov.au/. </p>  <p>  I welcome the recent indications by the Australian authorities that they plan to ease international travel restrictions on a phased basis. It is anticipated that fully vaccinated holders of qualifying visas will be permitted to depart and return to Australia from this week onwards and without needing to apply for a special travel exemption. However, the list of qualifying visas does not include bridging visas, even if the holder has applied for one of the qualifying visas. My Department is endeavouring to mitigate the impact of Australia's international travel restrictions on our many Irish citizens in Australia. Our Embassy Canberra and Consulate General Sydney will continue to closely monitor developments and will liaise with the Australian authorities on the easing of travel restrictions, particularly as they affect the Irish holders of Australian bridging visas. Throughout this pandemic, often in difficult circumstances, the Embassy, the Consulate and the Irish Support agencies in Australia have provided consular support to our affected citizens and they will continue to do so as Australia begins to open up to international travel.</p></reply>

This may include &lsquo;local journeys&rsquo; to the UK from within the Common Travel Area (CTA). It is important to note that, while the Bill provides that such a requirement may be introduced, any such requirement would be introduced by way of future amendments to the UK&rsquo;s immigration rules. It is also important to note that the Bill provides that the proposed ETA system will not apply to Irish and British citizens and the UK Government has made clear that there will continue to be no immigration checks on the land border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. The UK Government has spoken about the requirement coming into effect by 2024, though this timeframe could change.</p>  <p>  Officials in my Department are seeking clarification with the UK Government as to how it is proposed to apply the requirement in Northern Ireland and what changes are intended to be introduced in future immigration rules. As the Deputy is aware, tens of thousands of people, including many non-Irish EU/EEA nationals living in Ireland, cross the land border every day &ndash; visiting friends and family, going to work, socialising. There are also considerations in terms of supply chains and for tourism on an all-island basis, should this proposed legislation impact on any cross-border movements for non-Irish EU/EEA nationals. </p>  <p>  For  our part, the Government has made its position clear that there should be no hard border on the island of Ireland. This legislation remains under consideration within the UK Parliament and we will continue to engage with the UK Government to ensure that our position is clearly heard as this legislation progresses.</p></reply>

We are closely following the situation, including in relation to evidence based reports of systemic abuse, torture, arbitrary detention, forced labour, forced sterilisations, and restrictions on freedom of religion and belief.</p>  <p>  I raised our concerns regarding this situation with Chinese State Councillor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi during my trip to China in May. In that discussion, I outlined Ireland and the EU's position on the treatment of Uighurs and other minorities in Xinjiang. I emphasised the importance of allowing unrestricted access to the region to independent observers in order to make an objective assessment of the situation, particularly through the office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.</p>  <p>  Ireland has also been actively engaged on this matter in the multilateral contexts. At the 48th UN Human Rights Council in September this year, Ireland joined an EU Group Statement of 26 Member States, which called on China to comply with its obligations under national and international law to respect and protect human rights, particularly in Xinjiang. In October, Ireland joined a cross-regional statement on the situation in Xinjiang, delivered at the UN General Assembly. The statement called on China to allow &ldquo;immediate, meaningful and unfettered access to Xinjiang for independent observers, including the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  In response to the situation in Xinjiang, and under the EU global human rights sanctions regime, the EU unanimously adopted sanctions on 22 March 2021 against one entity and four individuals in China. The EU global human rights sanctions regime allows the EU to target serious human rights violations and abuses by state and non-state actors worldwide. It enables the EU to stand up quickly and in a more tangible and direct way for human rights, one of the fundamental values of the EU and its foreign policy.</p>  <p>  In relation to the 2022 Winter Olympics, it has not been customary for Minsters or Minsters of State to attend the Winter Olympics in the past. No Government Ministers are scheduled to travel to Beijing for the Winter Olympics as was also the case at the Tokyo Olympics, given COVID19 concerns. The Department of Foreign Affairs, through the Embassy of Ireland in Beijing, will provide appropriate consular assistance to the athletes and their teams for the duration of the Games, particularly in light of the very complex public health requirements to be implemented at the Games.</p>  <p>  The protection and promotion of human rights is a core pillar of Ireland's foreign policy, and Ireland will continue to monitor and assess the situation and, along with our EU partners, engage with Chinese authorities bilaterally and in appropriate multilateral fora to address our concerns. </p></reply>

An estimated 133,000 people, mostly in central and southern areas have been displaced.  There are fears that the situation could continue to worsen into 2022.  The Somalia government declared a state of emergency on 23 November and appealed for humanitarian assistance.  </p>  <p>  Ireland has strong track record of support for the people of Somalia, with the Irish Aid programme contributing over &euro;57 million in humanitarian assistance to the country since 2012.  So far this year Irish Aid funding of &euro;5,756,888 has been allocated to humanitarian action in Somalia, including direct humanitarian funding to Irish NGOs active on the ground responding to the impacts of the drought.  Ireland also contributed &euro;3,500,000 to the Country Based Pooled Fund for Somalia, including this month a specific contribution of &euro;500,000 in response to the drought.    </p>  <p>  The UN OCHA Central Emergency Response Fund, of which Ireland is one of the top ten donors globally, has provided US$8 million to drought response, augmented by $6 million from the Somalia Humanitarian Fund.  These pooled funding instruments provide rapid and flexible funding where it is needed most.  They enable timely, effective and principled humanitarian action while strengthening leadership, coordination and coherence in emergency response.  In 2021, Ireland made an overall contribution of &euro;11,500,000 to the Central Emergency Response Fund. </p></reply>

I have engaged extensively with both the Government of Yemen and countries of the region this year to urge them to work constructively towards a sustainable peace. </p>  <p>  Ireland also welcomes the Yemen Economic Framework proposed by the UN, and we will continue to encourage all parties to constructively engage with these proposals in response to catastrophic food insecurity and poverty in Yemen. </p>  <p>  In 2021, in addition to the &euro;5 million pledged earlier this year as Ireland's contribution to humanitarian situation in Yemen and recognising the scale of the challenge, this month Ireland contributed an additional &euro;1 million to the humanitarian response.

We are mindful that frontline EU Member States like Poland face immense pressures and we recognise that the unprecedented state of affairs at the Polish-Belarusian border has been a major factor in Poland&rsquo;s state of emergency decision.</p>  <p>  Nevertheless, we are very concerned for those migrants at the border and we would appeal to Poland to consider admitting international humanitarian organisations into the relevant area to assist with meeting migrants&rsquo; urgent and basic needs. Independent media access should also be facilitated. Furthermore, we would ask that Poland consider the possibility of accepting help and input from EU sources like Frontex. While the instrumentalisation of migrants by President Lukashenko&rsquo;s regime is to be condemned and the EU&rsquo;s territorial integrity needs to be maintained, EU values must be respected and Europe&rsquo;s humanitarian obligations under the Geneva Conventions upheld.</p>  <p>  At the November Foreign Affairs Council, I joined in discussions on this issue with my fellow Foreign Ministers where we gave political approval to the fifth package of sanctions, co-sponsored by Ireland.</p>  <p>  On a visit to Poland in December, my colleague, Minister of State for European Affairs, Thomas Byrne, TD, met with Poland&rsquo;s Deputy Foreign Minister, Marcin Przydacz, Undersecretary of State for Security, the Americas, Asia and Eastern Policy. Their discussions included developments at the Poland-Belarus border as well as migration and Minister Byrne expressed Ireland&rsquo;s position to Minister Prydacz. Furthermore, on a visit to Lithuania in October, Minister Byrne visited the Lithuanian-Belarusian border and saw first-hand the challenging situation in the region. </p>  <p>  This dialogue and experience will inform Ireland&rsquo;s engagement at EU level with all our fellow Member States, including Poland, to ensure Europe is equipped to deal with its migration challenges in a comprehensive and effective but also humane manner. </p></reply>

These Guidelines have been published on the Department of Foreign Affairs&rsquo; website and members of the Implementation Group including Ibec, Chambers Ireland, the Irish Exporters Association, and Business in the Community Ireland, have promoted the Guidelines. Following the launch of the Guidelines, my Department co-hosted practical webinars for businesses, together with partners including the Trinity Centre for Social Innovation and Shift.  As the Guidelines were published less than eight months ago, it is premature to fully assess their impact at this time.</p>  <p>  It is my understanding that the European Commission is planning to propose a legislative initiative to introduce mandatory human rights and environmental due diligence next year.  I consider this a positive development in the context of the implementation of the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.  However, as the Deputy will be aware, the regulation of businesses is a matter for the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. </p>  <p>  Regarding the potential development of a United Nations legally binding treaty in the area of Business and Human Rights, the European Union holds many of the competences in this policy area.  Accordingly, Ireland is engaging in the process through European Union structures in Brussels and Geneva.  At the most recent negotiation session in respect of a potential treaty, the EU offered to work with the drafters to address concerns with the current draft text.</p>  <p>  Globally, the European Union and its Member States are leaders in implementing the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.  The EU Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy 2020-2024 contains a suite of measures in the area of Business and Human Rights. Ireland strongly supports these initiatives and has shared the lessons learned from the review of our own National Plan at EU level.  This review was completed earlier this year and noted by Government at its meeting of 7 December 2021.</p></reply>

In addition, the Passport Service participates in the inter-departmental Quality Customer Service Action Team. </p>  <p>  The Passport Service Customer Service Hub has been operational since June 2021 in line with the scaling up of passport operations as pandemic restrictions were eased. Customer Service officers respond to customer queries by phone and webchat as well as with enquiries related to Emergency Passport cases. Since June, Customer Service officers have responded to 155,000 queries from customers. </p>  <p>  My Department attaches the highest priority to ensuring that the Passport Service is resourced to respond to current and anticipated high demand for passports. My Department is actively working with the Public Appointments Service to recruit and assign additional permanent and temporary staff between now and the end of January 2022, bringing total staff numbers to 920 and effectively doubling the number of staff at the Passport Service. These staff members are currently being trained and assigned across all areas of the Passport Service, including to the customer service team. I am confident that these additional resources will help to improve customer experience and reduce turnaround times.</p></reply>

The proposal is targeted and pragmatic and aims at ensuring that governments can resort to compulsory licences, including to export to countries with no or limited manufacturing capacities, in the most effective manner adapted to the circumstances of a pandemic.  </p>  <p>  The EU is of the view that there is no single solution and that a multi-pronged approach is needed and that discussions should concentrate on how the Intellectual Property system can contribute towards increasing the manufacturing capacity and the equitable access to vaccines around the world.</p>  <p>Despite the postponement of the 12th WTO Ministerial Conference, WTO members will continue to engage in a solution-oriented manner to find an outcome on how the WTO can contribute to an effective response to any pandemic, not just the current one.</p>  <p>  Ireland will engage with the European Commission and other member states on the EU position for the WTO discussions including discussions on how the flexibilities within the TRIPS Agreement can contribute towards increasing the manufacturing capacity and the equitable access to vaccines around the world.</p>  <p>  The global production of vaccines is increasing rapidly and it is estimated that 12 billion doses of COVID vaccines will be produced by the end of 2021.  The EU considers the COVAX facility as the mechanism best placed to ensure equitable access to the global supply of vaccines for low, middle, and high income countries.</p>  <p>  Team Europe has committed to donate 700 million doses of vaccines to low and middle income countries by mid-2022, of which 250 million should be delivered by the end of this year.  In addition the EU is investing &euro;1billion to ramp up vaccine production capacity in Africa.</p>  <p>  Ireland has contributed &euro;8.5million in funding to COVAX in 2021 and is donating 1.3 million vaccines to low and middle income countries via the COVAX facility.  Further donations via the facility are expected.</p></reply>

The primary day-to-day tasking of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the European Union. In terms of fishery protection the Naval Service is tasked with patrolling all Irish waters from the shoreline to the outer limits of the Exclusive Economic Zone. These patrols are carried out on a regular and frequent basis and are directed to all areas of Irish waters as necessary.</p>  <p>  In relation to national sea-fishery protection roles, the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006 established the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA) as the competent Authority for securing efficient and effective enforcement of sea fisheries protection legislation and the sustainable exploitation of marine fish resources from the waters around Ireland within Ireland's EEZ. A Service Level Agreement is in place which underpins the relationship between the SFPA and the Defence Organisation. </p>  <p>  The Naval Service work in close cooperation with the SFPA in relation to a risk based approach to fishery protection to better utilise resources.

The normal maximum periods of service for personnel enlisted to the PDF post 1 January 1994 are:</p>  <p>  - Line Privates, Line Corporals (and Naval Service equivalent ranks) and those in receipt of Technical Pay Groups 1 or 2, may not serve beyond 21 years; </p>  <p>  - Privates and Corporals (and Naval Service equivalent ranks) in receipt of Technical Pay Group 3 or above may serve up to 50 years of age; </p>  <p>  - Sergeants (and Naval Service equivalent rank) may serve up to 50 years of age;</p>  <p>  - Higher ranked NCOs may serve up to 56 years of age.</p>  <p>  Arising from an adjudication in 2015, it was agreed that a review of contracts of service for Line Corporals and Privates and Corporals in receipt of Technical Pay 1 and 2 would be conducted. It was subsequently agreed with PDFORRA that all Privates and Corporals recruited post 1994, would be allowed to continue in service to 31 December 2022 (or until they reach the age of 50), provided these personnel meet certain criteria during the interim period, including medical grades and fitness tests. This agreement was extended to include post 1994 Sergeants, who also can also continue to serve to the same date, subject to their meeting similar criteria in the interim period. These measures are in place to provide time for the review to be completed. </p>  <p>  A joint civil/military review of mandatory retirement ages of all ranks in the Permanent Defence Force has been conducted. The review has taken into account the Report of the Public Service Pay Commission on recruitment and retention in the Permanent Defence Force, which included in their recommendations, the need to consider options to tackle barriers to extended participation in the Permanent Defence Force.  </p>  <p>  As the recommendations in the review require consideration from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, in relation to implications on costs and pensions, the matter is currently the subject of detailed discussions with that Department. Discussions with PDFORRA will take place following the conclusion of the consultation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>  <p>  As regards the age that such members become eligible for a pension the position is that as with public service employees generally, the specific pension arrangements of members of the PDF depend primarily on when a person first joins the public service.  </p>  <p>  For enlisted personnel who joined prior to 1 April 2004, pension is payable immediately following retirement and regardless of age.  The minimum service required to qualify for a pension is 21 years, or 12 if discharged on medical grounds.  Maximum benefits are payable after 31 years&rsquo; service.</p>  <p>  For enlisted personnel who joined the PDF between 1 April 2004 and 31 December 2012 the minimum pension age is 50. Otherwise, where retirement is before age 50, pension benefits are preserved, i.e. payable from age 60.  A minimum service of 2 years is required for pension (whether immediate or preserved) and maximum benefits are payable after 30 years&rsquo; service. </p>  <p>  A person who enlisted from 1 January 2013 onwards is a member of the Single Public Service Pension Scheme and benefits are payable immediately on retirement from the PDF after age 50, and subject to having a minimum of 2 years&rsquo; pensionable service.  </p>  <p>  Immediate pension benefits may also be paid in a limited number of specific situations such as in the case of ill-health retirement and death. </p></reply>

The maintenance of the Air Corps fleet falls into three broad categories: scheduled, unscheduled and routine/daily. The use of performance based maintenance contracts with original equipment manufacturers assists the Air Corps in keeping downtime of aircraft to the minimum and this is in line with international best practice. </p>  <p>  It is currently the case that various aspects of aircraft maintenance are out-sourced by the Air Corps because the cost of in-house provision of such niche expertise and the specialist equipment required to certify airframes would be prohibitively expensive and not cost effective in the context of the number of airframes operated by the Air Corps.</p>  <p>  In this regard, the Military Authorities have advised that the Irish Air Corps has a contract with Leonardo Aircraft, the original equipment manufacturers, for service support provided by a number of their aircraft technicians.  These personnel provide additional specialist helicopter maintenance services on site in Casement Aerodrome and are directly employed by Leonardo Aircraft and are not outside agency aircraft maintenance workers employed under a contract for services directly by the Air Corps.  In addition, they are not senior aircraft inspectors and the work undertaken by them is carried out under the supervision of senior Air Corps Technicians and Aeronautical Engineering Officers. The invoiced cost to date in 2021 for this original equipment manufacturer service support is &euro;172,000.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Defence Forces have the necessary modern and effective range of equipment available to them to ensure that they can fulfil the roles assigned to them by Government.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-12-14a.950.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021121400090#WRV04200"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 380 and 381 together.</p>  <p>  A range of measures are in place to provide enhanced substitute cover in the context of current challenges.  </p>  <p>  The higher education institutions (HEIs) have ensured flexibility to programme delivery to enhance the availability of professional master of education (PME) students to undertake substitute work. PME student teachers have been advised to register with the Teaching Council and to register with Sub Seeker, the national substitution portal service to make their availability known to schools. </p>  <p>  In addition, the HEIs providing undergraduate programmes of initial teacher education have agreed to facilitate the release of 3rd and year 4th year students to support schools up to the end of the current term. They have also agreed to explore flexible options in relation to the assessment requirement for programmes in the context of students being available to support schools. </p>  <p>  The education stakeholders, including the Department, the HEIs and the Teaching Council, will continue to work together to address any practical issues and ensure the ongoing availability of student teachers to support schools pre and post-Christmas. </p>  <p>  A further 200 posts have been allocated to the primary substitute teacher supply panels in existing/new areas where significant challenges in sourcing substitution has continued, bringing the total to 680 posts covering approximately 2,600 schools. There are 7 primary substitute teacher supply panels in operation in County Kildare, covering 104 schools. A further 13 positions have been recently sanctioned, increasing the allocation in the county to 33 supply panel teachers.  </p>  <p>  In order to assist with the recruitment of teachers to supply panels, and in the context of the Covid-19 emergency, the Teaching Council has confirmed that newly qualified teachers (NQTs) who secure posts on supply panels in the 2021/2022 academic year may complete Droichead, the induction framework for NQTs. This is an exceptional time bound measure.  Further guidance will be provided by the National Induction Programme for Teachers regarding the role of the base school and partner schools in the process.</p>  <p>  The supply panels work alongside the existing methods of sourcing substitute teachers, such as the national substitution portal service Sub Seeker, operated by the Irish Primary Principals' Network and developed in accordance with my Department's Teacher Supply Action Plan. Schools can also make local arrangements to have their own regular substitutes to call on if needed. </p>  <p>  In addition to the expansion of the supply panels, qualified teachers on secondment to the Department&rsquo;s teacher education support services have been asked to make themselves available to provide substitute cover in schools. Arrangements have been made for available teachers from these services to register with Sub Seeker. </p>  <p>  Continuing professional development (CPD) where substitution is required has been suspended until after the February 2022 mid-term, with the exception of planned CPD relating to reforms in senior cycle examinable subjects. This measure is being taken on an exceptional basis. </p>  <p>  Retired teachers returning to classrooms until the end of the current school term will not have their pension abated. </p>  <p>  In exceptional circumstances where there is no substitute available it may be possible for the Treora&iacute; (formerly co-operating teachers) who host student teachers on school placement to provide substitute cover for absences of a very short duration in their own school if another substitute cannot be sourced at short notice. This should be for the shortest time possible until a substitute can be recruited. </p>  <p>  At post primary level a new temporary arrangement has been put in place to provide principals with an alternative means of sourcing appropriate substitution cover, preferably with subject appropriate qualifications, where none is otherwise available.  This scheme will assist post-primary schools to ensure that they can source sufficient substitution cover, in circumstances where schools cannot source cover through the existing arrangements.  Post-primary teachers will now be able to work over 22 hours per week, working extra hours to provide substitute cover, up to a total of 35 additional hours between 29th November and 28th February, 2022.</p>  <p>  These recently announced measures are in addition to those already in place, including, for the current school year, changes made to the career break scheme to permit teachers on career break to carry out unlimited substitute work. Changes have also been made to the job sharing scheme to permit job sharing teachers carry out substitute work on the days they are rostered off, in their own or in other schools. </p>  <p>  The Teaching Council has undertaken a communications campaign with the over 111,000 teachers on its register to raise awareness to the current teacher substitute challenges and to ask registered teachers who are available to do so to register with Sub Seeker, so that their availability to sub is known to schools seeking substitute teachers. </p>  <p>  Primary schools with teaching principals have also been asked to cluster their allocation of principal release days to form a full-time fixed-term post to minimise the requirement for substitute teachers.</p>  <p>  The provision of education for children with special needs is an ongoing priority for Government. The numbers of special classes, special education teachers and Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) are at unprecedented levels.  </p>  <p>  Budget 2022 announced details of funding for an additional 1,165 SNAs (in 2022) to provide support to children with special educational needs, which will bring the total number of SNAs to 19,169 at the end of December 2022.  This represents an increase of 81% in the number of SNAs provided since 2011 at which point 10,575 SNAs were available.</p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide. It has well established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents. NCSE seeks to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special education placements.  </p>  <p>  The Special Needs Assistant (SNA) scheme is designed to provide schools with additional adult support staff who can assist children with special educational needs who also have additional and significant care needs.  Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills. </p>  <p>  SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated.  </p>  <p>  Where circumstances in school change during the course of the 2021/22 school year that materially increase the level of care need in a school to the extent that the school can clearly demonstrate that it cannot be met within the existing SNA allocation, the school may apply to the NCSE for a review. Detailed information on the NCSE exceptional review process is published on the NCSE website ncse.ie/for-schools. </p>  <p>  The allocation of 1,165 SNAs announced in Budget 2022 is to meet the care needs of pupils in 2022 and will enable the establishment of new special classes, creation of new places in special schools, support children in mainstream classes for the 2022/23 school year.</p>  <p>  My Department provides funding to recognised primary and post-primary schools in the Free Education Scheme to enable them cater for ancillary services.  However, the Boards of Management of these schools are responsible for the employment of ancillary staff and ensuring relief staff are put in place as needed.  My Department also provides each Education and Training Board (ETB) with an administration and maintenance staffing allocation to support ETB schools, colleges, head office and other centres of education.  It is the responsibility of each ETB to recruit and manage staffing levels within this allocation including ensuring relief staff are put in place as needed. </p>  <p>  My Department has sought to support ancillary staff during the Covid-19 period through certain actions. For example special working arrangements were put in place and the Employee Assistance Service was extended to ancillary staff.</p></reply>

Updated guidance for schools on Practical Steps for the Deployment of Good Ventilation Practices in Schools was provided at the end of May following the work of an expert group that carefully considered the role of ventilation in managing COVID-19. A copy of the guidance is published on the Gov.ie website. </p>  <p>  The Expert Group in its report notes &ldquo;very good advice is contained in the Department of Education&rsquo;s Practical Steps for the Deployment of Good Ventilation Practices in Schools&rdquo; And that &ldquo;It must be emphasized that ventilation should be delivered as part of a layered strategy of protective measures to control the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  The over-arching approach in the guidance is for schools to have windows open as fully as possible when classrooms are not in use and partially open when classrooms are in use. The Expert Group also note &ldquo;consider using a portable carbon dioxide (CO2) monitor to identify areas of the school with inadequate ventilation. The Departments guidance outlines CO2 monitors can play a part in providing a useful general indication that areas/rooms may not be adequately ventilated. They can enable occupants to become familiar with the impacts of activities, outdoor weather and window openings on levels of good ventilation. The provision of portable CO2 monitors provides schools with the flexibility to focus their use to those rooms where most beneficial to inform strategies for optimising ventilation in the school.  In excess of 35,400 monitors were delivered to schools nationwide at a cost of circa &euro;4 million. </p>  <p>  A dedicated team has been established in the Department to support schools that may have concerns about ventilation. Officers are also available to contact schools where required, walking through the steps the schools should take to deploy good ventilation practices etc.  Where it is not possible for a school to access the expertise of an engineer or architect, and where necessary, a technical assessment to assist the school can be facilitated through the Department.</p>  <p>  Schools that identify inadequate ventilation in a room can utilise their minor work grant (for minor improvements) or apply for emergency works grant assistance to address ventilation enhancements on a permanent basis.</p>  <p>  There is no one solution that fits all scenarios, each application requires bespoke analysis and selection of the appropriate unit(s) matched to the specific room size and volume. If, following consultation with a supplier a school feels that its individual space may require specific technical specialist advice then the assistance of a Chartered Engineer or Registered Architect can be sought.</p>  <p>  The requirement for air cleaners in schools will depend on advices provided to schools by their Architect/Engineer. As part of contingency planning, the Department has put arrangements in place for a small reserve of air cleaners to facilitate quick deployment to any primary or post-primary school which has an immediate need and has been unsuccessful in sourcing locally. To date there has been no requirement to draw from the Department of Education's reserve.</p>  <p>  The Departments approach on good ventilation in schools, as part of a layered strategy of protective measures to control the spread of the virus, is fully consistent with Public Health advice and the Expert Group recommendations on good practices, the use of portable CO2 monitors and the targeted deployment of HEPA air filter devices where necessary for poorly ventilated areas.</p></reply>

As with all other guidelines around public health measures, my Department has been led by expert medical advice provided by the Government through the HSE and other relevant public bodies.</p>  <p>My Department&rsquo;s Circular Letter 0042/2021 details the current working arrangements and leave arrangements during the COVID-19 pandemic for teachers and special needs assistants employed in recognised primary and post primary schools.  This Circular should be read in conjunction with Information Note TC 0027/2021 which was published on 6th December 2021.</p>  <p>  The HSE advice on the &lsquo;very high risk&rsquo; group is at link: www2.hse.ie/conditions/coronavirus/people-at-higher-risk.html.  Having considered the most up to date HSE advice, if an SNA considers they are at very high risk of serious illness from contracting COVID-19, they may apply to the Occupational Health Service (Medmark) for a COVID-19 health risk assessment to be carried out. Having considered the medical information provided with the OHS Risk Assessment Questionnaire, the OHS will provide the SNA with a &lsquo;COVID-19 Health Risk Categorisation Report&rsquo; which advises whether they are at a very high risk of  serious illness from contracting COVID-19.  The COVID-19 health risk categorisation assessments are performed by a team of qualified and experienced specialists in occupational medicine. Available medical evidence, including reports from treating consultants as well as vaccination status of SNAs, are considered during the OHS COVID-19 health risk categorisation assessment process.   </p>  <p>  Based on the details provided by the Deputy, Medmark carried out a COVID-19 health risk assessment on the SNA in question and he has been categorised as &lsquo;high risk&rsquo;.  The &lsquo;high risk&rsquo; group is defined by the HSE and in accordance with this advice, an SNA in the &lsquo;high risk&rsquo; group who is not ill must attend the workplace and should take extra care to practice social distancing and hand hygiene and the use of personal protective equipment.</p>  <p>  An SNA who has been categorised by Medmark and considers that the OHS &lsquo;COVID-19 Health Risk Categorisation Report&rsquo; places them in an incorrect risk category, may request a review. Medmark will re-evaluate the medical evidence provided. The SNA may provide additional medical evidence as part of the review process. In a situation where the review outcome is that the COVID-19 health risk categorisation remains the same, a further review will only be undertaken, where additional medical evidence indicates there has been a change in the SNA&rsquo;s medical status or where there is a change in the HSE guidelines for the &lsquo;high risk&rsquo; group.</p>  <p>  My Department has always been guided by public health advice in relation to appropriate COVID-19 infection prevention and control measures in place in schools. These measures protect students, their parents and school staff and are very effective to help prevent and control COVID-19 in schools.  My Department will continue to work closely with public health officials and the education stakeholders in respect of the safe operation of schools during COVID-19.</p></reply>

This is a free secure online platform linking a community of more than one million teachers across Europe and supports teachers to find partners and work on joint projects in any curricular area. To-date, a total of 1,890 eTwinning projects have been registered with Irish teachers involving countries from the forty-four participating countries in Europe and beyond. Approximately 1,100 of those projects involved secondary schools. </p>  <p>  However, the acquisition of European language competency by students plays a key part in the success of such mobilities and exchanges.  The Deputy will be aware that Languages Connect is Ireland&rsquo;s Strategy for Foreign Languages in Education which aims to increase and diversify the range of languages taught and learned.  The Department of Education, through Post Primary Languages Ireland (PPLI) provides funding for the School Exchanges Scheme.  Under the Scheme, up to twenty schools annually have been provided with &euro;15,000 in funding over a three year period.  The funding can be used towards exchange costs such as flights, to offer scholarships to students who would not otherwise be able to participate, or for other needs that the school identifies as contributing towards language learning on the exchange. </p></reply>

This was acknowledged in the Comprehensive Review of the Special Needs Assistant Scheme (SNAs) published by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) in 2018. </p>  <p>  The Review made a number of recommendations regarding SNAs including referencing the training needs of SNAs.  In this regard, the NCSE recommended that a new national training programme at Level 5 of the National Qualification Framework be developed for existing SNAs who do not have the requisite level of training and for new SNAs on appointment.  The NCSE also recommended that training tailored to the specific complex needs of some students being cared for by SNAs would also be provided.  </p>  <p>  The policy advice has been considered by the Department. It was decided that priority should be given to the development of a training programme for SNAs who may not have had a recent opportunity to access a training programme tailored to their role.  The new first national training course for SNAs provided by UCD aims to enhance the knowledge, skills and expertise of SNAs whose work is central to the inclusion of students with additional care and complex needs in school life. The programme is fully funded by the Department and delivered at no cost to the SNA. </p>  <p>  This is the first national training programme for SNAs employed in schools and is tailored to their needs.  As this is the first programme, it is appropriate to take the time to review outcomes which will inform the future approach to ongoing training and professional development of SNAs. Part of that consideration will include accreditation.</p>  <p>  Raising the minimum qualification for appointment as a special needs assistant has been referred to the Workplace Relations Commission and the Department has been engaging in that process. </p>  <p>  The recruitment and appointment of Special Needs Assistants is a matter for the individual school authority and the Department's circular 36/2020 and 51/2019 sets out the current educational requirements for appointment as a Special Needs Assistant (SNA). In addition, the actual requirements for a post will vary depending on the specific needs of the children and the school to which the SNA is to be appointed. The Department does not believe that the existing minimum qualifications has impacted on the calibre of person appointed and it is also the case that people with experience and/or higher qualifications than the minimum are often the successful candidate in competitions held by schools.</p>  <p>  However, having considered the claim and, in particular, the period of time since they were set, the Department is open to reviewing the position. However, the Department is not yet in a position to indicate when that review might take place but is of the view that the forthcoming review of the SNA contract proposed as part of the Building Momentum national pay agreement should be carried out and implemented first.</p></reply>

SENOs also make recommendations to my Department where assistive technology/specialised equipment is required. The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in making recommendations for support.</p>  <p>  In order to qualify for equipment under the assistive technology scheme, a student must have been diagnosed with a physical or communicative disability and must also have a recommendation in a professional assessment that the equipment is essential in order to allow the student to access the curriculum. It must also be clear that the existing I.T. equipment in the school is insufficient to meet the child's needs.</p>  <p>  Schools make applications directly to the SENO, providing details of the student&rsquo;s special educational needs or disability, including details of the approach taken by the school in making relevant interventions. </p>  <p>  SENOs will review the application, and professional reports provided in support of same, in order to establish whether the criteria of the scheme have been met. They will then make a recommendation to my Department as to whether or not assistive technology is required; and based on this recommendation, my Department will decide on the level of grant, if any, to be provided. </p>  <p>  Although equipment is sanctioned under the Assistive Technology scheme for use by particular students, it is the property of the school, and the school&rsquo;s management authority is responsible for maintenance, repair, and insurance of the equipment. </p>  <p>  It is the responsibility of each individual school to purchase the equipment after the grant is sanctioned. My Department does not hold a record of the average wait time from start of application to the time a student receives their assistive technology. However, I can confirm that 3,370 applications have been forwarded from the NCSE since January 2021 to date, with 350 applications currently on hand. In addition, all applications for audiology supports for children with hearing impairment and equipment to assist children with visual impairment are fully up to date and there are currently none outstanding. </p>  <p>  In relation to the specific wait times requested from date of application, I have referred to the NCSE for their direct reply.</p></reply>

As outlined in the notice to schools, arrangements have been made for available teachers from these services to register on the SubSeeker portal which is available to all schools. Principals can access available substitutes using this portal. </p>  <p>  Those staff working in the Teacher Education support services also continue to support schools through their work in the support services when they are not called to provide substitute cover. A number of secondees have also been retained to continue to support the system by delivering planned priority CPD relating to reforms in Senior Cycle examinable subjects and some limited provision at primary level (e.g. Reading Recovery). All other CPD at both Primary and Post Primary, where substitution is required, will be deferred until after the February 2022 mid-term break. The temporary suspension of CPD will not affect the completion of the Droichead process for Newly Qualified Teachers whose contracts are due to end prior to the mid-term break in February. It is intended that this deferred CPD will be re-scheduled in the period following the February 2022 mid-term break. </p>  <p>  This is just one of a number of measures to increase the availability of substitute teachers in schools, including of course the flexibility being provided by Higher Education Institutes to enable students teachers to support schools up to the end of term. </p></reply>

Updated guidance for schools on Practical Steps for the Deployment of Good Ventilation Practices in Schools was provided at the end of May following the work of an expert group that carefully considered the role of ventilation in managing COVID-19. </p><p>A copy of the guidance is published on the Gov.ie website. </p><p>The Expert Group in its report notes &ldquo;very good advice is contained in the Department of Education&rsquo;s Practical Steps for the Deployment of Good Ventilation Practices in Schools&rdquo;.</p><p>And that &ldquo;It must be emphasized that ventilation should be delivered as part of a layered strategy of protective measures to control the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19.&rdquo;</p><p>The over-arching approach in the guidance is for schools to have windows open as fully as possible when classrooms are not in use and partially open when classrooms are in use. </p><p>The Expert Group also note &ldquo;consider using a portable carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) monitor to identify areas of the school with inadequate ventilation. The Departments guidance outlines CO<sub>2</sub>monitors can play a part in providing a useful general indication that areas/rooms may not be adequately ventilated. They can enable occupants to become familiar with the impacts of activities, outdoor weather and window openings on levels of good ventilation. The provision of portable CO<sub>2</sub>monitors provides schools with the flexibility to focus their use to those rooms where most beneficial to inform strategies for optimising ventilation in the school. </p><p>In excess of 36,000 monitors have been delivered to schools nationwide at a cost of circa &euro;4 million. </p><p>A dedicated team has been established in the Department to support schools that may have concerns about ventilation. Officers are also available to contact schools where required, walking through the steps the schools should take to deploy good ventilation practices etc.  Where it is not possible for a school to access the expertise of an engineer or architect, and where necessary, a technical assessment to assist the school can be facilitated through the Department.</p><p>Schools that identify inadequate ventilation in a room can utilise their minor work grant (for minor improvements) or apply for emergency works grant assistance to address ventilation enhancements on a permanent basis.</p><p>The Expert Group also notes the potential use for air cleaners &ldquo;consider using stand-alone high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter devices to further reduce airborne virus in poorly ventilated spaces&rdquo;.</p><p>The Departments Guidance is clear that where the recommended measures in the Practical Steps and poor ventilation continues to exist in a particular room/area, air cleaners may be considered as an additional measure in conjunction with other methods of ventilation that are available. This is line with Expert Group guidance which identifies that in areas with poor ventilation that structural interventions and measures to increase natural ventilation should be completed. Where such structural interventions or measures are not possible in the short term, that consideration should be given to using stand-alone HEPA filter devices in poorly ventilated spaces pending the completion of structural interventions.</p><p>There is no one solution that fits all scenarios, each application requires bespoke analysis and selection of the appropriate unit(s) matched to the specific room size and volume. If, following consultation with a supplier a school feels that its individual space may require specific technical specialist advice then the assistance of a Chartered Engineer or Registered Architect can be sought.</p><p>The requirement for air cleaners in schools will depend on advices provided to schools by their Architect/Engineer. </p></reply>

Its policy advice is always informed by international best practice.</p>  <p>  A lot of work has been done and NCSE published a progress report in November, 2019. At that stage, NCSE had reviewed existing educational provision in Ireland, conducted a detailed literature review, consulted various stakeholder groups and visited a number of Irish schools. NCSE had also looked at fully inclusive schools and practice in Canada and Portugal.</p>  <p>  The report found that no evidence to show that one type of special education placement is better that another.  It also stated that any decision to move towards greater inclusion would require careful consideration and planning. It is not something that could be achieved in the short term.</p>  <p>Since the publication of the progress report, NCSE has conducted further research and analysis, engaged in a public consultation survey and has received further submissions and expert inputs. It has also examined the implications arising from the UNCRPD.</p>  <p>  Before the advice is finalised, every effort is being made to ensure that NCSE has consulted widely with a view to developing shared understandings on the critical issues involved and proposed solutions.</p>  <p>  The policy advice is expected to be completed in early 2022.</p></reply>

The Department has always been guided by public health advice in relation to appropriate COVID-19 infection prevention and control measures in place in schools.  These measures protect students/pupils, their parents and school staff and are very effective when adhered to. </p>  <p>  The Department of Health and the HSE, working in collaboration with the Department of Education recently announced a programme in which antigen tests will be made available to children in primary schools. These arrangements for students and staff in post primary schools are identical to those in place for confirmed cases and close contacts in the wider society.</p>  <p>  Schools are still required to undertake the two most important actions to prevent the introduction and spread of Covid-19 (and other respiratory viruses), by ensuring no-one with new acute symptoms attend class, and that all recommended infection prevention and control measures are in place in line with school Covid response plans.</p></reply>

Updated guidance for schools on Practical Steps for the Deployment of Good Ventilation Practices in Schools was provided at the end of May following the work of an expert group that carefully considered the role of ventilation in managing COVID-19. A copy of the guidance is published on the Gov.ie website.</p><p>The over-arching approach in the guidance is for schools to have windows open as fully as possible when classrooms are not in use and partially open when classrooms are in use. </p><p>The guidance outlines that Carbon Dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) monitors can play a part in providing a useful general indication that areas/rooms may not be adequately ventilated. They can enable occupants to become familiar with the impacts of activities, outdoor weather and window openings on levels of good ventilation. The provision of portable CO2 monitors provides schools with the flexibility to focus their use to those rooms where most beneficial to inform strategies for optimising ventilation in the school. </p><p>In excess of 35,400 monitors were dispatched in the initial  delivery phase. In excess of a further 1,500 have since been dispatched to schools who requested and were approved for additional CO2 monitors.</p><p>St Teresa's National School Balbriggan received nine CO2 monitors as part of it's original allocation.

Initially, payment was made at a weekly rate of &euro;350.</p>  <p>  From 26 June 2020, the rate at which the PUP is paid was linked to the amount that individuals previously earned.  This ensured the sustainability of the scheme and made it more targeted and fairer. In determining the rate payable, the objective was to ensure that recent earnings were taken into account.  This is consistent with the approach underpinning short-term income support schemes such as Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit and Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance. </p>  <p>  The person concerned was self-employed prior to claiming the PUP.  The rate of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment for a self-employed person is calculated by reference to their reckonable income in either 2018 or 2019, whichever is the greater.  In 2018, the person had average weekly earnings of &euro;111; in 2019, their income was below the threshold of &euro;5,000 at which self-employed PRSI contributions are payable.  On that basis the PUP was paid at a rate of &euro;203 from 26 June 2020.</p>  <p>  With the reopening of the economy it is important in the interest of fairness and sustainability to restore standard Jobseeker terms in a controlled and considered manner.  The need for exceptional measures has diminished as more and more employees close their PUP claims to return to work.  To that end, the process of transitioning persons in receipt of the PUP to standard Jobseeker schemes commenced in October 2021.  The person concerned does not qualify for Jobseekers Benefit Self-Employed as she has no qualifying PRSI record in 2019 which forms the Governing Contribution Year for claims made in 2021.  The person concerned applied for and was awarded Jobseekers Allowance, which is a means tested payment.  Payment was awarded at a weekly rate of &euro;164 as the person has an occupational pension of &euro;39 which must be taken into account in the calculation of any entitlement to Jobseekers Allowance. </p>  <p>  The Benefit Payment for 65 year olds was introduced in line with the Programme for Government commitment, to provide a benefit payment for people who are  aged 65 and who are required to retire, or who chose to retire, without a requirement to sign on, engage in activation measures or be available for and genuinely seeking work. </p>  <p>  To be eligible for the payment a person must satisfy all the qualifying conditions of the scheme.  The Governing Contribution Year is the second last complete tax year, for example, for a claim in 2022 the PRSI record from 2020 is used to establish eligibility.  </p>  <p>  The attribution of contributions in respect of periods impacted by the pandemic is intended to ensure that persons entitled to and in receipt of certain Covid-19 income supports, including PUP, will not be disadvantaged in accessing social insurance benefits in the future.  </p>  <p>  The legislation underpinning the measure makes provision for the Minister for Social Protection, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and having considered certain matters set out in the legislation, to prescribe the number of self-employment contributions to be attributed to a self-employed contributor.  </p>  <p>  A self-employed contributor has a period of time following the end of the contribution year to remit and pay his or her social insurance liability for that contribution year.  For example, self-employed contributors have until the end of October 2021 to file their self-assessment tax returns for 2020, including the payment of social insurance contributions where they are liable to do so for that year.</p>  <p>  Once data on the social insurance returns made by self-employed workers in respect of 2020 are available towards the end of this year or early in 2022, I and my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will be in a position to prescribe, as appropriate, the number of self-employment contributions required to protect the social insurance entitlements of self-employed workers who were in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment in 2020 and who were not in a position to discharge their social insurance liability for that year.  </p>  <p>  In the event that the person concerned does not have a liability to pay self-employment contributions in respect of the 2020 year, they may be entitled to attributed contributions as set out above.  On that basis, the person may qualify for the Benefit Payment for 65-year olds once all the other eligibility criteria for the scheme are met. </p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Recipients retain the advantages of Jobseeker's allowance such as the retention of secondary benefits and access to activation programmes.  The 2021 Further Revised Estimate provides for expenditure of &euro;61.7 million on the scheme.</p>  <p>  The means test is flexible to allow for significant fluctuations from one year to the next.  Virtually all income is included in the means test but it is assessed in different ways and certain disregards apply.  Payments received under the Rural Environmental Protection Scheme (REPS), the Agri-Environmental Options Scheme (AEOS), the National Parks and Wildlife Service Farm Plan Scheme (NPWS) and the Green Low-Carbon Agri-Environment Scheme (GLAS) attract a disregard of &euro;2,540, with 50% of the balance assessed as means.</p>  <p>  There are annual disregards for dependent children; &euro;254 for each of the first two children and &euro;381 for the third and other children.  Remaining farm income and income from off-farm self-employment is then assessed at 70%.  In line with other means tested social welfare schemes, the first &euro;20,000 of capital is not assessed.</p>  <p>  On 29th November I announced the publication of the Social Welfare Bill which will enact Budget 2022 measures.  Included in this Budget Bill is provision for an extensive expansion to the list of Agri- Environmental schemes which will qualify towards the disregard of &euro;2,540.  The measure will support the Government&rsquo;s climate change agenda and will act as an incentive to farmers to participate in the schemes.</p>  <p>  The approximate estimated annual cost of increasing the income disregard from 30% to 45% would be &euro;4.3 million.  This estimated cost is for a full year and based on current numbers of farm assist recipients. </p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2022 I secured an increase of &euro;5 per week in the personal rate for Farm Assist which will increase to &euro;208 and proportionate increases for adult and child dependents will also apply.

The Commission was an independent body comprised of knowledgeable and experienced academics, pension experts, members of civil society and representatives of workers and employers.  The Commission has completed its work and its report was published on 7th October 2021.  The Commission's Report, its Technical Sub-Committee's working papers, and submissions made to the Commission are available on the Commission&rsquo;s website, pensionscommission.gov.ie.</p>  <p>  The Commission&rsquo;s Report is a comprehensive report that takes account of an assessment of various analyses of population, labour force and expenditure projections; an examination of international approaches; and responses to an extensive consultation process.  It has unambiguously established that the current State Pension system is not sustainable into the future and that changes are needed, and it has set out a wide range of recommendations in this regard - including measures to increase Social Insurance Fund (PRSI) income.</p>  <p>  The report has been referred to the Joint Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands and to the Commission for Taxation and Welfare for their views.  I understand that both the Chair of the Commission, Ms. Josephine Feehily and the Chair of its Technical Sub-Committee, Ms. Roma Burke met with the Joint Committee on 17th November 2021.  Officials from my Department also attended this meeting. </p>  <p>  In the interests both of older people and of future generations of older people, the Government intends to consider the comprehensive and far reaching recommendations in the Commission&rsquo;s Report very carefully and holistically.  My officials will work over the coming months to examine each of the recommendations.  They will consult across Government through the Cabinet Committee system.  </p>  <p>  I think it is really important that we complete that work before reaching conclusions.  I intend to bring a recommended response and implementation plan to Government by the end of March 2022.  </p>  <p>  The State Pension is the bedrock of the pension system in Ireland.  It is extremely effective at ensuring that our pensioners do not experience poverty.  This Government is committed to ensuring that this remains the case for current pensioners, those nearing State Pension age and today&rsquo;s young workers including those who are only starting their careers. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The majority of workers who exited PUP returned to employment. </p>  <p>  The PUP scheme, which closed for applications on 8th July 2021, has been re-opened again specifically to support workers who lose their employment as a direct result of the introduction of new public health restrictions effective from 7th December 2021, which mainly affects workers in the night-time economy including the live entertainment industry.  Workers who lose their employment on or after Tuesday 7 December because of the effects of these restrictions are eligible to apply for PUP.  This includes self-employed who lose their employment or experience a significant reduction in their income as a consequence of these latest restrictions. </p>  <p>  As the current restrictions are targeted and limited in nature a sectoral approach is required.  On 8th December, the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media announced a funding package of &euro;50m to support the Live Performance Sector which includes &euro;34 million funding for the Live Performance Support Scheme.  The Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media is also examining how further supports can be provided to the broader events sector.

The Appeals Office determined on appeal that the worker was in fact self-employed.  In reaching this determination the Appeals Officer set out a number of criteria that informed the decision and that could then be used on a case by case basis when deciding whether a worker was employed or self-employed.  It is not the case that the determination by the Appeals Officer was used to classify all people working as couriers as self-employed.</p>  <p>  While Deciding Officers in my Department have regard to the findings of the Appeals Office, they are required to assess each new case on an individual basis, considering all of the terms and conditions of the particular employment.  Accordingly, subsequent to the 1995 Appeals Office decision, and taking account of the criteria set out in that decision, Scope Section has found some couriers to be employees and others to be self-employed.</p>  <p>  In the years following the decision of the Appeals Officer in 1995, the evolving case law of the time  clarified and expanded the criteria that should be applied in determining questions of employment status.  These criteria were codified into the first Code of Practice, published in 2001.  This Code was devised by the Employment Status Group, involving trade union and employer representatives, under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and has been recently updated following consultation with the same groups. </p>  <p>  The outcome of any case with respect to a worker in a particular occupation or sector is not applied to an occupation or entire sector.  All workers are entitled to a determination of their status on an individual basis with each application for a determination subject to decision on its own merits taking account of the criteria set out in the Code of Practice. </p>  <p>  The criteria used for deciding the insurability of couriers are the same criteria used for deciding the insurability of individuals in all other sectors.  This criteria  is set out clearly in the Code of Practice on Determining Employment Status and it is based on case law set down by the Courts.  The Henry Denny case (Henry Denny &amp;amp; Sons (Ireland) Ltd v Minister for Social Welfare [1997] IESC 9), to which the Deputy refers, is one of many High Court and Supreme Court cases which are instructive in employment status cases.  Decisions made by my Department are guided by the case law as it evolves.  For this reason, an indicative list of key Court decisions is contained at page 33 of the Code of Practice.  </p>  <p>  In relation to the Revenue Tax Briefing of 1997 referred to by the Deputy, it is important to emphasise the distinction between the remits of my Department and that of the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.  While  I understand that the Revenue Commissioners has had regard to the criteria first identified in 1995 and subsequently expanded and codified in 2001 (updated in the past year), the Revenue Commissioners make decisions on tax matters under statutory powers granted to them and are required to act independently of Government in the exercise of their functions.  </p>  <p>  My Department has the statutory power to determine which social insurance class applies to an individual.  The Revenue Commissioners do not make decisions regarding social insurance status, only tax matters.  Equally, decisions of my Department as to PRSI insurability do not affect tax liability.</p>  <p>  I encourage any worker who has doubts about their social insurance classification to apply to Scope Section by e-mailing: scope@welfare.ie, phoning: +353 (0)1 673 2585 (9am-5pm) or writing to:</p>  <p>  Scope Section</p>  <p>  Department of Social Protection</p>  <p>  &Aacute;ras Mhic Dhiarmada</p>  <p>  Store Street</p>  <p>  Dublin 1</p>  <p>  D01 WY03  </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies matters for the Deputy.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-12-14a.1141.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021121400094#WRZ03300"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 444, 445 and 447 together.</p>  <p>  The role of the Social Welfare Appeals Office is to determine appeals against decisions of Deciding Officers and/or Designated Persons of the Department of Social Protection.  The legislation currently governing the appeals process is contained in Chapters 2, 3 and 4 of Part 10 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 and the Social Welfare (Appeals) Regulations, 1998 (S.I. No. 108 of 1998). </p>  <p>  Section 300(2) of the 2005 Act gives statutory power to Deciding Officers of the Department to determine questions relating to the insurability of employment for social insurance purposes.  All such determinations/ decisions can be appealed under the provisions of Section 311 of the 2005 Act to an Appeals Officer.  The equivalent provisions in relation to a decision made by an Appeals Officer in 1995 were Sections 247(2) and 257 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 1993 respectively. </p>  <p>  I am advised that in October 2000, the then Secretary General of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs in correspondence to the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee made reference to a number of representative &lsquo;test cases&rsquo; in the courier sector that were selected in 1993/1994 for investigation and formal decision as some couriers considered themselves self-employed while others regarded themselves as employees.  I am further advised that these cases were not selected to determine the employment status of all workers in that sector but rather to identify criteria that could be used by Deciding Officers and Appeals Officers for the purpose of assessing each case on an individual basis and to improve the quality and consistency of decision making in relation to the determination of whether an individual was employed or self-employed. Depending on the circumstances of the particular case, as assessed by reference to these criteria, an individual decision would be made in the case. </p>  <p>  In one particular case which I understand has become known as the &lsquo;1995 decision&rsquo; the Scope section of the Department determined that the courier was employed under a contract of service &ndash; i.e. an employee &ndash; and insurable at class A PRSI.  This decision was appealed by both the worker and the company to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.  Following an oral hearing, the Appeals Officer&rsquo;s decision in July 1995 was that, on balance, the worker was operating under a contract for services and, therefore, was deemed to be self-employed.  The Appeals Officer considered the following were critical factors in reaching the decision; lack of (company) control, no requirement to provide personal service, being able to enlist help of others (substitution) and refuse jobs, ability to do work for other companies and flexibility in the hours of attendance.  The evidence adduced at the oral hearing included that the worker provided his own vehicle and equipment, was responsible for expenses, including tax, insurance and maintenance and payment was made on the basis of rate per job. </p>  <p>  The Secretary General in his correspondence of October 2000 outlined that the Appeals Officer&rsquo;s decision established the criteria that were generally accepted as relevant for consideration when  determining the employment status of workers in that sector. </p>  <p>  It is my understanding that this approach was a precursor to the subsequent development on a tripartite basis of the Code of Practice for Determining Employment or Self-Employment Status of Individuals under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness in 2001.  The Code was subsequently updated in 2007 under the Towards 2016 Social Partnership Agreement with a further update in this past year.</p>  <p>  Therefore, since 2001, the criteria used for deciding insurability status are set out in the Code of Practice on Determining Employment Status.  The Code was updated further this year by an interdepartmental working group comprising my Department, the Revenue Commissioners and the Workplace Relations Commission.  I published the revised Code on 21 July 2021. </p>  <p>  Accordingly, neither the &lsquo;1995 decision&rsquo; nor any other decision is used by the Scope Section of the Department or the Social Welfare Appeals Office as a precedent and they do not form any part of the deliberations in such cases.  Cases are determined on a case by case basis having regard to the Code of Practice and the case law from the Courts.</p></reply>

The scheme closed to new applications on 8 July 2021. </p>  <p>  Following the announcement of the introduction of a range of public health measures with effect from Tuesday 7 December 2021 to help to reduce the spread of Covid-19, the Government has decided to reopen for a limited period the PUP to support people who lose employment arising from the new restrictions.</p>  <p>  These measures will have a particular impact on sectors such as hospitality, the night-time economy, and the arts and entertainment sectors. </p>  <p>  A self-employed person whose income from self-employment ceased or reduced since 7 December 2021 due to the introduction of the public health restrictions announced on that date is eligible to receive the PUP.  This includes musicians. </p>  <p>  The person concerned was in receipt of the Part-Time Job Incentive Scheme for the Self-Employed (PTSE).  The scheme is available to self-employed people who were in receipt of the PUP or a Jobseeker&rsquo;s payment in the week immediately prior to their application and are returning to or increasing their self-employment for up to a maximum of 24 hours per week.  The person concerned re-applied for the PUP following the introduction of public health measures from 7 December 2021 and the resulting impact on their self-employment.  Their application has been processed and awarded.  However, as the person had failed to take steps to close their existing claim for PTSE, this stopped their PUP claim and a communication issued to the customer advising them of that.  The matter has now been addressed and I am pleased to inform the Deputy that payment of the PUP has issued to the person.</p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Overall, since the onset of Covid-19, the range of working options have been full-time remote working, full-time office attendance and blended working i.e. a mixture of home and office working.</p>  <p>  The Government has confirmed its support of blended working in the Civil Service and, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is developing an overarching central framework to support consistency of implementation of blended working across the Civil Service. </p>  <p>  This framework will inform the development of organisation-level blended working policies tailored to the specific requirements of each Department/Office, whilst ensuring a consistency of approach across key policy areas.  In conjunction with this framework an application process is also currently being developed to allow staff to apply for blended working into the future. </p>  <p>  In line with this approach, it is intended, subject to business needs and individual suitability, to make blended working part of the way that my Department will work on a more permanent basis, continuing to offer remote working, blended working and office-based working options.  </p>  <p>  To this end, my Department will develop a blended working policy based on the framework being developed by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and will aim to implement this policy in the first quarter of 2022, subject to prevailing public health guidance.</p></reply>

Compared with other Government Departments, the Department of Social Protection has required on site attendance of an average of 50% of staff and has provided access to all public offices, including the network of Intreo Offices across the country. </p><p>Increased energy costs during 2020 can be accounted for by: </p><p>- The cost of electricity and gas increased in the period 2019-2021.  </p><p>- The use of four additional buildings to facilitate temporary staff recruited to manage the unprecedented administrative demand of processing the Pandemic Unemployment Payment.  Given the requirements for social distancing and attendance levels in existing buildings, this additional accommodation was necessary.  </p><p>- in order to facilitate social distancing, some offices of the Department operated shift attendance and weekend attendance and buildings required to be heated, lit and ventilated for longer periods.</p><p>- The ventilation systems were operated for extended periods in all buildings in accordance with public health advice. </p><p>- Although 50% of staff have worked largely off site since the commencement of the pandemic, the utility costs of office occupation were largely fixed, with staff distributed throughout buildings to maintain social distancing.</p><p>- Despite the fact that on average 50% of staff worked on site, remote access was required to facilitate the remaining staff working offsite in the majority of cases.  For security and other reasons, a remote access protocol was used which required desktop PCs to be maintained in a powered on position (remote PCs were simply used as a screen rather than having access to data and systems directly).</p><p>During 2020 almost two-thirds of staff who were working from home were remotely accessing PCs which had to remain switched on in the office; this was approximately 1,800 PCs.  Since then the Department has been rolling out secure laptops to staff to eliminate this requirement and currently about 250 staff are remotely accessing office PCs.</p><p>The target of reduction in energy usage for the public sector over the period 2009-2020 was set at 33% and, notwithstanding the increase in usage last year, this Department has exceeded this target, achieving an overall 42% saving in energy usage.</p><p>In June 2021, my Department was awarded ISO Certification in energy management and is the first Government Department to achieve this standard.  My Department will continue to prioritise energy management within an overall framework of our initiatives for a Greener Department and to implement the actions in this regard in the recently published Climate Action Plan.</p></reply>

Entitlement to such benefits is dependent on the individual's social insurance contribution record, the class of social insurance paid as well as satisfying other qualification criteria relevant to the scheme being applied for. </p><p>In general, self-employed people make PRSI contributions at class S.  Where all qualification criteria for the particular scheme are satisfied, this class of PRSI gives access to the following benefits -  </p><p>- Adoptive Benefit,  </p><p>- Guardian's Payment (Contributory),</p><p>- Invalidity Pension, </p><p>- Jobseeker's Benefit (Self-Employed), </p><p>- Maternity Benefit, </p><p>- Parent's Benefit, </p><p>- Partial Capacity Benefit (where in receipt of Invalidity Pension),</p><p>- Paternity Benefit, </p><p>- State Pension (Contributory), </p><p>- Treatment Benefit, and </p><p>- Widows, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's (Contributory) Pension.</p><p>The benefits to which class S PRSI does not provide access are -  </p><p>- Carer's Benefit, </p><p>- Health and Safety Benefit,  </p><p>- Illness Benefit, and </p><p>- Occupational Injuries Benefits. </p><p>Although self-employed people are not usually eligible for Illness Benefit, an exception was made in relation to Covid-19, primarily as a public health measure.  The purpose of the enhanced Illness Benefit payment in respect of Covid-19 is to encourage people to not go to work due to financial constraint when they should be in isolation.  It has been available to the self-employed since its introduction in March 2020.  Expenditure on the enhanced Illness Benefit is expected to be in the region of &euro;100 million for 2021.</p><p>There has been an extensive expansion of access to the range of social insurance benefits for self-employed social insurance contributors in recent years without any increase in the 4% rate of contribution made by them.  In effect, self-employed contributors, in return for a contribution of 11 percentage points lower than the combined employer and employee contribution of 15.05% made in respect of employed contributors, have access to benefits which comprise over 90% of the value of all benefits available to employed contributors.</p><p>The Programme for Government commits to giving consideration to increasing all classes of PRSI over time to replenish the Social Insurance Fund to help pay for measures and changes to be agreed including to the State pension system, improvements in short-term sick pay benefits, parental leave benefits, pay-related jobseeker's benefit and treatment benefits. </p><p>The supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme is the safety net within the overall social welfare system in that it provides assistance to eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs and those of their dependants.  Supports provided under the SWA scheme can consist of a basic weekly payment, a weekly or monthly supplement in respect of certain expenses, as well as single exceptional needs payments (ENPs) and urgent needs payments (UNPs).  The basic supplementary welfare allowance provides immediate assistance for those in need who are awaiting the outcome of a claim or an appeal for a primary social welfare payment or do not qualify for payment under other State schemes. </p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The first category are those who exercise a trade or profession and who are obliged to file annual returns of income under the Revenue self-assessment process through which any social insurance liabilities arising are collected in a single, annual sum.  The second category are company directors who utilise the PAYE system to remit the social insurance contributions due from their emoluments.  It has been confirmed with the Deputy&rsquo;s office that clarification relating to this latter category is what is required.</p>  <p>  As company directors are paid through the PAYE system they are required to discharge the appropriate social insurance liability, along with the relevant tax and USC liabilities as prescribed by Revenue.  The employee social insurance contribution rate of 4% must be deducted and Class S returned.</p>  <p>  Recognising that company directors may not draw emoluments in every week of the contribution year, my Department reviews the number of Class S contributions and the charges remitted on PAYE, if less than 52 weekly contributions have been returned on payroll.  This is done to ensure that in all circumstances where emoluments reach the &euro;5,000 social insurance contribution liability threshold, even when returned over a portion of the year, and the liability is discharged in full, the company director will be assigned 52 Class S contributions.  This ensures consistency with the contributions assigned to those who file annual returns under the self-assessment process. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

To date a total of 217,313 Covid Illness Benefit related claims have been processed.  </p><p>The majority of the standard Illness Benefit claims are automatically processed once medical evidence has been received from the customer; where an application is received and an e-Cert is submitted by a GP. </p><p>Over the past four weeks an average of some 8,000 Covid Illness Benefit applications have been received weekly with approximately 15,100 received since the beginning of December.  The medical evidence provided for the majority of these claims is a text from the HSE advising the person to self-isolate or that they have a Covid diagnosis.  All of these claims require manual officer intervention to verify that the medical evidence provided by the customer is valid for payment.</p><p>Claims made between 29 November and 05 December, where medical evidence has been provided, are currently being processed.  My Department has take a number of measures to reduce processing times including the temporary redeployment of staff from across the Department and system changes to increase automation within the process.  It is expected that these measures will improve these timelines over the coming weeks.</p><p>It is not possible to differentiate between Illness Benefit and Enhanced Illness Benefit in claim processing statistics.

In line with international best practice, the Report adapted the principles of the Net Present Value (NPV) method to compare the actual costs and wider quantifiable benefits of the initiative to the costs that would have necessarily been incurred in the counterfactual scenario where the initiative was not undertaken, in order to assess which option has a lower quantifiable net present cost (NPC).  This broader analytic approach is sometimes also referred to as a &lsquo;Cost-Effectiveness Analysis&rsquo; (CEA), and the costs and benefits may be split between &lsquo;financial&rsquo; and &lsquo;economic&rsquo; categories.</p><p>The report has been peer-reviewed by the Spending Review Steering Group, chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The report found that:  </p><p>- as a mature project with annual costs of about &euro;10 million and annual benefits of about &euro;30 million, the framework yields savings of over &euro;20 million every year; </p><p>- the investment in this framework paid for itself in less than five years; </p><p>- from 2010 to 2019, the total cost of the investment was &euro;98 million but this generated benefits of &euro;218 million over the same period; </p><p>- the total savings from the entire project from its inception out to 2030, adjusted for the time value of money is highly positive at over &euro;206 million. </p><p>The Report set out expenditure on the PSI management framework from its inception in 2010 to 2019.

In line with this guidance, a notice was issued by my Department on 1 December to the Early Learning and Care (ELC) and School-Age Childcare (SAC) sector, including childminders. The notice confirms that at this point in time there is no change in the public health guidance on adults wearing masks in ELC/SAC settings: staff members, parents and visitors should all wear face masks/coverings when not caring for children and where social distancing is not possible.</p>  <p>  As per guidance from the HPSC, the wearing of face coverings in ELC and SAC services is recommended for adults when it is not possible to keep a 2m distance from other adults. Staff are also advised to wear a face covering when in close proximity to children if doing so does not pose a barrier to early learning and care. HPSC guidance specifically notes that it is expected that use of face coverings will generally be practical when attending to school-age children. This aligns with the approach in schools.</p>  <p>  It is acknowledged that some staff may feel safer wearing a mask at all times, especially at a time of high levels of infection in the community. </p>  <p>  My Department is keeping public health guidance, including on wearing of face coverings, under review with the HSE and will provide updates as required.</p></reply>

The Optional Protocol is an international treaty that establishes two procedures aimed at strengthening the implementation and monitoring of the Convention. The first is an individual communications procedure allowing individuals to bring petitions to the Committee claiming breaches of their rights; the second is an inquiry procedure giving the Committee authority to undertake inquiries of grave or systematic violations of the Convention.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government reiterates the commitment to ratify the Optional Protocol after the first reporting cycle under the UNCRPD. Having regard to possible delays at UN Committee level, both I and my colleague, Minister Rabbitte, are open to an earlier ratification of the Optional Protocol.  </p>  <p>  Our intention is to prepare for ratification of the Optional Protocol once the state is in a position to meet its obligations thereunder. This is in line with Ireland's position of acting in good faith on the international stage. </p>  <p>  Commencement of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015, and full operationalisation of the Decision Support Service will be a key requirement in this regard. This is scheduled to take place in June and July of next year respectively, following the passage of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill, which is currently being drafted. </p>  <p>  In addition, a detailed review process is needed to ensure that Ireland's legislative provisions and redress mechanisms are sufficient to meet the obligations that will arise once Ireland ratifies the Optional Protocol.  My Department is working on this process now and will engage with other Departments and organisations in this regard, with a view to identifying and addressing any further requirements for ratification.</p>  <p>  Government is committed to ratification at the earliest possible date.  </p></reply>

The Safe Return Plan and the most recent guidance on the current approach advocate and support contingency planning to ensure that institutions remain flexible and adaptable in response to changes in the public health environment.</p>  <p>  My Department does not determine sector specific matters at this level. However, in order to address concerns, I met with management, staff and student representatives on the 19th November and the issue was discussed.</p>  <p>  Due to the diversity and autonomy of our higher education institutions, and the broad range of activities they undertake and the different contexts and requirements applicable to examinations, it was agreed that a uniform or one size fits all approach would not be appropriate across the whole of higher education or indeed the tertiary sector more generally. </p>  <p>  Management bodies confirmed that they are actively looking at a range of approaches to ensure that end of term examinations will be safe, and that the requirements of students who may have Covid-19 or underlying health conditions can be addressed. It was also pointed out that there are some examinations &ndash; such as those related to external accreditation - which are challenging to change to an online format at short notice.</p>  <p>  The outcome of the meeting was that Individual higher education institutions will assess the appropriate approach to examinations, taking into account the significant contextual factors that arise in different instances and that individuals who cannot sit exams due to Covid-19 concerns will be offered alternatives.</p>  <p>  Since that meeting in November, the sector has confirmed that many institutions have now commenced their end of semester examinations, adopting approaches to their examinations on the basis of risk assessment and the use of precautionary measures as agreed.</p>  <p>  In instances where examinations are being held in person, institutions are ensuring that these are taking place in environments in line with public health guidance and at a significantly lower capacity than normal. Procedures are in place to accommodate students who cannot sit an exam as a result of Covid impacting either themselves or close contacts.</p>  <p>  The sector continues to carefully consider the balance between the measures, the risk assessments and to engage with staff and students in planning for examinations.</p>  <p>  In all instances public health must remain a priority and I know that there will be a continuing focus on the evolving and often quickly changing public health situation overall. I have also recently announced a &euro;9 million fund to enable institutions provide free antigen tests to students.

Tyndall sits in a unique position in Ireland (and internationally) at the mid-point between traditional HEI research activities and the demanding industry interface, and over many years through an industry-experienced commercial team, Tyndall has built the required credibility and trust with industry partners which is critical to successful engagements. </p>  <p>  Tyndall is a national leader in achieving success within EU funding programmes &ndash; and in particular is an acknowledged key player in Europe within the Horizon 2020 ICT programme. It is involved in projects with a value of &euro;782m, with &euro;62m coming to Tyndall, and &euro;53m to other Irish partners.</p>  <p>  Tyndall&rsquo;s research excellence and impact has been acknowledged through prestigious international awards from ERC, Royal Society, IEEE, IoP, and EARTO and also through a number of its staff being appointed as Fellows of the IEEE. </p>  <p>  Tyndall is also a national leader in the commercialisation of its technology output and in that regard has generated license income, unrivalled in the sector, from key consumer product manufacturers in recent years. It also commercialises its research through the creation of new spin-off and start-up companies, and Tyndall&rsquo;s technology has been instrumental in the establishment of 22 such companies to date.</p>  <p>  A significant multi-year Tyndall core underpinning equipment upgrade is currently underway, with &euro;26m committed to date through a combination of direct Exchequer funding and competitively won infrastructure funding from SFI. </p>  <p>  I am pleased to support Tyndall and I have committed to increase Tyndall&rsquo;s annual funding to &euro;10 million by 2024.</p>  <p>  The Government have fully supported the Tyndall ambition to double in size in the coming years. This expresses strong confidence in Tyndall&rsquo;s ability to continue to deliver for Ireland on the international stage. It will also allow Tyndall/UCC to draw down the enabling &euro;75m EIB loan to fund the project, and importantly also ensure the project timeline can be maintained in order to deliver the new facility by the end of 2024.</p>  <p>  This will result in a national research facility of international scale, which will become a magnet for international research talent and will substantially assist the Governments FDI agenda with consequent significant economic impact.</p>  <p>  Related to the Tyndall expansion, in May 2021, I launched what will be an important activity within the expanded Institute &ndash; Ireland&rsquo;s first Quantum Computer Engineering Centre (QCEC) at Tyndall, which will ultimately lead to the creation and retention of high-quality sustainable ICT jobs. </p>  <p>  The State funding provided to the Tyndall Institute since 2011 either through direct exchequer funding, competitive SFI funding or another source is as follows: </p>  <p>  - Direct funding to the Tyndall Institute from the Department of Further and  Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science: &euro;44.8 m </p>  <p>  - Direct funding to the Tyndall Institute from Science Foundation Ireland: &euro;133.5m  </p>  <p>  - Direct funding to the Tyndall Institute from the Department of the Environment Climate and Communications: &euro;8.1m  </p>  <p>  - Direct funding to the Tyndall Institute from Enterprise Ireland R&amp;I programmes: &euro;45.0m</p>  <p>  While the Irish Research Council have awardees based at the Tyndall Institute, and indeed in other research institutes in UCC, they don&rsquo;t provide funding to the Tyndall Institute directly but instead provide it to UCC, which is responsible for hosting these awards.</p></reply>

The core research and support staff complement is 477 including 8 Academic/Research Professors. This includes 136 primarily PhD students who are regarded as a critical part of the core research community. Tyndall is also host to approx 30 academic members and researchers from UCC and MTU.

To encourage more family members to participate in DNA testing, my Department is developing a targeted outreach, in partnership with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and FSI, to build on the success of National Missing Persons Day. </p>  <p>  To support the work of these organisations, it is crucial that they are aware of all unidentified remains (partial and full) within the State, which fall under coronial jurisdiction. In July, Minister Humphreys wrote to each coroner in the State, requesting that they send my Department the number of unidentified human remains within their coronial districts. These results will be collated by my officials and will be shared with the Missing Persons Unit of the Garda National Protective Services Bureau.</p>  <p>  In order to keep this data up-to-date, from 2022 onwards, coroners will be asked to include details of any unidentified human remains reported to them in the preceding year, as part of their statutory annual returns to the Minister for Justice.</p>  <p>  In July, a forum was established by my Department with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s Missing Persons Unit, and with FSI, in order to maintain regular communication and information exchange on these very important matters.</p>  <p>  I was pleased to participate in this year&rsquo;s virtual National Missing Persons Day event on 1 December along with Dr. Ciaran MacLoughlin (as a representative of the Coroners Society of Ireland), relatives of missing people, and other key stakeholders.  This event provided an important opportunity to remember those who have gone missing as well as raising awareness of the significant contribution made by DNA testing to the conclusion of a considerable number of missing persons cases over recent years.</p></reply>

This application is currently being processed with a view to establishing whether the applicant meets the statutory conditions for the granting of naturalisation and will be submitted to me for decision as expeditiously as possible.</p>  <p>  I recognise the crucial role healthcare workers are continuing to play in responding to the threat of COVID-19. They work in a challenging environment and deal with vulnerable people on a daily basis. Their exceptional commitment has been particularly clear throughout the pandemic, during which they have played a vital part in preventing the spread of COVID-19.? </p>  <p>  The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.</p>  <p>  It is recognised that all applicants for citizenship would wish to have a decision on their application without delay. However, the nature of the naturalisation process is such that, for a broad range of reasons, some cases will take longer than others to process. In some instances, completing the necessary checks can take a considerable period of time. </p>  <p>  In addition, the combined impact of the 2019 High Court judgment in the Jones case and the necessary health restrictions arising from the pandemic, has unfortunately resulted in the processing time for standard applications increasing. </p>  <p>  However, my Department is taking a number of steps to speed up the processing of applications and a number of digitisation measures have also been introduced to increase efficiency in the process, including eTax clearance, eVetting and online payments. The end result of the digitisation process will be to free up more staff to focus on processing applications in a timely and efficient manner, to improve service to our customers and reduce waiting times.</p>  <p>  This year, we are on track to deliver approximately 11,000 decisions, significantly exceeding the levels achieved in the last two years. Additional staff have also been assigned to the citizenship team.  Based on these measures, my Department's objective is to achieve an improved timeframe of 6-9 months for decisions on a majority of applications during 2022.</p>  <p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility at: INISOireachtasMail@justice.ie, which has been specifically established for this purpose.

We are demonstrating the same goodwill and generosity of spirit that we ask is shown to the countless Irish people who left this island to build their lives elsewhere.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s decision will bring some much-needed certainty and peace of mind about their right to live and work in Ireland to thousands of people who are already living here and making a valuable contribution to our society and the economy, many of whom may be very vulnerable due to their current immigration circumstances.</p>  <p>  The time-limited scheme will open for online applications in January 2022 and applications will be accepted for six months. Further details regarding the qualifying criteria and the opening date for the scheme will be published on my Department's Irish Immigration website (www.irishimmigration.ie) in due course.</p></reply>

They work in a challenging environment and deal with vulnerable people on a daily basis. Their exceptional commitment has been particularly clear throughout the pandemic, during which they have been playing a key role in preventing the spread of the COVID-19 virus.  </p>  <p>  The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is governed by the provisions of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended.  All applications for a certificate of naturalisation are processed in line with the eligibility criteria as set out under the Irish Naturalisation and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended. Each application is assessed individually in accordance with the provisions of the Act.  A determination on whether an applicant satisfies the statutory criteria attendant to naturalisation can only be made after an application is received. </p>  <p>  There are no provisions to apply different criteria depending on the category of employment of the applicant.  All applicants are required to meet minimum periods of reckonable residence and standard checks are carried out as part of the overall process to maintain its integrity.</p>  <p>  However, my Department is taking a number of steps to speed up the processing of applications.</p>  <p>  In January, my Department opened a temporary system to enable these applicants to complete their naturalisation process by signing a statutory declaration of loyalty.  Since the introduction of the temporary system, 8,196 citizenship applicants have been contacted and over 7,400 new Irish citizens have received their certificates of naturalisation. My Department has prioritised the oldest applications on hand and a significant number of these applicants have received their certificates since the start of the year.</p>  <p>  A number of digitisation measures have been introduced to increase efficiency in the process, including eTax clearance, eVetting and online payments. The end result of the digitisation process will be to free up more staff to focus on processing applications in a timely and efficient manner, to improve service to our customers and reduce waiting times.</p>  <p>  This year, we are on track to deliver approximately 11,000 decisions, significantly exceeding the levels achieved in the last two years. Additional staff have also been assigned to the citizenship team.  Based on these measures, my Department's objective is to achieve an improved timeframe of 6-9 months for decisions on a majority of applications during 2022. </p></reply>

The scheme will only be open to those who do not have a current permission to reside in Ireland.</p><p>People who are eligible under the scheme will:</p><p>-  Have a period of 4 years residence in the State without an immigration permission, or 3 years in the case of those with children, including those born in Ireland, on the date the scheme opens for applications;</p><p>-  Be granted an immigration permission that allows for unrestricted access to the labour market; and</p><p>-  Have years of residence with that permission reckonable for the purposes of pursuing citizenship by way of naturalisation.</p><p>Any person who previously held an EU Treaty Rights (EUTR) permission and who currently has a temporary permission to remain while their application pursuant to the relevant legislation is under consideration or at review stage would not be considered as undocumented and therefore will not meet the criteria for the recently launched regularisation scheme. </p><p>Those whose EUTR applications are currently in a process that will decide their future status within the State, if successful, will be granted permissions under the EU Regulations e.g. 5 years residence or permanent residence.  This includes those who currently have applications at EUTR review stage.</p><p>Persons with an existing Deportation Order can apply, if they meet the minimum undocumented residence requirement. People with expired student permissions will also be able to apply. </p><p>All applicants must meet standards regarding good character and criminal record/behaviour and not pose a threat to the State. Having convictions for minor offences will not, of itself, result in disqualification.</p><p>Any applicant that is unsuccessful in their application will be able to appeal. That appeal will be considered by a different officer to the person who determined the original application unsuccessful. If a person does not wish to appeal, or if their appeal is also unsuccessful, they will be referred to the appropriate area in my Department&rsquo;s Immigration Service for follow up in accordance with the relevant legislation and the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).</p><p>The  fees payable by an applicant are designed to reflect the effort and cost involved in processing applications for the scheme which, given the benefits involved, is quite a detailed process. A fee of &euro;700 will generally apply to family unit applications and children up to 23 years, living with their parent(s), can be included in a family unit application. A fee of &euro;550 will apply to individuals&rsquo; applications. There is no provision for the discretionary waiver or reduction of fees. </p><p>The processing time will be determined by the number of applications received, as each application will be independently examined and assessed in relation to the scheme's criteria and the supporting documentation provided. The time-limited scheme will open for online applications in January 2022 and applications will be accepted for six months. </p><p>Further details regarding the qualifying criteria and the opening date for the scheme will be published on my Department's Irish Immigration website (<i>www.irishimmigration.ie</i>) in due course.</p></reply>

My officials continue to engage with stakeholders to understand how best their needs can be met.  </p>  <p>  Staff in the Burgh Quay Registration Office have been working extra hours, including at weekends, to meet the demand for first-time registrations to attend in person and to process the online renewal of permissions. </p>  <p>  For customers seeking to register for the first time, the public office in Burgh Quay is now open from 08:00 to 20:30 to provide assistance to customers. Customers should continue to apply directly for appointments as they become available without charge, through the online appointments system: burghquayregistrationoffice.inis.gov.ie.  </p>  <p>  The online booking system is available to all customers. My Department has always engaged with stakeholders that need to register large numbers of people to agree how best to facilitate this in a way that does not impact individuals&rsquo; ability to make an appointment. My Department is currently finalising plans to increase the number of appointments available to customers in the near future. </p>  <p>  My Department is also aware that there have been issues in the past around the securing of registration appointments and has continually introduced software fixes designed to improve the system. These new measures have been partly successful in preventing the block booking of appointments by third party agents.  </p>  <p>  However, some third party agents continue to provide appointment booking services in return for payment on the basis that the person provides them with their personal details in advance. My Department strongly advises against this practice of providing sensitive and personal data to unregulated and unknown third parties.  </p>  <p>  A new Immigration Service appointment and scheduling system, which will streamline and further improve the registration process, is currently being developed and is expected to be available to customers shortly.</p></reply>

I have also sought information on the number of prisoners who were not interviewed previously by the Interim Parole Board that have had their first contact with the parole system since the new independent board was set up. </p>  <p>  It is important to say that the parole process provided for by the Act of 2019 consists of a number of steps that must be complied with before a review of a given case can occur. In that regard, the Irish Prison Service is required to notify the Board of all prisoners eligible for consideration under the Act. Upon such notification, the Board is required to invite these prisoners to apply for parole. </p>  <p>  To date the Board has been notified of 228 such prisoners and, following the issuing of invitations, has received 191 applications from this group of prisoners. These applications have been acknowledged and the applicants have been informed that the Board will commence gathering the necessary reports required in order to give consideration to their application. </p>  <p>  Information on the process has also been provided to these applicants and is widely available throughout the prisons estate generally.  I have been informed that from an inspection of the applications currently on hand, all applicants had previous involvement with the Interim Board. In one case however, although a participant in the previous process, the application was not ready for consideration by the Interim Board prior to its cessation of operations in July 2021.  </p>  <p>  The Act also provides that victims of relevant offences may also make submissions to the Board.  </p>  <p>  Under the Act both victims and parole applicants may have access to legal representation. To that end the Board recently advertised for suitably qualified solicitors and barristers to become members of a legal aid panel and a panel of 125 such legal professionals has now been set up to provide legal assistance where the relevant parties express a desire for this.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that a considerable amount of preparatory work must be undertaken by the Board relating to processes, applications and corporate governance before cases can actually be considered. However, I am advised that the Board will begin making decisions on applications in early 2022.   </p>  <p>  Finally, I can confirm that the recruitment process for the post of full time Chief Executive should be finalised shortly and the successful candidate announced in due course.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-12-14a.1380.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021121400099#WREE03300"><p>I acknowledge that waiting times for many hospital procedures and appointments are unacceptably long. It is of particular regret that children can experience long waiting times for orthopaedic treatment, especially for time sensitive procedures, and I remain acutely aware of the impact that this has on children and their families. </p>  <p>  As part of Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland&rsquo;s (CHI) paediatric orthopaedic service, most complex orthopaedic cases are treated at Crumlin and Temple Street, with Crumlin providing specialised multi-disciplinary treatment for the most complex patients. The National Orthopaedic Hospital at Cappagh provides additional capacity for the treatment of less complex orthopaedic patients, including routine scoliosis procedures. By using the capacity provided by Cappagh, CHI can free up space in order that complex orthopaedic procedures can be carried out centrally at CHI sites.</p>  <p>  More specifically, additional theatre capacity at the National Orthopaedic Hospital Cappagh commenced on the 26 April 2021 for day case surgery. CHI has advised the Department of Health that this should result in a positive impact in reducing long waiting times for general orthopaedics, in addition to consequential capacity gains for scoliosis patients. In 2022 CHI is planning to undertake a range of inpatient, day case and outpatient orthopaedic appointments in Cappagh.</p>  <p>  In 2018 Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland was provided with an additional &euro;9 million in funding to address paediatric orthopaedic waiting lists, including the provision of scoliosis services. This funding is recurring and has been provided in the base HSE allocation each year since 2018. The additional funding supported the recruitment of approximately 60 WTEs in 2018 and 2019 to enable the expansion of paediatric orthopaedic services.</p>  <p>  Funding proposals submitted to the HSE by Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland for increased investment in paediatric orthopaedic services in 2022 will be decided as part of the finalisation of the Waiting List Action Plan 2022. In addition, the HSE has advised my Department that a proposal to fund an additional theatre at Temple Street is currently progressing through the normal HSE capital approval process. </p>  <p>  Improving access to scheduled care capacity remains a priority for the Department of Health as work continues to finalise next years&rsquo; Waiting List Action Plan. For 2022 an additional allocation of &euro;250 million, comprised of &euro;200 million to the HSE and &euro;50 million to the National Treatment Purchase Fund has been provided in respect of work to reduce hospital and community waiting lists. </p>  <p>  In addition, my Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund are also working on a Multi-Annual Waiting List Plan to bring waiting lists in line with Sl&aacute;intecare targets over the coming years. This process will be overseen by a Ministerial Taskforce, chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Health and includes representatives from the HSE and National Treatment Purchase Fund. </p></reply>

While significant progress was made in reducing waiting times from June 2020 onwards, the surge in Covid-19 cases in the first quarter of 2021 and the associated curtailment of acute hospital services, coupled with the ransomware attack of May 2021, has impacted waiting times.</p><p>On the 7th October I published the Acute Waiting List Action Plan. This plan, to run until December 2021, has a series of targeted measures that are designed to address the growth in waiting lists caused by Covid-19 and the cyber-attack.</p><p>In addition, my Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) are also working on a Multi Annual Waiting List Plan to bring waiting lists in line with Sl&aacute;intecare targets over the coming years. This process will be overseen by a Ministerial Taskforce, chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and includes representatives from the HSE and National Treatment Purchase Fund.</p><p>For 2022 an additional allocation of &euro;250 million, comprised of &euro;200 million to the HSE and &euro;50 million to the National Treatment Purchase Fund has been provided in respect of work to reduce hospital and community waiting lists. The &euro;250 million will be used to fund additional activity in both the public and private sectors. The &euro;50 million additional funding provided to the NTPF brings its total allocation for 2022 to &euro;150 million, and as a consequence there will be a budget of &euro;350 million available to support vital initiatives to improve access to acute hospitals and community health services.</p><p>The information requested by the Deputy is outlined in the attached documents. This information shows the number of children on the IPDC &amp;amp; OPD paediatric urology waiting lists at Temple Street Hospital, in the requested time-bands. In regard to the requested average wait times for paediatric urology at Temple Street Hospital, the health system does not collect the data necessary to calculate average wait times. In particular, the time to treatment of patients who have already received their care is not collected. The NTPF collects data on patients currently on the waiting list and the average time that these patients have been waiting is provided here.</p><p>Total Waiters for an Outpatient Paediatric Urology Appointment in CHI at Temple Street by Wait Time Band as at 25/11/2021 <table>    <tr>       <th>Sum of Total</th>       <th>Column Labels</th>       <th></th>       <th></th>       <th></th>       <th></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Row Labels</td>       <td>0-6 Months</td>       <td>6-12 Months</td>       <td>12-24 Months</td>       <td>24 Months +</td>       <td>Grand Total</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>CHI at Temple St</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Paediatric Urology</td>       <td>138</td>       <td>88</td>       <td>156</td>       <td>218</td>       <td>600</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Average and Median Wait Time for an OP Paediatric Urology Appointment in CHI at Temple St 2019-2021 <table>    <tr>       <th>Date</th>       <th>Average Wait Time (Days)</th>       <th>Median (Days)</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dec-19</td>       <td>393</td>       <td>381</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dec-20</td>       <td>506</td>       <td>464.5</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Nov-21</td>       <td>569</td>       <td>581</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Average and Median Wait Time for an IPDC Paediatric Urology Procedure in CHI at Temple St 2019-2021 <table>    <tr>       <th>Date</th>       <th>Average Wait Time (Days)</th>       <th>Median (Days)</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dec-19</td>       <td>216</td>       <td>160</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dec-20</td>       <td>318</td>       <td>308.5</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Nov-21</td>       <td>416</td>       <td>371</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Total IPDC Waiters for a Paediatric Urology Procedure in CHI at Temple Street by Wait Time Band as at 25/11/2021 <table>    <tr>       <th>Sum of Total</th>       <th>Column Labels</th>       <th></th>       <th></th>       <th></th>       <th></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Row Labels</td>       <td>0-6 Months</td>       <td>6-12 Months</td>       <td>12-24 Months</td>       <td>24 Months +</td>       <td>Grand Total</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>CHI at Temple St</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Paediatric Urology</td>       <td>48</td>       <td>22</td>       <td>43</td>       <td>30</td>       <td>143</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

Its establishment is a priority in the current Programme for Government.</p>  <p>  The proposal is to formalise a new model for collaborative working within Government and place a Pathfinder unit on a statutory footing, through section 12 of the Public Service Management Act 1997. This section has not been used before.</p>  <p>  Various administrative, budgetary, governance and legal arrangements need to be developed and agreed with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to ensure a robust and workable model for the Pathfinder unit.  The demands on both Departments during the pandemic have presented challenges to progressing the proposals. Nonetheless, the Department of Health has continued to engage with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to develop an implementation option that fully addresses these issues.</p>  <p>  Officials from the Department of Health last met with officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on 8 July to discuss improving proposals for governance and legal arrangements.  Since then, the Department of Health has worked with the Office of Parliamentary Counsel on the proposals for governance and legal arrangements.  On 6 December these draft proposals were circulated to the Department of Education and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  Once agreed, these will be submitted to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>  <p>  Recommendations from the National Youth Mental Health Task Force Report to build an evidence base to inform the development of youth mental health policy and service delivery, and to develop policy to give effect to youth mental health priorities and objectives, will be taken on by the new unit subject to agreement on the proposals.  The report&rsquo;s other recommendations were incorporated into the service plans of lead agencies over the three year lifespan of the report, which concluded in December 2020.  Implementation of recommendations includes: several online support projects were delivered to support online counselling, online CBT training and online signposting; schools have upskilled staff in mental health training and many disciplines have availed of mental health first aid training; early intervention projects such as perinatal training and family support projects have launched; and provision has been made in the forthcoming Mental Health (Amendment) Bill for 16- and 17-year olds to refuse or consent to their own mental health treatment.</p>  <p>  The implementation of the Pathfinder project is a priority for me and I will continue to keep this matter under close review in the context of progressing Sharing the Vision.</p></reply>

The OPAP covers a 10-year period up to 2025 and aims to reverse obesity trends, prevent health complications and reduce the overall burden for individuals, families, the health system, and the wider society and economy.</p><p>The OPAP provides for a mid-term review to be carried out, which will lead to a refreshed and updated Plan with a revised set of actions for the remaining lifetime of the OPAP.  This review provides the opportunity to consider developments and new evidence since the publication of the OPAP, and to assess which elements might best be further progressed by legislation or by other means.</p><p>The review will be informed by an evaluation of the OPAP which is being carried out by the Health Research Board Centre for Health and Diet Research, University College Cork.  This process has included an assessment through an online survey by numerous experts and stakeholders, and the final report is expected to be received shortly.  A strong evidence base will be required for any new legislative measures, and the review of the OPAP will build on the work already underway to identify gaps in the implementation of the Plan, including where actions need to be progressed, whether by legislative or other means, and where further research is required.  This will input into what measures should be included in a Public Health Obesity Act, and stakeholder consultation will also be an important element of the considerations in relation to this.</p><p>In relation to the issues around advertising and marketing of unhealthy foods aimed at children, Ireland is currently co-leading a Work Package in this area under the EU Joint Action &ldquo;Best ReMaP&rdquo; (Best practices in Reformulation, Marketing and public Procurement).  The title of the Work Package is &ldquo;Best practices in reducing marketing of unhealthy food products to children and adolescents&rdquo;.  Work has been underway under this Joint Action since October 2020 and there are 17 Member States participating.</p></reply>

As an immediate response, the HSE took all systems offline to reduce the risk of further contagion, while the situation was assessed. Funding provided this year addressed the immediate risks to the HSE, including the recovery of systems and data affected by the attack, upgrades and replacement of legacy systems and the establishment of a Security Operations Centre for enhanced monitoring of threats.</p>  <p>  There is a need for sustained investment in ICT in the health service in the coming years to protect the health system from the risk of future attacks and the 2022 Budget includes capital and revenue funding for the HSE to enhance cyber resilience. This investment will support the maintenance of a modern and secure ICT infrastructure, to mitigate against the impact of future attacks.</p>  <p>  Considerable work is also underway at government level to protect against future attacks. The Department of Health and particularly the HSE, as the key target of the cyber-attack in May, are working closely with the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer and the National Cyber Security Centre and its partners to strengthen ICT infrastructure and ensure that health services are resilient to future cyber incidents.</p>  <p>  Departments are also moving to the &ldquo;build to share&rdquo; Government infrastructure model which protects the working environment and monitors malicious activity more efficiently. Plans are in place to establish the National Cyber Security Centre on a statutory footing and to increase staff numbers to support the critical work that they do in protecting infrastructure from future cyber-attacks.</p></reply>

It is of particular regret that children can experience long waiting times for orthopaedic treatment, especially for time sensitive procedures, and I remain acutely aware of the impact that this has on children and their families.</p>  <p>  As part of Children's Health Ireland&rsquo;s (CHI) paediatric orthopaedic service, most complex orthopaedic cases are treated at Crumlin and Temple Street, with Crumlin providing specialised multi-disciplinary treatment for the most complex patients. The National Orthopaedic Hospital at Cappagh provides additional capacity for the treatment of less complex orthopaedic patients, including routine scoliosis procedures. By using the capacity provided by Cappagh, CHI can free up space in order that complex orthopaedic procedures can be carried out centrally at CHI sites.</p>  <p>  More specifically, additional theatre capacity at the National Orthopaedic Hospital Cappagh commenced on the 26 April 2021 for daycase surgery. CHI has advised the Department of Health that this should result in a positive impact in reducing long waiting times for general orthopaedics, in addition to consequential capacity gains for scoliosis patients. In 2022 CHI is planning to undertake a range of inpatient, daycase and outpatient orthopaedic appointments in Cappagh.</p>  <p>  In 2018 Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland was provided with an additional &euro;9 million in funding to address paediatric orthopaedic waiting lists, including the provision of scoliosis services. This funding is recurring and has been provided in the base HSE allocation each year since 2018. The additional funding supported the recruitment of approximately 60 WTEs in 2018 and 2019 to enable the expansion of paediatric orthopaedic services.</p>  <p>  Funding proposals submitted to the HSE by Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland for increased investment in paediatric orthopaedic services in 2022 will be decided as part of the finalisation of the Waiting List Action Plan 2022. In addition, the HSE has advised my Department that a proposal to fund an additional theatre at Temple Street is currently progressing through the normal HSE capital approval process. Improving access to scheduled care capacity remains a priority for the Department of Health as work continues to finalise next years&rsquo; Access to Care fund. For 2022 an additional allocation of &euro;250 million, comprised of &euro;200 million to the HSE and &euro;50 million to the National Treatment Purchase Fund has been provided in respect of work to reduce hospital and community waiting lists.</p>  <p>  In addition, my Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund are also working on a Multi Annual Waiting List Plan to bring waiting lists in line with Sl&aacute;intecare targets over the coming years. This process will be overseen by a Ministerial Taskforce, chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Health and includes representatives from the HSE and National Treatment Purchase Fund.</p></reply>

In addition, the impact of the new Omicron variant is still unknown. Public health advice remains that those who are not fully vaccinated should avoid congregated indoor settings for their own and others safety.</p><p>The National Public Health Emergency Team gave some consideration to the issues arising for those people that cannot receive a COVID-19 vaccine for medical reasons as part of its discussions on the 18th October 2021 on the continuing response to COVID-19 and the extension of Covid Pass arrangements. The matter is being given further consideration.</p><p>The Deputies may wish to be aware that on 15 July, NIAC made a recommendation, which was endorsed by the Chief Medical Officer and accepted by the Minister for Health that while the preference was for homologous vaccination regimens (using the same vaccine as part of a two dose regime) that selective use of heterologous vaccination schedules (two different vaccines used as part of two dose regime) should be permitted where a second vaccine dose of a homologous regimen is contraindicated, irrespective of whether the first dose was an mRNA or adenoviral vector vaccine. NIAC in conjunction with the RCPI and the Irish Association of Allergy and Immunology have prepared a guide to aid vaccinators and other healthcare workers on how to advise allergic individuals in respect of receiving a COVID-19 vaccine, this guide is available here: <i>rcpi-live-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/FAQs-about-COVID19-Vaccines-and-Allergies_12August2021.pdf</i>.</p></reply>

Where a health and social care professional qualifies outside the State and applies to register in Ireland, they must apply for the recognition of their qualification. EU/EEA applicants have the right to have their qualifications assessed in accordance with the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 and Directive 2005/36/EC on the Recognition of Professional Qualifications and the European Union (Recognition of Professional Qualifications) Regulations 2017 (SI No 8 of 2017). Once a complete file has been submitted to CORU, i.e. one containing all of the required documentation, a decision must issue within four months.  </p><p>CORU applies the processes available to EU/EEA applicants universally in the interests of equal treatment of all applicants. For this reason, there has been no change to the process for UK qualified applicants arising from the UK&rsquo;s exit from the European Union.</p><p>CORU has provided a table with monthly figures for 2019 and 2020 for the recognition of qualifications by the relevant registration board. Timeframes are calculated from the month a complete and valid file is completed. This data is available for 2019 and 2020. Data for 2021 will be available in Q2 of 2022. </p><p>The month shown in the table is the month in which the complete file was submitted. The figures do not include decisions that are post appeal, i.e. those that require compensation measure completion or decisions within the European Professional Card (EPC) mechanism. EPC decisions have a shorter timeframe by definition. </p><p>Table: Average number of days from submission of a complete file to the Recognition Department to the making of a decision by the Registration Board on that application. <table>    <tr>       <th>Month/Year </th>       <th>2019 </th>       <th>2020 </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>1 </td>       <td>81.9 </td>       <td>87.5 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2 </td>       <td>75.9 </td>       <td>81.1 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>3 </td>       <td>74.4 </td>       <td>80.9 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>4 </td>       <td>84.0 </td>       <td>85.5 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>5 </td>       <td>71.9 </td>       <td>73.5 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>6 </td>       <td>81.3 </td>       <td>93.3 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>7 </td>       <td>72.3 </td>       <td>71.1 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>8 </td>       <td>86.2 </td>       <td>94.0 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>9 </td>       <td>59.6 </td>       <td>62.1 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>10 </td>       <td>64.3 </td>       <td>69.9 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>11 </td>       <td>70.1 </td>       <td>65.9 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>12 </td>       <td>88.2 </td>       <td>80.8 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Number of decisions </td>       <td>631 </td>       <td>635 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>In relation to timeframes for the registration of applicants, CORU has stated that the average processing time is currently 9.2 weeks for new applicants entering a profession. This represents an improvement on an average processing time of 14 weeks, which was the case during 2020.</p><p>I met with the Chairperson and CEO of CORU earlier this year and raised the issue of timeframes for the recognition of qualifications and registration applications. Following our discussion, several measures have been initiated by CORU aimed at further reducing timeframes. </p><p>Until this year applicants were required to complete the recognition process before initiating the registration process unless they had confirmed job offers. All applicants are now invited to initiate an application for registration as soon as they have submitted a complete application file to the recognition department. This will have the effect of reducing the period of time required to both complete the recognition and registration process. </p><p>This is part of a suite of innovations that have been initiated following my discussions with CORU. Further steps underway include:</p><p>- Continued reorganisation of work processes to respond to the evolving working from home context (this has changed over time requiring adjustments as the situation develops)</p><p>- Full transfer to an online application system</p><p>- Increased frequency of regulatory decision making (Registration Board meetings)</p><p>- Additional temporary staff resources</p><p>- Recruitment of additional expert assessors in &lsquo;under pressure&rsquo; professions</p><p>My department will continue to support CORU in achieving its strategic vision and improving timeframes for all applicants into the future. </p></reply>

The HSE <i>Guidance on Managing Risk of Transmission of Respiratory Viruses Including COVID-19 in General Practice</i>sets out the measures to manage the risk transmission of Covid-19 in general practice, which includes encouraging patients entering the practice to use a face covering. However, refusal of service to those who decline to wear a mask is not recommended.</p><p>General practice has continued to operate during the Covid-19 public health emergency and GPs see patients face to face where necessary, albeit with infection-control measures in place.  In response to the pandemic, it has been necessary for GPs to triage patient in-person contact with GP surgeries as much as possible, to help prevent the spread of the virus and for the protection of patients and staff. GPs are performing assessments over the phone to determine if a patient needs to attend the surgery. Where clinically indicated, the GP will arrange an appointment to see the patient in the surgery.</p><p>No directive has issued from either the Department of Health or the HSE on the requirements in relation to medical card holders that do not or cannot wear masks when attending general practitioner appointments.  It is expected that clinical practice should be accessible to all patients, in line with normal risk assessment procedures.</p></reply>

This requirement has been introduced on a temporary basis as part of our response to emergence of the Omicron variant. Travel requirements are kept under regular review based on the evolving international epidemiological situation and as understanding of the Omicron variant develops. There is no facility in place to pay costs in the cases referred to. In making regulations to introduce these testing requirements, regard was given to the need for balance between the importance of the measure to protect public health and ensuring travellers have sufficient notice of a legal requirement and sufficient time to arrange testing before travel.</p></reply>

The number of entrants to GP training has increased from 120 in 2009 to 233 this year, with further increases expected as responsibility for training has transferred from the HSE to the Irish College of General Practitioners. Changes have been made to the entry provisions to the GMS scheme to facilitate more flexible/shared GMS contracts, and to the retirement provisions for GPs under the GMS scheme. An enhanced supports package for rural GP practices was also introduced.</p>  <p>  Recent developments in relation to general practice, in particular the 2019 Agreement on Contractual Reform and Service Development, have helped to re-establish general practice in Ireland as an attractive career choice.  The additional investment, which will amount to &euro;210 million annually once the Agreement is fully implemented, provides for an increase in capitation fees, improved maternity and paternity arrangements as well as enhanced supports for rural practices. In addition, targeted funding of &euro;2 million will also be set aside to provide additional support to practices in deprived urban areas. </p>  <p>  In relation to GP services in Charlestown, Co Mayo and surrounding areas, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

This has been advised to GPs by the HSE.</p>  <p>  The issue of GPs charging GMS patients for phlebotomy services is complex given the numerous reasons and circumstances under which blood tests are taken. My Department and the HSE discussed this issue previously with the relevant GP representative body. However, it did not prove possible to achieve agreement that no charges for blood tests would be applied in any circumstances. It is intended to raise this issue again at an appropriate time.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that the GP chronic disease management programme which is being phased in, having commenced last year, will involve the ongoing monitoring of patients&rsquo; condition and any blood tests required in this context will be covered by the fees payable for this care. </p>  <p>  The position remains that where a patient who holds a medical card or GP visit card believes he or she has been incorrectly charged for routine phlebotomy services by his or her GP, then that patient should report the matter to their HSE Local Health Office. The local management, upon being notified of potential inappropriate charging of GMS patients, carry out an investigation into each complaint and will, where appropriate, arrange for a refund of charges incorrectly applied by the GP.</p></reply>

It is of particular regret that children can experience long waiting times for orthopaedic treatment, especially for time sensitive procedures, and I remain acutely aware of the impact that this has on children and their families. </p><p>As part of Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland&rsquo;s (CHI) paediatric orthopaedic service, most complex orthopaedic cases are treated at Crumlin and Temple Street, with Crumlin providing specialised multi-disciplinary treatment for the most complex patients. The National Orthopaedic Hospital at Cappagh provides additional capacity for the treatment of less complex orthopaedic patients, including routine scoliosis procedures. By using the capacity provided by Cappagh, CHI can free up space in order that complex orthopaedic procedures can be carried out centrally at CHI sites.</p><p>More specifically, additional theatre capacity at the National Orthopaedic Hospital Cappagh commenced on the 26 April 2021 for daycase surgery. CHI has advised the Department of Health that this should result in a positive impact in reducing long waiting times for general orthopaedics, in addition to consequential capacity gains for scoliosis patients. In 2022 CHI is planning to undertake a range of inpatient, daycase and outpatient orthopaedic appointments in Cappagh.</p><p>In 2018 Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland was provided with an additional &euro;9 million in funding to address paediatric orthopaedic waiting lists, including the provision of scoliosis services. This funding is recurring and has been provided in the base HSE allocation each year since 2018. The additional funding supported the recruitment of approximately 60 WTEs in 2018 and 2019 to enable the expansion of paediatric orthopaedic services.</p><p>Funding proposals submitted to the HSE by Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland for increased investment in paediatric orthopaedic services in 2022 will be decided as part of the finalisation of the Waiting List Action Plan 2022. In addition, the HSE has advised my Department that a proposal to fund an additional theatre at Temple Street is currently progressing through the normal HSE capital approval process. Improving access to scheduled care capacity remains a priority for the Department of Health as work continues to finalise next years&rsquo; Access to Care fund. For 2022 an additional allocation of &euro;250 million, comprised of &euro;200 million to the HSE and &euro;50 million to the National Treatment Purchase Fund has been provided in respect of work to reduce hospital and community waiting lists. </p><p>In addition, my Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund are also working on a Multi Annual Waiting List Plan to bring waiting lists in line with Sl&aacute;intecare targets over the coming years. This process will be overseen by a Ministerial Taskforce, chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Health and includes representatives from the HSE and National Treatment Purchase Fund. </p><p>In relation to the specific query raised by the Deputy regarding the eighty-two children referred to, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The Temporary Assistance Payment Scheme (TAPS) was established in April 2020 as a temporary, administrative measure to respond to the challenges being faced by the nursing home sector at the start of the pandemic, and was extended twice beyond its original planned end date. </p>  <p>  In broad terms, TAPS had substantially fulfilled its temporary purpose of providing financial support to nursing homes to address COVID-19 and therefore it was appropriate to end the standard assistance element of the scheme in June 2021. From June onwards, in recognition of the residual risk presented by the virus, Minister Donnelly and I have agreed to the continued availability of the outbreak assistance element of the Scheme until the end of this year. This will ensure that contingency is available in the event of an outbreak.</p>  <p>  According to the most recent available HSE data, from 24 November, over 8,172 claims had been processed, with some &euro;120.7 million euro of direct financial support provided to the sector. Due to the extension of outbreak assistance, claims continue to be received and paid; &euro;1.75m has been paid to nursing homes under 75 separate claims for outbreak assistance since the end of June.  In total, &euro;134.5 million has been made available under TAPS between 2020 and 2021.</p>  <p>  There continue to be a number of outbreaks reported in nursing homes each week; however, current data suggests there may be a reduction in the number of associated cases per outbreak. The State has continued to prioritise residents of nursing homes in the response to COVID-19, including through the successful and early roll-out of the vaccine programme to nursing home residents. This prioritisation is continuing with the roll-out of booster vaccines to nursing home residents, which is expected to be completed by early December. The roll-out of booster vaccines has provided important protection for residents -  booster vaccines for the over 65's commenced at the beginning of October and were substantially completed within a three week period.</p>  <p>  As the pandemic has continued, many further support measures for private and voluntary nursing homes have been made available through the Health Service Executive (HSE), including the provision of PPE on a no-cost basis, the implementation of serial testing, the support and engagement of COVID-19 response teams and public health teams, the temporary accommodation scheme for nursing home staff and further supports. Many of these supports will continue to be provided by the HSE for the foreseeable future.</p></reply>

A Project Group has been created with representatives from both Departments to prioritise the project and senior officials have been assigned responsibility for this.

Relevant officials have also engaged with colleagues in the Health Service Executive. </p>  <p>  The transfer will require the Health Service Executive to report to two Ministers for different elements of its functions and amending legislation is required to the governing Act of the Health Service Executive, namely the Health Act 2004. Following significant engagement over a period of months, an overarching legislative framework has been agreed to provide for a robust accountability structure between the Health Service Executive and the Minister of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. </p>  <p>  On the 23rd of November 2021 Government approved the priority drafting of legislation, the Health (Amendment) Bill 2021, to enable the transfer.

Currently, PCR testing is the gold standard for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and it is essential that people who have symptoms of Covid-19 continue to be advised to self-isolate and seek a PCR test from the HSE.</p>  <p>  Rapid testing also has a role to play as another valuable tool in Ireland&rsquo;s battle against COVID-19, and I have been very clear in supporting its wider use.</p>  <p>  Antigen tests are already widely in use in Ireland, supported by the health service, in appropriate settings and contexts:</p>  <p>  -  In the health sector, the HSE has deployed rapid antigen tests for use for specific indications in the acute hospital setting, and as part of the response to outbreaks in community settings, supported by appropriate clinical governance and operational arrangements.</p>  <p>  -  In the agriculture sector, the HSE has supported the Department of Agriculture, Food, and the Marine in implementing an antigen testing programme in food processing facilities, supplementing the existing PCR serial testing programme.</p>  <p>  -  In the education sector, rapid testing pilot schemes have been underway in a number of universities, and also in other education and childcare settings.</p>  <p>  -  The HSE is also operating a pilot antigen detection testing programme for staff in a number of Residential Care Facilities for Older Persons across the country.</p>  <p>  -  Asymptomatic fully vaccinated close contacts of a person that tested positive for COVID-19 can now test themselves at home using free antigen tests sent to them by the HSE.</p>  <p>  -  Antigen tests are now provided for primary school children who are identified as close contacts as part of a pod in which there was a confirmed case of COVID-19.</p>  <p>  Government&rsquo;s objective has been to ensure the widespread availability of antigen tests, that are CE marked for self-testing, at an affordable price level. Following engagement by relevant Government Departments with leading retailers and wholesalers, it is clear that due to the increased level of competition in the market, the retail price of antigen tests for consumers has been dropping, with some products now available for &euro;3 or less. Supply chains remain robust and appear capable of meeting any potential increase in demand that may arise. Government is already supporting the price reduction seen in the market through implementation of a zero VAT rate for all Covid-19 test kits, and have confirmed this will continue into 2022.</p>  <p>  A comprehensive, cross-Government communications campaign on the appropriate use of antigen tests, to ensure there is clear message to the general public on when and how they should be used has also been launched and guidance material has been published on the HSE website and on gov.ie. The HPSC has also published rapid antigen testing programme guidance. </p>  <p>  There is ongoing consideration of the use of antigen testing in other settings and in other scenarios. The role of testing and contact tracing, as part of the wider public health response, has been under ongoing review throughout the pandemic and will continue to be reviewed and amended in line with the epidemiological profile of the disease, its impact on healthcare utilisation and outcomes, the vaccination status of the population and ECDC guidance. </p></reply>

This is why our Public Health (Alcohol) Act contains strong measures to limit the exposure of our children to alcohol marketing.</p><p>In November 2019,  sections 14, 17 and 20 of the Act came into effect. Section 14 prohibits alcohol advertising in or on public service vehicles, at public transport stops or stations and within 200 metres of a school, a cr&egrave;che or a local authority playground will be prohibited. Section 17 prohibits the sale of children&rsquo;s clothing that promotes alcohol and section 20 prohibits alcohol advertising in a cinema except around films with an 18 classification or in a licensed premises in a cinema.</p><p>In November 2020, section 22 of the Act came into effect. It provides that, in mixed retail outlets, alcohol products and advertising are confined to one of the following:</p><p>-  an area separated by a 1.2 metre high barrier, or</p><p>-  units in which alcohol products are not visible up to 1.5 metres height, or</p><p>-  up to three units that can be a maximum of 1 metre wide by 2.2 metres high.</p><p>In addition alcohol products can be contained but not be visible in a unit behind the counter. </p><p>Section 15 and 16 of the Act came into force on 12 November of this year. These provisions restrict alcohol advertising and sponsorship promoting alcohol products, and include a ban on alcohol advertising and sponsorship at events aimed particularly at children or at which the majority of participants or competitors are children. These measures will help to ensure that children can grow up in circumstances where they are not regularly exposed to alcohol products and alcohol advertising.  </p><p>Section 13 of the Act relates to the content of advertisements for alcohol products. This section cannot be commenced until regulations under this section have been made. Draft regulations under Section 13 are currently being developed by my Department; upon finalisation, they must be submitted to the European Commission for assessment as to whether they are in alignment with Single Market principles.</p><p>Section 19 of the Act provides for a broadcast watershed for alcohol advertisements on television and radio. It has not yet been commenced as it requires further engagement on compliance and enforcement issues with the Environmental Health Service of the HSE and the Broadcast Authority of Ireland.</p><p>Work on commencement of these remaining sections of the Public Health (Alcohol) Act was suspended throughout 2020 and much of 2021 due to resources being diverted to COVID-19 related areas; that work has now restarted. The full implementation of the Act remains a priority.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-12-14a.1773.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021121400107#WRNN02200"><p>The rate of COVID-19 related hospitalisations and ICU admissions in the population is determined by several factors, particularly the prevailing force of infection in the community, the proportion of those infected who are in the older age groups or at-risk groups, population immunity levels arising from vaccination or prior infection and overall adherence to the public health measures in place to reduce the risk of transmission.</p>  <p>  Vaccination is the most effective way to prevent hospitalisations, severe illness and death related to COVID19 and it is a particular priority to ensure that all eligible people are fully vaccinated. However, vaccinations are not 100% effective, and some fully vaccinated people will become infected (breakthrough infection) and experience illness. While the benefits of vaccination against hospitalisation and deaths have been sustained for at least six months for all European Medicines Agency (EMA) authorised vaccines, the risk of breakthrough infections and symptomatic disease increases over time.</p>  <p>  In Ireland, as of 9th December more than 90% of those aged 12 years and older are fully vaccinated. Ireland is currently undergoing a prolonged surge in case numbers despite high vaccine uptake, with an associated high level of ICU admissions. This is considered to be due to a number of factors, including the highly transmissible Delta variant, waning of vaccine immunity and the opening up of society over recent months with an increase in socialisation. The rate of hospitalisation of unvaccinated people is substantially higher than in those who are fully vaccinated. However, as vaccination rates are so high, the proportion of those vaccinated who are admitted to hospital and ICU settings is increasing</p>  <p>  The risks of severe COVID-19, hospitalisation and ICU admission are lower in younger people, but are not negligible. The presence of an underlying condition increases the risk of severe COVID-19 and booster vaccination has been recommended for those identified in this category. For all, there remains a residual risk, that decreases with age, of severe COVID-19 even in those with no risk factors. This risk will increase as the force of infection in the community remains high and as time from initial primary vaccination schedule elapses.</p>  <p>  Ireland is currently in a very uncertain and unstable position due to the high incidence of COVID-19 driven by the highly transmissible Delta variant. This is a matter of very significant concern as we wait for more evidence relating to the Omicron variant and the impact it may have to emerge.</p>  <p>  I am advised that based on the evidence available to us, we believe that the public health measures we are so familiar with will work to slow and stop the transmission of the Omicron variant, as well as the Delta variant. Early indications suggest that a booster dose of COVID-19 vaccine will offer good protection against infection from Delta and Omicron.</p>  <p>  It is of the utmost importance that all those eligible for a booster dose of COVID-19 vaccine take the opportunity to receive this vaccine as soon as it is offered. Similarly, those yet to receive a primary dose of COVID-19 vaccine should come forward as soon as possible. COVID-19 related hospitalisation and severe illness can be prevented by optimising the protection afforded by vaccination.</p></reply>

This section states that where he/she has a conscientious objection, a medical practitioner, nurse or midwife shall not be obliged to carry out, or participate in the carrying out, a termination of pregnancy.  In the event of a doctor, nurse or midwife having a difficulty in undertaking a required medical procedure, he or she will have a duty to make arrangements for the transfer of the woman&rsquo;s care to a colleague.  The Act makes it clear that conscientious objection cannot be invoked in an emergency situation, when the risk to a pregnant woman&rsquo;s life or health is immediate.  Conscientious objection is limited to persons involved in the delivery of the treatment only and does not extend to any other persons, or to institutions.  Section 49 of the most recent version of the Medical Council&rsquo;s Guide to Professional Conduct and Ethics for Registered Medical Professionals, published in August 2019, reiterates these provisions.</p></reply>

The project has been supported by the Radiology Clinical Care Programme and has involved key stakeholders across the system including the National Integrated Medical Imaging System (NIMIS) Team, Hospital Groups, and the support of the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) for data collection and data management expertise.</p><p>The latest available diagnostic waiting list data is outlined in the documents attached, which set out waiting list data for Quarter 3 2021 for CT, MRI and Ultrasound. The HSE advises that, at present, the further diagnostic scans requested by the Deputy (including cholangiopancreatography, electroencephalogram, angiogram, and bone scan), are not yet captured as part of this project.</p><p>The information that is currently being collected is presently being tested and validated at hospital, hospital group and national level and as such should not be used/reported without the context of the caveats set out below:</p><p>- Data is subject to inclusions and exclusions which are documented in the Data Profile Document. This document is available from Acute Operations and has been circulated to all Hospital Groups.</p><p>- Data contains urgent, routine and surveillance/planned activity which is currently not broken down in detail, as such this includes surveillance/planned activity which may not be exceeding planned date.</p><p>- Data is still undergoing validation at Hospital and Hospital Group level.</p><p>- Data does not take into account local nuances at site level (Site profile developed to support understanding of same).</p><p>- The purpose of this aggregate data is to provide a National Level overview of the number of patients waiting for modalities of CT, MRI and Ultrasound.</p><p>- This report is not intended to be used for the active management of hospital diagnostics waiting list, local reports and mechanisms should continue to be used for the management of diagnostics waiting lists at hospital level.</p><p>In Q3 2021, there were a total of 225,538 patients reported on the waiting list from all sites, this represents all outpatients waiting, urgent, semi urgent, routine and planned/surveillance (where diagnostic access is planned at particular time intervals). </p></reply>

The expert group's report, in addition to the HRB's evidence review, and consultation with other Departments and relevant State agencies will inform the development of proposals regarding the establishment of a compensation scheme, including the need for primary legislation, and work to advance policy development in this regard is under way in the Department.</p></reply>

It also includes an amendment in relation to applying the 3-year cap to the proceeds of sale of a house while a resident is in long-term care. This addresses the first relevant commitment in the <i>Housing for All </i>Strategy (action 19.7). This removed a disincentive against the sale of properties that might otherwise remain vacant.</p><p>As well as introducing the change above, the Department of Health has also agreed to action 19.8 in the Housing for All Strategy to develop a mechanism in relation to the rental of vacant properties &quot;in a way that is targeted, equitable, evidence-based and provides appropriate safeguards for vulnerable older people&quot;. It is important to note that complex policy questions remain in meeting these criteria and there are high risks associated with unintended consequences. </p><p>The NHSS is a complex &euro;1.4 billion Scheme that relies on &euro;350m of contributions from over 22,000 residents. It is important to ensure that the costs, benefits, and unintended consequences of any policy changes are fully understood and resolved before they are put in place. There is no existing exemption of rental or similar income from assessment within the Nursing Homes Support Scheme and due care needs to be taken to ensure that any future changes are appropriate; to protect and meet the needs of residents while also making provision for those in need of housing.</p><p>The Department of Health and other government departments continue to collaborate on this policy, including the identification of the number of houses that may be brought into use and the costs associated with the policy options available to address this action, with a view to introducing legislation as soon as possible once this analysis and policy development is complete.</p></reply>

Face masks/coverings are also recommended for children in third class and above in primary school and guidance has issued to schools from the Department of Education on this. This guidance can be found online: www.gov.ie/en/publication/d3c55-department-of-education-guidance-on-the-use-of-face-coverings-in-primary-schools/.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that this is a temporary, interim measure and will be reviewed in mid-February 2022. The continued importance of other public health measures will continue to be emphasised. </p>  <p>  The Government decision is based on a recommendation from the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET). The NPHET, at its meeting on 25 November, considered the question of reducing the age at which mask wearing is recommended. This issue has been subject to ongoing review by the NPHET. NPHET consideration has been informed by a number of evidence reviews and advice provided to NPHET by HIQA at NPHET&rsquo;s request since February 2021, informed by research evidence developed by HIQA&rsquo;s COVID-19 Evidence Synthesis Team and with expert input from HIQA&rsquo;s COVID-19 Expert Advisory Group (EAG).</p>  <p>  The most recent review by HIQA in August 2021 recommended that the minimum age for mask wearing should remain unchanged, however ongoing monitoring was advised with respect to the epidemiological situation in children.</p>  <p>  In light of the sharp rise in the incidence in the 9 to 11 year old age-group in recent weeks the issue was therefore considered again by the NPHET. As part of its deliberations, the NPHET considered previous advice from HIQA, the detailed epidemiological situation in children, international guidance, international practice, the evidence in relation to the use of face coverings in children, and the potential benefits and harms from any recommendations. The NPHET recognised the very significant impacts previous social and economic restrictions have had on families and children to date and also reiterated that a core priority of the NPHET throughout the pandemic has been to protect the continued operation of the education and childcare sector, recognising its importance to the health and development of children. Given the very high incidence in children the NPHET advised that measures should be taken to interrupt chains of transmission to protect those core priorities. For that reason, the NPHET agreed advice, including the recommendation in relation to mask wearing, to support families and young children in staying safe over the coming period with a view to reducing risk of disease transmission.</p>  <p>  HIQA&rsquo;s advice on &lsquo;Reducing the minimum age for mask wearing requirements and recommendations in COVID-19&rsquo; can be found online: www.hiqa.ie/reports-and-publications/health-technology-assessment/reducing-minimum-age-mask-wearing.</p></reply>

Compensation for statutory redundancy payments, paid to workers made redundant as a result of the prohibition, is one of the loss categories.  Various entitlements for employees are set out in legislation (Redundancy Payments Act 1967) and employees must follow specific redundancy procedures in that regard.  Redundancy payments are to be made available by employers when employment is terminated which may be the case when fur farming is prohibited.  </p>  <p>  The rates and conditions of these payments are defined in the Redundancy legislation and applies to businesses where employment is being terminated. The compensation package that is to be made available to the farm businesses will cover any statutory redundancy payments made but is only one aspect of the compensation to the business owners.  </p>  <p>  Statutory redundancy payments are the minimum workers are eligible for and will be included in this overall package - the businesses concerned may  make increased payments as they consider appropriate.   </p></reply>

The recommendations of the ANIT Committee, if they were to be implemented in full, would be particularly challenging.  This report will next be presented to a plenary session of the  European Parliament in January, seeking endorsement by the Parliament.</p>  <p>  The European Commission is currently reviewing European animal welfare legislation including the rules for the transport of animals. This review by the Commission will result in legislative proposals, which are expected in 2023. </p>  <p>  It can be expected that the report of the ANIT Committee will feed into this review. The Commission has repeatedly said however that legislative proposals will be made on the basis of the best available scientific evidence, and it is vital that this will be the case. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to engage with this process to communicate the challenges that these recommendations will place on Irish farmers.  Teagasc is currently engaged in research in relation to the welfare of animals being transported and the outcome of this scientific research will help to inform the debate in this area.</p>  <p>  It is essential, however, that stakeholders in the Irish agriculture sector take note of these findings. Societal attitudes to animal welfare and the welfare of animals during transport is continually evolving. </p>  <p>  It is important that stakeholders further advance their collaborative efforts to ensure the welfare of all animals transported, mitigate the risk of any sector being overly dependent on live exports and to continue to develop strategies that support the transition to a sustainable dairy-beef sector.  </p>  <p>  The export of animals is strictly regulated by my Department in accordance with existing EU law and the Irish system of controls is publicly acknowledged to have incorporated additional meaningful measures that ensure high standards of animal welfare on farm, and at every stage during transport.</p>  <p>  I am committed to retaining the live export market as it is an integral part of the dairy and beef sectors and exports play a key role in driving competition.  </p></reply>

There remains sufficient funds in the forestry allocation to pay  this year's commitments  across all afforestation and support schemes, including the ash dieback scheme.</p>  <p>  The Department has no plans to expand the ash dieback scheme at present but will continue to keep it under close review.</p>  <p>  This underspend in forestry arose because new planting in 2021 was less than anticipated and this is a matter of concern to me. It appears at this stage that the number of hectares of new afforestation, which we calculate as forestry in respect of which a first grant and premium has been paid, will be somewhere in the region of 2,000 hectares. This is despite over 4,000 hectares licensed and approved. </p>  <p>  There are 5,000 hectares of approved forestry licences issued and ready for use. I encourage anyone with a valid afforestation licence to plant their land, thereby accessing generous annual premiums and 100% establishment grants. </p>  <p>  Along with Minister of State Pippa Hackett, who has overall responsibility for the sector, we accept that delays in issuing afforestation licences may be a contributory factor in terms of low levels of planting and we are addressing these  licensing delays  through Project Woodland.  As regards afforestation, outputs are not where I&rsquo;d like them to be but there are signs of improvement. My Department is prioritising the assessment of afforestation licences on hand, using the same system as was applied to felling licences, which yielded good results. </p>  <p>  Ten Ecologists are now dedicated to afforestation, with more to be recruited. In addition to recruiting new staff I am also reallocating existing Administrative, Forestry Inspectorate and Ecology resources to afforestation licensing files.  I expect these changes to result in a higher level of output of afforestation licences than before.</p>  <p>  On the matter of community and small scale tree-planting, the Deputy may be aware that we have a Neighbourhood Scheme which supports close-to-home woodland amenities for public use and enjoyment,  and that we are seeking to amend the Forestry Act 2014 to increase small-scale native tree planting without the need for an afforestation licence.  In terms of the frost reconstitution scheme, I understand Minister Pippa Hackett, who has direct responsibility for forestry, discussed recently with stakeholders and the matter is under consideration.</p>  <p>  With over &euro;100 million provided for in the forestry budget for 2022, I am satisfied that there  are sufficient funds to  fully support increased afforestation and all other forestry related schemes in 2022. </p></reply>

I continue to keep the focus on the disproportionate quota reductions for Ireland under the TCA and to use any opportunity available to seek constructive solutions that would help to alleviate this unacceptable position, including keeping a strong focus on the matter within the Fisheries Council. I am fully committed to doing all possible through the CFP review to secure additional quota where possible for Irish fishers.  </p>  <p>   The Commission published a proposal on 6 July proposing an amendment to extend the derogation for access to EU Member States 12 miles zones up until the end of December 2032.  It also removed the provisions relating to access for the UK, which are now covered in the TCA.  I consider that this important element of the CFP should be dealt with the by the Commission as part of the full CFP review and form part of the formal review and the Commission report to Council and Parliament on the functioning of the CFP.  I have written to the Commissioner to make Ireland&rsquo;s concern and our position clear.   </p>  <p>  It is expected that all stakeholders will have an opportunity to engage actively in the Commission's review over the coming period, including the fishing industry, eNGOs and Member States.  However, the European Commission has not yet published details of the review process or how Member States and stakeholders will engage in this process.  Once we have a clear picture of the process and timelines of the review, I will finalise details of how Ireland will participate actively and effectively in the review of the CFP, including the interaction with stakeholders, to prepare Ireland's case and identify priorities.  In that regard, I intend to nominate the key stakeholders to participate in a stakeholder forum.</p></reply>

Herds that have been recently derestricted must carry out additional risk-based tests in the period after they go clear, which are dependent on the risk level of their breakdown. This reflects the fact that these herds have a higher risk of breakdown that other herds. </p>  <p>  The reasons for TB in certain herds and areas are multi-factorial and require a range of measures to address the issue, which may include contiguous programmes, gamma interferon blood testing, cleansing and disinfection, other risk-based TB tests, and isolation of reactors. Each TB outbreak is investigated by a veterinary inspector to identify the source of infection. </p>  <p>  Earlier this year, I launched the new Bovine TB Eradication Strategy 2021-2030. TB levels in 2021 are likely to be lower than in 2020. This will be the first annual decrease in TB since levels starting rising in 2016. Herd incidence in the 12 months to 5th December 2021 was 4.31% compared to 4.37% on the corresponding date last year, and the number of reactors in the 12 months to 5th December 2021 was 20,752, compared to 22,782 on the corresponding date last year, a decrease of over 2,000 reactors. This is evidence that the new policies implemented under the TB strategy, supported by the TB Forum, are starting to have an effect. </p>  <p>  I am acutely aware of the financial and emotional burden that is placed on a family farm as a consequence of a herd breakdown. I am committed to driving down TB rates and I believe we are in a position to make positive inroads.  </p></reply>

Since that Oireachtas Committee meeting on 29<sup>th</sup>January to 10<sup>th</sup>December, my Department has issued a total of 447 afforestation licences for an area of just over 3,700ha, as well as 1,298 Coillte felling licences, 1,207 private felling licences, and 583 forest road licences.</p><p>Along with Minister of State Pippa Hackett, who has overall responsibility for the sector, we accept that in terms of afforestation, outputs are not where I&rsquo;d like them to be but there are signs of improvement. </p><p>My Department is prioritising the assessment of afforestation licences on hand, using the same system as was applied to felling licences. Ten ecologists are now dedicated to afforestation, with more to be recruited. In addition to recruiting new staff I am also reallocating existing Administrative, Forestry Inspectorate and Ecology resources to afforestation licensing files.  I expect these changes to result in a higher level of output of afforestation licences than before.</p><p>Improvements in afforestation licences should help encourage more planting. However, there are 5,000 hectares of approved forestry licences issued and ready for use. I would encourage anyone with a valid afforestation licence to plant their land, thereby accessing generous annual premiums and 100% establishment grants. </p><p>As regards recent licensing output, in the last 14 weeks, we have issued on average 118 licences per week. </p><p>A monthly breakdown of licences issued  YTD is in the table below. <table>    <tr>       <th>-</th>       <th>Private Felling</th>       <th>Coillte Felling</th>       <th>Total Felling</th>       <th>Afforestation</th>       <th>Forest Roads</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>January</td>       <td>98</td>       <td>179</td>       <td>277</td>       <td>36</td>       <td>45</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>February</td>       <td>54</td>       <td>109</td>       <td>163</td>       <td>48</td>       <td>67</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>March</td>       <td>47</td>       <td>51</td>       <td>98</td>       <td>56</td>       <td>67</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>April</td>       <td>64</td>       <td>25</td>       <td>89</td>       <td>73</td>       <td>42</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>May</td>       <td>103</td>       <td>73</td>       <td>176</td>       <td>48</td>       <td>79</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>June</td>       <td>220</td>       <td>91</td>       <td>311</td>       <td>39</td>       <td>61</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>July</td>       <td>73</td>       <td>59</td>       <td>132</td>       <td>12</td>       <td>21</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>August</td>       <td>66</td>       <td>72</td>       <td>138</td>       <td>18</td>       <td>40</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>September</td>       <td>258</td>       <td>267</td>       <td>525</td>       <td>34</td>       <td>36</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>October</td>       <td>149</td>       <td>225</td>       <td>374</td>       <td>43</td>       <td>51</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>November</td>       <td>123</td>       <td>230</td>       <td>353</td>       <td>50</td>       <td>93</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>December*</td>       <td>50</td>       <td>96</td>       <td>146</td>       <td>26</td>       <td>27</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Totals</td>       <td>1,305</td>       <td>1,477</td>       <td>2,782</td>       <td>483</td>       <td>629</td>    </tr> </table> * to 10th December - total issued 3,894</p><p>We will reach this year's target of 4,000 licences and my Department is currently working on projections across all licence categories for 2022, which will be published before year end.

These are broken down by county and whether they are issued to Coillte Teo or private landowners in the tables below.</p><p>Tree felling licences issue with varying validity periods up to and including 10 years.  After the expiration of the validity period, a landowner has two years in which to replant the felled site.  Therefore, no reforestation inspections would be carried out on tree felling licences issued in 2020 and 2021 as they would be within the timeframe by which the replanting is required to take place.  Information on ad hoc inspections is not compiled centrally and therefore not readily available, as they usually arise from complaints received by letter, email or by phone call.  All such complaints are followed-up, with action taken as appropriate.</p><p>Every application for a forestry licence, including tree felling licences is assessed for its potential impact on the surrounding countryside and environment.

There are restrictions on access within the 12 nautical miles zones of Member States including Ireland.</p><p>Quotas for the various stocks are allocated for management areas - that is, ICES areas, rather than Member States' EEZs.  For example, the Total allowable Catch (TAC) area for the Hake Stock is ICES Areas 6 and 7 which  stretches from the north of Scotland south to the north coast of Brittany, and into the English channel.This area includes parts of the UK EEZ, the Irish EEZ, part of the French EEZ and some international waters.  Ireland's quota may be fished in any part of this area.Ireland's main  mackerel quota covers ICES Areas 6 and 7 stretching from north of Scotland to the north coast of Brittany and the full quota may be fished in UK waters of the northern North Sea.  The access to the northern North Sea in particular is economically important for our fleet.  </p><p>In relation to Ireland's 200 miles zone, the outtake has been estimated by the Marine Institute.  It  has estimated the landings from the Irish EEZ for the top 25 species over the period from 2015 to 2019.  The tables at the following link show that, overall, Irish vessels take 35.5% (by weight) and 38.8% (by value) of the landings from the Irish EEZ.  The data sets for 2020 and 2021 are not available yet.</p><p>The total value of Ireland's fish quotas for 2021 is approximately &euro;229 million.</p></reply>

Support for poultry farmers is provided under the Young Farmers Capitals Investment Scheme, and the Pig and Poultry Scheme measures under TAMS. </p>  <p>  High concentrations of ammonia in poultry houses should be avoided, thereby minimising negative impacts on bird health and performance. Good flock management practices are a factor in controlling ammonia concentrations, including stocking density and diet management and temperature adjustments in the houses.</p>  <p>  Controlling the ventilation rate is crucial. When ammonia levels increase, more ventilation is needed. </p>  <p>  Accordingly, measures to help reduce ammonia emissions include ventilation fans and control system for free range layer house and broiler houses and drinker systems.  Additionally, grant aid for the provision of energy efficient upgrades to buildings is a significant contributor to the control and reduction of ammonia levels in and emissions from poultry houses.  Details of all grant-aided investments are available on my Department's website.</p>  <p>  To date, total expenditure under the seven measures of TAMS, including transitional expenditure, has exceeded &euro;325million with commitments of an additional &euro;145million made to scheme participants who have yet to draw down those grants. Some 45,595 applications have been approved under the scheme. A total of &euro;1.7 million has been paid to date to 168 Poultry farmers under TAMS II.  No changes to the TAMS eligibility and technical criteria involved are being proposed at this time.</p>  <p>  The On-Farm Capital investment scheme, as is the case with all proposals under the CAP Strategic Plan (CSP), is in the process of development and is subject to the formal approval of the European Commission. The public consultation on the Environmental Assessment of the draft CAP Strategic Plan 2023-2027 closed on 8th December 2021, and I will be reviewing the proposal in advance of the submission of the proposal to the Commission by 1st January 2022.</p></reply>

The plan contains a comprehensive set of schemes which will lead to reductions in absolute greenhouse gas emissions, with significant co-benefits for air, water quality and biodiversity. Central to the CSP is protecting and enhancing farm incomes.  </p>  <p>  The Suckler Carbon Efficiency Scheme (SCES) will build on significant investments made to date under the Beef Data Genomics Programme (BDGP). Suckler beef farmers will be financially rewarded for participating in the scheme, which will not only improve GHG efficiencies, it will also reduce absolute GHG emissions over time, making a contribution to the sector's overall 22-30% GHG reduction target by 2030. Breeding low emitting animals will become a priority for this decade, and the Suckler scheme will support this objective. Crucially, participants will receive &euro;150 on the first 10 cows and &euro;120 on all remaining cows. This is significantly up on the BDGP which paid &euro;90/cow on the first 10 in the herd and &euro;80 thereafter. </p>  <p>  Funding under Pillar II has been increased by over &euro;900m in order to roll out a host of new schemes that will financially reward farmers to continue to play a leadership role in tackling climate change and addressing biodiversity and water quality. The new agri-environmental scheme under Pillar II will pay up to a maximum of &euro;10,000/farmer. There will be a move towards rewarding farmers for results-based outcomes, which will clearly contribute to overall environmental objectives. </p>  <p>  Under Pillar I, the Eco-Scheme measures offer a range of farmer-friendly options to participate while also having environmental benefits.</p>  <p>  My Department is also committed to the concept of carbon farming, a key part of current EU agriculture policy. </p>  <p>  A working group has been established which, taking account of developments at EU level, will bring forward a plan for establishing a pilot scheme. </p>  <p>  Carbon farming has significant potential to establish alternative funding streams for Irish agriculture, working closely with voluntary carbon markets, to provide financial incentives to underpin the necessary changes in farm management. I am genuinely excited and enthused about the potential of this area and I will push it forward.</p>  <p>  I have also established a soil carbon observatory and a soil sampling programme which will help to establish carbon baselines at individual farm levels. This will position Irish farmers to take advantage of carbon farming as the decade progresses. </p></reply>

The development of these 26 Plans will feed into the Government&rsquo;s overall Town Centre First Policy, which I expect will be launched in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  The funding will support each local authority, working with a collaborative Town Team, to develop a be-spoke Town Centre First plan to guide the development of each town. As part of the initiative, each local authority will be provided with &euro;100,000 to support the development of a unique vision for the town which will also outline specific interventions required to deliver on this vision.</p>  <p>  The Town Centre First Plans should be guided by a strong empirical base and be developed collaboratively with local Town Teams involving community and business, as well as public and private stakeholders. It is envisaged that the Plans will cover the importance of &ldquo;place-making&rdquo;, town centre living, and the social and economic purpose of the town. They should respond to emerging opportunities such as those linked to remote working, climate action and digitalisation. The Plans will also be central to addressing vacancy and dereliction in these locations.</p>  <p>  In addition to developing the plan, the funding can be used to cover any underlying analysis that must be undertaken to inform the development of the plan, capacity building required locally for the Town Team, or the initial delivery of some small interventions in the town, where the budget allows. </p>  <p>  The towns were selected based on submissions from the local authorities. Local authorities were requested to identify not more than three towns with a population of up to 10,000 people that are located outside of the 5 city metropolitan areas.

When taken together with the &euro;70 million already provided for 2021 and 2022 under the Transitional LEADER Programme, a total of &euro;250 million will be made available for the 2021 - 2027 period, thus maintaining the level of funding provided for the 2014-2020 programming period. The maintenance of the &euro;250m funding allocation will underpin the continued contribution of the LEADER approach in delivering on the Government&rsquo;s vision for Rural Ireland.</p>  <p>  Preparations for the design and delivery of the next LEADER programme from 2023-2027 are well underway. This includes an independent review of the delivery structures of the current programme, which is nearing completion. This review will draw on the experience of all stakeholders in the 2014 to 2020 LEADER programme and help to underpin effective scheme design for the new LEADER programme.</p>  <p>  My officials are engaging with stakeholders on an ongoing basis on the design of the next LEADER programme. They are also working closely with colleagues from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine and the EU Commission, in developing the next CAP Strategic Plan 2023-2027, which LEADER will form part of. </p>  <p>  The ongoing engagement and consultation with stakeholders combined with the funding allocation indicated will ensure that the LEADER programme from 2023 will continue to support and further develop our rural communities and businesses.</p></reply>

The Rural Development Programmes agreed by each Member State with the EU Commission were designed to correspond to specified Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) programming periods.  The CAP programming periods in turn correspond to the EU's budgetary cycle.  The Rural Development Programme (RDP) will now be replaced by each Member State&rsquo;s CAP Strategic Plan.  </p>  <p>  As part of the 2007 to 2013 CAP programming period, LEADER was included as a number of linked measures under Axis 4 of the RDP. The original  amount of funding that was made available to LEADER under that Rural Development Programme was approximately &euro;425m.</p>  <p>  Initially, &euro;400m was allocated to the Local Action Groups (LAGs) for project funding and administration with &euro;25m being withheld for future distribution. The LEADER programme evolves over the course of the 7 year period and, depending on the circumstances, can be amended with the agreement of the EU Commission.</p>  <p>  In 2013, due to the downturn in the national economy and following an amendment to the RDP which was negotiated with the European Commission, the allocations to the LAGs were revised resulting in a change in the co-financing rate and a decrease in the overall programme allocation. The revised allocations to the LAGs amounted to approximately &euro;327m. In some instances, the reduced level of funding was insufficient to meet the commitments of the LAGs and additional national exchequer funding in the region of &euro;47m was approved to meet these commitments. Additional funding for the food sector of &euro;3m was also approved. In total, &euro;377m was made available for the period 2007 to 2013.</p>  <p>  The final spend achieved by the LAGs up to the end of December 2015 was approximately &euro;366m.</p>  <p>  In the 2024-2020 RDP a total allocation of &euro;250m was available for LEADER, and this allocation has been maintained for the 2021-2027 period.</p></reply>

This recognises the difficulties inherent in the planning and profiling of capital expenditure, and that such projects may be subject to delays. </p>  <p>  Given the closure of construction sites for most of the first half of the year, in line with public health requirements, such delays were inevitable this year. I therefore decided to fully utilize this deferred surrender provision and will be carrying forward 10% of the Departments capital budget from 2021 to 2022. This amounts to &euro;16.86 million in capital funding.</p>  <p>  These funds are not lost, but are now available for use in 2022, where the funds will be used to further support capital schemes in the rural and community development programme areas.
