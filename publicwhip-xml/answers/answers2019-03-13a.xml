    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-03-13a.7.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019031300062#WRA00600"><p>The Public Service Stability Agreement 2018 to 2020 provides that management will engage with the Parties with a view to minimising the use of agency as far as possible and practicable over the lifetime of the Agreement. </p>  <p>  The level of spending on agency staff in the health sector is under constant review.  Agency staff are utilised by the sector where there is a difficulty in recruiting and employing hospital staff and where there is a short-term critical service need. Agency staff are also used for flexibility to allow for variations in activity and to meet patient demand. </p>  <p>  The level of health sector agency expenditure is influenced by a range of factors including increasing demand for services; ongoing challenges in recruiting and retaining clinical staff; and the need to comply with the European Working Time Directive. </p>  <p>  However, despite these issues it is clear that in certain services, the level of reliance on agency staffing is high, or has increased.  As a result, the HSE has assured the Minister for Health that the reduction and minimisation of agency costs remains an area of focus. </p>  <p>  Generally, progress achieved by the HSE in agency expenditure reduction last year was disappointing.  However, in the Acute Hospitals Division, agency spending reduced from over &euro;202m in 2017 to under &euro;200m in 2018. Within the Medical/Dental staff category, there was a reduction of over 10% between 2017 and 2018 representing an average monthly saving of over &euro;1m.   </p>  <p>  The HSE National Service Plan 2019 provides for a number of initiatives to address the overall financial challenges being faced by the HSE this year.  A target to reduce agency/overtime spend by &euro;17.5m has been identified and this has been subject to ongoing engagement with HSE service areas as part of operational planning for 2019. The HSE have advised that this process is nearing completion.</p></reply>

I am committed to ensuring that local clinicians and the community will be consulted with before a decision is made. I have decided that a comprehensive consultation exercise should be undertaken by the HSE, with an external facilitator, with the key stakeholder groups involved in the Portlaoise Hospital.  The consultation will involve key stakeholders and local community representatives and provide an opportunity to listen to and address the issues and concerns the stakeholders have highlighted.  The consultation will also provide an opportunity to set out clearly the immediate priorities for service development and improvement in the hospital.</p>  <p>  The appointment of an external facilitator for the consultation process is being finalised. The outcome of the consultation process will be a submission from the Department of Health, setting out the key findings from the consultation process and recommended response to inform me in making a final decision on the draft Action Plan. </p></reply>

The preferred supplier is responsible for the fabrication, installation and fit out of the modular theatres. </p>  <p>  I have been advised by the HSE that the first draft of contracts was issued by the HSE in May 2018. There has been active engagement with both legal teams and discussions are continuing.  A planning application was submitted in December 2018. Galway City Council has sought additional information which the HSE is now responding to. </p>  <p>  The Government has further increased investment in tackling waiting lists, with funding to the NTPF increasing from &euro;55 million in 2018 to &euro;75 million this year. </p>  <p>  The joint Department of Health/HSE/NTPF Scheduled Care Access Plan 2019 was published on Monday. The plan sets out measures to improve care for patients waiting for scheduled care in 2019 by reducing wait times for inpatient/day case treatment and outpatient appointments.  The Plan will, again this year, place a strong focus on high volume procedures, including orthopaedics. When combined with HSE activity it is projected that the NTPF will be in a position to offer treatment to all clinically suitable patients waiting more than 6 months for hip or knee replacement. </p>  <p>  The NTPF will deliver additional activity in the health service by working with hospital groups and individual hospitals as well as private health providers to maximise the number of patients treated in both a public and private capacity. I would strongly encourage all hospitals, including Galway University Hospital, to collaborate with the NTPF to identify waiting list initiatives.</p>  <p>  Subject to a successful determination of the planning application and successful discussions on the contract with the preferred bidder, the provision of the two modular orthopaedic theatres at Merlin Park University Hospital will proceed. </p></reply>

The Joint Committee produced two interim reports dated December 2017 and April 2018 and a final report was launched in October 2018. </p>  <p>  As part of its Terms of Reference, the Committee recognised that the Department of Health was simultaneously conducting a review of the national mental health policy, &lsquo;A Vision for Change&rsquo;. </p>  <p>Upon completion of its final report, the work of the Oireachtas Committee came to an end. In this report, the Committee requested that it be established on a permanent footing. The Committee&rsquo;s Terms of Reference, however, stated that &ldquo;the Joint Committee shall make its final report to both Houses of the Oireachtas by 31 October 2018, and shall thereupon stand dissolved&rdquo;. Consequently, there are no plans to establish the Committee on a permanent basis at present.</p>  <p>  One of the main objectives of the Committee was to &lsquo;assist with the completion of the implementation of &lsquo;A Vision for Change&rsquo; in order to provide a more integrated mental health service of the highest quality&rsquo;. As a result, the Committee&rsquo;s work is firmly affiliated with the Vision for Change refresh policy which is now nearing completion.</p>  <p>  It is anticipated that the final report of the Vision for Change refresh will be completed in the coming weeks. This report will be informed by the work of the Joint Oireachtas Committee. For example, the key concerns presented to the Committee by various stakeholders during the Committee&rsquo;s consultation process will be taken on board. </p>  <p>  In line with the recommendations of the Committee, the refreshed Vision for Change will support better access, personalised choice and greater service user involvement. It will be implemented by the Department of Health and the HSE. Similarly to other health areas, those charged with its implementation will be fully accountable to the Oireachtas Committee on Health and to the D&aacute;il itself.        </p>  <p>  In relation to the review of the Mental Health Act 2001, it is intended to finalise the draft heads of the bill in the coming weeks.  This initial draft will then be passed on to the Mental Health Commission for its views.  In line with normal procedures, the proposed legislation will be scrutinized by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</p></reply>

This process has involved reviewing the 106 sub-actions of the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy - which was published in August 2018 - and identifying where further actions were required. A readiness assessment of all the sub-actions was then initiated, which examined the degree to which there were plans and assigned responsibilities, behind the subactions, both new and existing. Finally, the Programme Implementation Office looked at how best to structure teams for successful and effective delivery. A Citizen Care Masterplan Framework for the implementation of the Sl&aacute;intecare actions was developed in order to establish a programmatic approach to delivery.</p>  <p>  At the end of December 2018, the Action Plan for 2019 was presented to me and I can confirm that, following its presentation to the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Advisory Council at the end of February, it will be published today (13 March 2019).</p>  <p>  It is a detailed and comprehensive plan for 2019 which firmly establishes a programmatic approach to the delivery of the Sl&aacute;intecare Strategy. It is a fundamental milestone in the delivery of the Sl&aacute;intecare vision for reformed health and social care services in Ireland.  </p>  <p>  The 2019 funding for the deliverables in the Action Plan have been provided in the relevant spending lines as part of the Estimates process for 2019.</p>  <p>  The Sl&aacute;intecare Programme Implementation Office is committed to transparency at all stages of the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare. The Programme Office will publish rolling plans annually and progress reports will be published on a biannual basis.</p></reply>

This is a clear indication of the importance placed on the mental health of the nation by the Government. The overall HSE Mental Health Budget has been increased by &euro;276 million, or 39%, since 2012.</p><p>Budget 2019 allocated an additional &euro;55 million to progress new developments in mental health this year. These developments include the development of a number of clinical programmes on such areas as early intervention psychosis, ADHD in adults and Eating Disorders. In addition, mental health services' capacity will be augmented by an increase in Primary Care counselling.</p><p>The Clondalkin Mental Health Team provides specialist mental health services to people living in the Clondalkin area. Currently the team consists of 22.1 WTEs (whole time equivalent staff), serving a population of 60,256 from two locations.</p><p>The Mental Health Service based in Clondalkin Village is temporarily relocating due to a number of health and safety issues. Services delivered at the Rowlagh Health Centre are unaffected by these issues.</p><p>I am informed that in the interests of both clients and staff, the HSE plans to deliver Community Mental Health services for Clondalkin in the proposed new Clondalkin Primary Care centre on Boot Road.</p><p>In the interim, alternative options are being pursued including a plan to temporarily relocate community mental health services to an existing HSE facility on the Belgard Road.</p><p>The Deputy might note that it is the intention of the HSE to continue to work with all stakeholders, including the Drugs and Alcohol Task Force, as plans develop.</p></reply>

In this regard I am committed to improving waiting times for hospital appointments and procedures.</p>  <p>  Cataract surgery is one of the most common surgical procedures carried out in the Ophthalmology specialty. Last year, under the Inpatient/Day Case Action Plan for 2018, I sought real progress to not only drive down waiting lists for high volume procedures, but also to treat patients with life-limiting conditions such as cataracts. </p>  <p>  Waiting List figures published by the National Treatment Purchase Fund for the end of February show the total number of patients waiting for a cataract procedure fell from 10,024 in July 2017 to under 6,300, a reduction of almost 38%. </p>  <p>  The numbers waiting more than 3 months almost halved in the same period, down from 8,000 to just under 4,000, while those waiting more than 9 months fell from 4,371 to 536, a reduction of 88%.</p>  <p>  Last year also saw the establishment of a dedicated Cataract Centre at Nenagh Hospital. This is a stand-alone high-volume consultant-led cataract theatre facility which, at full capacity, will provide a 5-day service and is expected to deliver approximately 2,000 cataract procedures in 2019. </p>  <p>  Budget 2019 announced that the Government had further increased investment in tackling waiting lists, with funding to the NTPF increasing from &euro;55 million in 2018 to &euro;75 million in 2019. </p>  <p>  Yesterday, I published the joint Department of Health/HSE/NTPF Scheduled Care Access Plan 2019, which sets out measures to improve care for patients waiting for scheduled care in 2019 by reducing waiting times for inpatient, day case and outpatient appointments. The plan places a strong focus on ten high volume procedures, including cataracts. When combined with HSE activity it is projected that the NTPF will be in a position to offer treatment to all clinically suitable patients waiting more than 6 months for one of these procedures.</p></reply>

The refresh has looked at a comprehensive range of interventions, including increased access to counsellors and psychologists providing a range of talking therapies - appropriate to the majority of mental health presentations encountered in primary care, and will make recommendations in these areas.</p>  <p>  The Government currently invests in the provision of Talk therapies, and there are a range of services already available. </p>  <p>  The HSE National Counselling Service within GP practices and primary care teams offers access to time-limited counselling to adults presenting in primary care with non-complex psychological needs. </p>  <p>  The Counselling in Primary Care (CIPC) service offers counselling sessions for medical card holders, who are 18 years of age or over, and who need help with mild to moderate psychological issues that can be appropriately dealt with by time-limited counselling in a primary care setting. </p>  <p>  Funding has also been provided for Psychologist and Assistant Psychologist posts in primary care to deliver rapid access low intensity psychological interventions for those under 18 years of age.</p>  <p>  The HSE is implementing two tele-counselling pilot projects. These are being provided to service users that have been identified by GPs as potentially benefitting from counselling for mild to moderate mental health difficulties. These service users are being offered the opportunity to avail of free online counselling at a location of their choice.</p>  <p>  The HSE is also undertaking two tele-psychiatry pilots to address CAMHS waiting lists and provide remote consultations on the national adolescent addiction and substance abuse service.</p>  <p>  In tandem with this I am aware that HSE Mental Health has engaged with a leading international provider of instant text messaging support services with a view to establishing such a service in Ireland. HSE is working closely with partner NGOs to act as a host/incubator organisations for the service, which will initially be rolled out on a pilot basis.</p>  <p>  In addition, there is a number of Voluntary and Community Sector organisations that provide a range of talking therapies and related supports, through a service level agreement with the HSE, to individuals experiencing mild to moderate mental health problems. These can be broadly targeted or relevant to particular constituencies of need and age ranges. These supports are an important component of psychological and social recovery services available at local level.</p></reply>

It provides evidence-based psychological interventions that are delivered through Primary Care and where necessary through specialist mental health services. The recruitment of 20 Psychologists and 114 Assistant Psychologists to Primary Care services last year is expected to alleviate capacity issues within mental health specialist services.</p>  <p>  Interventions are tailored to each patient&rsquo;s individual needs and can include a broad range of interventions that may include psychopharmacological treatments and various forms of psychotherapy including those which have their roots in cognitive behavioural therapies, systemic therapies and psychodynamic therapies. </p>  <p>  The Department of Health is working with the HSE to explore the increased use of digital technologies and early intervention services are being introduced. These include tele-psych facilities, which will provide increased talk therapies to patients within the primary care setting and directly to their digital device as is proven to be the preference of many teens and adolescents. </p>  <p>  In recognition of the importance of mental health, the Government increased the mental health allocation for 2019 to nearly &euro;1 billion. The overall HSE Mental Health Budget has been increased by &euro;276 million, or 39%, since 2012. Budget 2019 allocated an additional &euro;55 million to progress new developments in mental health this year. &euro;3 million of the new development funding is being used to develop resilience and early intervention programmes. The HSE will work with sports, community and voluntary groups to ensure that services are delivered at community level, where required. </p>  <p>  In addition, the HSE Medicines Management Programme has Prescribing Tips and Tools information cards for a number of anti-depressants and are available on their website for all prescribers to access.</p>  <p>  In conclusion, I am satisfied that the HSE is exploring different types of treatments while employing the most appropriate for each individual patient.</p></reply>

Each pathway serves a different purpose and therefore the Deputy's assertion that a contradiction exists is misinterpreted. </p>  <p>  For the purposes of clarity the two different access pathways are: </p>  <p>  1. Via Ministerial licence:</p>  <p>  Under the Misuse of Drugs legislation the Minister for Health may grant a licence to an Irish registered medical practitioner for access to cannabis for a named patient, where the course of cannabis treatment has been endorsed by a consultant who is responsible for the management of the patient and who is prepared to monitor the effects of treatment over time.</p>  <p>  Whilst the legal basis for the granting of licenses exists under the Misuse of Drugs Regulations, the decision to prescribe such treatment for an individual patient is a clinical matter and as such will be a decision for the prescribing clinician, in consultation with their patient.</p>  <p>  2. Medical Cannabis Access Programme (currently under development)</p>  <p>  The Medical Cannabis Access Programme, once operational, will be based on the recommendations of the HPRA's report &ldquo;Cannabis for Medical Use-A Scientific Review&rdquo;, and on the &lsquo;Clinical Guidance on Cannabis for Medical Use&rsquo; which has been drawn up by an expert group of doctors, pharmacists, patient representatives and scientific experts, to support the Medical Cannabis Access Programme. These guidelines are available on the Department&rsquo;s website. The guidelines contain detailed information on the use of medical cannabis, including the clinical indications for which cannabis may be prescribed under the access programme. The contents of these guidelines are based on expert clinical advice. It would be wholly inappropriate for a Minister for Health to seek to alter these expert guidelines in any way against the advice of the clinical experts that produced them.</p>  <p>  It is intended that the Ministerial licence application scheme will continue to operate in parallel with the Cannabis for Medical Use Access Programme, after the programme becomes operational, for exceptional cases only where there is an unmet clinical need.</p></reply>

While the Pay Commission noted that the incremental measures being introduced for new entrants would not be sufficient to bridge the gap between the pay of existing and new entrant consultants, new entrant consultants will benefit from these measures.</p>  <p>  The HSE is also committed to supporting consultant recruitment and retention, pursuing a number of initiatives including improvements to the recruitment process, offering contracts to the Hospital Group rather than individual sites and focusing on family friendly arrangements. </p>  <p>  At the end of December 2018 there were 3,096 whole time equivalent consultants working in the public health services, the highest number in the history of the State. Notwithstanding recruitment and retention challenges, the number of consultants has increased by 125 in the 12 months to end December 2018 and by 540 in the past five years. There are approximately 450 consultant posts which are not filled on a permanent basis at present. Most of these posts are filled by locums or temporary staff to support the delivery of essential services.</p></reply>

Funding to implement the switch to HPV screening, and extend HPV vaccination to boys, has been allocated in Budget 2019.</p>  <p>  The decision to switch to primary HPV screening follows on from a Health Technology Assessment carried out by HIQA. This found that it would be beneficial, both clinically and from a cost effectiveness perspective, to make this transition.</p>  <p>  The HPV test is a more accurate testing mechanism than liquid-based cytology, which is the current testing mechanism. Its use will result in fewer false negative results, though it is very important to be clear that false negatives will always be inherent in screening. Where a positive result for HPV is found, cytology is then undertaken as a second test.</p>  <p>  The introduction of primary HPV screening is in line with developments in cervical screening internationally. Ireland will be among the first countries in the world to make this transition. The HSE has been engaging with other countries who have already made the switch &ndash; the Netherlands, and Australia - or who are preparing to do so, to identify learnings for the project, and has been progressing work across a range of workstreams including procurement, ICT and colposcopy services. Pre-tender market engagement has been completed and a Prior Information Notice was published on 20 February.</p></reply>

It provides evidence-based psychological interventions that are delivered through Primary Care and where necessary through specialist mental health services. The recruitment of 20 Psychologists and 114 Assistant Psychologists to Primary Care services last year is expected to alleviate capacity issues within mental health specialist services. </p>  <p>  Interventions are tailored to each patient&rsquo;s individual needs and can include a broad range of interventions that may include psychopharmacological treatments and various forms of psychotherapy including those which have their roots in cognitive behavioural therapies, systemic therapies and psychodynamic therapies. </p>  <p>  The Department of Health is working with the HSE to explore the increased use of digital technologies and early intervention services are being introduced. These include tele-psych facilities, which will provide increased talk therapies to patients within the primary care setting and directly to their digital device as is proven to be the preference of many teens and adolescents. </p>  <p>  In recognition of the importance of mental health, the Government increased the mental health allocation for 2019 to nearly &euro;1 billion. The overall HSE Mental Health Budget has been increased by &euro;276 million, or 39%, since 2012. Budget 2019 allocated an additional &euro;55 million to progress new developments in mental health this year. &euro;3 million of the new development funding is being used to develop resilience and early intervention programmes. The HSE will work with sports, community and voluntary groups to ensure that services are delivered at community level, where required. </p>  <p>  In addition, the HSE Medicines Management Programme has Prescribing Tips and Tools information cards for a number of anti-depressants and are available on their website for all prescribers to access.</p>  <p>  In conclusion, I am satisfied that the HSE is exploring different types of treatments while employing the most appropriate for each individual patient. </p></reply>

However, the increased demand has undoubtedly put pressure on lab capacity and turnaround times. </p>  <p>  The HSE has been working actively with the labs to manage this issue and to improve turnaround times for smear tests. In addition, the HSE is aiming to source additional screening capacity, which would improve the turnaround time of results. This is a priority concern for my Department and the HSE. </p>  <p>  The HSE advises that the CervicalCheck Programme has recently agreed with laboratories to prioritise those slides which originate from women who attended colposcopy, as this cohort of women are considered to have the most serious need. The HSE also advises that the natural history of cervical cancer would indicate that the disease would normally develop over a period of 10 to 15 years. Due to this very fact, it is important that any woman of screening age attends for cervical screening each and every time she is invited to participate. The HSE has advised that in this context, a delay in the return of cervical screening results, whilst undesirable, is not necessarily dangerous and poses a very low risk to women.</p>  <p>  I have asked the HSE to introduce HPV testing as the primary screening method for the prevention of cervical cancer as soon as possible. Funding to implement the switch to HPV screening, and extend HPV vaccination to boys, has been allocated in Budget 2019.  The decision to switch to primary HPV screening follows on from a Health Technology Assessment carried out by HIQA. This found that it would be beneficial, both clinically and from a cost effectiveness perspective, to make this transition. The introduction of primary HPV screening is in line with developments in cervical screening internationally. Ireland will be among the first countries in the world to make this transition. Work is progressing across a range of workstreams including procurement, ICT and colposcopy services, pre-tender market engagement has been completed and a Prior Information Notice was published on 20 February.</p>  <p>  I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy in relation to the specific number of women who are waiting more than four weeks for their results and the length of time women are waiting. </p></reply>

The HSE current expenditure budget was increased by over &euro;848 million on the 2018 Supplementary budget, a substantial additional level of funding. The amount allocated follows an extensive process of engagement between my Department and DPER, which considers both the funding requirements as submitted by the HSE and the fiscal position. These types of engagements are a normal part of the Budgetary process and happen with agencies across Government. All public bodies put forward spending proposals but all such bodies, including the HSE, are required to operate within the amounts proposed by Government and determined by the D&aacute;il. While increased resources contribute to health service improvement, there are also ways in which improvements can be achieved within the current resources. The HSE has my full support in achieving these improvements as part of our shared reform agenda.</p>  <p>  Since I have come to office the allocation to the HSE has increased by &euro;2.56 billion or 19%. More resources are always welcome in contributing to the development of services but there is also a responsibility on the HSE to seek greater value from the very substantial existing resources at its disposal.</p>  <p>  The services to be provided in 2019 are as set out in the National Service Plan, and levels are typically equal to or higher than planned or delivered in 2018. The additional funding provided in Budget 2019 for new developments will support new or expanded levels of services across priority service areas. I expect the HSE to operate within the funding provided to it in 2019.</p></reply>

Approval and funding has been provided for the additional staff required to facilitate this service expansion and five staff (Grade IV Admin, Porter, Senior Cardiac Physiologist, Senior Radiographer and Staff Nurse) have now been recruited on an 8am to 8pm working day basis. Furthermore, the recruitment of a cardiologist to facilitate an increase in the operating hours of the existing cath lab is also being progressed by the HSE.</p>  <p>  A mobile cath lab has also been deployed at UHW since October 2017 to conduct diagnostic cardiac procedures pending the recruitment of the additional staff required to extend the opening hours of the existing cath lab.  </p>  <p>  I remain committed to the provision of a second cath lab in University Hospital Waterford and I asked the HSE to consider the cost of progressing the project to design, planning and construction stages in the context of the HSE&rsquo;s Capital Plan for 2019. </p>  <p>  I am please to advise the Deputy that the HSE has confirmed that this project has now been included in the HSE&rsquo;s Capital Programme 2019 and has been granted a capital allocation for 2019 to appoint the design team and to progress the design of the project. </p>  <p>  The Herity Report also recommended that the current 9 to 5 provision of emergency pPCI services should cease to allow the hospital focus on the much larger volume of planned work. The Minister for Health asked his Department to address the implications of this recommendation by arranging for a National Review of Specialist Cardiac Services. The aim of this Review is to achieve optimal patient outcomes at population level with particular emphasis on the safety, quality and sustainability of the services that patients receive by establishing the need for an optimal configuration of a national adult cardiac service.</p></reply>

An enhanced support package for rural practices has also been introduced with improved qualifying criteria and an increased financial allowance of &euro;20,000 per annum. 257 GP practice units encompassing 347 individual GPs are now in receipt of financial supports under this framework, a significant increase on the 167 GPs who received a rural practice allowance prior to the introduction of the 2016 measures. In addition, GP training places have been increased from 120 in 2009 to 193 filled in 2018.</p>  <p>  It is acknowledged that there are many challenges in general practice.  That is why Government remains committed to engaging with GP representatives on the development of a package of measures and reforms to modernise the current GMS contract.  </p>  <p>  Talks between the Department of Health, the HSE and the Irish Medical Organisation as the established GP representative body are continuing. Agreement on the delivery of these service improvements and contractual reforms has the potential to facilitate a substantial increase in the resourcing of general practice on a multiannual basis. </p>  <p>  The State&rsquo;s negotiating team is keen to bring matters to a conclusion; however, any agreement must substantially benefit patients and provide value for money for the taxpayer.</p></reply>

The two-brigade Army structure has seen the consolidation of understrength units into smaller numbers of full strength units, a reduction in the number of headquarters and the associated redeployment of personnel from administrative and support functions to operational units. This has resulted in an improvement in the deployability and sustainability of the Defence Forces, both at home and overseas.  It is clear that a three-brigade structure would cause a range of inefficiencies, including a return to understrength units and the re-introduction of an unnecessary layer of management functions associated with an additional brigade headquarters.</p></reply>

The focus of these increases is weighted in favour of those on lower pay.</p>  <p>  The Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020, which was accepted by members of the Permanent Defence Force through their representative associations, provides for increases in pay ranging from 6.2% to 7.4% over the lifetime of the Agreement. The increases due under the agreement from 1 January 2018, 1 October 2018 and 1 January 2019 have been paid to Permanent Defence Force personnel. Further increases in pay are scheduled in 2019 and 2020.</p>  <p>  By the end of the current Public Service Pay agreement the payscales of all public servants (including members of the Defence Forces), earning under &euro;70,000 per annum, will be restored to pre FEMPI levels. The restoration of the 5% reduction to allowances cut under FEMPI is also scheduled as part of that agreement. </p>  <p>  New entrants who joined the Defence Forces since 2011, may also benefit from the measures which were recently announced in relation to interventions at points 4 and 8 of the pay scales for relevant new entrants to the public service. </p>  <p>  Given the unique and demanding nature of military life, there is understandably a relatively high level of turnover among Defence Forces personnel. This is not new and the Defence Forces have always had a level of turnover that exceeds other areas of the public service. </p>  <p>  In order to balance personnel turnover there is ongoing recruitment at both enlisted and officer level. This includes general service recruits, apprentices, cadets and direct entry officers.  </p>  <p>  With regard to other retention measures, there are a range of actions outlined in the White Paper on Defence (2015) which are aimed at enhancing the capabilities of the Defence Forces. These include HR initiatives which impact on retention such as providing career development opportunities and accreditation.  The criteria for extending service beyond twelve years have been revised and this has ensured that personnel who would have had to depart could remain. An examination of age profiles for enlisted personnel has been prioritised and this is being progressed. A gap analysis of skill sets in the Permanent Defence Force is also being prioritised. In addition, the military authorities have introduced further initiatives to enhance work-life balance and this is also to be welcomed.</p>  <p>  In accordance with the provisions of Public Services Stability Agreement 2018-2020, the Government has tasked the Public Service Pay Commission with conducting a comprehensive examination of specific recruitment and retention challenges in the Defence Sector. The Commission's work is on-going.  The Government will give due consideration to the findings and any recommendations that arise from the work of the Commission. </p></reply>

I met with David Lidington in Dublin on 28 February, and again during my visit to London on 6 March, and since then by phone. I spoke with Michel Barnier over the weekend, during his visit to Dublin. </p>  <p>  There have been an intensive series of meeting between the EU and the UK over the past few weeks, including between the British Attorney General, Geoffrey Cox, the UK Brexit Secretary, Stephen Barclay, and the EU Chief Brexit Negotiator Michel Barnier, most recently on 6 March.  </p>  <p>  On 11 May Prime Minister May and President Juncker agreed a package of measures comprising of an &ldquo;Instrument relating to the Agreement on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland from the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community&rdquo; and a &ldquo;Joint Statement supplementing the Political Declaration setting out the framework for the future relationship between the European Union and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.&rdquo;  There was constant contact between our team and the Commission's team over the last number of days as these documents were being developed. The Taoiseach also spoke by phone with President Juncker before the package was agreed with Prime Minister May. </p>  <p>  These documents are complementary to the Withdrawal Agreement and Political Declaration and aim to provide an additional layer of interpretation, clarification and elaboration to the United Kingdom. They provide the legal assurances sought by the UK on the temporary nature of the backstop, as well as additions to the political declaration on the future relationship setting clearly our commitment to finding alternative arrangements to the backstop.</p>  <p>  The Government welcomes this agreement, and has backed this package of measures in the interests of securing an overall deal. </p>  <p>  We regret the outcome of last night&rsquo;s vote in the House of Commons and are disappointed that the UK Government has been unable to secure parliament approval of the Withdrawal Agreement. </p>  <p>  It is now for the UK to set out what it intends to do next. We will be closely monitoring further developments and votes in Westminster in the coming days. There is still time for sensible solutions. </p></reply>

I made clear to the Secretary of State the Government's deep concern at the statement she had made earlier that day, regarding deaths caused by British soldiers and police during the Troubles, which had caused intense hurt and distress to families who lost loved ones in dreadful circumstances. </p>  <p>  I underlined the need for investigation of all Troubles-related deaths, implementation of the Stormont House Agreement legacy framework, and honouring of the commitment under the 2001 Weston Park Agreement for a public inquiry in the Pat Finucane case.</p>  <p>  I reiterated to the Secretary of State the Government's position that there must be effective investigations into all deaths during the Troubles, regardless of the perpetrator.  I underlined that there are no amnesties from prosecution provided for in the Good Friday Agreement or any subsequent Agreements, including the Stormont House Agreement, and that the Government has been clear that it would not support any proposal to introduce such a measure, for state or non-state actors. </p>  <p>  I also emphasised the imperative of moving ahead with legislation to establish the Stormont House Agreement legacy bodies, including to provide an effective system for investigation of outstanding legacy cases in Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  The Secretary of State acknowledged the deeply-felt hurt and concern her comments had caused, and stated that this was not intended. Secretary of State Bradley also confirmed the British Government's continuing support for the Stormont House Agreement and its intention to progress the necessary implementing legislation. She also affirmed that all Troubles-related deaths must be effectively investigated in accordance with the law, whatever the circumstances and whoever the perpetrators.</p>  <p>  The Secretary of State's subsequent statement on 7 March which apologised for the offence and hurt caused by her statement to families who lost loved ones is important. It is also important that the Secretary of State publicly confirmed that what she had said was wrong, that "where there is any evidence of wrongdoing this should be pursued without fear of favour whoever the perpetrators might be", and that this is and will remain the basis of the British Government's  approach to dealing with legacy issues.</p>  <p>  The Government will continue to engage with the British Government to seek the establishment of the Stormont House Agreement legacy institutions, in order to meet the legitimate needs and expectations of victims and survivors, for whom delivery of a comprehensive legacy framework is long overdue.</p></reply>

The Act provides, among other things, that a person must be an Irish citizen before a passport can be issued to him/her. In order to meet this, each person must demonstrate an entitlement to Irish citizenship by providing acceptable documentary evidence of this entitlement. </p><p>Entitlement to Irish citizenship is determined by the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, under which Irish citizenship may be obtained by birth, by descent, or by naturalisation.</p><p>An individual born on the island of Ireland before 2005 is automatically an Irish citizen. For individuals born outside of Ireland, they may claim citizenship if they had at least one parent who was born in the island of Ireland before 2005. </p><p>Individuals born outside of Ireland can also claim citizenship through a parent who was not born in Ireland but was an Irish citizen at the time of the individual's birth, or through a grandparent born in Ireland. Individuals who wish to claim citizenship through these means must have their birth entered on the Foreign Births Register (FBR). Citizenship commences after inclusion on the FBR. Further details regarding the process can be consulted at the Passport Service's website: <i>www.dfa.ie/passports-citizenship/citizenship/born-abroad/</i>.</p><p>There are no provisions for the spouse or partner of an Irish citizen to acquire Irish citizenship solely by virtue of marriage or civil partnership. Post nuptial citizenship was repealed with effect from 30 November 2005. The Passport Service will accept a valid post-nuptial certificate as evidence of citizenship if this post nuptial certificate was awarded prior to November 30 2005. There is no provision to apply for post nuptial citizenship retrospectively.</p><p>In cases where no Irish lineage exists, an individual may apply for Irish citizenship through naturalisation. Minimum residency terms must be satisfied before an individual is eligible for citizenship through naturalisation. The Department of Justice and Equality is responsible for citizenship matters, including applications for naturalisation.</p></reply>

A complete description of the item being imported would be required in order to give a full customs tariff classification, this is particularly important for the importation of car parts and accessories. In the case of new or used vehicles imported from a third country, customs duty is chargeable at importation in the normal way, unless the trader has been authorised by Revenue for the deferral of taxes and duties. </p>  <p>  Full details of the customs procedures are available on Revenue&rsquo;s dedicated Brexit website www.revenue.ie/brexit. If further information is required in relation to customs procedures, these can be addressed to brexitqueries@revenue.ie.</p>  <p>  In relation to VAT, vehicles that are acquired from Italy and transited through the United Kingdom will be subject to the current VAT rules. Vehicles imported from the UK will be subject to VAT at the point of importation.</p>  <p>  In order to alleviate the cash flow burden on Irish businesses post Brexit, I have legislated for postponed accounting for import VAT.  Under this system, importers will not pay import VAT at the point of entry but will instead account for import VAT through their VAT return, so that it is reclaimed at the same time that it is declared - a straightforward simultaneous in/out accounting transaction, without the need to pay the import VAT at the point of entry to the State.  Use of postponed accounting will be optional and will be available to all traders in Ireland who trade with operators in countries outside of the European Union for a time after Brexit, after which continuation of the facility will be subject to conditions, to be set by the Revenue Commissioners at a later date.</p></reply>

The SBCI provides loan funding to Small and Medium Sized Enterprises. The SFF was established to address the needs of community organisations and social enterprises for loan funding which was difficult to obtain from mainstream financial institutions; it acts as a wholesale funder, providing funding to its lending partners Clann Credo and Community Finance Ireland.

The majority of the funding has been drawn down, with partial draw down indicated.</p><p>The National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) has indicated that the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (&ldquo;ISIF&rdquo;) does not provide county level information as the publication of such information could inadvertently result in the disclosure of commercially sensitive information relating to underlying investee companies.  The ISIF publishes bi-annual economic impact reporting which contains national and regional level data on the Fund's investments and economic impact. The ISIF H1 2018 Economic Impact Report is available on the ISIF website and sets out the regional spread of ISIF's investments, showing that 54 per cent of jobs supported and 47 per cent of capital invested are outside of Dublin.  Approximately 6 per cent of investment and 4 per cent of economic activity achieved, to-date, are in the five Connacht counties.</p><p>It was not possible for the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) to respond to this information request in the time available and therefore I will make arrangements to provide a response in line with Standing Orders.<table><tr><th>Body</th><th>Funding provided to projects in each of the years 2016 to 2018 and to date 2019</th></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>Co Galway<br /><br />2016 -  &euro;79,000<br /><br />2017 -  &euro;771,464<br /><br />2018 -  &euro;457,251.75<br /><br />Jan/Feb 2019 -  &euro;30,000</td></tr><tr><td>Social Finance Foundation</td><td>Co Roscommon<br /><br />2016 -  &euro;57,438<br /><br />2017 -  &euro;392,925.80<br /><br />2018 -  &euro;369,757.54<br /><br />Jan/Feb 2019 -  &euro;129,315.43</td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>Co Galway<br /><br />2016 - Liquidity Scheme: &euro;16,863,179<br /><br />            Credit Guarantee Scheme: &euro;180,000<br /><br />2017 - Liquidity Scheme: &euro;19,656,235<br /><br />            Credit Guarantee Scheme: &euro;150,000<br /><br />            Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme: &euro;7,085,837<br /><br />2018 - Liquidity Scheme: &euro;4,866,485<br /><br />            Credit Guarantee Scheme: &euro;865,000<br /><br />            Brexit Loan Scheme: &euro;565,000 (&euro;500,000 drawn down)<br /><br />2019 - Liquidity Scheme: &euro;937,559<br /><br />            Credit Guarantee Scheme: &euro;180,000<br /><br />            Brexit Loan Scheme: &euro;400,000 ( Draw down info on Q1 2019   not due to be reported until 15th May 2019)</td></tr><tr><td>Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland</td><td>Co Roscommon<br /><br />2016 - Liquidity Scheme: &euro;2,905,162<br /><br />2017 - Liquidity Scheme: &euro;3,462,059<br /><br />            Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme: &euro;133,394<br /><br />2018 - Liquidity Scheme: &euro;2,594,083<br /><br />            Credit Guarantee Scheme: &euro;200,000<br /><br />2019 - Liquidity Scheme: &euro;244,671<br /><br />            Brexit Loan Scheme: &euro;30,000 ( draw down info on Q1 2019 not due to be reported until 15th May 2019)</td></tr></table></p></reply>

In my Budget 2019 speech, I announced that my Department will begin work, in conjunction with the Central Bank of Ireland, on the national regulation of crowdfunding in Ireland. </p>  <p>  With regulation, crowdfunding has the potential to play an important role in broadening competition in the SME finance market, beyond the banking system which is a key priority in terms of access for finance for SMEs. Regulation will also ensure that sufficient consumer protections are in place for non-sophisticated or non-professional investors and that such investors have all of the relevant information and are made aware of the risks involved in investing via crowdfunding. </p>  <p>  The potential benefits of crowdfunding have been recognised at a European level where the negotiations on a draft regulation on the regulation of crowdfunding are underway. The purpose of the draft European regulatory regime for all crowdfunding service providers operating in the European Union is to reduce regulatory divergence and obstacles, facilitate and support crowdfunding activity as a means of providing finance to SMEs, and as part of completing the Capital Markets Union. </p>  <p>  Given the development of the European regulation, it may not be necessary to introduce a domestic regime for Ireland. However, if the draft European regulation is delayed for a considerable period, a domestic regime, which is aligned with the proposed European regime, will be brought forward.</p></reply>

The harder the Brexit the more negative the impact will be on our economy. </p>  <p>  While my Department&rsquo;s central economic and fiscal planning scenario remains an orderly exit involving the UK leaving with a transition arrangement in place, the risk of a disorderly exit cannot be discounted. </p>  <p>In November 2018, a number of new research reports in the UK were published that showed that the impact in the UK would be larger than previously assumed. An initial &lsquo;holding&rsquo; assessment was prepared by the Department of Finance in January, based on an initial application of the latest UK estimated, pending the completion of a more comprehensive model-based assessment with the ESRI. This was made public following consideration by government on 29 January 2019.</p>  <p>  The initial assessment showed that in a disorderly exit, while in aggregate terms, the economy is likely to continue expanding, the pace of growth would be lower than is currently expected. The assessment suggests that the size of the economy will be around 4&frac14; percentage points smaller than our existing trajectory over the medium-term and will be around 6 percentage points smaller compared to a &lsquo;no Brexit&rsquo; scenario. </p>  <p>  It is important to recognise that such estimates may not capture the full impact, and the figures may be conservative. Indeed, the impact in certain exposed sectors and regions will be worse than the average.</p>  <p>  My Department is therefore working with the ESRI on a new more comprehensive model-based assessment of the economic and fiscal impact of Brexit on Ireland. This work takes into account the recently published UK assessments, and substantial new microeconomic research that has been produced since the 2016 assessment. The assessment will include short-run disorderly impacts, tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade, and the positive benefits of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) that is redirected from the UK to Ireland. The results are expected to be published later this month and will inform my Department&rsquo;s next set of macroeconomic forecasts in the Stability Programme Update in April. </p>  <p>  The UK&rsquo;s departure from the EU is an event without precedent in modern economic history &ndash; estimating the impact of this is challenging. Nevertheless, quantifying the impact is important to help Government to understand the possible macroeconomic implications and to design the appropriate policy response. </p>  <p>  The Government has already taken significant action to get Ireland Brexit ready. Since the UK referendum, all of our national Budgets have been framed to prepare for the challenge of Brexit with dedicated measures announced in Budgets 2017, 2018 and 2019. This is supported by long-term planning through the National Development Plan and the National Planning Framework which will provide significant investment in Ireland&rsquo;s public capital infrastructure.</p></reply>

All applications are assessed by an Occupational Health Physician who is on the Medical Council&rsquo;s Specialist Register in Occupational Medicine. The medical opinion on permanent medical disability lies with the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) and not with the civil servant's GP/ hospital doctor.</p>  <p>  The person referred to by the Deputy applied for ill-health retirement and in line with procedures was referred to the CMO&rsquo;s Office. The report from the CMO was that it was not the opinion of the Ill Health Retirement Forum, who assess applications, that this applicant was likely to be permanently medically incapable of regular and effective service in her current occupation. </p>  <p>  The applicant appealed this decision and the case was referred to an independent Occupational Physician. The independent Occupational Physician upheld the decision of the CMO and advised that the person was fit to continue working part-time and that Ill Health Retirement was not appropriate.  </p>  <p>  This remains the position. </p>  <p>  In relation to the Spouses' and Children&rsquo;s Superannuation Scheme, this is a contributory scheme for civil servants which provides pensions for qualifying spouses and/or dependent children of a member who dies in service, or who dies after qualifying for a pension or preserved pension. Special rules apply to the payment of contributions in cases where ill-health retirement applications are approved. The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and PeoplePoint are responsible for the management of the Scheme.</p></reply>

The general principles in accordance with which the Inspectorate carries out its work are set out in the Code of Practice for the Inspectorate. (2015)</p><p>While the great majority of inspections to schools and other settings are carried out successfully, occasionally a board of a school or a teacher or other educational practitioner may be dissatisfied with an aspect of the inspection process or an Inspectorate report. When these cases arise the board of management, teacher or practitioner may seek a review of the work of an inspector or an inspection report and the procedures for such reviews are published in the document Procedure for Review of Inspections on Schools and Teachers under Section 13(9) of the Education Act, 1998.<i></i>(September 2015).<i></i></p><p>One of the principles underpinning these procedure is that the concerns of teachers or boards are best resolved informally. For this reason, the Procedure for Review incorporates an Informal Review process as well as a Formal Review process.  If the concern remains unresolved following the Informal Review process, the teacher, practitioner or board may request a Formal Review of the inspection. </p><p>A Formal Review involves the examination of the matter by an Internal Reviewer and an External Reviewer, and that that process must be exhausted before a report may be published. </p><p>In the case of the school concerned, a request for an Informal Review was received and processed. The person seeking the Informal Review was not satisfied that their concern was addressed in the Informal Review and they have sought a Formal Review of the inspection. The Formal Review has not concluded so it is not possible at this stage to state when the inspection report will be published.</p></reply>

I have spoken to a number of school secretaries about their employment conditions.</p>  <p>  Schemes were initiated in 1978 and 1979 for the employment of Clerical Officers and Caretakers in schools.  The schemes were withdrawn completely in 2008.  These schemes have been superseded by the more  extensive capitation grant schemes.  The current grant scheme was agreed in the context of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, published in 1991.  </p>  <p>  The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools now receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under these grant schemes.  It is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs. Where a school uses the grant funding for caretaking or secretarial purposes, any staff taken on to support those functions are employees of individual schools.  Specific responsibility for the pay and conditions rests with the school. </p>  <p>  On foot of a Chairman&rsquo;s Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department engaged with the Unions representing school secretaries and caretakers, including through an independent arbitration process in 2015. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for staff and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period.  This arbitration agreement covers the period up to 31 December 2019.  </p>  <p>  The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a Secretary or Caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration will, from 1 January 2019, be paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay. </p>  <p>  The F&Oacute;RSA trade union have requested a meeting with the Department to discuss pay arrangements for grant-funded Secretaries and Caretakers from 2020 onwards. The Department has acknowledged the letter and is considering the union&rsquo;s request.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. </p><p>Tallaght and Rathfarnham Garda Stations form part of the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) South Division.

The official categorisation of Community Garda simply refers to those who are exclusively assigned to building relationships with local communities and civil society including giving talks to schools, community groups and others.

Each application is assessed individually and the process involved in making a provisional assessment is based on the records of the institutions concerned (where these are available) and any other relevant records or statements which may include the applicant's testimony and sometimes testimony from others. This process enables a decision to be made as to whether on the balance of probabilities an applicant comes within the scope of the scheme.</p><p>I can assure the Deputy that all applications will be dealt with as quickly as possible.</p></reply>

This legislation is being progressed through the Oireachtas as a matter of priority.

Once the General Scheme has been approved by Government, it will be referred to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel for drafting and to the relevant Oireachtas Committee for pre-legislative scrutiny.</p>  <p>  A working group was established in 2017, comprising officials from the Department of Justice and Equality, the Courts Service and the Legal Aid Board, to examine the operational aspects relating to the Family Court and develop an overall architecture for the new family court structure. The Department of Children and Youth Affairs and Tusla also participated in the working group. Key issues that arose in consultations included family court venues and facilities, resources and capital investment in family courts and integration of relevant family and child services to provide the best possible family law outcomes.</p>  <p>  In 2018, a task force comprising senior officials from the Department of Justice and Equality, the Legal Aid Board and the Courts Service was formed to seek agreement on core questions of policy and costs.  The work of this group is at an advanced stage.  Issues being examined include court areas and locations, use of courthouses, provision of facilities and services, arrangements for management of resources, and oversight arrangements.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to building a new Family Law Centre and Children&rsquo;s Court in Dublin 7.

The project is to be delivered as a Public Private Partnership. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998 management of the courts, including the provision of accommodation for court sittings, is the responsibility of the Courts Service, which is independent in exercising its functions. </p>  <p>  Discussions are ongoing with the Courts Service in regard to a number of issues including aspects of the funding proposal. In due course, the project would also require sanction from Department of Public Expenditure and Reform before it can proceed.</p></reply>

Preparation has had a wide-ranging focus on operational requirements, including personnel, infrastructure and technology. I know the Commissioner is committed to ensuring the organisation can deal with any policing challenges arising from Brexit though clearly the circumstances which may arise are dependant on the political settlement.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Government's policy is that there will be no hard border on the island and there are no plans for such.  However, as she is also aware, policing in the Border region has always presented particular challenges and this can be expected to increase in the context of Brexit.  It is also the case that violent dissident republic groups continue to seek to frustrate counter-terrorism efforts and organised criminals seek to exploit the two jurisdictions in order to try to evade detection.  </p>  <p>  The 2018 Cross-Border Threat Assessment prepared jointly by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI estimated that some 43 per cent of organised crime gangs in Northern Ireland have a cross-Border dimension. Likewise, mobile organised crime groups, responsible for multiple instances of domestic burglary, operate on an all-island basis.  There are increasing instances of borderless crimes such as cyber fraud and international terrorism.  </p>  <p>  The success of cross-Border policing actions is grounded in the recognition that the best means of combating the threat to our communities is to maintain and enhance the excellent levels of co-operation between law enforcement agencies north and south of the Border. The Garda&iacute; and PSNI, along with other agencies, have worked together closely for many years and enjoy an excellent working relationship and co-operation at all levels.</p>  <p>  The Fresh Start Agreement recognised this and led to the establishment of Joint Agency Investigation Teams which have had considerable success in combating this type of crime.  I understand this is also the context for the Commissioner&rsquo;s operational decision to establish an additional Armed Support Unit in Cavan.  </p>  <p>  Garda ASUs provide a rapid armed response capacity and capability on a Regional basis.  Members of the ASUs are highly trained and equipped with a variety of non-lethal and lethal weapons and perform high visibility armed checkpoints and patrols throughout their respective Regions.  In the Northern Region ASUs are currently based in Ballyshannon, Co. Donegal and Dundalk, Co. Louth.</p>  <p>  Garda deployments in all areas of the country including those along the Border have benefited from increased recruitment in recent years.  I am advised by the Commissioner that the strength of the Northern Region as on 31 January, the latest date for which figures are currently available, was 1,406 Garda&iacute;.  There are 59 Garda Reserves and 144 Garda civilian staff attached to the Northern Region.  An additional 49 Garda&iacute; were assigned to the region with effect from last Friday.  </p>  <p>  The increased resources coming on stream have also provided the capacity to expand the specialist bureaus including the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau, all of which are particularly active in the Northern Region in addition to the Armed Support Units.</p>  <p>  The ongoing recruitment will provide the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; to deliver a visible, effective and responsive policing service.  These requirements will be kept under ongoing review by Garda management with a view to addressing any policing requirements for the Border region which may arise depending upon the outcome of the Brexit negotiations.  In the event that a &ldquo;no deal&rdquo; Brexit gives rise to additional requirements in Border areas, further resources can and will be provided through redeployment.</p>  <p>  More generally, the Deputy will be aware that the resources provided by Government to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have reached unprecedented levels this year, with an allocation of &euro;1.76 billion.  Significant capital investment is also being made in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including investment of &euro;342 million in Garda ICT infrastructure between 2016 and 2021; allocation of &euro;46 million to the Garda Fleet over the same period; as well as considerable capital investment in addressing the deficiencies in the Garda estate. I am informed by the Garda authorities that the allocation of Garda resources is subject to constant review in light of operational need, to ensure their optimum use. </p>  <p>  Finally I want to assure the Deputy that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the full support of the Government in dealing with the implications of Brexit and will provide the necessary resources to keep our people and our communities safe.</p></reply>

The economy has recovered strongly and there are now more people at work than any time in the last decade. With the increase in employment and increase in earnings, there is now more spending in the economy and this is to the benefit of all businesses, including hairdressing and personal care sectors. </p>  <p>  The supports of my Department to improve access to credit for businesses are available to businesses in the hairdressing and personal care sectors. These include loans of up to &euro;25,000 available throughMicro Finance Ireland, the Credit Guarantee Scheme which is operated with the three pillar banks and also the Brexit Working Capital Loan Scheme. I am aware that many businesses may import products for the UK and Brexit may give rise to extra costs. I would also encourage businesses from all sectors to engage with their Local Enterprise Office (LEO), which offer a range of advisory and other supports in every county. In particular at this time of Brexit uncertainty I am encouraging businesses to consider participating in the LEO Customs Training programmes if appropriate so they can remain competitive in a post-Brexit environment. Skillnet Ireland and the Education and Training Boards are also engaged with the sector and again I would encourage business owners to engage directly with local providers on their changing skills requirements, in particular where there are requirements for reskilling and upskilling. </p>  <p>  Stabilising the public finances and prudent fiscal management is an essential underpinning for a strong and growing economy and is essential to ensuring future growth prospects for all sectors. The Government&rsquo;s ability to directly fund locally trading businesses is more constrained due to considerations of displacement, fairness and equity between businesses. </p>  <p>  This Government has played its part in supporting the personal care sector when it most needed it with the introduction of the reduced VAT rate in 2011, which helped to sustain employment throughout the country in the sector. </p>  <p>  As the Minister for Finance noted in introducing Budget 2019, while a Government&rsquo;s decision to provide stimulus to the economy is often an easy one to make, judging when it is appropriate to withdraw stimulus measures is always more challenging. The Minister for Finance gave a commitment in the 2018 Finance Bill to undertake an economic analysis of the 9 per cent rate. The review found that the reduced rate has done its job. In the context of the new economic reality where the economy is strong, growth is broadly balanced and full employment is within sight, the Minister noted that it was appropriate to increase the rate of VAT and underlines the Government&rsquo;s commitment to responsibly manage the public finances and maintain a broad tax base.</p></reply>

The only current proposal to amend the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 has arisen in the context of an ongoing review of Dangerous Substances legislation to overhaul the current licensing and regulatory regime for the retail petroleum and petroleum bulk storage sectors. My Department has identified the need to provide a legal basis to delegate certain powers to the Health and Safety Authority. These powers would allow the Health and Safety Authority to act on behalf of the Minister as a decision-making Body in respect of appeals of decisions made by Local Authorities on applications for licenses to store or sell petroleum products and other fuels. This is a relatively minor technical amendment to the 2005 Act.</p>  <p>   The decision to delegate this power to the Health and Safety Authority has been taken following consultation with relevant stakeholders within the sector as part of the review of Dangerous Substances legislation and received Government approval in December 2018.</p></reply>

That is why my Department started developing supports for businesses from the time when Brexit first became a possibility. Government&rsquo;s priority is to ensure that businesses around the country can manage risks and avail of any opportunities. This has informed the range of advisory and financial supports that are in place. </p><p>The &euro;300 million Brexit Loan Scheme launched last year is open to eligible businesses of up to 499 employees which have been demonstrably impacted by Brexit, or which will be in the future. The Brexit Loan Scheme provides working capital funding to businesses to innovate, change or adapt in response to Brexit-related challenges. Loan amounts range from &euro;25,000 up to &euro;1.5 million, for terms of up to three years and at a maximum interest rate of 4%. Loans of up to &euro;500,000 are available unsecured. This may be useful for businesses whose cashflow has already been impacted by Brexit. </p><p>Beyond this, my Department and its agencies are fully engaged in preparing Irish businesses for Brexit and have participated in the Government of Ireland&rsquo;s series of Getting Ireland Brexit Ready events in Cork, Galway, Monaghan, Dublin, Limerick and Donegal. As part of awareness-raising activities, Enterprise Ireland continues to roll out regional Brexit Advisory clinics. To date, these clinics have been held in Letterkenny, Tralee, Portlaoise, Claremorris, Cootehill, Charleville, Dublin, Galway, Dundalk, Waterford and Limerick. Further events are planned in Galway, Cork, Letterkenny and Dublin ahead of the withdrawal date. </p><p>EI has also been running a PrepareforBrexit communications campaign, featuring the Brexit SME Scorecard and the PrepareforBrexit.ie website, which offers information on the likely impacts of Brexit on Irish businesses and how these impacts might be mitigated. The Brexit SME Scorecard is an interactive online platform that can be used by all Irish businesses to self-assess their exposure to Brexit. </p><p>Funding to the Local Enterprise Offices has been increased by 22% and they, along with InterTradeIreland, are offering a range of Brexit-focused supports to companies, including those engaged in cross-border trade with Northern Ireland. InterTradeIreland continues to offer its Brexit: Start to Plan voucher scheme, which makes available financial support of up to &euro;2,250 towards professional advisory services to address Brexit-related challenges.</p><p>The LEOs offer Brexit supports to micro and small businesses through the 31 LEOs nationwide, including tailored mentoring to address Brexit-related business challenges, and targeted training on specific Brexit challenges.</p><p>The InterTradeIreland Brexit Advisory Service provides a focal point for SMEs working to navigate any changes in cross-border trading relationships arising as a result of Brexit. As part of the service, ITI has organised a series of awareness events focused on improving knowledge of customs processes and procedures and identifying actions that can be taken in areas such as logistics and supply chain management.</p><p>ITI also offers a Brexit Start to Plan voucher scheme, which enables businesses to get professional advice on how best to plan and prepare for the UK's withdrawal from the European Union. This support helps businesses obtain advice on specific areas such as tariffs, currency management, regulatory and customs issues and movement of labour, goods and services. ITI vouchers are worth up to &euro;2,250 (inclusive of VAT) each. Companies are finding the vouchers very useful and there has been strong demand which can be attributed to the media campaign conducted by ITI across a range of platforms. ITI have just launched a further financial support - &pound;5,000 in matched funding which will support companies in implementing a change identified in their Brexit action plan.</p><p>While I have seen a very positive uptake of the supports available, not everyone is engaging. With Brexit around the corner, I want businesses, particularly those around the Border counties to know my Department and agencies are here to help. My Department and its agencies are providing extensive supports, schemes and advice to ensure that businesses are prepared for Brexit.<table><tr><th>Scheme</th><th>Uptake (end Feb)  </th></tr><tr><td>Brexit Loan Scheme</td><td>479 applications received, 430 approved by SBCI, 82 Loans progressed to sanction at bank level to a value of   &euro;17.35 million (this figure as at 1st March)</td></tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland Brexit Scorecard - online platform for Irish   companies to self-assess their exposure to Brexit</td><td>4,435 Brexit Scorecards have been completed. 722 LEO clients have completed the scorecard.</td></tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland Be Prepared Grant</td><td>168 Be Prepared Grants have been approved</td></tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland Market Discovery Fund - A support to EI   clients to research new   markets</td><td>251 projects have been approved under this   initiative</td></tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland Agile Innovation Fund - Gives rapid fast-track   access to innovation funding</td><td>43 Agile Innovation projects have been   approved</td></tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland Brexit Advisory Clinics</td><td>13 Brexit Advisory Clinics have been run with over 1,000 in attendance</td></tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland Brexit &ldquo;Act On Programme&rdquo; &ndash; A support funding   the engagement of a consultant to devise report with recommendations to   help clients address weaknesses and improve resilience</td><td>190 &ldquo;Act on&rdquo; Plans have been completed</td></tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland Strategic Consultancy Grant &ndash; A grant to   assist EI clients to hire a strategic consultant for a set period</td><td>1,057 Strategic Consultancy Grants have been approved</td></tr><tr><td>Local Enterprise Office LEAN for Micro &ndash; The LEO Lean4Micro offer was developed in collaboration between the EI Lean department and the LEOs to tailor the EI lean offer for LEO micro enterprise clients.</td><td>419 clients were approved assistance under the Technical Assistance Grant (end January 2019)</td></tr><tr><td>Local Enterprise Office LEAN for Micro - The LEO Lean4Micro offer was   developed in collaboration between the EI Lean department and the LEOs to tailor the EI Lean offer for LEO micro enterprise clients</td><td>221 LEO clients have participated in the programme</td></tr><tr><td>Local Enterprise Office Mentoring</td><td>471 mentoring participants solely focused on Brexit</td></tr><tr><td>Local Enterprise Office Brexit Seminars/Events </td><td>3,996 Participants at the Brexit Information events</td></tr><tr><td>InterTradeIreland Brexit Advisory Service</td><td>1,092 SMEs have directly engaged with the Brexit Advisory Service in 2019.

In many cases, medication plays an important part in helping the patient to deal with mental health issues.  At the same time, it is necessary to ensure that alternatives, such as talk therapies, are available where needed.</p>  <p>  The HSE provides a comprehensive range of community-based mental health services. It is committed to the provision of a person-centred approach to the care for each patient. It provides evidence-based psychological interventions that are delivered through Primary Care and where necessary through specialist mental health services. The recruitment of 20 Psychologists and 114 Assistant Psychologists to Primary Care services last year is expected to alleviate capacity issues within mental health specialist services.</p>  <p>  Interventions are tailored to each patient&rsquo;s individual needs and can include a broad range of interventions that may include psychopharmacological treatments and various forms of psychotherapy including those which have their roots in cognitive behavioural therapies, systemic therapies and psychodynamic therapies. </p>  <p>  The Department of Health is working with the HSE to explore the increased use of digital technologies and early intervention services are being introduced. These include tele-psych facilities, which will provide increased talk therapies to patients within the primary care setting and directly to their digital device as is proven to be the preference of many teens and adolescents. </p>  <p>  In recognition of the importance of mental health, the Government increased the mental health allocation for 2019 to nearly &euro;1 billion. The overall HSE Mental Health Budget has been increased by &euro;276 million, or 39%, since 2012. Budget 2019 allocated an additional &euro;55 million to progress new developments in mental health this year. &euro;3 million of the new development funding is being used to develop resilience and early intervention programmes. The HSE will work with sports, community and voluntary groups to ensure that services are delivered at community level, where required. </p>  <p>  In addition, the HSE Medicines Management Programme has Prescribing Tips and Tools information cards for a number of anti-depressants and are available on their website for all prescribers to access.</p>  <p>  In conclusion, I am satisfied that the HSE is exploring different types of treatments while employing the most appropriate for each individual patient.</p></reply>

The recent Budget provided an additional &euro;55 million to progress new developments in mental health which brings overall HSE mental health funding to nearly &euro;1 billion in 2019. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the number of referrals to CAMHS increased from around 12,800 referrals received in 2011 to around 18,100 referrals expected in 2019. Cases assessed by professionals as urgent are seen as a matter of priority.</p>  <p>  The total number of children on CAMHS Waiting List was 2,523 at the end of January 2019. The HSE has prioritised reducing CAMHS waiting lists, particularly those over 12 months, which was 310 in January. </p>  <p>  There are now 70 CAMHS teams, and 3 Paediatric Liaison Teams. All aspects of CAMHS nationally are being improved by the HSE under its annual Service Plans. This includes better out-of-hours and 7/7 day cover, progression of Day Hospital care, developing specialist teams such as Eating Disorders, and improved Prevention and Early Intervention services.</p>  <p>  In conjunction with the Department of Health and the HSE, I am progressing various initiatives to enhance CAMHS, and also to adopt a wider approach around Prevention and Early Intervention measures, designed to alleviate pressures on the specialist CAMHS service.  These include maximising the impact of the additional Primary Care Assistant Psychologists recruited in 2018 to relieve pressures on CAMHS; roll-out by the HSE of various e-mental health pilot projects; additional Mental Health Nurse training places coming on-stream to help fill existing vacancies; and a review of CAMHS under the refresh of A Vision for Change. </p>  <p>  There is regular monitoring of CAMHS activity and staffing data by the Department of Health in conjunction with the HSE.  In addition, I have held meetings with, and sought further information from, the Chief Officers and Executive Clinical Directors of the CHOs specifically on CAMHS vacancies, with a view to improving the rate of recruitment for CAMHS staff.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.</p>  <p>  The Report of the NHSS Review published in 2015 identified a number of issues for more detailed consideration, including a review of the pricing mechanism used by the NTPF, with a view to:</p>  <p>  - Ensuring value for money and economy, with the lowest possible administrative costs for clients and the State and administrative burden for providers;</p>  <p>  -  Increasing the transparency of the pricing mechanism so that existing and potential investors can make as informed decisions as possible; and</p>  <p>  - Ensuring that there is adequate residential capacity for those residents with more complex needs.</p>  <p>  A Steering Group was established to oversee and manage the pricing review. The Steering Group is chaired by the NTPF and includes representatives from the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER). As part of its work on the review the NTPF sought various inputs including external expertise and stakeholder engagement to inform the review. These inputs are being considered in detail. </p>  <p>  I understand that the NTPF is now close to completing the report and it is expected that the Steering Group will be provided with a final draft very shortly. Once complete the report of the review will then be submitted to the Department of Health.</p>  <p>  It is recognised that any change to any part of the Scheme must be considered in terms of the short- and long-term impact on the viability of the Scheme and accessibility of long-term residential care in general. It is therefore important that the relevant issues are considered thoroughly through the review process.</p></reply>

Extending the HPV vaccine to boys will provide direct protection against HPV-related disease to boys.  It also provides indirect herd protection to girls who have not been vaccinated.  Another important factor includes the additional protection provided by a gender-neutral programme to vulnerable groups (for example, men who have sex with men). </p>  <p>  The HSE National Immunisation Office are currently working towards preparing a gender-neutral HPV programme.

The size, complexity and specialist nature of the new children's hospital project informed the decision by the NPHDB to adopt a two-stage procurement process comprised of:</p>  <p>  Procurement Stage 1: A full tender and contract for Phase A (below ground including basement works) on the basis of a detailed design with the tendering of Phase B (the main above ground works) on a Preliminary 1st stage design with an approximate and remeasurable bill of quantities reflecting the Preliminary 1st stage design. Contract Awarded to main and specialists contractor 3rd August 2017. </p>  <p>  Procurement Stage 2: While the basement Phase A works were under construction, the 2nd stage detailed design for the above ground Phase B works was completed with a full bill of quantities priced at the 1st stage Preliminary design tendered rates. Phase B works instructed 8 January 2019. </p>  <p>  That procurement approach resulted in estimated 2-year saving in total project delivery time, and brought issues on cost to the fore, and to be resolved, much earlier in the life of the project than is the case where traditional procurement approaches are deployed.    </p>  <p>  Following completion of the second stage of the two-stage tender procurement process in November 2018, the capital build cost of the project is now at &euro;1.433b.  There is also additional investment from other sources associated with broader programme which is outside of these capital costs. This relates to investment in ICT and the Electronic Health Record rollout funded through the ICT capital programme,  the comprehensive Children's Hospital Integration Programme which is well underway, funded through revenue, to ensure the successful clinical and operational merging of three paediatric hospitals, pre-2013 project expenditure relating to the former Mater project, and the planned construction of the Children&rsquo;s Research and Innovation Centre to be funded through philanthropic funding.</p>  <p>  In relation to cost certainty , the Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) procurement process agreed with the contractors requires the contractors to take all risk for quantities following completion of the GMP process, and, as per the contract, limits their recovery of additional costs incurred by them to clearly defined scope changes, in excess of 4% inflation (as per the average of three published tender price indices) which may occur post July 2019 and changes in legislation (e.g. VAT, PRSI, statutory labour rates, building regulations). Other than in respect of exclusions, the GMP ceiling cannot be exceeded with any amount in excess not recoverable by contractors. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, in light of the concerns over the major and sudden cost escalation associated with the finalisation of the GMP, Government also approved the commissioning of an independent review of the escalation in cost at the same time. As part of its Terms of Reference, the review will comment on the major residual risks and the robustness/completeness of the current forecasts and, where possible, quantify those risks contractually excluded from the GMP/adjusted contract sum.</p></reply>

Enhanced supports for rural GP practices have also been introduced. 257 GP practice units encompassing 347 individual GPs are now in receipt of financial supports under this framework, a significant increase on the 167 GPs who received a rural practice allowance prior to the introduction of this measure.  These steps should help to address the future demand for GPs by enticing GPs who may have ceased practicing for family or other reasons back into the workforce, facilitating GPs to work past the standard retirement age and encouraging more GPs to work in rural areas.</p>  <p>  There has been a huge expansion in the number of training places on GP training programmes in recent years.  In 2009, there were 120 GP training places available and in 2018 193 places were filled, an increase of around 60% over this nine year period.</p>  <p>  It is acknowledged that there are many challenges in general practice.  That is why Government remains committed to engaging with GP representatives on the development of a package of measures and reforms to modernise the current GMS contract.  </p>  <p>  Talks between the Department of Health, the HSE and the Irish Medical Organisation are continuing. Agreement on the delivery of these service improvements and contractual reforms has the potential to facilitate a substantial increase in the resourcing of general practice on a multiannual basis.</p></reply>

Analysis of future scenarios (based on demographic projections and taking account of envisaged reform measures) shows potential requirements for the period to 2031. </p>  <p>  On the back of these findings, the Government committed to introducing health reforms and providing capital funding for an 4,500 additional short and long term residential care beds over the ten years of the National Development Plan (NDP). It is important to recognise that the NDP and implementing Sl&aacute;intecare are long-term plans. Many proposals for additional service capacity are at an early stage and, as with all proposed developments, will require further appraisal, planning, design and tender before a firm timeline or funding required can be established.  </p>  <p>  In relation to public nursing homes which provide a combination of long and short-stay beds, capital plans are in place to provide for the replacement/refurbishment of up to 90 units nationally. This programme of investment proposes to deliver up to 215 additional beds in centres being built or refurbished in locations identified as having particular capacity issues.</p></reply>

They play a significant role in stimulating price competition and provide an alternative market outlet for farmers.  My Department facilitates this trade, recognising its critical importance to the agri-sector, while ensuring that live animal exports meet the highest welfare standards.</p>  <p>  In 2017, I reduced the veterinary inspection fee payable on live exports of calves less than three months of age to &euro;1.20 per animal. This brought greater equity in the fees payable for calves, weanlings and adult cattle and gave an important boost to the trade.  A significant increase in live calf exports resulted in the number of calf exports reaching 159,000 in 2018.</p>  <p>  Other initiatives in developing the international export market include the issuing of new health certificates for the export of cattle to Libya which were agreed in November 2018.  This increases the range of cattle that can be exported there.  My Department is also engaging with the Egyptian authorities to secure the finalisation of agreement on health certificates for the export of fattening, slaughter and breeding cattle. </p>  <p>  I have extended an invitation to my Algerian counterpart to visit Ireland in early 2019. This follows earlier contact with Algeria, in an effort to reach agreement on revised and separate slaughter, fattening and breeding certificates.  Furthermore, following my visit to Turkey last week, I am confident that consideration will be given to the reopening of the live export market to Irish cattle by the Turkish authorities.</p>  <p>  My Department officials are in on-going communication with the Irish exporters with regard to the need for co-operative management between each other to ensure that the lairage capacity at Cherbourg is optimised.  I had a recent meeting with the exporters where these issues were discussed.  I have also met with farming organisations in recent weeks on the issues.  The provision of additional facilities depends on commercial decisions by private industry.  </p>  <p>  I welcome the recent approval by the French Authorities of an increase in the holding capacity of one of the lairages at Cherbourg.  This additional capacity of 400 places is an important boost for Irish calf exports to Continental Europe.</p></reply>

This involved the amalgamation of a multiplicity of legal texts into a single law with the aim of supporting the EU livestock sector in terms of competitiveness, food safety and ease of trade.  The Animal Health Law is a key output of the EU animal health strategy &lsquo;Prevention is Better Than The Cure&rsquo;.</p>  <p>  Under the Animal Health Law, several Delegated Acts have been drafted by the Commission, and a consultation process has been undertaken with Member States.  One of the Delegated Acts sets out the legislative framework for disease eradication programmes throughout the European Union including specifically that for bovine TB.</p>  <p>  The Delegated Acts dealing with TB and Animal Movement (to become operational in April 2021) have not been finalised, and are still undergoing scrutiny at Commission level. Ireland is continuing to engage with the Commission on this matter.  It is anticipated that a public consultation process on the Act will be undertaken circa April 2019. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-03-13a.709.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019031300081#WRV02600"><p>At the outset, I would like to point out that in discussing the funding of the Common Agricultural Policy, we should bear in mind that this funding forms part of a broader EU budget which is negotiated by Finance Ministers and then agreed by Heads of State and Government at the European Council.</p>  <p>  The European Commission has proposed, as part of the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) 2021-2027, that funding for the Common Agricultural Policy should be set at &euro;365 billion.  This equates to a cut of approximately 5% to the CAP budget in the next MFF period of 2021 - 2027.  I have previously stated that the proposed cut is unacceptable for Ireland.  The retention of an adequate budget for the CAP post-2020 is a key priority for Ireland. </p>  <p>  Negotiations on the MFF proposals have commenced and are running in parallel to the CAP post-2020 negotiations. The European Commission's intention is to reach overall agreement on the MFF before the European Parliamentary elections in 2019.  </p>  <p>  The MFF is a critical matter for all Member States and its agreement requires unanimity at the EU Council.  It is clear that there are divergent views among Member States on the appropriate level for the budget.  While some Member States (including Ireland) have indicated their willingness to increase their contributions, once they contribute towards areas of added European value, there are others who feel equally strongly that the current proposals, such as they are, are too costly.  </p>  <p>  The departure of the UK from the EU further compounds the budgetary issue, with some &euro;12 billion per annum in UK net contributions being removed from the budget post-2020.  Against this background, agreeing the MFF will make these negotiations a particularly challenging task.</p>  <p>  The new CAP proposals point to a more significant environmental ambition than the current CAP schemes, including in Pillar I. It is a new departure for Member States that they will be required to design a specific climate and environment scheme in Pillar I. This is something that I support as it is consistent with my Department's long term strategy for the agriculture sector, which recognises the critical importance of environmental sustainability.  I believe that protecting the environment and the sustainable development of agriculture are two sides of the same coin.</p>  <p>  I believe that farmers play a vital role in the provision of public goods and need to be adequately recognised and recompensed for this role.  It is important that the overall level of the budget acknowledges the public goods being delivered from farmers.  </p>  <p>  I continue to work towards building consensus among my agriculture colleagues in Europe with regard to maintaining the CAP budget.  I co-signed a Joint Memorandum in Madrid in May last year, which calls for the CAP budget to be retained at current levels for the EU 27 post-2020.  The memorandum has been supported by up to 20 other EU Agriculture Ministers.  We will continue to work together on this issue as the negotiations for the CAP post 2020 and its budgetary allocations progress.</p>  <p>  I have also sought to continue this work as part of ongoing bilateral meetings.  Since May 2018, my colleague Minister Doyle and I have met initially with the EU Agri Ministers from Germany, France, Belgium, Denmark, Finland and Hungary, inter alia to support a strong CAP Budget after 2020. I have also met with Ministers from the Netherlands, Estonia, Belgium, Poland, Luxembourg, and Austria, and my officials engage regularly with counterparts in other Member States on this issue. </p>  <p>  Ireland needs to work closely with its EU colleagues to build a consensus around the need to reverse the proposed cuts in CAP.  I would like to reassure the deputy that I will continue to do this, and to fight for a strong CAP budget as the negotiations progress.</p></reply>

Under this Scheme, &euro;12.5 million was paid to approximately 1,300 young farmers in 2018.</p>  <p>  There are also a number of national taxation measures specifically aimed at young farmers, specifically &lsquo;100% Stock Relief on Income Tax for Certain Young Trained Farmers&rsquo; and &lsquo;Stamp Duty Exemption on Transfers of Land to Young Trained Farmers&rsquo;.  The Agri-taxation Review set out the main policy objectives for continuing support to the sector through agri-taxation measures including: </p>  <p>  - Increasing land mobility and the productive use of land; allowing young farmers and new entrants to the sector gain access to land by providing a cheaper means of long-term access to land, as opposed to the relatively high cost of land purchase. </p>  <p>  - Assisting succession and the transfer of farms, which continues to be a central part of the Government&rsquo;s agri-taxation policy. Agricultural Relief from Capital Acquisitions Tax, Retirement Relief from Capital Acquisitions Tax, Retirement Relief from Capital Gains Tax and the stamp duty exemptions on the transfer of land all facilitate the early inter-generational transfer of farms.</p>  <p>   In addition, in 2017 I launched the 'Succession Farm Partnership Scheme'. This provides for a &euro;25,000 tax credit over five years to further assist with the transfer of farms within a partnership structure, promoting and supporting the earlier intergenerational transfer of family farms. This scheme also encourages important conversations within farm families regarding succession planning.  </p>  <p>  Teagasc&rsquo;s recent publication &ldquo;Teagasc Education Vision &ndash; meeting future needs&rdquo; outlines the importance of education for young farmers and the development of their skills through education and training. This core function of Teagasc is supported and funded by my Department.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, supporting young farmers and generational renewal continues to be a priority and will form an important part of the CAP post-2020.  My Department and I are actively engaging with other Member States and the EU on these issues during the current negotiations on new CAP proposals.</p></reply>

It filled a very well recognised role in farm management training. Following on from recommendations of the report of the Taskforce on Agricultural Education and Training (2000), the Farm Apprenticeship Scheme was incorporated into Teagasc education structures. The Scheme was discontinued in the early 2000&rsquo;s following a decline in overall enrolments in agricultural education. As such, there are currently no recognised apprenticeships in place in agriculture other than a long-established craft apprenticeship in agricultural mechanics</p><p>The development of &lsquo;new&rsquo; apprenticeship programmes and awards is governed by the requirements set out by the Apprenticeship Council in conjunction with SOLAS, the Higher Education Authority and Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI). </p><p>Key requirements for new national apprenticeships are that they: </p><p>- are industry led;  </p><p>- are of at least two years&rsquo; duration; </p><p>- contain a minimum of 50% on-the-job training; </p><p>- prepare apprentices to work autonomously and competently in a specific occupation; </p><p>- involve a Contract of Apprenticeship; </p><p>- provide a salary for the duration of the  apprenticeship (on-the-job and off-the-job).</p><p>In response to calls for new apprenticeship proposals in the agricultural sector, Teagasc on behalf of industry stakeholders, submitted five apprenticeship proposals to the Apprenticeship Council in the following areas. </p><p>- Farm Technician (Level 6) </p><p>- Farm Manager (Level 7) </p><p>- Assistant Stud Farm Manager (Level 7) </p><p>- Applied Horticulturalist (Level 6) </p><p>- Sports Turf Technician (Level 6)</p><p>The development of each individual apprenticeship is being overseen by an industry-based consortium group. The Apprenticeship Council has approved the occupational profiles developed for each of the apprenticeships. The next step in the process is to have the proposed education programmes individually validated by QQI, which is a detailed process in its own right. The validation process is likely to extend into 2020. </p><p>Apprenticeships are just one piece of the jigsaw in addressing education and training requirements in the agricultural sector. In 2018, more than 7,000 learners participated in Teagasc school leaver, adult vocational education and training programmes and higher education programmes delivered with the Universities and Institutes&rsquo; of Technology. Teagasc also provide short courses and continuous professional development courses for famers and agri-food industry personnel. Typically, 2,000 - 3,000 participate annually, but this may be substantially higher in a given year. </p></reply>

In total, over 95,000 farmers receive a payment under the Scheme each year.  In estimating the administrative cost related to the administration of the scheme and the current appeals process,  a total staff cost has been calculated taking into account staff salaries, employers PRSI contributions, pension contributions and standard accommodation overheads.   This is in line with the procedures set out in the Public Spending Code for such costings.  </p>  <p>  The total administrative costs on this basis is &euro;1.656m.

As part of my 2019 Trade Mission schedule, I plan to lead a Government agri-food trade mission to Japan and South Korea in June. </p>  <p>   Given that Free Trade Agreements between the EU and Japan and South Korea are now in place, it is an opportune time to build on the trade mission that I led to those countries in November 2017 and to again highlight Ireland as a source of high quality and safe agri-food, including dairy products, beef, sheepmeat, pigmeat, poultry, drinks, seafood, food ingredients and beverages.</p>  <p>   As part of its market prioritisation exercise, Bord Bia has identified both countries among those that present trade opportunities for Ireland. Indeed, Bord Bia will be opening an office in Tokyo and has also received EU funding to promote beef and pigmeat to South Korea.</p>  <p>   Japan is the world&rsquo;s third largest economy and one of the largest meat importers globally. It is already Ireland&rsquo;s third most import trade destination in Asia, with &euro;114m worth of agri-food produce exported there in 2018. This was a large increase on the &euro;56m worth of product exported in 2016. The main driver behind this increase is pigmeat (&euro;41m in exports in 2018, compared to &euro;14m in 2016). In fact, Japan is the fifth most important destination for Irish pig meat globally. Other notable areas are dairy produce (&euro;40m in exports in 2018 compared with &euro;15m in 2016) and fish (&euro;14.3m).</p>  <p>   I also see great opportunities in South Korea, particularly given that it is already an important destination for pigmeat &amp;amp; seafood exports, with nearly &euro;14m in each category in 2018. Of course I will use the visit to meet with the Korean authorities as part of our determined effort to secure market access for Irish beef.</p>  <p>   I have no doubt that this trade mission will be very valuable in both promoting Irish food and drink exports and in further developing relationships at political and official level. My experience has been that such contacts are central to Ireland&rsquo;s efforts to gain new market access, and to developing existing levels of access where these have been secured. </p></reply>

They play a significant role in stimulating price competition and provide an alternative market outlet for farmers.  My Department facilitates this trade, recognising its critical importance to the agri sector, while ensuring that live animal exports meet the highest welfare standards.  I continue to prioritise efforts to gain access to new third country markets and, equally importantly, to deepen existing markets for live exports.  </p>  <p>   Since 2016, more than 60,000 Irish cattle have been exported to Turkey.  The stringent system of animal health and welfare controls operated by my Department on the sea journey to Turkey ensures that Irish cattle arrive in excellent condition, a point acknowledged by the Turkish authorities.</p>  <p>   I visited Turkey last week to meet with my Turkish counterpart, Dr Bekir Pakdemirli, Minister for Agriculture and Forestry.  We discussed existing and future opportunities for technical cooperation and trade in agri-food products between Ireland and Turkey. I impressed upon Minister Pakdemirli the importance of the Turkish market for Irish livestock and our desire to re-establish trade as soon as possible.   </p>  <p>   I now have a clearer understanding for the reasons behind the Turkish Government&rsquo;s decision to suspend the issuing of new import licenses in late 2018. There are obvious concerns in Turkey regarding over supply in the beef market, a matter which Minister Pakdemirli is determined to address. I am pleased that the Minister indicated his intention to consider the re-opening of the market in the second half of 2019.  I assured him that there is significant interest from industry in resuming that trade.</p>  <p>  We agreed that our officials would continue to explore opportunities for future cooperation and a visit by a Turkish technical team, including officials from the Ministry of Agriculture and ESK (the Turkish Meat and Milk Board) is planned for this summer.</p></reply>

Following an extensive public consultation process,  I announced in December that vessels over 18m will be excluded from trawling in inshore waters inside the six nautical mile zone and the baselines from 1 January 2020.  Trawling for sprat by vessels over 18m will be phased out by 31 December 2021. </p>  <p>   Based on my assessment, I considered that there was a compelling case for excluding trawling by large vessels in coastal waters inside six nautical miles.  In environmental terms, large vessels trawling can have a significant impact both on fish stocks and on important coastal marine environments.  Excluding trawling by large vessels in coastal waters inside six nautical miles will provide wider ecosystem benefit, including for nursery areas and juvenile fish stocks.  Small scale and island fishermen strongly rely on inshore waters and I am very conscious of  the benefits this change will bring for these fishermen. </p>  <p>   As Minister, I have responsibility for policy in relation to sea-fishing boat licensing.   </p>  <p>   On March 5th last, I issued Ministerial Policy Directive 1 of 2019 to the Registrar General of Fishing Boats under Section 3 of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 2003, as amended by Section 99 of the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006, to give effect to these measures.  This Policy Directive is intended to give effect to the measures I recently announced in relation to trawling activity (that is operating trawl or seine nets) inside the six nautical mile zone and inside the baselines.

Charging at home at night is the most cost-effective and eco-friendly way to charge an electric vehicle. Given the high proportion of homes with driveways and dedicated parking spaces, Ireland has greater capacity for home charging than many other countries. A Government grant of up to &euro;600 is available, via the SEAI, to the purchasers of new and second-hand electric vehicles to support the installation of home chargers. </p><p>The majority of the existing network of publicly accessible charge points was rolled out by the ESB through its eCars programme. A real-time map showing the charge points, including the status and availability of the charge points, is available on the ESB's website at<i>www.esb.ie/ecars</i>. The management of these charge points is an operational matter for the ESB. </p><p>The table, provided to my Department by ESB eCars, sets out the number of publicly available standard charge points and fast chargers on the eCars network in each county. <table><tr><th>County</th><th>Standard Charge Points </th><th>Fast Chargers</th></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>26</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>10</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim</td><td>6</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>20</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td>20</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>16</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>28</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td>10</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td>10</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>10</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>22</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>24</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>160</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>28</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td>14</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td>16</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>26</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>12</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>26</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>14</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td>16</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>24</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>16</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>26</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>58</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>28</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>666</td><td>78</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Under the scheme Government is funding up to 50% of the total capital and project management costs for homes that achieve an A3 Building Energy Rating post retrofit. This will inform a model that could make deep retrofit available to homeowners on a larger scale post 2020, and will help Ireland move away from fossil fuels to clean renewable heating systems, such as solar and heat pumps.</p>  <p>  To date, a total of 229 homes have been upgraded with a spend of &euro;5.96m under the Deep Retrofit Pilot scheme. Of these, 211 houses were upgraded in 2018 with a spend of &euro;4.72m. The scheme operates on a milestone basis, with milestone payments being made at 25%, 50% and 90% completion. 10% of the payment is retained until 12 months post works and is paid on submission of the first year&rsquo;s post-works data. Each homeowner also signs up to providing SEAI with data on their energy usage for 3 years post retrofit. </p></reply>

In that regard, I refer you to the AAIU website www.AAIU.ie where you can find the Interim Statement that was released by the AAIU on the 1 March 2019. In addition, I can confirm that the points of contact for each of the four affected families were made aware of the AAIU position prior to public release of the Interim Statement.</p>  <p>  As previously stated, the AAIU is the national Safety Investigation Authority for aviation accidents and incidents and while it is located within my Department, it functions independently of me and my Department. Regulations provide for investigations to be held in private, and are confidential. The sole purpose of such Investigations is the prevention of future accidents and incidents and not to apportion blame or liability.</p>  <p>  Whilst I understand the on-going public interest in this matter, it is vital that the AAIU is given the time and space to follow due process, complete its work and report on its findings. As the AAIU is independent in the conduct of its investigations, it would be inappropriate for me to become involved in individual investigations. As such, I am not in a position to directly comment further on the AAIU investigation of R116.</p></reply>

Legislation in the Road Traffic Acts allows for the recognition of foreign driving licences for exchange purposes.

This directive sets minimum driving test standards, training and quality assurance for driver testers. Testers have to undergo continuous monitoring of the application of Driving Test Standards, by way of regular and ongoing supervision.</p>  <p>  A Driving instructor's opinion of a learner driver's competency is only that - an opinion. Regardless of the experience or capability of an instructor, one instructor's opinion may differ greatly than another. An effective driving test provides learner drivers with a consistent evaluation process which ensures that candidates have attained a sufficient level of competency to drive unaccompanied. If a candidate's nervousness is of such a level that it adversely affects their driving test, they may not be ready to sit the test and may require further instruction. </p>  <p>  The RSA has a Quality Assurance Policy which ensures that the practical driving test experience is of a consistent high quality, regardless of where it is carried out or who carries it out, and always produces valid and reliable results. A key element of this Policy is the continuous monitoring of the application of Driving Test Standards. This is done by way of regular and ongoing supervision which is in compliance with the Directive.</p></reply>

As part of contingency preparations for the possibility of a no-deal Brexit, my Department has maintained frequent contact with the MIBI over the past few months.</p>  <p>  A green card is a document which acts as proof of motor insurance when travelling internationally.  The system predates the European Union, and covers 48 states, including all EU Member States.  Under the EU Motor Insurance Directive, green cards are not required for travel within the EU.  However, if the UK leaves the EU without a deal in place the default position is that green cards will be required for EU-registered vehicles entering the UK and for UK-registered vehicles entering the EU.  </p>  <p>  The EU Commission has to power to set a date from which green cards for vehicles entering the EU from any particular third country will not be required, if so requested by the National Motor Insurers Bureaux of all the member states.  Such as request has been with the Commission in respect of the UK since November 2018, but the Commission has yet to issue a decision.  My Department has engaged with the Commission asking them to reach a decision, and will continue to do so.</p>  <p>  The MIBI has now issued approximately 1 million Green Cards to insurance companies and brokers.  The MIBI has also engaged extensively in public information campaigns about this matter.  </p>  <p>  While we would all prefer a negotiated departure of the UK from the EU, it is prudent to plan for the alternative.  The MIBI deserves to be commended for the way in which it has been engaging for months in advance to prepare for the contingency that green cards may be needed. </p></reply>

Unfortunately, this means that many services that submit high quality applications ultimately do not receive an offer of funding because the budget is not there to facilitate this. </p>  <p>  As a means to address this, the 2019 Early Learning and Care and School Age Capital applicant guidelines, released on 31 January 2019, introduced a rule that clearly states that early learning and care services who have received funding under the equivalent strand of EY Capital (i.e. Creation of New EY Places) between 2016 and 2018, are not eligible to apply under Strand A (Creation of new places for 0-3 year olds) in 2019. </p>  <p>  One of the benefits of the introduction of this rule is that capital funding can be distributed around as wide a range of services as possible over a four-year cycle.</p>  <p>  In the interest of fairness and equity, this rule must apply to all services without exception.</p>  <p>  It is noted that the service in question received a capital grant under Strand 1 in 2016. This funding was made available to providers in order to facilitate an increase in childcare places from September 2016. In the case of the service in question, this funding resulted in an increase of 11 ECCE places, as stated by them in their application at the time. </p>  <p>  However, there is no rule precluding this service from applying under Strands B and C in 2019. Despite their disappointment at their ineligibility for Strand A this year, I hope they are satisfied that the two other streams of funding under the 2019 Capital schemes are still open to them.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-03-13a.831.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019031300086#WRAA01800"><p>The 2019 Early Learning and Care and School Age Capital applicant guidelines, released on 31 January 2019, clearly state that early learning and care services who have received funding under the equivalent strand of EY Capital (i.e. Creation of New EY Places) between 2016 and 2018, are not eligible to apply under Strand A (Creation of new places for 0-3 year olds) in 2019.</p>  <p>  The capital programmes have been significantly oversubscribed in recent years, with demand for funding far outstripping the available budget. Unfortunately, this means that many services that submit high quality applications ultimately do not receive an offer of funding because the budget is not there to facilitate this. One of the benefits of the introduction of this rule is that capital funding can be distributed around as wide a range of services as possible over a four-year cycle.</p>  <p>  In the interest of fairness and equity, this rule must apply to all services without exception.</p>  <p>  It is noted that the service in question received a capital grant under Strand 1 in 2016. This funding was made available to providers in order to facilitate an increase in childcare places from September 2016. In the case of the service in question, this funding resulted in an increase of 22 ECCE places, as stated by them in their application at the time. </p>  <p>  However, there is no rule precluding this service from applying under Strands B and C in 2019.

In recent months, in the course of deliberations over revisiting the provisions relating to privacy in the Bill, I have considered the  views expressed in relevant reports and debates on this matter by advocacy groups and by members of the Oireachtas. I have also considered the many representations made to me by members of the public and by stakeholders generally. </p>  <p>    Some of these groups and individuals have expressed concerns about specific aspects of the Bill, and in particular, the requirement for adopted people to sign an undertaking declaring that they would not contact their birth parent and the absence of a provision for the release of birth certificates.</p>  <p>  Having listened to these concerns, I engaged again with the Office of the Attorney General seeking to revisit the privacy provisions and strengthen the right to identity. As the Deputy will be aware, I recently secured Government approval to draft amendments to revise these provisions in the Bill.  </p>  <p>  Once these amendments are finalised, it is my intention to progress to Committee Stage of the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill 2016 in Seanad &Eacute;ireann as soon as possible.</p></reply>

In that context, support for the works outlined by the Deputy could potentially be considered eligible for LEADER funding.</p><p>In order for a project to be eligible for funding under LEADER, it must be compatible with the actions outlined in the approved Local Development Strategy in the LEADER sub-regional area concerned, and it must comply with the Operating Rules and EU Regulations in place for the programme. </p><p>The decision to approve a project, or otherwise, is a matter for the Local Action Groups (LAGs) which administer the programme in each LEADER area.  Interested applicants should, in the first instance, contact the relevant LAG through its Implementing Partners to discuss the funding that may be available.  Contact details for Implementing Partners under LEADER are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at: <i></i>.</p></reply>

The payment continues to be paid in respect of children up to their 18th birthday who are in full-time education, or who have a disability.  Child Benefit is currently paid to almost 622,900 families in respect of almost 1.2 million children, with expenditure of more than &euro;2 billion in 2018. </p>  <p>  The rules for determining the person with whom a child resides for the purposes of the payment of child benefit are set out in Article 159 of the Social Welfare (Consolidated Claims, Payments and Control) Regulations 2007 (S.I. No. 142 of 2007).  These rules were amended in 2007 by the Social Welfare (Consolidated Claims, Payments and Control) (Amendment) Regulations 2007 (S.I. No. 859 of 2007).</p>  <p>  These amending regulations contain an additional rule, which provides that where a child is placed in foster care, or with a relative by the HSE, payment of child benefit will transfer to the foster parent after a period of six months of foster care.  The rationale behind this change is that the purpose of child benefit is to assist toward the ongoing cost of child rearing.  However, when introducing the change, it was considered inappropriate to withdraw payment from a parent in respect of short periods of foster care.  Furthermore, it was recognised that the immediate withdrawal of child benefit may have an adverse financial effect on the mother who may, regardless of the duration of the foster care, maintain some level of contact with the child. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that discussions with the Health Service Executive and the Irish Foster Care Association at the time of the making of these Regulations, established that the HSE considers the vast majority of foster care arrangements to be short-term placements.  I understand from my Department that in view of this and in light of the fact that legislating for all possible scenarios would be impractical, it was decided that six months represents a reasonable &lsquo;lead-in&rsquo; time before the transfer of child benefit.   </p>  <p>  While these arrangements are kept under constant review, any changes to the payment of child benefit to foster parents would have to be considered in the overall budgetary context. </p></reply>

These payments are being reviewed under a new Total Contributions Approach (TCA) to pension calculation which includes provision for homecaring periods.</p>  <p>  The legislation introduced provides for the new homecaring periods and calculation method.  The qualifying conditions for the state pension (contributory) scheme have not changed.  For example, a minimum requirement of 520 paid social insurance contributions remains a condition of the scheme.</p>  <p>  The Government intends to introduce a Total Contributions Approach (TCA) to establishing the level of entitlement for all new state pension contributory claims from 2020 onwards (TCA2020).</p>  <p>  I launched a public consultation on the design of the full TCA to be introduced from 2020 on 28th May 2018 to which a wide variety of stakeholder groups were invited.  A number of workshops were also held on the day to elicit views and feedback.  All Oireachtas members were invited to a detailed briefing in Leinster House by my officials shortly afterwards.  The consultation was open for over three months and the Department received almost 300 responses from individuals and organisations.  Those submissions outlined the views of respondents on a number of issues, including the number of years required for a full pension, as intended as part of the consultation process.</p>  <p>  I intend to bring a proposal to Government, setting out the proposed details of the scheme, having considered the outcome of the consultation.  When the Government has agreed the approach to be taken, I will initiate the work required to introduce this reform, including the necessary legislation and systems development.</p>  <p>  People will be informed of the details of the scheme as soon as possible, following the Government decision.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The review is addressing a number of key aspects including sound or noise, visual amenity setback distances, shadow flicker, community obligation, community dividend and grid connections. </p>  <p>  As part of the overall review, a strategic environmental assessment (SEA) is being undertaken on the revised Guidelines before they come into effect, in accordance with the requirements of EU Directive 2001/24/EC on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment, otherwise known as the SEA Directive. </p>  <p>  SEA is a process by which environmental considerations are required to be fully integrated into the preparation of plans and programmes which act as frameworks for development consent, prior to their final adoption, with public consultation as part of that process.  My Department appointed SEA experts in December 2017 to assist in this regard.  The recent publication of updated WHO noise standards had resulted in a delay in finalising the revised draft Guidelines. These revised draft guidelines were to be published in Quarter 1 2019. However, there have now been some delays to the planned schedule, due to the need to focus on certain Brexit-related planning issues. As part of the SEA process, there will be an 8 week public consultation on the revised draft Guidelines, together with the comprehensive environmental report with the aim of issuing the finalised Guidelines, following detailed analysis and consideration of the submissions and views received during the consultation phase, later in 2019.</p>  <p>  When finalised, the revised Guidelines will be issued under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.  Planning authorities and, where applicable, An Bord Plean&aacute;la must have regard to guidelines issued under Section 28 in the performance of their functions generally under the Planning Acts. In the meantime, the current 2006 Wind Energy Development Guidelines remain in force.</p></reply>

Proposals under consideration by the Working Group have been aimed at facilitating short-term letting of accommodation within permanent residences, known as homesharing, while protecting the existing stock of residential property in areas of high demand.</p>  <p>  Having considered the Working Group's report as well as the recommendations in the report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government on short-term lettings, I announced plans to introduce a &ldquo;one host, one home&rdquo; model in areas where there is high housing demand. </p>  <p>  Under the proposed new arrangements, homesharing will continue to be permissible for a person&rsquo;s primary residence. In addition, an annual cap of 90 days will apply for the renting out on a short-term basis of a person's entire home where it is their primary residence, with such short-term lets being restricted to periods of 14 days or less at a time.  Under these arrangements, people who wish to avail of the proposed new planning exemptions to use their own home for home-sharing or limited short-term letting purposes will be required to register this with their local planning authority.</p>  <p>  Where a person owns a second property and intends to let it for short-term letting purposes, they will require planning permission to do so unless the property already has planning permission to be used for tourism or short-term letting purposes. Planning permission for a change of use to short-term letting can be sought and it will be up to each local planning authority to consider such applications, based on guidance that will issue from my Department, taking account of housing demand pressures in the area concerned and other relevant factors such as cumulative impacts.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that these proposed changes will not affect the operation of holiday homes as typically understood, or longer-term flexible lettings which are provided for those coming to Ireland under employment contracts. </p>  <p>  It is intended that the proposed new planning changes will come into effect on 1 June 2019. In addition to making revised exempted development planning regulations, which are being progressed, amendments to primary legislation will also be introduced which will underpin and strengthen the new proposals.  This element of the changes proposed is currently being developed and details will be published in due course.</p></reply>
