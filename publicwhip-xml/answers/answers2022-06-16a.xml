    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-06-16a.7.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022061600059#WRA00600"><p>I am aware that the general level of new lending interest rates in Ireland are higher than is the case in many other European countries. However, the price lenders charge for their loans is a commercial matter for individual lenders. As Minister for Finance I cannot determine the lending policies of individual banks including the interest rates they charge for loans including mortgages.   </p>  <p>  Despite this, it should also be noted that recent trends indicate that certain mortgage rates have been falling in Ireland. For example, the interest rates on new mortgages (excluding renegotiations) have fallen from 4.05% in December 2014 to 2.77% in April 2022.  (The average for the euro area in April 2022 was 1.59%, although rates varied considerable across countries). </p>  <p>  The weighted average interest rate on new fixed rate mortgage agreements stood at 2.59% in April 2022, down from a series high of 4.11% in December 2014. It is also worth noting that a significant portion of new mortgages &ndash; 82% in April 2022 - are now fixed rate mortgages and this will protect borrowers in the event of a rise in official and market interest rates at least for the period that the interest rate is fixed. There has also been a reduction in the interest rates charged on loans to SMEs and consumers over the same period.</p>  <p>  However, Irish mortgage and other loans can have different characteristics from those offered in other countries. For example, many Irish banks include incentives such as cash back offers, which reduce the effective Irish mortgage interest rate. Also Irish mortgages are generally not subject to upfront fees which are typically charged by banks in some other EU jurisdictions.</p>  <p>  There are also a number of important factors which will likely influence the interest rates charged on Irish mortgages. These include for example operational costs, certain structural factors as referenced above (such as incentives offered), as well as the fact that pricing will reflect: </p>  <p>  - credit risk and capital requirements which in Ireland are elevated due to historical loss experience; </p>  <p>  - the level of non-performing loans which is higher in Ireland relative to other European banks (as provisioning and capital requirements are higher for these loans to reflect their higher risk and this in turn results in higher credit and capital costs for the Irish banks); and</p>  <p>  - higher cost-to-income ratios which has been a characteristic of the Irish banking sector in recent years </p>  <p>  To support consumers when considering what mortgage option is best for them, the Central Bank introduced a number of increased protections for variable rate mortgage holders in 2017. The enhanced measures, which are provided for in an Addendum to the Consumer Protection Code 2012, require lenders to explain to borrowers how their variable interest rates have been set, including in the event of an increase. </p>  <p>  The measures also improve the level of information required to be provided to borrowers on variable rates about other mortgage products which could provide savings for the borrower and signpost the borrower to the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission's (CCPC) mortgage switching tool.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank also introduced additional changes to the Consumer Protection Code in 2019 to help consumers make savings on their mortgage repayments, provide additional protections to consumers who are eligible to switch, and facilitate mortgage switching through enhancing the transparency of the mortgage framework. </p>  <p>  Consumers can reduce average pricing in the mortgage market by availing of switching options to ensure that recent and potential future price reductions through increased competition pass through to the greatest number of customers possible. Indeed a Central Bank study estimated that three in every five &lsquo;eligible&rsquo; mortgages for principal dwelling homes stand to save over &euro;1,000 within the first year if they switch and &euro;10,000 over the remaining term. </p>  <p>  To conclude I appreciate that greater sustainable competition in the credit market will be of benefit to consumers and other borrowers.  Accordingly, the review of the retail banking market which is now underway in my Department will consider how the banking system can best support economic activity, assess competition and consumer choice in the market for banking services and consider options to further develop the mortgage market.</p></reply>

The National Remote Work Strategy aims to make remote work a permanent feature of the Irish working experience in a way that maximises the economic, social and environmental benefits. </p>  <p>  As part of the national remote working strategy: Making Remote Work, in 2021 the Tax Strategy Group (TSG) reviewed the tax arrangements for remote working in respect of both employees and employers. The TSG paper outlines the effects of Covid-19 on remote working in Ireland, provides an international comparison of remote working tax rules, sets out options for consideration with regard to enhancing the tax arrangements for both employers and employees in respect of remote work and evaluates those options in accordance with the Department of Finance Tax Expenditure Guidelines. The paper is published on the gov.ie website.</p>  <p>  The TSG paper noted that changes to the tax arrangements for remote working may give rise to issues of deadweight loss and economic inefficiencies, as well as equity issues in the personal income tax system. The paper also noted that in the context of a whole of Government policy to facilitate and support remote working, it may be considered appropriate to enhance or amend the current tax arrangements in order to underline and reinforce public policy decisions in this area. </p>  <p>  Taking these factors into consideration, as the Deputy will be aware, in the Finance Act 2021, were enhanced and formalised the tax arrangements for working from home in line with Government policy to facilitate and support remote working.  Accordingly, for the tax year 2022, an income tax deduction amounting to 30% of the cost of vouched expenses for electricity, heat and broadband in respect of those days spent working from home can be claimed by taxpayers. </p>  <p>  The amount of the relief will depend on the particular circumstances of the remote worker in terms of the level of costs incurred and their marginal tax rate. However, this measure provides some relief for those with additional expenses arising from working from home, and at the same time it ensures that the traditional burden of employer related costs are not transferred from the employer to the State and the wider body of taxpayers. </p>  <p>  There are no immediate plans to further increase the tax relief for working from home. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-06-16a.18.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022061600059#WRA01700"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 25 together.</p>  <p>Inflation picked up sharply over the course of the last year and in May stood at 8.3 per cent, a multi-decade high. Almost every advanced country in the world is in the same position, with euro area inflation reaching a record 8.1 per cent in May. </p>  <p>  The key driver behind the elevated level of inflation at present is the sharp rise in wholesale energy prices since the onset of the war in Ukraine. Looking ahead, increases in wholesale energy prices will continue to feed into higher energy inflation over the coming months. Pass-through price effects are expected in other sectors, such as food (via fertilisers and fuel costs) and consumer goods (via higher energy inputs). Indeed, the recent rise in core inflation suggests that inflationary pressures are becoming increasingly broad-based. </p>  <p>  The Government is acutely aware of the cost pressures currently facing households and businesses and has responded to help alleviate some of this burden.  On a cumulative basis, the Government has announced &euro;2.4 billion in cost of living measures since last October.  These measures include changes in tax and social welfare, the provision of an energy credit for households, a temporary reduction in the rate of VAT on the supply of gas and electricity and a reduction in the excise rate for petrol, diesel and marked gas oil. </p>  <p>  Whilst the Government will continue to work to minimise the fall-out on those who are least-equipped to respond, resources are limited and we cannot cushion all households and businesses from the entire impact of the current shock.  Furthermore, in calibrating how we respond to the current challenges, it is important that we strike the right balance and ensure that policy doesn&rsquo;t inadvertently add further inflationary pressures into the system. </p>  <p>  Finally, it is worth pointing out that monetary policy is the first line of defence against inflation.  In this context, the European Central Bank has indicated a tightening of policy in the coming months.  By slowing demand in the economy, this should help bring demand and supply back into balance, with positive implications for inflation. </p></reply>

In general, the Directive provides that all goods and services are liable to VAT at the standard rate unless they fall within Annex III of the Directive, in respect of which Member States may apply either one or two reduced rates of VAT. Ireland currently operates two reduced rates of VAT, 13.5% and 9%, as permitted by the Directive. Hotel and holiday accommodation is listed in Annex III of the Directive and, therefore, can be subject to VAT at a reduced rate.</p>  <p>  However, building materials are not included in the categories of goods and services on which the EU Directive allows a lower rate of VAT or an exemption to be applied, and so they are liable to VAT at the standard rate. By way of special derogation from the general rule though, Ireland is permitted to continue its long-standing practice of applying a reduced rate, currently 13.5%, to the supply of ready-to-pour concrete and certain concrete blocks but there are strict restrictions on this derogation, including that the rate cannot be reduced below 12%.  </p>  <p>  In addition, under the EU VAT Directive  the supply of construction services is liable to VAT at the standard rate generally across the EU but Ireland applies a 13.5% reduced rate of VAT to all construction services under a derogation from the EU VAT Directive, again subject to strict restrictions. The Deputy will be aware that this derogated rate also applies on sales of new homes. </p>  <p>  Following lengthy negotiations the new agreement on VAT rates that came into force in April allows Ireland to maintain this derogation rather than apply the standard rate of VAT.</p></reply>

This was a result of numerous headwinds at the start of the year, including the Omicron wave of the virus, inflationary pressures, and the high level of uncertainty stemming from the war in Ukraine. </p><p>Modified domestic demand, my preferred measure of domestic economic activity, declined by -1 per cent in the first quarter. Consumer spending, a major component of MDD, decreased by -0.7 per cent, reflecting the impact of restrictions that were in place in the early part of the first quarter along with the weakness in consumer sentiment and the spike in prices following the outbreak of the war in Ukraine in the latter part. Business investment softened somewhat in the first quarter, although we did see strong growth in new housing investment. This followed a very high level of business investment in the fourth quarter of last year.</p><p>The weak first quarter for the domestic economy comes at a time of unprecedented geopolitical instability and uncertainty. The onset of the war in Ukraine and the associated economic and financial sanctions represent a large &lsquo;supply-side&rsquo; shock to the world economy, one which has resulted in inflationary pressures rising sharply &ndash; and globally &ndash; as a result. Consumer price inflation in Ireland rose to a multi-decade high of 8.3 per cent in May. </p><p>The Government has responded to help ease the impact of price rises, with the announcement of &euro;2.4 billion in measures to address the cost of living to date including measures announced in <i>Budget 2022</i>. The Government will continue working to ensure the fall-out is minimised for those who are least-equipped to respond, but we cannot shield all households and businesses from the entirety of the impact.</p><p>On a positive note, the labour market has remained resilient despite these challenges. Employment levels were very strong in the first quarter, with a record 2&frac12; million people in employment. Wages are rising, with total earnings up 2&frac12; per cent over the first quarter. The external side of the economy also continues to perform very strongly with exports in the quarter exceeding &euro;150 billion.</p></reply>

However, I would like to highlight that the Government's &lsquo;<i>Housing for All</i>&rsquo; strategy sets out the Government comprehensive policy to address housing in all its various aspects and to create a sustainable housing system into the future.</p><p>The strategy is a multi-annual, multi-billion euro plan to improve Ireland&rsquo;s housing system and deliver more homes of all types whilst addressing pressures within our housing market.  This approach is expected to benefit both prospective owner-occupiers and renters by addressing the mismatch between demand and supply which has been a long-standing characteristic of the housing market. </p><p>The role of the Minister for Finance is in relation to taxation.

Introduce a new vacant land tax, which was the Residential Zoned Land Tax, completed in Q4 2021.</p><p>3. Assess the adequacy of funding for <i>Housing for All </i>targets, which was completed also in Q4 2021;</p><p>4. Review the Help to Buy scheme to ensure it is appropriately calibrated, which was completed in Q3 2021.  In this regard, I might note that the current comprehensive review of the scheme arose on foot of a recommendation made in that 2021 exercise;</p><p>5. Collect data on vacancy with a view to introducing a vacant property tax; this is due for completion at the end of Q2 2022;</p><p>6. Review the options on the tax and fiscal treatment of rental accommodation providers, which is due in Q3 2022;</p><p>7. Expand data sharing efforts between the Residential Tenancies Board and Revenue and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, which is due in Q1 2023; and</p><p>8. Increase funding for the Land Development Agency, which is due in Q1 2024. </p><p>In relation to first-time buyers, the Help to Buy scheme was extended in Budget 2022 until 31 December 2022 and, as I referenced already, the scheme is being reviewed in a comprehensive way at present. </p><p>On the question of the tax treatment of landlords' rental income, as I said, my Department is committed to review the recommendations of the <i>Report of the Working Group on the Tax and Fiscal Treatment of Rental Accommodation Providers (2017)</i>. A copy of the 2017 report is available on the Department's website [at: www.gov.ie/en/collection/51d1c-budget-2018/ ]. I understand that the review is currently in hand. </p><p>As indicated to the Deputy previously in the replies to his questions no. 82 dated 1 June 2022 and no. 208 of 2 June 2022, proposals for any new tax reliefs must be assessed in accordance with my Department's Tax Expenditure Guidelines. These make clear that it is important that any policy proposal which involves tax expenditures should only occur in limited circumstances. In particular, they provide that a tax-based incentive should only be considered where it would be more efficient than a direct expenditure intervention.</p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s past experience with tax incentives in the property sector strongly suggests the need for a cautionary stance when considering State intervention.</p></reply>

Under the scheme, businesses can temporarily &lsquo;park&rsquo; certain tax debts on an interest free basis until the end of this year (or until 30 April 2023 for businesses most impacted by the most recent public health restrictions and who are eligible for certain Covid-19 support schemes).</p>  <p>  Debt warehousing allows for the deferral of the payment of VAT, PAYE (Employer) and certain self-assessed income tax labilities, and overpayments under the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) and the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS).  It provides a vital liquidity support to businesses experiencing cash-flow and trading difficulties due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  </p>  <p>  As of 31 May 2022, &euro;2.9 billion has been warehoused, comprised of &euro;1,362 million in VAT, &euro;1,371 million in Employers PAYE, &euro;56 million in Income Tax, &euro;53 million in TWSS overpayments and &euro;37 million in EWSS overpayments.  </p>  <p>  Almost 90,000 individual entities are availing of Debt Warehousing, including 8,000 taxpayers who have warehoused &euro;172 million under the recent extension to warehousing for certain businesses.</p>  <p>  To retain the benefits of the scheme, it is essential that all tax returns are filed, even if the liability cannot be paid or there is no liability. This has been a key condition of the scheme since its commencement.  In addition, current taxes must be paid as they fall due. </p>  <p>  Recent reports indicate that Government supports, including the debt warehousing scheme, have so far prevented the level of business failures that would otherwise have been expected from trading restrictions.  The ESRI estimated that the level of financial hardship would have been 72% higher without the &euro;10 billion in wage subsidies paid by the Government during the pandemic.  The CSO published data on rates of business survival in 2020-2021 which found that 84% of enterprises trading normally in 2019, employing 1.4 million people, had survived by the end of 2021.</p></reply>

The Deputy should note that in his correspondence the Minister outlined the various actions he had taken  to mitigate the cost of energy for households and businesses in Budget 2022, as well as the additional &euro;505m support package introduced in February. He also outlined the further package of measures in March which provided for a reduction in excise duty on petrol of 20 cent; diesel 15 cent and Marked Gas Oil of 2 cent.</p>  <p>  The Minister acknowledged the importance of the Energy Tax and VAT Directives, in particular  the framework they provide for a consistent application of these taxes across all Member States. However, in the context of the significant increases in energy prices, he outlined the limitations of the recent changes to Annex III of the VAT Directive given that reduced rates may only be applied to gas and electricity, and therefore other fuels remain outside the scope of the reduced rates. In this context the Minister  asked the Commission to consider allowing Member States to respond to the crisis  with greater flexibility than is permitted under the Directives. </p>  <p>  On 23 April, Commissioner Gentiloni wrote to all Finance Ministers in relation to the energy crisis, responding to points Minister Donohoe and his European counterparts have raised. The Commissioner highlighted the current flexibility provided by EU Directives, including the newly agreed amendment to VAT rates.  The Commissioner indicated that the Commission does not envisage any further revisions of the EU taxation framework to respond to the current crisis.</p>  <p>  Minister Donohoe and his officials will continue to engage with the Commission and with their European counterparts to seek the maximum degree of flexibility for Member States to respond to the current energy crisis. It should be noted that any change to the VAT Directive would require unanimity from all Member States and that the recent amendment to VAT rates within the Directive was the result of four years of negotiations.  </p></reply>

Therefore, it is important that motor insurance is affordable, which is why this Government has continued to prioritise efforts to reduce costs for motorists as part of the <i>Action Plan for Insurance Reform.</i>In that regard, I am pleased to note that data from both the Central Statistics Office (CSO), and National Claims Information Database (NCID), show that prices are continuing to fall for private motor insurance. </p><p>The latest CSO Consumer Price Index (CPI) for May 2022 data indicates that the price of motor insurance is now 16% lower than in June 2020, when this Government was formed. This is clear evidence that reforms have the desired policy impact. According to the CSO CPI, the price of motor insurance has also declined by 10.9% year-on-year. </p><p>In the context of the European market, the Eurostat Consumer Prices show Ireland had the largest price reduction in motor insurance premiums in the EU in the 12 months to April 2022, at 11.7%.</p><p>This downward trend of motor insurance prices is also separately validated by data from the National Claims Information Database (NCID), with the last motor report indicating that the average earned premium per policy peaked at &euro;708 in Q4 2017, and declined by 16% to &euro;595 in Q4 2020. </p><p>I expect that the next NCID report on private motor insurance, due later this year, will show a continued decrease in insurance prices, as the impact of the various Government reforms in this area continue to bed in and take effect.</p></reply>

This concentration means total tax receipts are vulnerable to the business decisions of a handful of large companies.</p><p>In relation to policy, as has been well articulated over the past few years, changes to the international tax regime represent a key risk to this revenue stream.  My Department&rsquo;s central estimate at present is that &euro;2 billion could be lost in corporate tax by 2025 relative to baseline. I would stress that there is significant uncertainty attached to this technical assumption; the final figure could be considerably different.</p><p>Of course, the strong growth in corporation tax that we have seen over the last several years is, in many respects, welcome.  It meant that, during the pandemic, we had to borrow less than would otherwise have been the case. It is also a reflection of the success of our industrial policy in attracting high quality multinational firms and high wage jobs to Ireland.</p><p>While the revenue stream is indeed welcome, we must be careful not to craft budgetary policies on the basis of these highly volatile and unpredictable corporate tax receipts.  As a result, Government has frequently cautioned against building permanent expenditure commitments on the basis of corporation tax receipts.  </p><p>It is also worth pointing out that with borrowing costs rising, our capacity to absorb a shock to corporation tax receipts is more diminished. This further enhances the need to reduce our exposure to this revenue stream. </p><p>Finally, last year I established the <i>Commission on Taxation and Welfare</i>to analyse the structure of our public finances and to propose reforms to ensure the long-term sustainability of our tax and welfare systems. The Commission is due to report next month on how to best address vulnerabilities in the tax base to ensure that we are in a position of strength to address any future economic shocks that may occur.</p></reply>

These information requirements were included in LPT returns in accordance with section 39A of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended), which was introduced by the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2021.  Any information obtained under section 39A may only be used for compiling statistical information in relation to vacant residential properties.  </p>  <p>  It is important to note that LPT applies in respect of any building which is in use as, or is suitable for use as, a dwelling. Properties that were uninhabitable or unsuitable for use as a dwelling, as at 1 November 2021, are not liable for LPT for 2022. Owners of these properties were not required to value their property for LPT purposes and they were not required to submit an LPT return to Revenue.  </p>  <p>  As the information on occupancy status was collected as part of the LPT return, all property owners that submitted an LPT return for the valuation period 2022-2025 completed the local property tax survey on vacancy that the deputy has referred to.  As of 11 May, 1,250,611 property owners had filed returns in respect of 1,597,200 properties. </p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that, as with any other tax return, all LPT returns are subject to validation and checking by Revenue, and this extends to the information returned regarding the occupancy status of properties.  Where a person files an LPT return but fails to include in the return all of the required information and fails to remedy matters when asked to do so by Revenue, section 146 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012   provides that the person will be liable to a penalty of the amount of the LPT that is correctly payable in respect of the property (subject to a cap of &euro;3,000). Accordingly, where a person failed to indicate in their LPT return for the valuation period 2022-2025 that the property was unoccupied on 1 November 2021 and fails to remedy matters when asked to do so by Revenue, the person will be liable for a penalty as outlined. </p>  <p>  Revenue have completed a preliminary analysis of the LPT returns received to date which has been shared with my Department. The results of the preliminary analysis suggest that levels of vacancy are low across all counties. The Minister for Finance will be considering this issue in consultation with colleagues before reverting to Government with proposals on the appropriate response. I understand Revenue intends to publish a profile of the occupancy data from the LPT returns very soon. </p>  <p>  The Finance (Covid-19 and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2022 has recently been enacted so any potential vacancy measure would require new legislation. </p></reply>

There are many strands to this policy, including energy security, rising input costs and costs to consumers, and the need to reduce dependence on fossil fuels. The complexities of the energy market and the range of producers and contracts must also be acknowledged. For example, the Renewable Energy Support Scheme (RESS) contains strong consumer protection measures, with wholesale market revenues above the auction price returned to electricity consumers through the Public Service Obligation Levy. All of these aspects must be considered in connection with proposed new policy measures.  </p>  <p>  In April, the Government approved and published the National Energy Security Framework, which sets the overarching response to the impacts of the war in Ukraine on the energy system in Ireland. The Framework includes a commitment to work with the European Commission and other Member States to consider the proposals set out in the EU&rsquo;s REPowerEU plan. Under REPowerEU, it is considered that taxation or regulatory measures aimed at removing gains created by the current crisis situation could be considered.  </p>  <p>  Energy policy is under the remit of the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications (DECC).  The Energy Security Energy Group, which is chaired by DECC and includes the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, is considering these issues in its role overseeing the implementation of the National Energy Security Framework.</p>  <p>  Officials in DECC are working to examine where gains created by the current crisis situation may be occurring and to consider what, if any, action would be appropriate having regard to over-arching energy policy.  This includes engaging with Department of Finance officials to determine potential fiscal response measures. This work, which will help inform the implementation of the National Energy Security Framework, includes consideration of potential negative impacts of any such action. For example, there is a risk that a windfall tax may lead to higher consumer costs and negatively impact upon investment in the energy sector, particularly in the area of renewables. This would in turn impact on the Government's ambitions to tackle climate change through the reduction of carbon emissions.</p>  <p>  A well-functioning EU electricity market is crucial for the integration of our Internal Energy Market and supporting investment in new renewables. The best long-term approach for Ireland to insulate consumers from volatility on international wholesale energy markets is to invest in energy efficiency and renewable energy. Cutting our dependence on fossil fuels and generating power from our own renewable sources will ensure a cleaner, cheaper energy future in the long term.</p>  <p>  I would also note that the Government has taken a number of measures to reduce the burden on consumers in relation to the cost of energy. This includes providing &euro;200 worth of energy credit to every household in the country; reductions in fuel excise duty; and a reduction in the VAT rate for electricity and gas.</p></reply>

Arguably, the resilience of the Irish economy has been most clearly evident in the labour market, where a remarkable recovery has taken place in just a short space of time. There was a record 2&frac12; million people in employment in the first quarter this year while the unemployment rate fell to 4.7 per cent in May, its lowest rate since 2006. </p>  <p>  However the war in Ukraine has fundamentally altered the economic outlook and created significant economic headwinds both in Ireland and throughout the world.  The onset of the war stoked fears around global energy and commodity supplies and brought about a rapid spike in prices. These volatile price movements, in particular in the global energy market, have had knock on implications for the everyday cost of living in Ireland. Driven by the rise in energy prices, inflation is currently running at a multi decade high of 8.3 per cent.  Higher energy price are now having a pass-through impact into other sectors and as a result price pressures are becoming increasingly broad based. Higher prices will erode the purchasing power of consumers and undermine the profitability of businesses. At least over the short term, higher inflation will continue to act as a significant headwind to economic growth. </p>  <p>  The Government is acutely aware of the cost pressures currently facing households and businesses and has responded to help alleviate some of this burden. On a cumulative basis, the Government has announced &euro;2.4 billion in cost of living measures since last October. These measures have included changes in tax and social welfare, the provision of an energy credit for households, a temporary reduction in the rate of VAT on the supply of gas and electricity and a reduction in the excise rate for petrol, diesel and marked gas oil.</p>  <p>  Although the impact of the war in Ukraine represents the most immediate and pressing risk to our economy, it is important not to lose sight of the other challenges we continue to face. Covid highlighted the vulnerabilities in global supply chains, if these vulnerabilities become more persistent than expected, it will have negative implications for both output and inflation.  Domestically, there is also a real risk that a wage-price spiral emerges as the economy approaches full employment and prices remain elevated. This would damage Ireland&rsquo;s cost competitiveness and hamper the economy&rsquo;s ability to compete in the global market place. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to monitor risks to the Irish economy closely, and respond as needed. In calibrating how we respond to the current challenges, it is important that we strike the right balance and ensure policy does not add further inflationary pressures into the system.</p></reply>

The scope is confined to multinational groups with turnover in excess of &euro;20 billion annually. Residual profit is profit greater than 10% of turnover. </p><p>Pillar Two provides that the minimum effective rate is 15% for multinational enterprises with annual turnover in excess of &euro;750m.</p><p>It is expected that the Agreement will bring long-term stability and certainty to the international tax framework arising from discussions which have taken place.</p><p>The implementation timeframe for both Pillars is ambitious as acknowledged recently by the Secretary General of the OECD.  However, I am fully committed to delivering both pillars of the agreement as soon as possible.</p><p>Intensive work is ongoing, both at the OECD and EU, to reach agreement on the technical detail required in both Pillars to ensure that these complex provisions are transposed robustly and in co-ordination by all signatories to the agreement.</p><p>An intensive programme of meetings is ongoing at the OECD to ensure that the Agreement can be translated into rules which ultimately can become legislation. My officials and those of the Revenue Commissioners are endeavouring to shape the rules to ensure that they provide the necessary tax certainty, are administrable for business and tax administrations, and remain broadly faithful to the October Agreement.</p><p>On Pillar One the OECD have divided the work into 14 building blocks necessary to implement Pillar One.  Each block is sent to public consultation as part of the development process and these elements will eventually form the Pillar One Model Rules.</p><p>These model rules, which will govern the reallocation of taxing rights to market jurisdictions, are to be delivered through a Multilateral Convention. This will be both legally and legislatively challenging to develop and deliver.</p><p>Pillar Two is more advanced. The OECD published Model Rules in December 2021 and published a commentary to these rules in March of this year.  The Model Rules provide an important framework to assist individual jurisdictions to implement the Global Minimum Effective Tax Rate in a coordinated and consistent manner in accordance with the terms of the Agreement.</p><p>Work is ongoing on the OECD&rsquo;s Implementation Framework to deal with further implementation issues, such as co-existence with the US GILTI regime, and the GloBE information return.</p><p>In the EU, work on delivering Pillar Two into legislation through the Minimum Tax Directive is very advanced. I am fully supportive of the efforts of the French presidency towards reaching unanimous agreement of the Directive and am optimistic that unanimous agreement can be reached at ECOFIN soon.</p><p>The EU Minimum Tax Directive now provides for implementation by 31 December 2023, which is in line with the OECD agreement of 2023 implementation.  This remains faithful to the original deadline, while recognising the complex work required of both tax administrations and businesses in order to introduce and operate these rules effectively.</p><p>Domestically, a public consultation has recently been launched on the implementation of Pillar Two into Ireland&rsquo;s tax code and I encourage all interested parties to engage with this consultation.</p></reply>

The number of primary dwelling mortgages in arrears peaked at over 140,000 in 2013 and have subsequently declined to around 47,000 mortgage accounts at the end of December 2021. This amounts to 6.5 per cent of all primary dwelling mortgage accounts.</p>  <p>  However, if accounts in short term arrears are excluded, around 32,500 mortgages are more than 90 days in arrears which amounts to 4.5 per cent of all primary mortgages as at the end of 2021. At the end of 2020, 5.3 per cent of primary dwelling accounts were more than 90 days in arrears. </p>  <p>  As one part of this overall Government framework to address mortgage arrears, &lsquo;Mortgage To Rent&rsquo; (MTR) was introduced in 2012 as a specific social housing response for borrowers who, having gone through the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process as set out in the Central Bank Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, were deemed to have an unsustainable private mortgage.</p>  <p>  Under the MTR scheme, the borrower surrenders their property to their lender and it is then then sold to an MTR provider which can be either an Approved Housing Body or, since 2018, a private company. The Approved Housing Body or local authority (in the case where the property is sold to a private company) then becomes the landlord and the borrower remains in the property as a tenant paying a differential rent to the landlord based on his or her income.</p>  <p>  The inclusion of a private entity in the MTR scheme arose from a 2017 review of the scheme and was seen as a way to achieve greater scale to meet the long-term social housing needs of some borrowers who have unsustainable mortgages.</p>  <p>  In overall terms, eligibility for the MTR scheme and policy on the operation of the scheme, including the entities which can purchase properties and provide services under the scheme, are in the first instance a matter for my colleague the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage. However, I work closely with my colleague as we seek to address the problem of mortgage arrears and housing more generally.</p></reply>

This is a valuable relief from CAT and a fundamental objective of this relief is that it is availed of by genuine, and active farmers, and that it relates to agricultural land which is being actively farmed.</p>  <p>   One of the key conditions for agricultural relief is that agricultural property must make up at least 80% of a beneficiary&rsquo;s total property. Prior to the changes made in Finance Act 2017, any land leased for solar panels was not classified as agricultural land and therefore could not be counted towards satisfying this 80% threshold.</p>  <p>   In recognition of the then Government&rsquo;s commitment to facilitate the development of solar energy projects in Ireland and the potential role of farmland in achieving this, an amendment was made to allow land leased for solar panels to be classified as qualifying agricultural activity under certain conditions.</p>  <p>   While introducing this amendment, it was important that sight was not lost of the fundamental principle which underpins agricultural relief policy, namely to support the intergenerational transfer of family farms and to encourage succession planning. Therefore, a key aspect of this relief is to ensure that it is targeted at land, which is actively farmed. Consequently to facilitate the above policy objectives, the amendment included a condition that in order to be classified as qualifying agricultural activity, the total area under lease for solar should not exceed 50% of the total area of agricultural land.</p>  <p>  This addressed any potential disincentive to leasing land for solar panels, while also preserving the integrity of this significant CAT relief. </p>  <p>  I currently have no plans for reviewing this matter.</p></reply>

Firstly, there was the Omicron wave and its impact on hospitality and certain other contact-intensive services sectors in the early part of the first quarter. Then as the economy fully re-opened we were faced with the fallout from the war in Ukraine, which led to a collapse in consumer sentiment due to the heightened uncertainty and a further rise in inflationary pressures. All of this is reflected in an increase in household precautionary savings, with households saving around a fifth of disposable income in the first quarter, a rate not seen since the second quarter last year.</p>  <p>  The war in Ukraine and the associated economic and financial sanctions represent a large &lsquo;supply-side&rsquo; shock to the world economy, with the main channel of transmission from the war to the Irish economy coming via the sharp rise in energy and other commodity prices. Inflationary pressures have risen steeply as a result.</p>  <p>  Consumer price inflation in Ireland rose to 8.3 per cent in May, a multi-decade high. Core inflation has also been increasing sharply in recent months, suggesting price rises are becoming more broad-based, with a greater range of consumer goods affected.</p>  <p>  I am acutely aware of the real hardship this inflationary pressure has created, with both businesses and households feeling the strain. Rising prices ultimately reduce the real incomes of households and result in households cutting back on spending.</p>  <p>  The Government has introduced a series of measures to ease the impact of rising prices, with &euro;2.4 billion in announced cost of living measures so far, including measures announced in Budget 2022. We will continue working to ensure the fallout is minimised for those who are least-equipped to respond, although we cannot cushion the impact for all.

My officials have also engaged with those in the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (DTCAGSM) and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (DETE), who also advise that no such correspondence has been identified. My officials have sought clarification from the Deputy&rsquo;s office on the question but unfortunately no further information was provided in the time available.  I would note that, should any correspondence be received from the European Commission on State aid to the Irish film industry, or indeed any subject matter, I would treat it with the utmost priority. </p><p>It is possible that the Deputy may be referring to correspondence in respect of the Audiovisual Media Services Directive (AVMSD). The AVMSD governs EU-wide coordination of national legislation on all audiovisual media, traditional TV broadcasts and on-demand services. In May the European Commission referred five Member States, including Ireland, to the Court of Justice of the European Union over the failure to transpose the revised AVMSD (Directive (EU) 2018/1808). The revised Directive provides EU-wide media content standards for all audiovisual media. It does not relate to tax matters. The referral included a request to impose financial sanctions in accordance with Article 260(3) TFEU. This is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (TCAGSM).</p><p>With regard to the film tax credit, section 481 TCA 1997 provides a 32% payable credit for eligible expenditure on film production in Ireland. The scheme is intended to act as a stimulus to the creation of an indigenous film industry in the State, creating quality employment opportunities and supporting the expression of the Irish culture.</p><p>In order for a production to qualify for the relief it must have been issued with a cultural certificate by the Minister for TCAGSM. In considering whether to issue a certificate in relation to a film, the Minister for TCAGSM will consider whether the film will either or both:</p><p>i.act as an effective stimulus to film making in the State through among other things, the  provisions of quality employment and training and skills development opportunities (referred to as &lsquo;the Industry Development test&rsquo;), and</p><p>ii. be of importance to the promotion, development and enhancement of the national culture including, where applicable, the Irish language (referred to as &lsquo;the Culture test&rsquo;)</p><p>To ensure adherence with the Industry Development test, all applications for film relief must include a Skills Development Plan. For all projects with eligible expenditure in excess of &euro;2 million, a copy of the Skills Development Plan should also be submitted to Screen Ireland for approval. The Skills Development Plan requires information concerning the number of skills development participants and the types of skills activities undertaken. Within 6 months of completion of the project, applicants are required to submit a Quality Assurance Compliance Report including all evidence of skills development activity for all skills development participants.</p><p>Applicants for the film tax credit must also complete an undertaking in respect of quality employment. This undertaking commits applicants to compliance with all relevant employment legislation and requires them to have in place written policies and procedures in relation to grievances, discipline and dignity at work (including harassment, bullying and equal opportunity). These conditions shall be met by both the producer company and the qualifying company.  If an applicant company does not adhere to the conditions specified in the undertaking, any credit claimed may be subject to recoupment by Revenue.</p><p>The Culture test is the mechanism which ensures that aid is provided only to projects which promote European culture. As part of the application to DTCAGSM, applicants must demonstrate how the project will be of importance to the promotion, development and enhancement of the national culture by meeting at least three of the eight applicable criteria. These criteria are set out on Screen Ireland&rsquo;s website[1]. Further information may be requested from the applicant by DTCAGSM if any clarification is required. The test is assessed by one member of staff in DTCAGSM, reviewed by another member of the Department, and is finally approved at the Principal Officer grade. Should a production fail to pass the Culture test, it will not be certified by the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media and will therefore not qualify for relief. </p><p>www.screenireland.ie/filming/section-481#:~:text='Section%20481'%20is%20a%20tax,the%20Revenue%20Commissioners%20(Revenue)</p></reply>

Monetary policy supports over the course of the pandemic have been extraordinary, with the ECB maintaining record low interest rates and making extensive asset purchases. This injected additional liquidity into markets and helped to maintain favourable financing conditions during the worst of the pandemic. </p>  <p>  These favourable conditions supported commercial bank lending to firms and households, and low interest rates also reduced the burden of debt for euro area countries. This allowed necessary government borrowing to take place, which enabled the substantial fiscal support provided to households and businesses. Essentially, monetary and fiscal policy worked hand-in-glove during the pandemic.</p>  <p>  At the beginning of this year, the outlook for the euro area economy was positive. The fading impact of the pandemic represented a tailwind for economic activity, and the expectation was that monetary policy could be gradually normalised in line with the burgeoning economic recovery. This outlook was upended with Russia&rsquo;s unlawful and immoral invasion of Ukraine, with the crisis and its associated economic, financial, and other sanctions representing a large supply-side shock to the global economy. One of the major economic consequences of the war has been the significant rise in energy and other commodity prices. </p>  <p>  Prices across the globe have risen substantially as a result, with inflation in Ireland recorded at 8.3 per cent in April, the highest rate since the series began. Against this backdrop, the process of monetary policy normalisation in the euro area has begun, with the ECB bringing their programme of quantitative easing to an end. I also note the recent announcement by the ECB&rsquo;s Governing Council that it plans to raise interest rates at its upcoming meeting in July, in accordance with its commitment to ensure inflation stabilises at its 2 per cent goal over the medium term. This will be the first rise in ECB interest rates in more than a decade, following the most recent period of very accommodative policy. </p>  <p>  As Minister for Finance, monetary policy is not a part of my remit and it is not my place to comment or speculate on the setting of Eurozone interest rates, which as the Deputy is aware is the responsibility of the ECB. Of course, higher interest rates will have an impact on the Irish economy. Indeed estimates published by my Department suggest that a one per cent increase in policy rates would lead to lower economic growth and employment over the medium term &ndash; although it would also serve to reduce inflation. As such my Department will continue to monitor interest rate developments closely. </p></reply>

This was driven by very strong growth in VAT, corporation tax and income tax. </p><p>Income tax receipts to end-May were up by &euro;1.7 billion (17 per cent), compared to the same period last year. This is a reflection of the strong recovery in our labour market, with employment now at its highest level ever, as well as continued robust increases in wages in sectors less affected by the pandemic.</p><p>The strong rebound in VAT receipts &ndash; up by &euro;2.0 billion, or almost 29 per cent &ndash; also points to the scale of the domestic economic recovery. </p><p>Of course, it is important to remember that these annual comparisons are flattered by a number of factors, such as the impact of stringent public health restrictions last year, the warehousing of tax receipts and the temporary reduction in the standard rate of VAT, which exaggerates the annual growth rate. </p><p>Corporation tax receipts amounted to &euro;5.2 billion to end-May, up by &euro;2.3 billion (77 per cent) on the same period last year. This was mainly driven by increased profitability in the multinational sector; it also reflects, in part, a timing issue, whereby receipts received in August last year have been received earlier this year, distorting the annual comparison. </p><p>Excise receipts of &euro;2.1 billion were broadly flat on last year. This is due, in part, to the measures Government has taken to address the rising cost of living by reducing excise on petrol, diesel and marked gas oil, and likely reflects the impact of rising energy price on excise-related consumption.</p><p>In conclusion, I would caution that these figures are backward looking; many of the risks that we identified in the spring forecasts (set out in the <i>Stability Programme Update</i>) now appear to be materialising. Inflation is higher, broader and more persistent than foreseen, external demand is slowing and borrowing costs are rising. All of these will have adverse implications for the public finances.</p></reply>

While Ireland&rsquo;s direct exposure to the impacts of the war is limited, second round effects have been significant, with higher energy and commodity prices acting as the main transmission channel from the war to the Irish economy. We are already seeing the impact of higher commodity prices, with inflation in Ireland reaching a multi-decade high of 8.3 per cent in May. </p>  <p>  The pass through effect of soaring energy prices will also be reflected in rising costs for both businesses and households. These factors, alongside heightened uncertainty, will hold back consumer spending and investment this year. Indeed, modified domestic demand (MDD) &ndash; the best measure of domestic economic activity &ndash; declined by 1 per cent in the first quarter as consumers and businesses scaled back spending and investment. At the time of SPU 2022, my Department forecast MDD growth of 4&frac14; per cent for this year. However, as set out in the SPU, there are numerous downside risks to this projection. </p>  <p>  The Government is acutely aware of the cost pressures currently facing households and businesses and has responded to help alleviate some of this burden. On a cumulative basis, the Government has announced &euro;2.4 billion in cost of living measures since last October. These measures have included changes in tax and social welfare, the provision of an energy credit for households, a temporary reduction in the rate of VAT on the supply of gas and electricity and a reduction in the excise rate for petrol, diesel and marked gas oil. </p>  <p>  Whilst the Government will continue to work to help with the cost of living challenge, we must be cognisant that resources are limited and we cannot cushion households and businesses from the entire impact of the current shock. Furthermore, in calibrating how we respond to the current challenges, it is important that we strike the right balance and ensure policy doesn&rsquo;t inadvertently add further inflationary pressures into the system.</p></reply>

The timeframe for delivery on this commitment is the second quarter of 2022. The Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2021 enabled Revenue to collect certain information in relation to the occupancy status of  residential properties including, where unoccupied, the duration and reason for this, in the Local Property Tax (LPT) return forms submitted by residential property owners in respect of the new LPT valuation period 2022-2025. This information, together with information from other available sources, will be used to assess the merits and impact of introducing a Vacant Property Tax. </p><p>In considering the case for such a tax, it is important to have a sound understanding of the quantity, locations and characteristics of long-term vacant properties. It is also essential to identify the reasons for vacancy, and whether this is long or short-term in nature. There may be genuine and acceptable reasons for vacancy such as refurbishment work, the temporary absence of the owner for medical reasons or pending the grant of probate for a deceased person&rsquo;s estate.</p><p>The LPT returns included questions such as whether a property is vacant, the reasons for the vacancy and if the period of vacancy exceeds 12 months. It should be noted that LPT applies only to habitable residential properties, and derelict or uninhabitable properties are not captured under the LPT system. </p><p>Revenue have completed a preliminary analysis of the LPT returns received to date which has been shared with my Department. The results of the preliminary analysis suggest that levels of vacancy are low across all counties. The Minister for Finance will be considering this issue in consultation with colleagues before reverting to Government with proposals on the appropriate response. I understand Revenue intends to publish a profile of the occupancy data from the LPT returns shortly. </p><p>Addressing vacancy and dereliction, and maximising the use of the existing housing stock, is a priority objective of the Government, as evidenced in the <i>Housing for All</i>strategy where one of the four pathways in the plan is specifically dedicated to this area.</p></reply>

In general, the Directive provides that all goods and services are liable to VAT at the standard rate unless they fall within Annex III of the Directive, in respect of which Member States may apply either one or two reduced rates of VAT. Ireland currently operates two reduced rates of VAT, 13.5% and 9%, as permitted by the Directive. Hotel and holiday accommodation is listed in Annex III of the Directive and, therefore, can be subject to VAT at a reduced rate.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2021, as part of the Government&rsquo;s response to the economic situation arising from the Covid emergency, some goods and services that previously had been subject to VAT at the 13.5% rate were temporarily moved to the 9% rate, including hotel and holiday accommodation.  In Budget 2022, I  announced an extension of the arrangement until end August 2022.  In May, the Government agreed a further extension until 28 February 2023.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, there is no legal obligation for companies to pass on price reductions arising from a decrease in VAT. I have not engaged with the hotel industry in relation to this issue but would encourage hotels in Dublin and across Ireland to reduce their prices by the equivalent of the VAT reduction. </p>  <p>  I am informed by Revenue that the estimated cost of continuing to apply the 9% VAT rate to hotels and holiday accommodation (instead of the 13.5% rate which normally applies), from 1 September 2022 until 28 February 2023, is in the region of &euro;70 million. This estimate is based on the most recently available third-party consumption data and assumes no behavioural changes in response to price. </p>  <p>  The estimated full-year cost of this measure is presented in the Revenue Ready Reckoner at the following link:</p>  <p>  www.revenue.ie/en/corporate/documents/statistics/ready-reckoner.pdf</p></reply>

Along with the unjust loss of life, millions of people have been forced to flee their homes. As well as the humanitarian crisis, the war and associated economic, financial, and other sanctions represent a large supply-side shock to the global economy, with European countries at the front line.</p>  <p>  Reflecting the negative spill-over effects from the war, the OECD has recently revised down its forecast for global GDP growth by 1&frac12; percentage points this year and &frac12; percentage point next year, relative to their December projections.</p>  <p>  Whilst Ireland&rsquo;s trade links with Russia are small, we are nevertheless, highly exposed to indirect effects arising from the conflict.</p>  <p>  The primary channel through which the war is having a negative impact on the Irish economy is through higher energy and commodity prices. Consumer price inflation rose to 8.3 per cent in May, the highest rate in decades. Pass-through price effects are expected to result in price levels rising in other sectors, such as food, transport and consumer goods. Indeed, in recent month core inflation has also been increasing sharply, suggesting that inflationary pressures are becoming increasingly broad-based.</p>  <p>  Higher inflation is squeezing the purchasing power of households. Along with the heightened level of uncertainty created by the geopolitical instability, this will dampen growth in the domestic economy. Households are expected to respond to higher prices by reducing their real spending, while firms are expected to hold back on investment.</p>  <p>  In addition, while Ireland&rsquo;s direct links with Russia are limited, many of our key trading partners have stronger trade links with Russia. The war is weighing on demand in some of Ireland&rsquo;s export markets, with knock-on implications for Irish exports.</p>  <p>  The Government is acutely aware of the cost pressures currently facing households and businesses. Whilst the government will continue working to minimise the fall-out on those who are least-equipped to respond, resources are limited and we cannot cushion households and businesses from the entire impact of the current shock.</p></reply>

The incentive gives a refund on Income Tax and Deposit Interest Retention Tax paid in the State over the previous four years, subject to limits outlined in the legislation. Section 477C Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 outlines the definitions and conditions that apply to the scheme.</p><p>In my Budget 2022 address I announced that a formal review of the scheme will take place this year.

It should also examine the impact of the scheme on house prices since inception.</i></p><p><i>The findings should present an assessment on a national basis while highlighting any regional aspects.</i></p><p><i>Having regard to the Government&rsquo;s Housing for All strategy, and in particular to other initiatives included in Housing for All that have the same broad policy objectives as currently apply for the scheme, to examine whether there is a continued role for Help-to-Buy and, if so, to present options on how such role might best be fulfilled in the most efficient and cost-effective manner in the medium to long term, including on the question of any transitioning.</i></p><p><i>As part of the overall context, the review should draw on experience internationally and offer views in this regard as appropriate.</i></p><p><i>The study should be completed by c.o.b. Friday, 24 June 2022.&quot; </i></p><p>The future of the Help to Buy scheme beyond its current sunset date of 31 December 2022 is a matter that will fall to be considered by Government in the light of the findings of the above review and in the context of the Budget 2023 process.

Early stage investments are also receiving support from HBAN (Halo Business Angel Network), a joint initiative of Enterprise Ireland, InterTradeIreland and Invest Northern Ireland, which launched a new Impact Syndicate to invest in ESG start-ups on the island of Ireland over the next three years, in February this year. HBAN&rsquo;s Impact Syndicate will collectively invest &euro;10m in start-ups focusing on sectors such as climate, energy, the blue economy and cleantech.</p>  <p>  To meet Climate Action Plan energy efficiency targets, the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications (DECC), with assistance from NewERA, is working with SBCI to develop a loan guarantee scheme of at least &euro;500m to provide a competitive funding offer to help increase the volume and depth of retrofit activity &ndash; the Residential Retrofit Loan Guarantee Scheme. </p>  <p>  Separately, the SBCI published an Open Call earlier this year to identify lenders to participate in the &euro;150m SME Energy Efficiency Loan Scheme. </p>  <p>  The St James&rsquo;s Hospital &euro;15m retrofit, financed by the Ireland Energy Efficiency Fund, in which the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications is an investor, was completed in March. This will reportedly result in energy and operational savings of at least &euro;26m over the next 20 years and a reduction of almost 6,000 tonnes of CO2 every year.</p>  <p>  I would also note that the ISIF committed &euro;20m to a major new fund that will improve the energy efficiency of buildings and homes in February this year. Other cornerstone investors in the Solas Sustainable Energy Fund (SSEF) include the European Investment Bank (EIB), MEAG, the asset manager of the Munich Re group and IDEAL insurance. ISIF is also an investor in the &euro;90m Irish Innovation Seed Fund Programme, a new fund for Irish start-ups targeted at a number of areas including climate change.</p></reply>

This position is reinforced by the EU Single Market framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive). </p><p>Notwithstanding this, the <i>Programme for Government</i>recognises that insurance costs are a significant issue for businesses, motorists, and households, as well as a range of sporting, community, and voluntary groups. We therefore established the Sub-Group for Insurance Reform to prioritise further action in this area, with a focus on reducing insurance costs, and increasing the availability of cover. Furthermore, the <i>Insurance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2022, </i>which is a pro-consumer piece of legislation that will enhance transparency in several areas, should be finalised in the Oireachtas in the coming weeks.</p><p>This reform work is being driven through the <i>Action Plan for Insurance Reform</i>, which sets out 66 actions across several policy areas, including the Department of Finance. According to the second <i>Action Plan Implementation Report</i>published in March this year, this reform agenda is progressing well, with some 80% of actions being delivered, and the remaining ongoing to completion. </p><p>Some of the key achievements to date aimed at reducing costs include:</p><p>- the implementation of the <i>Personal Injuries Guidelines,</i>which have significantly lowered award levels for many common injuries; </p><p>- the Central Bank&rsquo;s forthcoming ban on price walking for home and motor insurance, which will end the &ldquo;loyalty penalty&rdquo; imposed on some long-term customers; </p><p>- the establishment of the <i>Office to Promote Competition in the Insurance Market</i>, which aims to lower costs by promoting greater competition in the Irish market;  </p><p>- the development of legislative proposals to reform the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB), with a view to increasing the number of claims settled by the Board without recourse to litigation; and </p><p>- measures to reduce fraud, including the enactment of the <i>Criminal Justice (Perjury and Related Offences) Act 2021, </i>which places perjury on a statutory footing for the first time.</p><p>My Department has regular engagements with industry and stakeholders in relation to implementing this suite of reform measures. </p><p>I believe that the annual decline of 10.9% in motor insurance prices, as evidenced by recent Central Statistics Office data, indicates that the Action Plan initiatives are having a positive policy outcomes for consumers. </p><p>The Central Banks&rsquo; National Claims Information Database (NCID) last motor report indicates that the average earned premium per policy peaked at &euro;708 in Q4 2017, and declined by 16% to &euro;595 in Q4 2020. </p><p>With respect to insurance for businesses, the first NCID Report on Employers&rsquo; Liability, Public Liability and Commercial Property indicates that many businesses are accessing affordable insurance. According to the Report, in 2019, the average premium for package policies was &euro;2,269, and 93% of all policies had a premium of less than &euro;5,000.</p><p>Over time, the NCID should allow us to assess the cumulative impact of the reform package across motor, employers&rsquo; liability, and public liability insurance, and I look forward to the publication of this year&rsquo;s reports in due course.</p></reply>

This Act provides that any person which directly or indirectly provides credit to consumers, including credit which is termed as 'buy now pay later' (BNPL) type credit, or hire purchase or consumer hire agreements to consumers will now fall within the regulatory remit of the Central Bank of Ireland.  </p>  <p>  As a consequence of this legislation, the Central Bank can apply the relevant provisions of its codes and regulations to all the regulated providers of credit, hire purchase and PCP agreements to consumers.  In particular, the Central Bank will be able to apply Chapter 5 of its Consumer Protection Code on 'Knowing the Consumer and Suitability', and which requires that a regulated entity assess the suitability and affordability of credit before the provision of financial accommodation. This is in line with a recommendation that was made in the Tutty Report on the PCP market.</p>  <p>  Firms which are providing these financial services will now be required to seek Central Bank authorisation as a retail credit firm or as a credit servicing firm as appropriate.

This will be done to prevent an increase in the real burden of income tax, to prevent more low income workers being taken into the tax net, and to ensure there is no increase in the number of people having to pay higher income tax and Universal Social Charge rates&rdquo;.  </p>  <p>  The Government is very conscious of inflationary pressures and introduced a range of measures in Budget 2022 which included an income tax package amounting to &euro;520 million, which, within available resources, sought to index the income tax standard rate bands and main personal tax credits. The single income tax rate band was increased by 4.2 per cent from &euro;35,300 to &euro;36,800 for the 2022 tax year, with commensurate increases for persons who are married/in civil partnerships.  The main tax credits, personal tax credits, employee tax credit and earned income credit, were also increased by just over 3 per cent from &euro;1,650 to &euro;1,700 for the 2022 tax year. This is providing a real benefit to all individuals who pay tax by reducing their tax liability and ensures that some low and part time workers remain outside income tax net.  </p>  <p>  In addition, the 2% rate band ceiling for USC was also increased in line with the increase in the national minimum wage to ensure that a full-time adult worker who benefits from the increase in the hourly minimum wage rate will remain outside the top rates of USC.  </p>  <p>  I would point out that this Government has a put in place a package of targeted measures to address the cost of living increases. This brings the aggregate value of measures, including those in Budget 2022, to &euro;2.4 billion.  </p>  <p>  I would also like to draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to my opening remarks at the ESRI&rsquo;s Budget Perspectives conference last Friday 10 June where I noted that &ldquo;Budget 2023 is being prepared against the backdrop of rising borrowing costs; an inflation situation unlike anything we&rsquo;ve encountered in over three decades; heightened economic and geopolitical uncertainty; and, a worrying exposure of revenue to corporate tax receipts.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  Further, as the Deputy will appreciate, the broad economic and fiscal parameters for the Budget in the autumn will be presented in the Summer Economic Statement.  It is within this context and the overall macro-fiscal position that budgetary options, including those relating to income tax, will be considered.</p></reply>

This scheme provides an exemption from benefit-in-kind (BIK) where an employer purchases a bicycle and associated safety equipment up to a maximum of &euro;1,250 (&euro;1,500 in the case of e-bikes), for an employee to use, in whole or in part, to travel to work. Safety equipment includes helmets, lights, bells, mirrors and locks but does not include child seats or trailers.</p>  <p>  Under section 118B TCA 1997 an employer and employee may also enter into a salary sacrifice arrangement under which the employee agrees to sacrifice part of his or her salary, in exchange for a bicycle and related safety equipment.</p>  <p>  Benefit-in-kind is a charge to tax that applies where an employer provides an employee with a benefit such as a bicycle, car or accommodation. Therefore, the Cycle to Work scheme is only applicable where the bicycle and safety equipment is provided by an employer to either a director or someone in its employment and thus, where an employer-employee relationship does not exist, for example, in the case of students, retired individuals, or those in receipt of social welfare payments, such individuals can&rsquo;t qualify for the scheme. Likewise, salary sacrifice arrangements may only be entered into between an employer and a director or employee.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the cycle to work scheme operates on a self-administration basis. Relief is automatically available provided the employer is satisfied that the conditions of its particular scheme meet the requirements of the legislation. There is no notification procedure for employers involved. This approach was taken with the deliberate intention of keeping the scheme simple and reducing administration on the part of employers. Accordingly, there are no records available on the number of people availing of the scheme or the cost of the scheme. </p>  <p>  The scheme continues to be kept under review by my officials.  The Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment at this time, on what changes, if any, are being considered in terms of this relief or any other tax relief. The Deputy may also be aware that the Department of Transport published an examination of the scheme in November 2021 as part of the Spending Review series.</p>  <p>  Further guidance regarding the  Cycle to Work Scheme and salary sacrifice arrangements can be found on Revenue&rsquo;s website.</p></reply>

As such, increasing diversity in the financial services workforce is an important priority in the Government&rsquo;s <i>Ireland for Finance </i>Strategy and<i></i>Action Plans 2021 and 2022.</p><p>A key milestone in the area of diversity, specifically gender balance, was the launch by Minister of State Se&aacute;n Fleming of Ireland&rsquo;s first Women in Finance Charter in April 2022. The development of this Charter was a public-private collaboration under the <i>Ireland for Finance</i>Action Plans. The measure was led by industry and their representative bodies, i.e. Financial Services Ireland and Banking Payments Federation Ireland, with involvement from stakeholders including Insurance Ireland and Irish Funds. It was supported by Government including my Department, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Balance for Better Business.</p><p>The Charter is open to all financial services firms operating in Ireland and I encourage firms to commit to this important development. Signatories of the Charter commit their organisations to achieving greater gender balance by setting targets that are appropriate to their company and formulating action plans to achieve these targets. This should lead to a more inclusive working environment by increasing the number of women in junior, middle and senior management, leadership and board level positions. The ESRI has been commissioned by the industry associations to undertake a comprehensive analysis of the data that firms provide and publish periodic reports. The Charter will be overseen by a Steering Group comprised of public sector officials from my Department and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and industry professionals. The Steering Group will also provide guidance and direction for the Charter. More information on Ireland&rsquo;s Women in Finance Charter is available on the Balance for Better Business website www.betterbalance.ie/partners/ </p><p>However, diversity goes beyond the number of women in the workplace or in leadership. It also means diversity of age, ethnicity, sexual orientation, education, nationality, disability, beliefs, and more. There is an increased interest by industry on developing talent being driven by trends in fintech and sustainable finance, and by changes in the regulatory environment. I expect that this theme will continue to feature in the strategic update of the <i>Ireland for Finance</i>Strategy that has taken place over the last number of months and which I hope to have Government approval for its publication next month.</p></reply>

This is because farming, which is defined in section 654 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, requires the occupation of farmland. Agricultural contracting does not involve the occupation of farmland. The measure is specifically targeted at the farming sector to address the particular problems faced by family farms. </p><p>However, it should be noted that, currently, those who incur expenses in relation to farm diesel in the course of their trade of agricultural contracting may claim an income tax or corporation tax deduction for these expenses, including any carbon tax charged in respect of the diesel.</p><p>I indicated to the Deputy, most recently on 25 May last in my reply to question no. 182, that I expected that the review would be completed in advance of Budget 2023 and is likely to be completed by the early part of Q3 this year.

This year, as in all prior years, the format and content of the SPU has been produced in accordance with the guidelines set out by the European authorities. These guidelines stipulate that the macroeconomic and fiscal forecasts should be produced for at least three years ahead. The decision to provide forecasts beyond this time horizon is at the discretion of each member state.</p>  <p>  The forecasts produced as part of the Stability Programme Update (SPU) took place against a backdrop of unprecedented uncertainty and geopolitical instability. Given the degree of uncertainty at present, constructing a set of macroeconomic and fiscal projections is particularly challenging and the margins of error around these projections are extremely pronounced. Extending the forecasts beyond the three-year horizon would likely have amplified the uncertainty, as the key assumptions underpinning the forecasts would have become less reliable over time.  With this in mind, the SPU does contain a more severe scenario, examining an alternative pathway for the economy in the event of changes to the assumptions underpinning the central scenario.  </p>  <p>  Faced with many similar challenges, a number of member states throughout Europe have also used a three-year horizon in producing macroeconomic and fiscal forecasts for SPU 2022. As such, Ireland&rsquo;s forecast horizon is in line with international norms. </p></reply>

Central Bank expects them to have plans in place to manage the impact of the broader changes and consolidation in the retail banking sector in Ireland. It is the responsibility of the individual banks to ensure that they are putting their customer first, ensuring fair treatment of customers and that customers understand what the changes mean for them.</p>  <p>  With regard to vulnerable customers, the Central Bank's Consumer Protection Code 2012 (the Code) applies to regulated financial service providers providing regulated activities within the State. Under the provisions of the Code the Central Bank expects that all regulated firms take a consumer-focused approach and to act in their customers&rsquo; best interests, particularly in dealings with vulnerable consumers. The Code contains a number of provisions aimed at ensuring that vulnerable people can gain access to mainstream financial services and to ensure that the vulnerable consumer is provided with such reasonable arrangements to facilitate them in their dealings with the regulated entity.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank has also written specifically to banks on the issue of vulnerable customers setting out its consumer protection expectations in the changing retail banking landscape. This industry letter sets out that all customers are potentially vulnerable to the risk of making uninformed decisions, or decisions that are not in their best interests, particularly during times of uncertainty and change. The Central Bank sets out the following expectation of regulated entities in respect of vulnerable customers:</p>  <p>  - Consider specifically the impact of their decisions on vulnerable customers and provide the assistance necessary to reasonably mitigate those impacts and retain access to basic financial services.</p>  <p>  - Have specific and effective processes and communication plans to support vulnerable customers during this time of increased uncertainty.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank met with the CEOs of the five main retail banks on 17 May 2022 to discuss the large scale migration of customer bank accounts, and the actions necessary to ensure that this activity happens in line with customer needs and expectations.  </p>  <p>  Following a constructive meeting, there was agreement that a strong customer focused approach needs to be delivered including the banks having customer focused arrangements to ensure they take into account the specific circumstances a customer may face and strongly supporting them in making the move. </p>  <p>  My officials and I will continue to monitor the migration of current accounts from the exiting banks and engage with relevant stakeholders, both public and private, as I have been doing over recent months.

Almost every advanced country in the world is in the same position, with euro area inflation reaching a record 8.1 per cent in May. </p>  <p>  The key driver behind the elevated level of inflation at present is the sharp rise in wholesale energy prices since the onset of the war in Ukraine. Looking ahead increases in wholesale energy prices will continue to feed into higher energy inflation over the coming months. Pass-through price effects are expected in other sectors, such as food (via fertilisers and fuel costs) and consumer goods (via higher energy inputs). Indeed, the recent rise in core inflation suggests that inflationary pressures are becoming increasingly broad-based. </p>  <p>  At the time of SPU 2022, the Department forecast average inflation of 6&frac14; per cent for this year. However, with many of the risks outlined in the SPU having already come to pass, the annual rate will no doubt be higher. Needless to say, the war in Ukraine and in particular the escalation of sanctions against Russia will continue to shape the outlook for inflation over the short term.</p>  <p>   The Government is acutely aware of the cost pressures currently facing businesses and households, in particular those on low incomes, and has responded to help alleviate some of this burden. On a cumulative basis, the Government has announced &euro;2.4 billion in cost of living measures since last October. These measures have included changes in tax and social welfare, the provision of an energy credit for households, a temporary reduction in the rate of VAT on the supply of gas and electricity and a reduction in the excise rate for petrol, diesel and marked gas oil. Distributional analyses of the February and April cost of living packages show that low-income households have benefitted the most from the policy changes introduced. </p>  <p>  However, it is important to bear in mind that the causes of current price pressures are not within our control. Whilst the Government will continue to help with the cost of living challenge, we must be cognisant that resources are limited and we cannot cushion households and businesses from the entire impact of the current shock. Overall, we will be aiming to design policy in a manner that does not add to inflationary pressures &ndash; in other words, budgetary policy itself must not become part of the problem.</p></reply>

The VRT rates were changed again in Budget 2022 to increase the fiscal gap between low emission vehicles and the rest, thus incentivising motorists in the market for a new car to make &lsquo;greener choices&rsquo;. The structure is based on the 'polluter pays' principles, with a reduced rate for battery electric vehicles (BEVs) of 7% of open-market selling price (OMSP), while vehicles falling into the highest emissions band are liable to a rate of 41%.  Similarly, in motor tax, WLTP-tested vehicles are charged motor tax according to their emissions profile; the rate for BEVs is &euro;120 and scales up to &euro;2400 for the most pollutant vehicles.</p><p>Budget 2020 introduced a VRT surcharge on nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions in recognition of the environmental health costs caused by pollutants emitted in particularly high quantities by diesel vehicles. Budget 2021 saw an adjustment to the NOx surcharge structure by increasing rates to incentivise the uptake of cleaner cars. </p><p>There are also a broad range of measures in support of Climate Action Plan commitments to increase the electrification of the fleet. This include a &euro;5,000 VRT relief, SEAI purchase grant, low VRT and motor tax rates, and a &euro;50,000 Benefit-in-Kind exemption for Battery Electric Vehicles. </p><p>I am satisfied that the current vehicle taxation regime is based on an environmental rationale which incentivises low emission vehicles and consequently provides strong disincentives for the most polluting ones. Officials from my Department keep vehicle taxes under review as part of the Tax Strategy Group process.</p></reply>

The BPFI is also facilitating regular engagement between the leaving and remaining banks and other relevant parties. </p>  <p>  I have also been informed by the Central Bank of Ireland that it has written to the CEOs of the top direct debit originators which it regulates to reinforce their duty to take action to ensure this exercise is completed efficiently. </p>  <p>  The Central Bank and I expect all retail banks, both those exiting the market and those remaining, to have plans in place to manage the impact of the broader changes and consolidation in the retail banking sector in Ireland. It is the responsibility of the individual banks to ensure that they are putting their customer first, ensuring fair treatment of customers and that customers understand what the changes mean for them.</p>  <p>  My officials and I will continue to monitor the migration of current accounts from the exiting banks and engage with relevant stakeholders, both public and private, as I have been doing over recent months.

Regulated entities are required to comply with all aspects of the CCMA as a matter of law.</p>  <p>  The objective of the CCMA is to ensure that regulated entities have fair and transparent processes in place to deal with their borrowers who or in facing mortgage arrears. Due regard must be given to the fact that each mortgage case is unique and needs to be considered on its own merits. All cases must be handled sympathetically and positively by the regulated entity, with the objective at all times of assisting the borrower to meet his or her mortgage obligations. </p>  <p>  In particular the CCMA provides that, in order to determine which options for alternative repayment arrangements are viable for each particular case, the regulated mortgage creditor must explore all the options for alternative repayment arrangements offered by that creditor.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore, if a borrower is not satisfied with the decision of the regulated entity in relation to this matter, such as if he or she is not happy with the particular alternative repayment arrangement offered by the mortgage creditor to address the particular mortgage repayment difficulty or if the mortgage creditor declines to offer an alternative repayment arrangement, the CCMA provides that an appeals process be in place to allow for the matter to be reconsidered.  That appeals procedure must also inform the borrower of his/her right to refer the matter to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.</p>  <p>  The responsibility for overseeing and enforcing the provisions of the CCMA is an independent matter for the Central Bank and the Bank has the powers available to it for that purpose.  The Central Bank has advised that it is currently undertaking intensive supervisory engagement with firms on Long Term Mortgage Arrears (LTMA) to ensure that firms are doing all they can to get borrowers who are engaging meaningfully and paying something towards their mortgage on to an appropriate and sustainable arrangement. </p>  <p>  They are also engaging with firms to encourage borrowers that are not currently engaged, to reengage with their firm and it has also advised that firms are being challenged to utilise their full suite of alternative repayment arrangements (ARAs), and look at solutions outside of ARAs, such as Personal Insolvency Arrangements (PIAs) or Mortgage to Rent (MTR). </p></reply>

This estimate is after taking account of the estimated value of the State&rsquo;s investments in banks and NAMA&rsquo;s retained earnings. The C&amp;AG are currently undertaking work to refresh these figures as at end-2021 and updated figures will be available in due course.</p>  <p>  The Exchequer continues to incur the cost of servicing the debt associated with the banking stabilisation measures. While the amounts invested in recapitalising banks, proceeds from disposals, income accruing from the investments, and estimated residual values can be readily identified, estimation procedures are required to identify the costs incurred by the State in funding the investment. The estimate of the net cost of banking stabilisation has remained relatively consistent since the initial estimate was produced in respect of the end of 2014. In total, the debt-related cost to the State associated with the investments was c.&euro;22 billion over the period 2009 to 2018. In the long-term, the cost of servicing the debt associated with the investments is projected to be around &euro;420 million annually for each percentage point that the State pays on its debt, per the most recent C&amp;AG projections. For example, at an average cost of debt of 2.5%, the cost of servicing the debt would be around &euro;1.1 billion annually. This estimate does not take account of the additional interest costs that will arise in the future from funding the annual debt servicing cost.</p></reply>

This is just over &euro;30bn higher than it was at end-2019 i.e. pre-pandemic. However, the Exchequer has at its disposal significant cash and other assets. Therefore, the net National Debt &ndash; that is the debt after the deduction of these assets &ndash; is lower. It stood at &euro;208bn at end-2021. This is c. &euro;20bn higher than it was at end-2019, pre pandemic.  </p>  <p>  The Stability Programme Update (SPU), published by my Department in April 2022, includes forecasts for General Government Debt (GGD). GGD is a measure of the total gross consolidated debt of Government. It includes National Debt measured on a gross basis, along with debt of the wider general government sector. GGD is forecast to decrease to &euro;233.8 billion by end-2022 (from &euro;235.9 billion at end-2021), the equivalent of 96.5 per cent of GNI*. The baseline forecasts within the SPU are based on the assumption that the war in Ukraine slows the pace of economic expansion in Ireland, rather than reverses it.</p>  <p>  Turning to the second element of the Deputy&rsquo;s Question related to the Bank Bailout, in general terms, the proceeds of borrowing, as well as revenues such as tax revenue are lodged to the Exchequer account. No specific tranches of borrowing were undertaken solely for the purpose of recapitalising the banking sector. Therefore, it would be extremely difficult to accurately quantify the part of the national debt that relates to the borrowing undertaken to recapitalise the banks or provide a useful percentage figure that related to the banking stabilisation measures. It is generally the case that public debt is not repaid as such, but rather is refinanced, or rolled over into new debt, when it comes to mature.</p>  <p>  The Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&amp;AG) has previously &ndash; in its Reports on the Accounts of the Public Service &ndash; provided estimates of the net cost of the banking stabilisation measures as at end-2014, end-2016 and end-2018.</p>  <p>  The most recent report, containing estimates as at end-2018, stated that the net cost to the State from banking stabilisation measures up to the end of 2018 was around &euro;41.7 billion. This estimate is after taking account of the estimated value at the end of 2018 of the State&rsquo;s investments in banks (&euro;8.4 billion), and NAMA&rsquo;s retained earnings (&euro;4.2 billion).</p>  <p>  The 2021 edition of the C&amp;AG&rsquo;s Report on the Accounts of the Public Service, due for publication later this year, will include updated estimates of the net cost of banking stabilisation measures and associated debt service costs, as at end-2021.</p></reply>

The <i>Revenue Commissioners</i>estimate that these taxes raised some &euro;2.8 billion last year. </p><p>From a broader perspective, the Deputy will be aware that Ireland has one of the most progressive systems of taxes and social transfers of any EU or OECD country.  Our tax system is strongly progressive, and when combined with our welfare system, contributes substantially to the redistribution of income and to the reduction of inequality. </p><p>In relation to the high rate of inflation, the Government is keenly aware of the challenges of rising price pressures.  The Government has responded in a timely and forceful manner to address the impact of higher prices, with a suite of measures to help to ease the impact on businesses and households, particularly those on low incomes.

The Government has to balance the appropriate response to the increased cost of living in Ireland with the unprecedented level of global economic uncertainty and macro-economic risk. </p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the <i>Summer Economic Statement</i>will be published in the coming weeks and will set out the broad economic and fiscal parameters for <i>Budget 2023</i>, taking into account the overall macro-fiscal position.</p></reply>

These forecasts were produced against a backdrop of unprecedented uncertainty and geopolitical instability and, as such, the margin of error around these point estimates was very wide. </p><p>My Department identified several downside risks to the projections at the time and our best assessment is that many of these have now materialised.  For example, inflation has proved to be higher, broader and more persistent than initially assumed, while the external environment is less benign.  The stance of monetary policy has become less accommodative, and the higher cost of funds will have an impact for households, firms and government.</p><p>The Government has introduced a series of measures to ease the impact of rising prices, with &euro;2.4 billion in announced cost of living measures so far, including measures announced in <i>Budget 2022</i>.

Indeed, the OECD Economic Outlook notes the extent of supports that the Government has introduced to mitigate the adverse impact of inflationary pressures. On a cumulative basis, &euro;2.4 billion has been announced in cost of living measures to date. </p>  <p>  At the outset, Budget 2022 was framed within the context of these price pressures. It contained an income tax package to the value of &euro;520 million, a social welfare package worth &euro;558 million, and other supports, including health and childcare measures, to help to mitigate the cost of living.</p>  <p>  Since the Budget, Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine has exacerbated price pressures. The Government has introduced further measures to help to ease cost of living pressures, including a suite of measures in February amounting to &euro;505 million. Further supports were announced in March and April, including an energy credit, a reduction in the VAT rate for electricity and gas, and reductions in excise duties. In May, the Government announced an extension of the 9 per cent VAT rate for the tourism and hospitality industry for a further six months.</p>  <p>  The Government is acutely aware of the differential impacts of rising inflation across household groups and has introduced this range of targeted measures to help alleviate the burden on those worst affected by current price pressures. </p>  <p>  The tax and welfare changes introduced in Budget 2022 and more recent measures to mitigate the increase in the cost of living were strongly progressive, with the gains from measures more keenly felt by those in the lower income deciles. </p>  <p>  However, it is important to bear in mind that the causes of current price pressures are not within our control. Whilst the Government will continue to work to minimise the fall-out on those who are least-equipped to respond, resources are limited and we cannot cushion households and businesses from the entire impact of the current shock.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, in calibrating how we respond to the current challenges, it is important that we strike the right balance and ensure policy does not inadvertently add further inflationary pressures. </p></reply>

It will facilitate engagement and a speedy determination of the impacts of exceptional inflation and supply chain disruption.</p>  <p>  The first element of the framework was published on 20 May 2022 for projects with values in excess of &euro;1m.</p>  <p>  The second element was published on 3 June 2022 for projects with values less than &euro;1m.</p>  <p>  Where the first element is concerned there are two strands, depending on whether the project is operating under the older form of contract; published before 7 January 2022, or the new form; published on 7 January 2022.  For the older forms, the framework covers materials and energy price increases.  For the new forms, only energy price increases are covered as these forms were amended to allow for materials price inflation.</p>  <p>  Where the completion of the works is delayed due to supply chain disruption, contractors will not be held liable for any liquidated damages payments for the late delivery of the works.</p>  <p>  It will operate from the point at which the parties enter the framework until project completion. It also permits inflation cost recovery on payments already made on projects from 1 January 2022 in recognition that inflationary pressures were further building from this point in anticipation of the invasion of Ukraine.</p>  <p>  Inflation-related costs are determined according to a standardised approach using specified price indices published by the CSO.  These additional costs are apportioned between the parties, with, subject to budgetary constraints, the State bearing up to 70% of the additional inflationary related costs on an ex gratia basis.</p>  <p>  The use of the framework is voluntary, but participation by the parties is strongly encouraged. It represents a pragmatic response to the current challenges caused by inflation that are not within either party&rsquo;s control.</p></reply>

The OPW, through its arterial drainage works, meets its statutory duty to maintain these completed schemes in proper repair and effective condition.  </p><p>In terms of best practice and national guidance for these arterial maintenance works, the OPW has developed and published the national &lsquo;<i>Environmental Guidance: Drainage Maintenance and Construction</i>&rsquo;. This sets out a framework for the arterial drainage maintenance service to minimise potential environmental impact and maximise the environmental gain through proactive initiatives such as the river enhancement programme.  This guidance was developed in consultation with the National Parks and Wildlife Service and Inland Fisheries Ireland.  </p><p>The Arterial Drainage Maintenance Service also operates a national framework of multi-annual Appropriate Assessments for thirty-one catchments. All associated Screening reports, Natura Impact Assessments and Appropriate Assessment Determinations, including those for specific sites are published on the OPW website.A public consultation is to commence shortly to inform the next 6-year Strategic Environmental Assessment for the National Arterial Drainage Maintenance Programme. </p><p>The OPW is currently delivering some 150 flood relief schemes as part of the Government&rsquo;s &euro;1.3bn investment under the National Development Plan to 2030.</p><p>The design of all flood relief schemes involves an extensive series of environmental assessments. As well as meeting the statutory and regulatory requirements these detailed assessments help to inform how the environment can be integrated into a viable scheme design. To that end, there is a specific requirement for all design consultancy services to assess the potential for nature-based solutions for catchment management as an integral part of the overall viable scheme design options. Where feasible, these measures are being implemented helping to manage the flood risk for a community and provide many co-benefits including for agriculture, aquaculture potential through improving water quality and biodiversity by creating habitats and reducing pollution. </p><p>The OPW in its Biodiversity Action Strategy 2021-2026 is enhancing the ways in which it works with flood relief and arterial drainage works to include creative solutions, balancing biodiversity with social impacts, minimising environmental impacts where they are unavoidable and creating opportunities to achieve Net Gain for both biodiversity and flood protection through sound policies, procedures and research.</p><p>As a proactive contributor and participant in a wide range of studies and research projects, the OPW continues to inform and improve its approach to environmental assessments and nature-based solutions. In this way, the OPW is continuing to take an evidence-based approach and meet the highest standards. </p></reply>

These measures amounted to over &euro;1 billion and covered a wide range of areas, including income supports, supports for healthcare, energy, housing, families with children and education. </p>  <p>  The economic context has become more challenging in recent months with the conflict in Ukraine compounding supply chain issues. The Government is acutely aware of the pressures facing households, in particular relating to energy bills and especially for those on lower incomes.  </p>  <p>  In recognition of these prices pressures, a further set of measures was announced in February at a cost of over half a billion euro. This was targeted at providing timely, temporary support to mitigate the impact of increasing cost of living, including:  </p>  <p>  -  An Energy Credit payment automatically applied to the electricity bill of all domestic account holders to assist with rising energy costs. </p>  <p>  -  In addition to the &euro;5 per week increase in Fuel Allowance payments introduced in Budget 2022, a further two lump sum payments totalling &euro;225, paid in March and in mid-May, will benefit over 370,000 households. </p>  <p>  -  Budget 2022 announced an increase of &euro;10 in the weekly income threshold for the Working Family Payment. The implementation of this increase was brought forward from April to June.</p>  <p>  -  A further reduction from &euro;100 to &euro;80 in the monthly payment threshold for the Drugs Payment Scheme. This will reduce medicines and drugs costs for over 70,000 recipients. </p>  <p>  -  A temporary 20% reduction in Public Service Obligation Public Transport fares until the end of 2022 to reduce the financial burden on commuters returning to the workplace.</p>  <p>  -  The maximum annual School Transport charge was reduced to &euro;150 per family at primary level and &euro;500 per family at post-primary level for the next academic year. </p>  <p>  -  A temporary and targeted emergency grant scheme for licensed hauliers provides a payment of &euro;100 per week for licenced heavy goods vehicle for a period of eight weeks. </p>  <p>  To provide further support towards mitigating fuel cost increases, the Department of Finance have introduced temporary reductions in the excise duties charged on petrol, diesel and marked gas oil and have reduced the rate of VAT on the supply of gas and electricity.</p>  <p>  While the Government cannot absorb the full spectrum of the inflationary shock, we have taken action to provide substantial assistance towards mitigating the impact of rising prices. We have sought to implement measures which strike a balance between delivering targeted support, capable of timely implementation and are temporary in nature to ensure that our public finances remain on sustainable trajectory and avoid actions that could result in further inflation. </p>  <p>  I am currently engaged in preparations for the Summer Economic Statement with my colleague the Minister for Finance. This publication will set out the fiscal parameters for Budget 2023 taking account of the challenging economic context. In determining this strategy, I will aim to strike a balance  between delivering continued investment in public services, continuing the support for cost-of-living challenges and achieving our fiscal targets. </p></reply>

These collective agreements have helped to ensure that public pay is managed in a sustainable, affordable and orderly manner. These agreements have also enabled significant reform of public services and changes to work practices.</p><p>The value of public pay deals to the Government and the taxpayer is ensuring that pay costs are managed in a sustainable and orderly way and in a climate of industrial peace. </p><p>The current public service agreement is Building Momentum - A New Public Service Agreement 2021-2022. This Agreement is weighted towards those at lower incomes with headline increases of approximately 5% for the lowest paid public servants. These groups will also benefit more from other measures in the Agreement including the overtime rates and premia payment adjustments.</p><p>Building Momentum is a two year Agreement, which is due to expire at the end of 2022. </p><p>As Deputies will be aware, exploratory discussions have taken place between the parties to the Agreement following the triggering of the review clause in Building Momentum by public service unions and associations due to the increasing cost in living. These discussions have now moved to formal phase of discussions which are being facilitated by the Workplace Relations Commissions. </p><p>As Deputies will appreciate, while these discussions are ongoing it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the detail of those talks which should remain confidential to the parties. However, the inflation and cost of living issues are a feature of those discussions.</p><p>These are very challenging discussions given the impact high levels of inflation are having on living standards of workers but also because of the uncertainty in the global economic outlook. The aim in these talks will be to strike the right balance and seek to achieve a deal that is fair and affordable to both taxpayers generally and public service employees.</p><p>An agreement on public service pay could play an important role in underpinning stability, minimising industrial unrest and supporting the continued delivery of reform and quality public services over the period ahead.

I, along with my colleague the Minister for Finance, will consider this report. The Minister for Finance will provide a formal reply in the coming weeks. Regarding spending rules, our domestic rule is encompassed in the Government's budgetary strategy. </p>  <p>  The 2021 Summer Economic Statement set out the Government's medium term budgetary strategy. This strategy aimed to return fiscal policy to a sustainable path while continuing to invest in our public services. It set out a commitment to align core expenditure growth to the trend growth rate of the economy. This seeks to ensure that increases in core expenditure are sustainable both now and into the future. </p>  <p>  The medium term expenditure strategy is based on the dual objective of returning fiscal policy to a sustainable path&mdash;following the considerable investment since 2020 in Covid supports&mdash;and providing continued investment in public services and public infrastructure. In this way, the strategy recognised that sustainability of expenditure relies on a combination of both a sustainable expenditure growth rate and delivery of sustainable public services. Overall the strategy must be responsive to key macroeconomic developments.</p>  <p>  Over the coming weeks, I will be engaging with my colleague the Minister for Finance to prepare the Summer Economic Statement. This will set out the budgetary parameters for Budget 2023 taking account of an increasingly challenging and complex economic context. </p></reply>

In this context, my Department, in collaboration with Civil Service employers, Trade Unions and Staff Associations, has developed a Blended Working Policy Framework for Civil Service Organisations.</p>  <p>  The Framework focuses on the longer-term approach to remote working in the Civil Service and will assist in providing a consistent approach across the wider public service. The Framework supports commitments contained in a number of strategies which this Government has launched. These include, the National Remote Working Strategy, Our Rural Future, the Climate Action Plan and the National Planning Framework. </p>  <p>  I, along with Minister of State Smyth, published the Framework on 31 March.  The Framework provides broad strategic direction to individual organisations in the Civil Service to develop tailored policies on blended working that are appropriate to their business needs and employees. It is anticipated that Departments and Offices will have these policies completed no later than end-Q2 2022. </p>  <p>  In developing their own blended working policies, Civil Service Departments and Offices will have the flexibility to determine matters such as the proportion of time individual employees work remotely versus onsite and those roles that are suitable for blended working.</p>  <p>  Access to blended working by civil servants will be dependent on Departments/Offices having the ability to meet the needs of the business.  Remote working will not be available to employees on a 100 percent basis, as some physical attendance at workplaces will be required to facilitate face-to-face meetings, training and other key events deemed necessary by the employer. Any requirements an employee may have for flexible working arrangements should be discussed directly with their employer.</p></reply>

In this context, my colleague, Ossian Smyth T.D., Minister of State with responsibility for Public Procurement Policy, is actively engaged in promoting sustainable public procurement and ensuring that relevant guidance is available to guide public procurement practitioners through the Office of Government Procurement (OGP).  </p><p>Following the publication of the Climate Action Plan 2019, my Department published <i>Circular 20/2019: Promoting the use of Environmental and Social Considerations in Public Procurement</i>in October 2019.  This instructs Departments to consider using green criteria in their procurements, and also requires public bodies to incorporate relevant green procurement measures into their planning and reporting cycles as an appendix within their Annual Report. In addition, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) collects reports from Departments annually on progress in relation to Green Public Procurement which will assist in understanding where further guidance is needed or where promotion should focus.  The first report was published in April 2022 and indicated that Government departments reported a total spend of &euro;53.765 million on contracts over &euro;25,000, signed in 2020, that included green criteria. </p><p>The Strategic Procurement Advisory Group (SPAG), chaired by the OGP, aims to promote and facilitate the incorporation of strategic considerations into public procurement projects.  In 2021, the establishment of an Environmental subgroup of the SPAG, co-chaired by the OGP and the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communication&rsquo;s Circular Economy Unit, has facilitated the implementation of Green Public Procurement (GPP) measures in Ireland. It has assisted coordination and awareness in the lead up to the publication in 2021 by the EPA of Green Public Procurement &ndash; Guidance for the Public Sector, accompanied by 10 sets of green criteria.  The subgroup has also facilitated the EPA in the coordination of the rollout of training in Green Public Procurement across public bodies. In addition, it makes public bodies aware of the green frameworks developed by the OGP and other central purchasing measures.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware, the Programme for Government includes a number of commitments in relation to public procurement, including evaluating and managing the environmental, economic and social impacts of procurement strategies within the State. The OGP and its partner Central Purchasing Bodies (CPBs) have been reviewing all central purchasing arrangements to identify opportunities to include green considerations. Of the 260 central arrangements that are available from the five CPBs, 165 had been updated to include specific green criteria by the end of 2021.</p></reply>

In practice, this means that Equality Budgeting attempts to provide greater information on how proposed or ongoing budgetary decisions impact on particular groups in society, thereby integrating equality concerns into the budgetary process. </p>  <p>  Equality objectives and indicators are published every year in the Revised Estimates Volume and the Public Service Performance Report. The initial focus of Equality Budgeting was on gender, following which the initiative was extended to other dimensions of equality including socio-economic inequality, disability and minority groups. </p>  <p>  An Expert Advisory Group was established to guide development of Equality Budgeting policy, and has met regularly since September 2018. The role and objectives of the Group are to provide constructive, critical feedback on the Equality Budgeting initiative and provide expert guidance and informed insights on the future direction and areas of focus for Equality Budgeting, including in light of international experience, lessons from other policy areas and from academia.</p>  <p>  In 2019, the OECD published a report on Equality Budgeting in Ireland, providing 12 recommendations on how to drive this initiative forward. Implementation of the report's recommendations is now at an advanced stage. A key recommendation was to develop an equality data strategy, which was completed by the CSO in October 2020. To build on this, work is now underway to draft an equality data strategy.   In March 2021, an inter-departmental group was established to facilitate implementation of Equality Budgeting across all Government departments. This group meets regularly and plays a key role in guiding the continued progress of Equality Budgeting.  Members are accountable for ensuring that policy makers in their departments are fully aware of, and implementing, Equality Budgeting policy where applicable and bringing all relevant work within their department to the attention of the Equality Budgeting unit. </p>  <p>All Government Departments are now participating in Equality Budgeting. The latest Public Service Performance Report, published on 19th   May this year, includes an update on this work. </p></reply>

One of the key objectives for Limerick City &amp;amp; Co Council is to build upon the City Centre&rsquo;s historic character by fully capturing the rich heritage, protecting and enhancing it where appropriate and complementing it with world class design for any new development.  Central to Limerick City &amp;amp; County&rsquo;s masterplan for the city is the development of the Opera project to bring much needed activity, employment, social facilities and life back into the city centre.  Limerick City &amp;amp; Co Council has tasked Limerick 2030 with the development of the Opera project.</p><p>In 2014, following on from the publication of the Economic and Spatial Plan for Limerick, the Government decided in principle, to the relocation of the Revenue Commissioners from their existing offices in Sarsfield House to new offices that will form part of the major Opera, urban regeneration scheme being developed in Limerick city centre.</p><p>Sarsfield House was constructed in the early 1970&rsquo;s and comprises of an approximate gross area of 7,900 square meters of office accommodation over six floors.  As a building suitable for modern, 21<sup>st</sup>century working, Sarsfield House does not meet required energy efficiency standards and is, in effect, at end of life.  The OPW is very mindful of the continuing requirement to provide suitable accommodation of a sustainable nature to the 800 Revenue Commissioner occupants in Sarsfield House. The condition of the building is such that it does not meet the standards expected from a modern workplace.  It is the OPW&rsquo;s understanding that the property will be utilised by Limerick City &amp;amp; County Council as part of a public amenity area that will aid the regeneration of the inner city and significantly enhance the natural environment of the city.  This property footprint will become an essential part of the overall greening of the locality to allow for the development of the public realm and the transition to a more sustainable eco-friendly environment.</p><p>The Office of Public Works, and the Revenue Commissioners, continue to work with Limerick City &amp;amp; County Council and Limerick 2030, to give effect to the Government decision and to ensure the new Opera site will provide a modern, energy efficient office building that will meet the long-term requirements of the Revenue Commissioners and other OPW clients in Limerick city centre.  Limerick City &amp;amp; County Council and Limerick 2030 have fully committed to ensuring that the Opera building will be constructed to the highest sustainable and environmental standards. </p><p>The Government&rsquo;s Climate Action Plan requires that all public buildings meet carbon reduction targets by 2030 and accord with all prevailing EU regulatory provisions. The OPW&rsquo;s existing office accommodation portfolio has a disproportionate amount of buildings dating from the early 1950&rsquo;s to the early 1990&rsquo;s. Those aging assets are at, or near, the end of their useful lives. The buildings to be retained in the portfolio, to meet existing and future public service workforce needs, are therefore in need of major investment to significantly reduce their carbon footprint in line with Government and EU climate action requirements.</p><p>The National Recovery and Resilience Plan recently published by the Government identifies advancing the green transition as a top priority and allocates significant funding towards decarbonising projects such as the retrofitting of public office accommodation. The OPW is deeply committed to helping advance sustainable solutions that mitigate against climate change, including through the new Public Sector Retrofit Pathfinder Project as well as through a Public Service Innovation Fund project, which will develop guidelines for the deep energy renovation of historic public sector properties. The Office of Public Works is partnered with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland on the pathfinder programme.</p><p>The Office of Public Works are completing the final stages of the development of guidance on the <i>Roadmap for the use of lower carbon materials in construction</i>. The document outlines key areas of guidance for lower-carbon building materials in construction supported by examples of best practice in this area. The use of lower carbon building materials in construction will play an important role in reducing our emission by 51% by 2030.</p></reply>

Energy prices also showed marked increases in 2021 and have further escalated in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.  Both materials and energy represent significant input costs for construction projects and inflation is a risk that contractors have been expected to bear under the public works contracts for a defined period.</p><p>These inflationary provisions have operated reasonably effectively over the years since their introduction, albeit in times of relative price stability. However, the price movements experienced on construction materials over the past 12 months have arisen suddenly and with no warning. In response to this challenge, I introduced a series of measures to address the risk posed.</p><p><font color="#001A26">-  The OGP issued procurement guidance in November 2021 to assist public bodies in managing the challenges they face concluding &lsquo;live&rsquo; tenders.</font></p><p><font color="#001A26">-  With reference to future tenders, the OGP published interim amendments to the provisions in the public works contracts on 7 January 2022. Within certain parameters, these amendments reduce the level of risk of extraordinary materials price inflation that contractors have to bear, while also enabling the Exchequer to obtain cost reductions should exceptional price reductions occur during the course of the works.  The measures are designed to encourage confidence in the tender process and to mitigate against the over-provision for price inflation in tender prices.  However, they do not cater for fuel/energy price increases or supply chain disruption. </font></p><p>While these changes had been expected to bring greater stability to contracting arrangements on projects whose tenders were received after 18 January 2022, there has been sustained feedback from Government Departments and their Agencies that successful delivery of priority projects included in the NDP is jeopardised by further inflationary pressures associated with the war in Ukraine. Departments have reported specific issues with fuel costs and supply chain disruption, including reduced competition for public works contracts and challenges relating to projects underway during 2021.</p><p>Through extensive engagement with industry and public sector stakeholders involved in the delivery of the National Development Plan 2021-2030(NDP), it is clear that the delivery of many critical public capital projects is being put at risk due to the rapid increases in material and energy prices in recent times. For contractors who tendered for projects prior to the onset of these inflationary pressures, this issue is particularly acute.</p><p>In the interest of safeguarding public projects that are already under construction and to mitigate the risks of significant losses being sustained by contractors, on Tuesday 10 May I announced details of the &ldquo;Inflation Co-operation Framework&quot; for those parties engaged under a public works contract.</p><p>The Framework facilitates both parties to engage with one another for the purpose of addressing the impacts of this most recent onset of exceptional inflation and supply chain disruption and operates on an ex gratia basis. The Framework sets down the approaches and the parameters within which parties to a public works contract may calculate additional costs attributable to material and fuel price fluctuations using price indices published by the Central Statistics Office.</p><p>In recognition that neither party is responsible for the global events that have given rise to inflation, it is proposed that the additional inflation costs be apportioned between the parties, with, subject to budgetary constraints, the State bearing up to 70% of the additional inflationary related costs. The Framework applies to payments made from 1 January 2022.</p><p>The key provisions of the Inflation Co-operation Framework are:</p><p><font color="#001A26">-  It operates from the point at which the parties agree to engage until the project is completed or the parties elect to withdraw by giving notice to the other.</font></p><p><font color="#001A26">-  Given that further inflationary pressures have been building since the beginning of 2022, it provides for the back-payment of a proportion of inflation related costs (on materials and energy) to 1 January 2022 on those contracts which pre-date the introduction of the interim amendments (contracts with a revision date earlier than 7 January 2022).</font></p><p><font color="#001A26">-  The inflation analysis is undertaken using relevant indices published by the Central Statistics Office.</font></p><p><font color="#001A26">-  Going forward, for the duration of the framework, additional inflation costs (for materials and energy) are to be calculated in a similar manner.</font></p><p><font color="#001A26">-  For more recent contracts (i.e. those that commenced under the amended forms of contract), the framework permits the recovery of costs arising from fluctuations in energy prices.</font></p><p><font color="#001A26">-  And finally, for all contracts currently in progress, where it can be shown that a supply chain disruption that has arisen since 01 January 2022 that has led to a delay in completing the project, contractors will not be held liable to pay liquidated damages for the late delivery of the project. </font></p><p>The use of the framework is voluntary, but participation by the parties is strongly encouraged.

All line Departments and agencies submit information on their expenditure levels against profile to my Department, along with an explanation outlining details regarding any variance of under or over spending against profile.</p>  <p>  The latest capital expenditure figures available to end-May reveal that the net capital spend, including capital carryover, was &euro;2,710 million.  When the carryover amount is omitted, the net capital spend amounts to &euro;2,195 million, which is &euro;453 million or 17.1% behind the profiled amount of &euro;2,648 million, with all but two Departments declaring underspends against profile.  Expenditure on capital infrastructure and programmes for the first five months is some &euro;310 million or 16.4% ahead of the same period last year.</p>  <p>  Capital expenditure by its nature tends to be lumpy, with a particularly high drawdown at year-end.  It is therefore not unusual for Departments to record an under or over spend against profile throughout the year. </p>  <p>  The Government has committed to investing &euro;165 billion in capital programmes and projects across a range of investment sectors, as set out in the National Development Plan 2021 - 2030 published last October.  In 2022, almost &euro;12 billion is available to spend on vital infrastructure in areas such as housing, transport, education, enterprise, sport and climate action and our annual capital investment as a percentage of national income is among the largest in the EU.</p>  <p>  We will continue to monitor and report on capital expenditure developments as the year progresses.</p></reply>

These collective agreements have helped to ensure that public pay is managed in a sustainable, affordable and orderly manner. These agreements have also enabled significant reform of public services and changes to work practices.</p>  <p>  The current public service agreement is Building Momentum - A New Public Service Agreement 2021-2022. This Agreement is weighted towards those at lower incomes with headline increases of approximately 5% for the lowest paid public servants. These groups will also benefit more from other measures in the Agreement including the overtime rates and premia payment adjustments.</p>  <p>  Building Momentum is a two year Agreement, which is due to expire at the end of 2022. </p>  <p>  As the Deputies will be aware, exploratory discussions have taken place between the parties to the Agreement following the triggering of the review clause in Building Momentum by public service unions and associations due to the increasing cost in living. These discussions have now moved to formal phase of discussions which are being facilitated by the Workplace Relations Commissions. </p>  <p>  As the Deputies will appreciate, while these discussions are ongoing it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the detail of those talks which should remain confidential to the parties. However, inflation and cost of living issues to which the Deputies have referred will feature in those discussions.</p>  <p>  These are very challenging discussions given the impact high levels of inflation are having on living standards of workers but also because of the uncertainty in the global economic outlook. The aim in these talks will be to strike the right balance and seek to achieve a deal that is fair and affordable to both taxpayers generally and public service employees.</p>  <p>  An agreement on public service pay could play an important role in underpinning stability, minimising industrial unrest and supporting the continued delivery of reform and quality public services over the period ahead.  However, any such agreement would need to reflect the broader economic context and the current fiscal position where significant challenges are emerging.</p></reply>

In June 2022, the Government published <i>Understanding Life in Ireland: The Well-being Framework</i>.  This report builds on the initial report, <i>First Report on a Well-being Framework for Ireland</i>, that was published in July 2021 by taking account of the contributions to a public consultation and further research. </p><p>The overarching vision of the <i>Well-being Framework for Ireland</i>is &ldquo;enabling all our people to live fulfilled lives now and into the future&rdquo;.  In addition to publishing details of the Well-being Framework and an associated dashboard hosted by the Central Statistics Office, the Government is also committed to ensuring that the well-being framework is utilised in a systematic way across government policy making in evaluating programmes and reporting progress as well as in setting budgetary priorities (as an important complement to existing economic measurement tools). </p><p>In order to progress the use of Well-being Framework as part of the policy process, and develop a knowledge base around well-being as a policy objective, the Department of Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform has sought to pilot an approach to utilising the Well-being Framework to locate well-being within existing public policy.  The approach under consideration builds on the performance budgeting initiative by placing an explicit focus on stated policy goals and evidence of progress.  In order to develop this approach, Departments have been invited to consider how they might utilise the Well-being Framework as part of the Spending Review process.  As noted in the <i>Expenditure Report 2022</i>, the Well-being Public Policy Unit in the Department of Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform is available to support Departments in carrying out this work.</p><p>Furthermore, as noted in the <i>Expenditure Report 2022</i>, and subsequently in <i>Understanding Life in Ireland: The Well-being Framework</i>, the next phase of the Department of Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform's work in this area is to develop an approach to associating public expenditure with the various dimensions of the Well-being Framework.  The intention is to develop over time a way of setting out budgetary decisions on the basis of well-being dimensions; an approach that would complement the existing Vote Group approach to presenting such decisions.</p></reply>

This was just slightly over the profiled spend with a variance of &euro;114 million or 0.4%.  This compares with just under &euro;33 billion in overall gross voted expenditure at the end of May 2021, a reduction of &euro;1.2 billion or 3.5% year on year.  In net terms, total net voted expenditure to end-May 2022 amounted to &euro;25.8 billion, which was &euro;313 million or 1.2% below the amount profiled to be spent and &euro;0.8 billion or 3.1% below the same period in 2021.</p>  <p>  For current expenditure, gross voted spending was &euro;29.6 billion at end May 2022 against &euro;31.1 billion for the same period in 2021 &ndash; a reduction of &euro;1.5 billion or 4.8%. Among the main changes was spending in Social Protection being &euro;3.4 billion lower than in 2021, reflecting lower Covid-19 related spend than in 2021, while there was higher year on year current spending of just over &euro;1 billion in the Department of Health.</p>  <p>  Current spending was &euro;571 million or 2.0% ahead of profile. Vote Groups with higher than profiled spend included Social Protection which was &euro;315m or 3.3% ahead or profile, and Health which was &euro;291 million or 3.4% above profile.  Higher than expected spending in both Vote Groups was largely due to increased Covid-19 spending as a result of the Omicron wave against the amount allocated for Covid-19 schemes in their Estimates. </p>  <p>  In relation to gross capital expenditure, end May spend of &euro;2.2 billion was &euro;316 million or 16.6% ahead on the same period in 2021. Capital spending in the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications was &euro;0.4 billion or over six times higher than the same period in 2021, reflecting payment of the Electricity Credit to domestic account holders, with other year on year increases in Agriculture (&euro;35m or 40%), Education (&euro;44m or almost 18%) and eleven other Vote Groups. </p>  <p>  Capital expenditure at end May was &euro;457 million or 17.1% below profile. Capital spending was higher than profile in Agriculture and Education. However in the majority of Departments capital spending to end May was less than had been expected when profiles were prepared. Capital spending tends to be weighted toward the end of the year, and my Department will continue to closely monitor spend against profile. </p></reply>

The BDP will transform the Irish construction and built environment sectors by enabling all stakeholders to develop, maintain, and continuously improve their capabilities through digital adoption to support delivery of PI2040. Overall, the project will enable parallel positive impacts for organisations across productivity, sustainability, procurement, and standards adoption. </p>  <p>  Of the seven actions, work is ongoing on the national rollout of eplanning applications by the Local Government Management Agency.

This will be established in early 2023. Additionally, work is also progressing on Modern Methods of Construction (MMC). The adoption of MMC will be vital in driving innovation in the wider construction sector, contributing towards the achievement of the Government&rsquo;s ambitious capital investment plans. </p>  <p>  Collaboration and continued engagement with industry representatives through the CSG is resulting in positive developments in terms of enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of the construction sector, which will in turn enable the delivery of the Government's ambitions under the NDP.  </p>  <p>  Finally, a range of budgetary reforms have been put in place in recent years, to drive spending efficiency and effectiveness and the Programme for Government commits to continuing reform and improvement of the budgetary process.

Equality Budgeting seeks to approach the budget as a process that embodies long-standing societal choices about how resources are used, rather than simply a neutral process of resource allocation. </p>  <p>  Significant work has been undertaken to develop the initiative and Equality Budgeting has been expanded across multiple dimensions of equality including gender, socio-economic, disability and minority groups.  </p>  <p>  In 2019, the OECD was requested by my Department, and the Department of Justice and Equality, to conduct a scan of Equality Budgeting in Ireland. The published report supported the approach taken, and provided twelve recommendations on how to drive this initiative forward. Implementation of the report's recommendations is well advanced. </p>  <p>  A key recommendation was the establishment of an inter-departmental network of Equality Budgeting contact points which was established last year.   The group includes a senior member of staff from each department with a broad knowledge of the policy work undertaken by that department and its relevance to advancing Equality Budgeting. </p>  <p>  Members are accountable for ensuring that policy makers in their departments are fully aware of, and implementing, Equality Budgeting policy and bringing all relevant work within their department to the attention of the Equality Budgeting unit, to ensure that strategic direction of Equality Budgeting is fully informed.</p>  <p>  This group is playing a key role in guiding the continued progress of Equality Budgeting. Meeting agendas and minutes are published on the Equality Budgeting page of Gov.ie.  </p>  <p>  At the most recent meeting the Department of Justice gave an update on a skills and needs analysis carried out, regarding further implementation of Equality Budgeting. </p>  <p>  In parallel to the Inter-Departmental group, bilateral engagement is a key driver of this policy and my Department maintains strong engagement with officials in the Department of Justice to increase capacity, drive implementation of this policy and share relevant knowledge.</p></reply>

The Cyber Security Baseline Standards Framework will be used by Public Service Bodies to assess and improve the management of cybersecurity and will allow them to identify, protect, detect, respond to, and recover from an attack, minimising damage and impact.

This is a global issue and the European Union has put in place specific EU-wide legislation, the Network and Information Security (NIS) directive,  to ensure that critical IT systems are subject to a higher standard of cyber-security.  Updated legislation is currently being drafted by my colleague the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications whose Department is responsible for the transposition of the NIS2 Directive in to national law.  This new legislation is needed in order to strengthen the security requirements and expand the list of systems and industries that fall under its scope.

There is a whole-of-Government response in place to co-ordinate the humanitarian supports required to respond to the conflict. </p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s role is primarily focused on ensuring that the necessary resources are in place to respond to this humanitarian crisis with work ongoing, in consultation with other Government Departments, to estimate the potential resources required to provide a range of supports to Ukrainian refugees including accommodation and social welfare supports. It remains difficult to accurately estimate the total amount of funding that may be required given the ongoing uncertainty on the overall numbers of arrivals, their demographic profile and specific needs, and accommodation solutions. In recognition of this important humanitarian priority, provision of up to &euro;3 billon was included in the Stability Programme Update (SPU) as an indicative figure for 2023. The scale of funding needed, for 2022 and future years, will be reviewed on an ongoing basis, as more information becomes available. </p>  <p>  My Department is also monitoring developments arising from the conflict both in terms of the overall fiscal impacts and for key areas under the remit of my Department.  </p>  <p>  The Office of Government Procurement continues to monitor the implications of war for supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures. To address the significant ongoing uncertainty faced by contractors engaged on public works projects due to inflationary pressures outside the control of either party that have arisen due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine the Inflation Co-operation Framework was introduced last month. </p>  <p>  The EU has introduced a range of flexibilities to address the impact of the influx of Ukrainian refugees including a regulation on Cohesion Action for Refugees in Europe (CARE) allowing for the swift release and reallocation of existing cohesion policy funding. Member States are also permitted to use existing funds not yet programmed under the Recovery Assistance for Cohesion and the Territories of Europe (REACT-EU), a post-COVID recovery package and all unallocated resources under the current 2014-2020 funding period where programmes are drawing to a close. Ireland is making use of remaining unallocated funding under the European Regional Development Fund (&euro;0.4m) and REACT-EU (&euro;53m) for this purpose. My Department is currently working closely with other Government Departments and agencies to determine the range of existing activities supporting Ukrainian refugees which could be financed under this mechanism.</p></reply>

This increase in inflation is not a problem unique to Ireland. Internationally, arising from the pandemic supply chain issues were a factor, and now with the war in Ukraine driving further increases in energy prices countries are facing higher prices. These external factors are not within our control. </p>  <p>  In recognition of this inflationary challenge, Budget 2022 set out a &euro;1.2 billion package of expenditure measures to support citizens across a range of sectors with cost of living pressures. Some headline measures include increases in social protection payments, Fuel Allowance and Working Family Payment; health affordability measures; social and affordable housing funding, and enhanced student and childcare supports. Budget 2022 also contained an income tax package of just over half a billion euro.</p>  <p>  Since December 2021, over half a billion euro of additional expenditure measures have been put in place to support citizens and businesses with increased costs. A number of these measures build on supports put in place in Budget 2022. A summary of the main measures is as follows:</p>  <p>  -   An Energy Credit payment automatically applied to the electricity bill of all domestic account holders to assist with rising energy costs. </p>  <p>  -  In addition to the &euro;5 per week increase in Fuel Allowance payments introduced in Budget 2022, a further two lump sum payments totalling &euro;225, paid in March and in mid-May, will benefit over 370,000 households. </p>  <p>  -  Budget 2022 announced an increase of &euro;10 in the weekly income threshold for the Working Family Payment. The implementation of this increase was brought forward from April to June.</p>  <p>  -  A further reduction from &euro;100 to &euro;80 in the monthly payment threshold for the Drugs Payment Scheme. This will reduce medicines and drugs costs for over 70,000 recipients. </p>  <p>  -  A temporary 20% reduction in Public Service Obligation Public Transport fares until the end of 2022 to reduce the financial burden on commuters returning to the workplace.</p>  <p>  -  The maximum annual School Transport charge was reduced to &euro;150 per family at primary level and &euro;500 per family at post-primary level for the next academic year. </p>  <p>  -  A temporary and targeted emergency grant scheme for licensed hauliers provides a payment of &euro;100 per week for licenced heavy goods vehicle for a period of eight weeks. </p>  <p>  To provide further support towards mitigating fuel cost increases, the Department of Finance have introduced temporary reductions in the excise duties charged on petrol, diesel and marked gas oil and have reduced the rate of VAT on the supply of gas and electricity.</p>  <p>  While public resources cannot be deployed at the scale that would be needed to fully compensate for all cost increases, the Government has committed significant resources to mitigate cost of living issues, targeted at the main underlying problem of higher energy prices and with additional assistance to those most vulnerable.</p>  <p>  Over the coming weeks, I will be engaging with my colleague the Minister for Finance to prepare the Summer Economic Statement. This will set out the budgetary parameters for Budget 2023 taking account of an increasingly challenging and complex economic context. </p></reply>

With an investment in capital of &euro;165 billion, the NDP shows the ambition of the government with the largest ever public capital investment plan in the history of the State. </p>  <p>  As Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform I am responsible for setting the overall capital allocations across Departments. Management and delivery of individual investment projects within the allocations agreed under the NDP is a key responsibility of every Department and Minister. However, I am conscious of the challenges to the delivery of the NDP being posed by the increases in the prices of construction materials in the aftermath of the pandemic and as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. My Department has put in place a series of policy measures to mitigate those challenges and will continue to assess and respond to a rapidly changing environment.</p>  <p>  As the NDP is a high-level financial and budgetary framework it does not outline a comprehensive list of all public investment projects. An extensive list of projects that are currently planned as part of Project Ireland 2040 are available in the capital tracker and the myProjectIreland map published most recently by my Department in May 2022.

Hosted at gov.ie/2040, the Investment Projects and Programmes Tracker and interactive map provide people with in-depth information on the progress of capital projects in their own area. The most recent version of the tracker was released on 18 May 2022. It is drawn from data provided by relevant Government Departments and agencies. It focuses mainly on projects and programmes with costs greater than &euro;20 million. </p><p>Management and delivery of the projects and programmes are a matter for the Sponsoring Agency and Approving Authority in each case. The latest update of the tracker provides progress updates on over 270 projects and 140 programmes, including almost 100 projects in excess of &euro;50m. Developed in collaboration with Ordnance Survey Ireland, MyProjectIreland is a citizen-focussed interactive map. By clicking on the map at gov.ie/2040, citizens can find updated information on what has been achieved and what is planned for their own local area. The May 2022 update expands the coverage of the map to incorporate over 1,100 projects.</p><p>The Government is committed to continue to detail the delivery of the National Development Plan at regular intervals into the future to allow for full transparency on the implementation of Project Ireland 2040.

Departments have reported specific issues with fuel costs and supply chain disruption, including reduced competition for public works contracts and challenges relating to projects underway since early in 2021.</p>  <p>  The &lsquo;All Materials&rsquo; category of the Central Statistics Office&rsquo;s (CSO) Detailed Wholesale Price Indices for Building and Construction Materials saw a 16.9% increase in the 12 months to March 2022.  In some of the sub-categories the 12 month increase is more severe, &lsquo;other structural steel&rsquo; for example shows a 64.1% increase and rough timber 46.3%.</p>  <p>  Through extensive engagement with industry and public sector stakeholders involved in the delivery of the National Development Plan 2021-2030 (NDP), it is clear that the delivery of many critical public capital projects is being put at risk due to the rapid increases in material and energy prices in recent times. For contractors who tendered for projects prior to the onset of these inflationary pressures, this issue is particularly acute.</p>  <p>  In the interest of safeguarding public projects that are already under construction and to mitigate the risks of significant losses being sustained by contractors, on Tuesday 10 May I announced details of the &ldquo;Inflation Co-operation Framework" for those parties engaged under a public works contract.</p>  <p>  There are two strands to the framework depending on whether the project is operating under the older form of contract; published before 7 January 2022, or the new form; published on 7 January 2022.  For the older forms the framework will cover materials and energy price increases, and supply chain disruption.  For the new forms only energy price increases and supply chain disruption will be covered as these forms were amended to allow for material price inflation.</p>  <p>  The framework facilitates both parties to engage with one another for the purpose of addressing the impacts of this most recent onset of exceptional inflation and supply chain disruption and operates on an ex gratia basis. The framework sets down the approaches and the parameters within which parties to a public works contract calculate additional costs attributable to material and fuel price fluctuations using price indices published by the CSO.</p>  <p>  In recognition that neither party is responsible for the global events that have given rise to inflation, it is proposed that the additional inflation costs be apportioned between the parties, with, subject to budgetary constraints, the State bearing up to 70% of the additional inflationary related costs.</p>  <p>  It has been decided that it is appropriate for the State to bear the majority of any additional costs identified on the basis of the limited capacity of contractors to bear these additional costs which are exceptional in terms of the increase and the uncertainty with respect to their duration. As the State is the ultimate owner and beneficiary of the asset that is under construction, it is imperative that quality materials continue to be used to ensure the durability of completed asset.</p>  <p>  However contractors should continue to carry some degree of the additional costs arising due to inflation in recognition of the original terms upon which they tendered and it encourages more efficient purchasing thereby addressing value for money concerns.</p>  <p>  The framework applies to payments made from 1 January 2022 in recognition that inflationary pressures were further building from this point in anticipation of the invasion of Ukraine.  The extent of additional payments that will arise on projects going forward will depend on the materials that are to be incorporated, the stage of the project&rsquo;s development and further movement in prices which is extremely difficult to forecast at this moment and contracting authorities will be working within ranges which are related to movements in various indices.</p>  <p>  The measures available under the framework strike an important balance between the additional costs incurred by the State to support Contractors engaged on public projects and the State&rsquo;s ability to deliver the NDP including housing delivery, whilst providing value for money for the taxpayer.</p>  <p>  Departments are consistently required to deal with fluctuations in market conditions in delivering required infrastructure. The key requirements that underpin approvals process for capital investment, namely appraisals on the economic and financial value of projects, will remain. Only projects that deliver the required benefits on key Government objectives and prove to be Value for Money for the State will go forward to implementation.</p>  <p>  While the amendments announced recently may lead to some extended timelines in project delivery, it is open to Departments to amend existing plans to deliver similar outcomes within the agreed Budgetary ceilings in the NDP. </p>  <p>  The 2022 capital allocation is &euro;11,403 million. This is an increase of &euro;0.9 billion or 8% on the 2021 allocation and an increase of almost &euro;2.3 billion or 25% on the actual spend (exclusive of carryover) in 2021. In aggregate, including capital carryover, there is &euro;12.2 billion available for capital spending this year.</p>  <p>  The ceilings detailed in the NDP are cognisant of the overall capability of the construction sector to deliver on the NDP and of the appropriate share of National Income being devoted to infrastructure. The levels of capital spending, at close to 5% of GNI*, are already among the highest in the EU and are close to the limit of the overall capability to deliver in the coming decade.</p>  <p>  In the NDP, it was clarified that there will need to be an agile approach to funding allocations and in-plan reprioritisation of funding, particularly where underspends and policy changes are apparent. </p>  <p>  These changes impact on live contracts within the fixed price period, much of this period will have elapsed and the greater flexibility in the changes announced will only impact from 2022 onwards. Outside of that, there is evidence that the market prices and tender prices for core materials have increased. Similar to any process of Vote management, it will be up to sectors and Accounting Officers to assess whether existing timelines for the implementation of key projects will need to be adjusted on account of recent changes made or if there will be a need for prioritisation within their existing 5 year departmental ceilings. It is also possible for the same set of projects to be delivered with some extension of delivery timelines or some re-evaluation of project scope.</p></reply>

Following the Revised Estimates in December 2021, &euro;3.9 billion of this funding remained unallocated. This contingency is held in reserve centrally to allow Government flexibility to respond to emerging needs during the year.</p>  <p>  In February 2022, the Government announced a suite of measures to assist with costs of living pressures. This included the Electricity Credit to domestic account holders, which had an estimated cost of &euro;400 million. This required a Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, given the scale of this amount in relation to the original Estimate for Vote 29. This Supplementary Estimate was brought before the D&aacute;il in March to provide an additional allocation of &euro;271 million with the remaining cost funded through reallocation of existing Vote 29 resources. Following this development, the remaining contingency balance stood at just under &euro;3.7 billion. </p>  <p>  While this is the only draw down from the contingency funding allocated in Departmental Estimates to date, there are significant pressures and commitments on the remaining funding including: </p>  <p>1.   Further Covid support measures, including the response to the Omicron wave will require additional funding over that foreseen at the time of Budget 2022. This includes income and employment support schemes in the Department of Social Protection, Department of Health Covid-19 response, the targeted Commercial Rates Waiver for Q1 2022 and Department of Education Covid response measures.  These Covid-19 expenditure pressures are evident in the end May expenditure reported in the Fiscal Monitor with gross current expenditure in the Department of Social Protection &euro;315 million ahead of profile and &euro;291 million ahead of profile in the Department of Health. </p>  <p>2.  Additional allocations may be required to fund the other cost of living measures announced in February and April. </p>  <p>3.

This has enabled the Government to put in place these supports for businesses and households throughout the pandemic and to respond to the recent cost of living pressures. </p>  <p>  The Summer Economic Statement 2021 set out a medium term expenditure strategy for core expenditure. This strategy aims to align core expenditure growth with the trend growth rate of the economy. It seeks to maintain fiscal policy on a sustainable path while continuing to invest in our public services and infrastructure.  </p>  <p>  I am currently engaged in preparations for this year's Summer Economic Statement with my colleague the Minister for Finance. The economic context has changed considerably with inflation levels elevated above those projected in Budget 2022. This adds complexity to the formulation of our fiscal strategy for 2023. In finalising the budgetary parameters, we will seek to strike a balance between helping to mitigate cost of living pressures and ensuring sustainability of the public finances. Overall we aim to design policy to protect the most vulnerable in society while also ensuring measures do not add to inflationary pressures. The Summer Economic Statement and the Mid-Year Expenditure Report will be published in the coming weeks.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-06-16a.341.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022061600066#WRH00500"><p>There have been significant and sustained increases in the prices of a broad range of commonly used materials in the construction sector throughout 2021 in the aftermath of the pandemic.  Energy prices also showed marked increases in 2021 and have further escalated in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.  Both materials and energy represent significant input costs for construction projects and inflation is a risk that contractors have been expected to bear under the public works contracts for a defined period.</p><p>These inflationary provisions have operated reasonably effectively over the years since their introduction, albeit in times of relative price stability. However, the price movements experienced on construction materials over the past 12 months have arisen suddenly and with no warning. In response to this challenge, I introduced a series of measures to address the risk posed.</p><p>-  The OGP issued procurement guidance in November 2021 to assist public bodies in managing the challenges they face concluding &lsquo;live&rsquo; tenders.</p><p>-  With reference to future tenders, the OGP published interim amendments to the provisions in the public works contracts on 7 January 2022. Within certain parameters, these amendments reduce the level of risk of extraordinary materials price inflation that contractors have to bear, while also enabling the Exchequer to obtain cost reductions should exceptional price reductions occur during the course of the works.  The measures are designed to encourage confidence in the tender process and to mitigate against the over-provision for price inflation in tender prices.  However, they do not cater for fuel/energy price increases or supply chain disruption. </p><p>While these changes had been expected to bring greater stability to contracting arrangements on projects whose tenders were received after 18 January 2022, there has been sustained feedback from Government Departments and their Agencies that successful delivery of priority projects included in the NDP is jeopardised by further inflationary pressures associated with the war in Ukraine. Departments have reported specific issues with fuel costs and supply chain disruption, including reduced competition for public works contracts and challenges relating to projects underway during 2021.</p><p>Through extensive engagement with industry and public sector stakeholders involved in the delivery of the National Development Plan (NDP) 2021-2030, it is clear that the delivery of many critical public capital projects is being put at risk due to the rapid increases in material and energy prices in recent times. For contractors who tendered for projects prior to the onset of these inflationary pressures, this issue is particularly acute.</p><p>In the interest of safeguarding public projects that are already under construction and to mitigate the risks of significant losses being sustained by contractors, on Tuesday 10 May I announced details of the &ldquo;Inflation Co-operation Framework&quot; for those parties engaged under a public works contract.</p><p>The Framework facilitates both parties to engage with one another for the purpose of addressing the impacts of this most recent onset of exceptional inflation and supply chain disruption and operates on an ex gratia basis. The Framework sets down the approaches and the parameters within which parties to a public works contract may calculate additional costs attributable to material and fuel price fluctuations using price indices published by the Central Statistics Office.</p><p>In recognition that neither party is responsible for the global events that have given rise to inflation, it is proposed that the additional inflation costs be apportioned between the parties, with, subject to budgetary constraints, the State bearing up to 70% of the additional inflationary related costs. The Framework applies to payments made from 1 January 2022.</p><p>The key provisions of the Inflation Co-operation Framework are:</p><p>-  It operates from the point at which the parties agree to engage until the project is completed or the parties elect to withdraw by giving notice to the other.</p><p>-  Given that further inflationary pressures have been building since the beginning of 2022, it provides for the back-payment of a proportion of inflation related costs (on materials and energy) to 1 January 2022 on those contracts which pre-date the introduction of the interim amendments (contracts with a revision date earlier than 7 January 2022).</p><p>-  The inflation analysis is undertaken using relevant indices published by the Central Statistics Office.</p><p>-  Going forward, for the duration of the framework, additional inflation costs (for materials and energy) are to be calculated in a similar manner.</p><p>-  For more recent contracts (i.e. those that commenced under the amended forms of contract), the framework permits the recovery of costs arising from fluctuations in energy prices.</p><p>-  And finally, for all contracts currently in progress, where it can be shown that a supply chain disruption that has arisen since 01 January 2022 that has led to a delay in completing the project, contractors will not be held liable to pay liquidated damages for the late delivery of the project. </p><p>The use of the framework is voluntary, but participation by the parties is strongly encouraged. It represents a pragmatic and proportionate response to the current challenges caused by inflation that are not within either party&rsquo;s control.</p><p>Guidance, workbook templates and forms of agreement have been published by the Office of Government Procurement and are available on the Capital Works Management Framework website: constructionprocurement.gov.ie/. There is a new dedicated page &lsquo;<i>Details of Inflation/ Supply Chain Delay Co-operation Framework</i>&rsquo;, which can be accessed directly from the link in the top banner on the website.</p><p>The measures available under the Framework strike an important balance between the additional costs incurred by the State to support Contractors engaged on public projects and the State&rsquo;s ability to deliver the NDP including housing delivery, whilst providing value for money for the taxpayer.</p><p>The OGP will be further amending the conditions of the public works contracts so that these measures are incorporated into the contractual framework on a permanent basis.</p><p>These amendments will ensure a clear apportionment of the risk associated with inflation to enable contractors to price that risk and ensure that we retain a reasonable degree of budgetary certainty without seeing a reduction in those participating in tenders and over-provision for inflation by those that submit tenders.</p></reply>

The Centre was officially opened to public in April 1994 and the centre plays a critical role in the cultural life of D&uacute;n Chaoin and is an important facility for the local community. It is also an important heritage visitor experience, operated by OPW, which celebrates and interprets the extraordinary literary legacy of the Great Blasket and as such, it makes a significant contribution to the economic and tourism agenda in West Kerry.</p>  <p>  At An Blascaod M&oacute;r itself, the State purchased the majority of the land holdings in 2009. The OPW has provided a very successful guide service on the island since 2013, highlighting the heritage of the island for visitors. The OPW, with assistance from F&aacute;ilte Ireland, has also restored two houses on the island, including the home of the pre-eminent Blasket author, Tom&aacute;s &Oacute; Criomhthain. Further work is currently underway with a view to the further conservation of the largely abandoned island village.</p>  <p>  In 2020, the OPW opened a striking new &lsquo;Viewing Platform&rsquo; at the Ionad site in D&uacute;n Chaoin, on a clifftop site overlooking the Blasket Sound. This project was funded by F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the OPW to create a unique way for visitors to experience the dramatic landscape of West Kerry. It connects with the headland walking routes which provide a safe way for visitors of all ages to enjoy the natural landscape.</p>  <p>  As part of this strategic programme of investment with F&aacute;ilte Ireland, a project is also underway to refurbish Ionad an Bhlascaoid itself incorporating a completely reimagined interpretive exhibition of world-class standard. The centre will re-open to visitors this month. </p>  <p>  The OPW is currently investigating options for the provision of public toilets on the island and have discussed this matter with the landowners. OPW will carry out a survey this summer to ascertain the suitability of potential locations.</p>  <p>  Improved landing facilities where boats could embark and disembark passengers directly to the island are under consideration. This is an essential element in the sustainable management of the island from heritage, tourism, safety and environmental perspective. While ferry services are confined to licensed vessels with specific tender permits, it is not currently possible to manage access and visitor numbers to achieve a balance between sustainable tourism access and maintaining the fragile environmental balance of the island.</p>  <p>  Kerry County Council have advised that is necessary to secure fresh planning permission for a pier at An Blascaod M&oacute;r, given that there have been significant changes in the designated status of the island and in environmental regulations in the period since the original permission was granted to Kerry County Council in 2003. This will necessitate updated environmental and other reports to support such an application, as well as the preparation of a detailed updated design for the project. The OPW continues to engage with the relevant stakeholders to consider the key challenges in undertaking this project. </p>  <p>  The conservation and protection of An Blascaod M&oacute;r continues to be of great importance to the OPW in order to secure safe access for visitors and to protect the unique landscape of the Island into the future. </p></reply>

The tracker provides a composite update on the progress of all major investments that make up Project Ireland 2040. The tracker is drawn from data provided by relevant Government Departments and agencies. It focuses mainly on projects and programmes with costs greater than &euro;20 million. Management and delivery of the projects and programmes are a matter for the Sponsoring Agency and Approving Authority in each case. The latest update of the tracker provides progress updates on over 270 projects and 140 programmes, including almost 100 projects in excess of &euro;50m. </p>  <p>  The tracker includes user-friendly dashboards and search functions to aid interpretation of the data. As such the tracker is a key tool in overseeing the progress of Project Ireland 2040, aiding industry by communicating opportunities for investment, and alongside the MyProjectIreland map provides an important communications channel for all citizens in relation to Project Ireland 2040 investments taking place throughout the country.</p>  <p>  Developed in collaboration with Ordnance Survey Ireland, MyProjectIreland is a citizen-focussed interactive map. By clicking on the map at gov.ie/2040, citizens can find updated information on what has been achieved and what is planned for their own local area. The May 2022 update expands the coverage of the map to incorporate over 1,100 projects.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to continue to detail the delivery of the National Development Plan at regular intervals into the future to allow for full transparency on the implementation of Project Ireland 2040. This will be achieved through regular updates of the capital tracker and map as well as the publication of annual reports and regional reports highlighting Project Ireland 2040 achievements and giving a detailed overview of the public investments which have been made throughout the country.</p></reply>

After a comprehensive investigation, the Commission found that <i>&quot;In general, evidence suggests that there are not significant recruitment difficulties to the various large scale public service vocational streams. However, there are problems in the case of some specific and specialist groups across the public service.&quot;</i>Particular challenges were examined by subsequent modules of the Pay Commission and considered by Government.</p><p>I would also highlight the growth in public service numbers since the end of 2013.  Since 2013, an additional 73,917 public servants have been recruited to meet demands for enhanced public service delivery in front-line services. These include 10,006 teachers, 7,502 Special Needs Assistants, 3,319 Health and Social Care Professionals, 8,572 nurses and 3,835 medical and dentistry staff.</p><p>The number of people working in the public service, including staff not directly funded through the Exchequer, stood at 365,893 in full- time equivalent terms (FTEs) at end-2021 according to the most recent data available to my Department.  The Revised Estimates Volume included an estimate for end-2022 public service numbers of 384,754 (FTE), an increase of 18,861 FTE (5.15%) over end-2021 actual public service numbers of 365,893. </p><p>In the case of recruitment to the civil service, for which I have policy responsibility, the Civil Service 2024 Renewal Action Plan sets out actions to ensure that the civil service is as an employer of choice with a range of initiatives under the Workforce, Workplace and Organisation of the Future themes to help further attract, develop and retain a diverse civil service that delivers for our citizens.</p><p>Public service pay has been governed by a system of collective agreements since the Croke Park Agreement was negotiated in 2010 which have helped to ensure that public pay is managed in a sustainable, affordable and orderly manner. These agreements have also enabled significant reform of public services and changes to work practices while minimising industrial unrest.  </p><p>The current public service agreement is Building Momentum - A New Public Service Agreement 2021-2022. This Agreement, which is due to expire at the end of 2022, is weighted towards those at lower incomes with headline increases of approximately 5% for the lowest paid public servants. It also includes the equivalent of a 1% increase in annualised basic salaries to be used as a Sectoral Bargaining Fund.  As the Deputy will be aware, exploratory discussions have taken place between the parties to the Agreement following the triggering of the review clause in Building Momentum by public service unions and associations due to the increasing cost in living. These discussions have now moved to formal phase of discussions which are being facilitated by the Workplace Relations Commissions.  </p><p>While the current inflationary impacts on all workers is acknowledged, the public service is a good employer offering competitive terms and conditions to attract and retain staff including flexible working arrangements, decent pension provision, fair wages that increase over time and secure employment.  </p></reply>

In this regard, OPW holds a portfolio of property throughout the country to meet the various operational needs of the Civil Service, the Garda&iacute; and various other State Bodies. The OPW&rsquo;s objective is to hold, manage and maintain a property portfolio that is aligned to Government delivery needs in terms of size, location, specification, value for money and optimum utilisation.

Offices are likely to remain an essential place of work but now may be used differently by personnel working a hybrid work arrangement whereby they attend the workplace for part of the week only.In March 2021 the Government published &ldquo;Making Remote Work - National Remote Work Strategy&rdquo;. The objective of the Strategy is to ensure that remote working is a permanent feature in the Irishworkplace in a way that maximises economic, social and environmental benefits.</p><p>Throughout 2021, OPW actively engaged with the Civil Service Management Board to advance a centralised framework on blended working across the Civil Service. This centralised framework forblended working across the Civil Service was published in March 2022. Government Departments are now formalising their own blended working policies in accordance with this centralisedframework.The OPW has been actively engaged with Government Departments and Agencies on how the workplace can be adapted to meeting new operational requirements in the context of hybrid workstrategies. New work arrangements will impact on office accommodation requirements, and will assist in advancing OPW strategies to optimise the accommodation portfolio and consolidate activities over the longer term.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-06-16a.365.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022061600067#WRJ00700"><p>I welcome the findings published in the report, which provide further evidence that remote working will, on balance, change Ireland for the better. The research was conducted in line with the goals set out in <i>Making Remote Work</i>, Ireland&rsquo;s National Remote Work Strategy, which I launched in January 2021, and the publication of this report is just one of the many actions that have been achieved in the Strategy to date. </p><p>The report is authored by an economist in my Department who is part of the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service (IGEES). While research papers like this do not necessarily represent an official Government or Departmental view, I have welcomed the report and I believe the research is an important contribution to our evidence base as we continue to develop remote work policy to maximise the economic, social and environmental benefits that it can bring. </p><p>Remote working will continue to play a significant role as we emerge from the pandemic, giving workers greater work-life balance and flexibility while providing firms with increased pools of talent to choose from. Remote working will be a key mechanism for achieving our employment targets, helping those most distant from the labour force into work, and further contributing to achieving our ambitious climate targets. Female labour force participation in Ireland is currently at a record high, with over 1.2 million women in the labour force as of Q1 2022, an increase of over 100,000 from pre-pandemic levels. This is a development that is likely to be at least in part facilitated by the wider adoption of remote working arrangements. </p><p>The research also highlights how remote working can lead to more balanced regional development. My Department recently published new Regional Enterprise Plans to 2024 in which there is a focus on promoting remote working opportunities and investing in infrastructures across the nine regions. The plans were launched at regional locations during February and March 2022.</p><p>My Department co-ordinated the implementation of the National Remote Work Strategy&rsquo;s actions through an Interdepartmental Group. There has been significant progress in implementing these actions, and some key achievements to date are outlined below: </p><p>- On 25th January, the Government approved the priority drafting of the Right to Request Remote Working Bill 2022. The new law will set out a clear legal framework around which requesting, approving or refusing such a request can be based. Pre-legislative scrutiny of the General Scheme by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment commenced on 9th of February, with three meetings having been held to date. Officials in my Department attended a further meeting on 18th May. The intention remains that the Bill will be progressed through the Oireachtas as quickly as possible. Following publication of the Joint Oireachtas Committee&rsquo;s Report on pre-legislative scrutiny, any recommendations made will be reviewed and considered. I want to emphasise that I am happy to listen to proposed amendments to the Bill.</p><p>- The publication of the Code of Practice on the Right to Disconnect in April 2021 by the Workplace Relations Commission.</p><p>-  An enhanced income tax deduction for remote workers amounting to 30 percent of expenses for heat, electricity and broadband was announced in Budget 2022.</p><p>- The Government is investing heavily in remote work infrastructure throughout the country to ensure that communities across Ireland are in a position to benefit from the opportunities presented by increased remote working.-</p><p>- The Connected Hubs Fund awarded funding of &euro;8.9m to 117 remote working hub projects and Broadband Connection Points in July 2021 to upgrade Ireland&rsquo;s remote work infrastructure. An additional &euro;5m has been made available under the 2022 Connected Hubs Call. &euro;18.5m in funding under the Town and Village Renewal Scheme was also announced recently, with successful projects including 28 remote working proposals.</p><p>- To date, a total of approximately &euro;100m has been provided by the Department of Rural and Community Development through its various funding streams to support the development of remote working infrastructure across the country. This includes &euro;76 million in funding for projects under the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund (RRDF), many of which involved the regeneration of historic town centre buildings as enterprise centres and co-working hubs.</p><p>- In October 2021, over &euro;9.3 million in funding was awarded to projects around the country through Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Regional Enterprise Transition Scheme, with successful applicants including hubs and enterprise centres throughout the country.</p><p>- The publication of the Civil Service Blended Policy Framework by DPER in March 2022 will help deliver the Programme for Government commitment to move to 20% remote working across the sector.</p><p>- My Department is continuing to develop and promote its Guidance for Working Remotely webpage. This webpage acts as a central access point for employers and employees and brings together the existing State guidance, legislation and advice on remote work into one place. The webpage is a live resource and is updated regularly. The webpage includes an Employer Checklist to provide employers with a quick way to successfully navigate the adoption of remote working arrangements.</p></reply>

Depending on the specific circumstances, matters pertaining to assault and/or sexual harassment would likely require the direct involvement of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p>  <p>  There are various legislative requirements, policies and systems in place to underpin a safe working environment across each of the eleven buildings occupied by my Department and its Offices, which include the Companies Registration Office, the Intellectual Property Office of Ireland, the Labour Court, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement and the Workplace Relations Commission. These include, but are not limited, to the following: </p>  <p>  -  Under the Employment Equality Acts 1998-2015, sexual harassment and harassment of an employee (including agency workers and trainees) in the workplace is against the law. This includes sexual harassment and harassment by co-workers; the employer; clients, customers or other business contacts of the employer.  Information on the Employment Equality Acts can be found at www.workplacerelations.ie.</p>  <p>  -  The Safety, Health and Welfare Act 2005 deals with a range of issues, including setting out requirements and advice to employers to guard against inappropriate behaviour on their premises. Information on this legislation is available at www.hsa.ie, the website of the Health and Safety Authority of Ireland HSA), an agency under the remit of my Department. This legislation requires employers to report any accidents and dangerous occurrences to be reported to the H.S.A. State Authorities also have a statutory requirement to report any unplanned or uncontrolled occurrence or sequence of occurrences that caused or had the potential to cause injury, ill-health, disease, and/or damage/loss to property/service to the State Claims Agency.</p>  <p>  There are also various Civil Service codes of conduct, procedures and internal processes to protect the health, safety and welfare of staff and visitors. The Civil Service Code of Standards and Behaviour is an important framework within which all civil servants are expected to work, and this includes observing appropriate standards of behaviour at work. This is available at www.sipo.ie.</p>  <p>  The Civil Service is committed to protecting and promoting dignity and respect across the organisation. The Civil Service Dignity at Work 2015 policy aims to promote respect, dignity, safety, and equality in the workplace. Every member of staff is made aware that all forms of bullying, harassment, and sexual harassment are unacceptable, and every member of staff has a duty to behave in an acceptable and respectful manner towards other staff members and visitors alike. This policy can be found at www.gov.ie.  Related to this, and at the same website, is the Civil Service Disciplinary Code, which is also underpinned by various legislative requirements. The Disciplinary Code sets out the various steps involved to investigate allegations of misconduct, which may include assault and or/sexual assault. Any disciplinary matters would be an internal matter for the HR Unit of the Department to consider.</p>  <p>  Supplementing all of the above are internal Departmental policies such as the Department&rsquo;s Health and Safety Statement; a Physical Access Policy which includes details regarding Departmental premises and a CCTV Policy. Such policies could also be used as part of any investigative requirement, either internally or with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in the event of an allegation being notified to the Department by a staff member or an external person.</p>  <p>  My Department does not operate any public offices so the volume of members of the public onsite at Departmental premises is generally low. Nonetheless I can assure the Deputy that any allegations of assault or sexual harassment by a member of staff or of the public, would be treated with the utmost gravity and involve all appropriate mechanisms, legal and otherwise, to ensure that the matter was investigated in a thorough and proper fashion. </p>  <p>  The specific day-to-day operations of the Agencies under the aegis of my Department are a matter for their respective Boards and Heads of Agencies. All of the legislative requirements referred to above are applicable to each Agency and the public sector codes of practice and requirements of the highest standards of behaviour expected of staff essentially mirror those of the Civil Service.</p></reply>

These levies will work in a similar way to the plastic bag levy, which has been so successful in tackling plastic bag litter.  These new environmental levies will be introduced incrementally, with the initial focus on the introduction of levies on single-use disposable hot drinks cups later this year.</p><p>Amendments to the Bill at Committee Stage provide for the mandatory inclusion in the Circular Economy Strategy of sectoral targets in respect of, <i>inter alia</i>, the retail and packaging sectors. The targets to be set out in respect of a sector must include appropriate targets in respect of reductions in material resource consumption and the use of non-recyclable material; increases in the use of reusable products and materials; increased levels of repair and reuse; or improved maintenance and optimised use of goods, products and materials. The strategy must also set out the actions necessary to meet those targets. The Bill also provides that a report must be prepared by or on behalf of the Minister examining how single-use packaging used in the sale of fruit and vegetables can be reduced. The Bill does not contain provisions in relation to floor area use in retail outlets.</p><p>Through the Single Use Plastics Regulations 2021 some measures are already in place for certain single-use items and further measures will be introduced in the coming years which will significantly reduce the use of single-use plastic being placed on the market. Specifically in relation to wet wipes, compulsory marking requirements were introduced from 3 July 2021 and an extended producer responsibility scheme will be operational from 31 December 2024. </p><p>There are significant opportunities for the retail sector to play a leading role in the circular economy transition.  The Retail Forum, which is chaired by the Minister of State for Employment, Business and Retail, provides a platform to allow key issues of relevance to the sector to be discussed with a view to identifying practical actions which can be taken by Government or by industry itself to support the sector. Under the sustainability theme, which is a key focus for the Retail Forum, a Retail Forum Working Group &lsquo;Future of Retail &ndash; Green Transition Working Group&rsquo; has been established. The Retail Forum will work with relevant stakeholders, including my Department, to progress actions identified by the Working Group and drive forward relevant Government policies. </p><p>There are a number of supports available to encourage and assist businesses, including retailers, implement circular economy practices:</p><p>-  The Circular Economy Innovation Grants Scheme, launched by my Department in 2021, is designed to help advance the circular economy amongst local communities, NGOs and small businesses, and raise awareness of the need to transition to sustainable patterns of production and consumption.</p><p>-  The Climate Enterprise Action Fund, administered by Enterprise Ireland, provides Climate Action Vouchers to assist businesses in identifying operational opportunities in a range of areas including the circular economy.</p><p>-  Local Enterprise Offices are assisting small businesses through the Green for Micro Programme, which provides training and advice on a range of subjects including circular economy principles and the transition to a circular business model.</p></reply>

Under the SEAI home energy upgrade schemes, the general principle applies whereby grant funding can only be issued once per measure per property. </p>  <p>  However, under the National Home Energy Upgrade Scheme, a homeowner may be permitted to avail of a second grant for a measure where it is recommended in the One Stop Shop Home Energy Assessment to achieve the B2 and heat pump target. In cases where the OSS determines through the Home Energy Assessment and Heat Loss Indicator assessment that a second wall insulation is required to meet the heat pump requirement, then grant support for a second measure is permitted as follows:  </p>  <p>- Internal Wall Insulation is eligible where cavity has previously been funded. </p>  <p>- External wall insulation is eligible where either cavity or internal wall insulation has been funded.</p>  <p>  In addition, as part of the package of supports approved by Government, reforms have also been made to the Better Energy Warmer Homes Scheme whereby applications may now be accepted from qualifying homeowners who previously received supports under the Scheme, but who could still benefit from deeper upgrade measures (revisits). This means that homeowners of properties built and occupied before January 1993 and have a pre-works BER of E, F or G will not be precluded from applying for a second time for qualifying works not previously carried out on their properties. </p>  <p>  With regard to the specific information sought by the Deputy, the SEAI advise that under the residential and community energy efficiency schemes there was a carbon emissions saving of 38.8 ktCO2 in 2021, of this 21.6 ktCO2 relates to residential buildings. The most recent data available from SEAI shows carbon savings of 8.11 ktCO2 across the residential energy efficiency schemes to date this year. </p>  <p>  Officials of my Department will provide the Deputy with a separate table setting out data on the improved BER ratings per SEAI Scheme for 2021 and 2022 year-to-date.</p></reply>

A key action for 2022 arising from this is Ag Obair Le Ch&eacute;ile. This is a comprehensive action plan to develop my Department's people, culture and organisation to deliver, improve and transform the Department.</p>  <p>  My Department has in place a number of safeguards for both our staff and members of the public who must attend our offices for services. </p>  <p>  The Civil Service has a robust Dignity at Work Policy that promotes respect, dignity, safety, and equality in the workplace and provides the framework for my Department to examine complaints of bullying, harassment and sexual harassment in the workplace. </p>  <p>  My Department also operates under Circular 19/2016 Civil Service Disciplinary Code. The purpose of this Code is to set out the arrangements for dealing with disciplinary matters in the Civil Service. It is also to ensure that all civil servants are aware that if there is a failure to adhere to the required standards of conduct, work performance and attendance, the disciplinary procedure set out in this Circular will apply. This procedure will be initiated where a concern arises about the conduct, work performance, and/or attendance of a civil servant. This procedure will provide a fair and efficient process for dealing with any such concern. This Code applies to all civil servants other than new entrants serving in a probationary capacity. The  Guidelines on the Management of Probation in the Civil Service provides the mechanism to address performance issues with new entrant staff.  </p>  <p>  These central Civil Service policies are publicly available on the Department of Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform's website. </p>  <p>  I have asked the bodies under the aegis of my Department to provide the information requested for their organisations directly to the Deputy.</p></reply>

I would ask the Deputy to contact my office if a response has not been received within ten days.</p>  <p>  With respect to the Deputy's question regarding test extensions, EU Member States are required to carry out periodic roadworthiness inspections on motor vehicles at specified regular intervals. </p>  <p>  Under Regulation 3(2) of the Road Traffic (National Car Test) Regulations 2017 (S.I. No. 415/2017), which sets out the applicable dates for periodic testing, the initial test due date for a vehicle is determined using the date of registration of that vehicle and subsequent test due dates fall on anniversaries of that date. Accordingly, all test due dates are predetermined based on the date of registration of a vehicle and any NCT certificate issued in respect of a vehicle is only valid up to the test due date that falls after that certificate was issued.</p>  <p>  Ireland, like all Member States, is obliged to adhere to the specified minimum intervals between roadworthiness inspections. Permitting the validity of roadworthiness certificates to be extended without inspection would place the State in breach of our obligations under European law and may negatively impact road safety should the vehicle in question be unsafe to drive. </p></reply>

Under the Roads Acts 1993-2015, the operation and management of individual national roads is a matter for Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII), in conjunction with the local authorities concerned. Therefore, matters relating to the day to day operations regarding national roads, including toll roads and the establishment of a system of tolls, are within the remit of TII. More specifically, the statutory power to levy tolls, to make toll bye-laws and to enter into agreements with private investors are vested in TII under Part V of the Roads Act 1993 (as amended). </p><p>Toll revenue is a very important source of revenue for TII and is used to fund essential services including the operation and maintenance of the primary and secondary road network; Dublin Tunnel, the Jack Lynch Tunnel; and TII&rsquo;s Motorway Control Centre.</p><p>In addition, the Public Private Partnership (PPP) toll concessions on the national road network are also under the remit of TII.  However, the toll revenue generated by these toll roads is collected by the PPP concessionaire and generally funds the construction debt as well as the operation and maintenance of the road itself.</p><p>Therefore, because of the criticality of tolling revenue streams for the smooth functioning of our roads network and access tunnels, the fact that PPP toll concessionaires own the revenue collected on those tolls, and TII&rsquo;s statutory obligations, TII are not in a position to introduce any additional exemptions. </p><p>Noting the above position, I have referred your question to TII for a direct reply. Please advise my private office if you do not receive a reply within 10 working days.</p></reply>

As well as an increased allocation of &euro;289 million administered through the National Transport Authority (NTA) to Active Travel, I was delighted to also announce funding of &euro;60 million for investment in our Greenways.</p>  <p>  The overall increase in funding across urban and rural Ireland will not only support the construction and improvement of safe and connected walking and cycling infrastructure, but also the deployment of almost 250 dedicated Active Travel staff in local authorities around the country.</p>  <p>  In addition to the increased funding for walking and cycling infrastructure, a number of smaller-scale initiatives are being progressed by my Department to support and promote efforts to increase safe Active Travel. The Department of Transport funds the delivery of CycleRight training through Cycling Ireland, which delivers cycling training to school-children around the country and equips them with the skills to cycle safely.</p>  <p>  In partnership with the Department of Education we also launched the Safe Routes to Schools Programme last year, which aims to accelerate the delivery of safe walking, scooting and cycling infrastructure on key access routes to schools. It has had a great response, with applications received from schools in every county in Ireland. &euro;15m has been allocated to the 170 schools which were selected in round 1 of the programme. </p>  <p>  The step-change in funding and the introduction of various innovative measures to encourage safe and connected Active Travel is proof of the Government's commitment to this area, and I look forward to the delivery of the numerous projects and programmes around the country, including in rural areas. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, TII (Transport Infrastructure Ireland) are developing a National Cycle Network that will identify routes for development all around the country that will work with the Regional and Local Cycle Networks being developed by the NTA.</p></reply>

This is expressly prohibited by the EU&rsquo;s Solvency II framework. However, I can assure the Deputy that Government is committed to improving the cost and availability of insurance for all consumers, businesses and community groups. This includes niche sectors such as thatched properties. </p><p>The whole-of-Government approach being taken through the<i>Action Plan for Insurance Reform</i>sets out 66 actions which aim to improve both the cost and availability of this key financial service. The <i>Second Implementation Report </i>shows that 80 per cent of these actions have been delivered. Government&rsquo;s focus will now move to delivering the remaining elements.</p><p>One of the signature achievements of the reform agenda is the implementation of the Personal Injury Guidelines, which significantly reduce awards for a range of injuries, particularly of soft tissue. At the same time, the Department is working with the IDA to broaden the supply of insurance in the market, including in areas which have been identified as &lsquo;pinch-points&rsquo;, such as that highlighted by the Deputy. The IDA has commenced a multi-phased engagement process with targeted overseas underwriters and will seek to leverage the developments of the Government insurance reform agenda to date. </p><p>I have previously raised the issue of thatched roof properties with both Insurance Ireland and Brokers Ireland in meetings with them. Brokers Ireland has informed me that it has a dedicated information service for people having insurance issues with their thatched roof properties and has established a special email address to deal with these queries, which is thatchedroofqueries@brokersireland.ie </p><p>Details on available support schemes for thatched properties, such as the thatching grant, are best addressed to the Department for Housing, Local Government and Heritage. Under Action 6 of the government strategy <i>A Living Tradition: a strategy to enhance the understanding, minding and handing on of our built vernacular heritage</i>published in December 2021, the Department for Housing, Local Government and Heritage will be conducting a consultation on the issues relating to the insurance of thatched properties in Ireland. This will investigate and work to resolve the issue of affordability and availability of insurance for thatched buildings.</p><p>Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to assure the Deputy that securing a more sustainable and competitive market through deepening and widening the supply of insurance in Ireland remains a key policy priority for this Government and that I will continue to work towards this objective with my colleagues.</p></reply>

However, as a result of the strength of the policy supports introduced by the Government to protect incomes, jobs and firms, the labour market has been at the forefront of a remarkable recovery in Ireland&rsquo;s economy following the pandemic. </p>  <p>  The number of people at work has increased to a new record, with more than 2&frac12; million people in employment in the first quarter of this year, with an associated headline unemployment rate of 5 per cent in the same period. This has resulted in the level of employment increasing by 160,000 since the first quarter in 2020 as the pandemic reached our shores. Encouragingly this is the result of much stronger labour force participation particularly among females, with more than 100,000 additional women in the workforce compared to the first quarter of 2020. The most recent labour market figures are a remarkable achievement that has occurred more rapidly than expected. Indeed the Government&rsquo;s Economic Recovery Plan, published only last year, set an employment target of 2&frac12; million by 2024. Clearly the ambitious policies set out in that Plan along with those introduced during the pandemic had a much more rapid impact than anticipated. </p>  <p>  Looking at the latest data, the momentum in the labour market has continued into the second quarter, with the unemployment rate standing at 4.7 per cent in May, the lowest rate since 2006. The labour market appears to be at, or very close to, full employment. Of course challenges remain, with not all sectors back to pre-pandemic levels of employment, while shortages are emerging in many others. Government is very conscious of these issues and will seek to orientate labour market policies towards growing sectors and in-demand skills.</p>  <p>  In sum, it is clear that the labour market has recovered strongly to date, and that the Government&rsquo;s labour market policy response - effectively maintaining the employer-employee link to prevent labour market scarring - has paved the way in this respect.  Of course I am very conscious that risks to the outlook remain heavily tilted to the downside, not least the continued international uncertainty and the potential for further fallout from the invasion of Ukraine, particularly as regards energy and other commodity prices. However as we face into this uncertain outlook we do so from a position of strength. </p></reply>

The Communication emphasises the broad nature of the impact and policy response. </p><p>In May, the EU published the RePowerEU Plan with the dual objective of ending the EU's dependence on Russian fossil fuels and tacking the climate crisis. Ireland broadly welcome the proposals, particularly on the need to ramp-up investment in cross border energy infrastructure, including electricity interconnection. We continue to engage proactively at an EU level to consider and discuss the proposals in detail.</p><p>In addition, through my position as President of the Eurogroup, I have prioritised discussions on energy prices, inflation and the implications for growth at Eurogroup meetings. I also briefed European leaders at the March Euro Summit on the economic situation, and invited the director of the EU Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators to attend and speak at Eurogroup on energy prices.</p><p>From a domestic perspective, the Government recognises the challenges of rising price pressures and has responded to help to ease the impact on businesses and households, particularly those on low incomes. On a cumulative basis, &euro;2.4 billion has been announced in cost of living measures to date. This includes excise duty reductions, an energy credit and fuel allowance payments. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-06-16a.482.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022061600070#WRM02900"><p>Firstly, it is important to note that neither I, nor the Central Bank, have the power to direct insurers to sell any specific product, or to make it available at a particular price. This is reinforced by the EU Solvency II directive which expressly prohibits Government from doing so. </p><p>As the Deputy is aware, the Personal Injuries Guidelines came into force in April 2021 and materially reduced award levels for many categories of common injuries. Latest data from PIAB indicates that on average award levels are 42 per cent lower than under the previous Book of Quantum. Furthermore, 72 per cent of awards are now under &euro;15,000, while 49 per cent are under &euro;10,000. Consequently, a number of common injuries will move to the jurisdiction of the District rather than the Circuit Court, thus reducing associated legal fees. The Guidelines also provide guidance in relation to injuries previously not included in the Book of Quantum and will be used by both the PIAB and the judiciary.</p><p>They should therefore help to bring more certainty to the process, and as such reinforce the benefits of using PIAB, which should further reduce the costs of claims. Notwithstanding this, I understand there are a number of legal cases ongoing at the moment which are impacting on the finalisation of awards. Minister Fleming has met the CEOs of the main insurance firms on a number of occasions to discuss the Government&rsquo;s expectation that insurers will reflect the decrease in award levels through reduced premiums, as part of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to ensure that savings of the insurance reform agenda are passed onto customers.</p><p>Another key development with regard to insurance costs has been the Central Bank&rsquo;s decision to prohibit price-walking from 1 July 2022. This is a form of dual pricing whereby customers are charged higher premiums relative to the expected costs the longer they remain with an insurance provider. This ban is a balanced approach that will protect customers who prefer to stay with their current provider from being subject to a &lsquo;loyalty penalty&rsquo;, while still allowing customers to benefit from discounts from new providers. </p><p>Other actions which aim to assist in lowering costs include measures to reduce fraud, enacting legislation making perjury easier to prosecute, as well as efforts by the Office to Promote Competition in the Insurance Market to attract new providers. Work is also continuing across Government to drive forward the outstanding aspects of the Action Plan for Insurance Reform, including: further changes intended to reduce costs such as strengthening PIAB; and reforming the duty of care. It is my belief that the overall implementation of the Action Plan should help to improve both the cost and availability of insurance. Recent data from the Central Statistics Office shows that average private motor insurance prices have fallen by 41 per cent since their peak in July 2016, and it is my hope that these ongoing reforms will bolster this downward trend in the wider insurance market, to the benefit of consumers, businesses and community groups.</p></reply>

A public consultation on PSD2 is open on the European Commission&rsquo;s website until 2 August.</p>  <p>  Independent ATM operators are regarded as Professional Cash Handlers. The Central Bank monitors all Professional Cash Handlers involved in the recirculation of euro banknotes for compliance with the Decision of the European Central Bank (ECB/2010/14) on the authenticity and fitness checking and recirculation of euro banknotes. Professional Cash Handlers must ensure compliance with Decision ECB/2010/14.</p>  <p>  The Banking and Payments Federation of Ireland (BPFI) collects data on the total number of bank operated ATMs cross the country. This has been declining in recent years mainly because banks have sold, mainly offsite, ATMs to independent ATM operators and more recently also due to branch closures.</p>  <p>  Latest data from the BPFI shows that in December 2021 there were 1,787 ATMs operated by banks, this is down from 2,353 in December 2020. The BPFI estimates that the total number of ATM&rsquo;s was approximately 2,900 in December 2021.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently undertaking a review of the retail banking sector. The Retail Banking Review has commenced its work and a public consultation is open on the Department&rsquo;s website where members of the public can make a submission to the Department of Finance on issues, specifically Question 7 which seeks views on the regulation of ATMs, by 08 of July.</p></reply>

Some key construction materials have experienced very high levels of inflation, including, 28.5 per cent for rough timber, 51.3 per cent for structural steel and reinforcing metal and 21 per cent for plaster. </p>  <p>  Many of the factors explaining the current high inflationary environment are not within Ireland&rsquo;s control. These include the inflationary impact &mdash; via energy prices &mdash;  of Russia&rsquo;s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine; the impact of a rapid rebound in global demand post-pandemic; and blockages in global supply chains affecting the availability of key inputs. </p>  <p>  These events will clearly have an impact of the price of new homes coming onto the market. However, it is important to note that inflation in the price of second hand homes is currently higher than inflation in new homes. The CSO&rsquo;s Residential Property Price Index shows that from Q1 2021 to Q1 2022, the price of new homes increased by 6.2 per cent and the price of second hand homes increased by 17.8 per cent. This indicates that the mismatch between demand and supply is the primary driver of residential property price inflation, not the rising cost of input prices.</p>  <p>  As a result, the Government&rsquo;s primary response to mitigate residential price inflation has been to increase supply. Under Housing for All, the target is to build 33,000 new homes on average per annum to 2030. In the twelve months to April 2022, 32,456 new homes were commenced. Moreover, in the 12 months to end Q1 2022, there were 44,491 units granted planning permissions nationally. </p>  <p>  As well as increasing the supply of homes in general, more work needs to be done to increase the supply of social and affordable homes. In Budget 2022, &euro;4 billion was allocated towards housing, including capital funding of &euro;2.58 billion, a large proportion of which will be used to deliver 9,200 new social homes. Under Housing for All, there is a commitment to invest over &euro;4 billion in housing per year to 2030. </p>  <p>  Housing for All targets the delivery of over 90,000 social homes, 54,000 affordable homes for purchase or rent, 18,000 cost rental homes and 170,000 private homes by 2030. Achieving these targets will make a real difference in improving affordability for our citizens, including young families.</p>  <p>  Young families can also avail of supports such as the Help to Buy scheme, which provides a refund of income tax and deposit interest retention tax, and the Local Authority Home Loan.</p>  <p>  All of these measures demonstrate the need to take a multi-faceted approach to increase the supply of new housing.</p></reply>

Ireland&rsquo;s ability to attract and retain FDI reflects our strong legal and regulatory landscape, our track record as a stable and pro-enterprise jurisdiction, and our talented and flexible workforce. These unique features continue to support our competitive advantages, which are recognised and valued by the multinational sector. </p>  <p>  During the Covid-19 pandemic, the resilience of the multinational sector proved remarkable, with the sector supporting the economy during the worst of the crisis and now helping to bolster the economic recovery. </p>  <p>  The stock of FDI in Ireland continues to grow, reaching over &euro;1,200bn in the first quarter of 2022. Last year, the Industrial Development Agency reported the highest increase in FDI employment in a single year, indicative of the strength of the FDI sector in Ireland. </p>  <p>  Against the backdrop of current geopolitical instability and uncertainty, the FDI environment is likely to face challenges over the coming years. The war in Ukraine may result in a reconfiguration of the global economy while at the same time the pandemic has dealt a significant blow to globalisation. The extent to which this transpires will only be seen with time, but deglobalisation &ndash; should it occur &ndash; could result in lower levels of global FDI, with impacts on living standards and productivity in host countries.</p>  <p>  Given that a number of these factors are beyond our control, we must focus on the factor we can control, ensuring that Ireland remains an attractive environment for FDI investment. </p></reply>

The scope is confined to multinational groups with turnover in excess of &euro;20 billion annually. Residual profit is profit greater than 10% of turnover. </p>  <p>  Pillar Two provides that the minimum effective rate is 15% for multinational enterprises with annual turnover in excess of &euro;750m.</p>  <p>  It is expected that the Agreement will bring long-term stability and certainty to the international tax framework arising from discussions which have taken place.</p>  <p>  Importantly for Ireland, the agreement provides that the minimum effective rate for those companies in the scope of the agreement will be 15%, and this will provide the critical certainty for Government and business alike.  At the same time we protected the 12&frac12;% rate for out of scope business which will continue to be an important part of our offering in the future.</p>  <p>  The agreement will also continue to support innovation and growth, acknowledging as it does the need for innovation incentives such as for research and development. </p>  <p>  This is a global agreement, and will ultimately underpin the required certainty and stability in the international tax framework, important to both business and government alike, when it comes to making future investment decisions.</p>  <p>  I have long held that there will be a price to pay but it is a price that is worth paying to reduce the risk of disputes and escalating trade tensions. Instead this agreement will achieve greater tax certainty and the removal of unilateral measures such as digital services taxes.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s economic success is not simply an accident of history. It has been achieved by identifying our strengths and developing a strong offering that meets the needs of modern business. While Ireland is not blessed with abundant natural resources, we have invested in education so that we have our own resource - a highly educated workforce whose skills meet the needs of modern enterprises.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s place in the world is that of a business friendly country, deeply integrated with the global economy, and an ideal location for companies looking to access the EU, the world&rsquo;s largest consumer market.</p>  <p>  The historic agreement achieved at the OECD last October, will provide a platform for Ireland's continued competitiveness and attractiveness for Foreign Direct Investment.</p></reply>

Irish exports recorded a robust start to 2022, with a continued strong performance in the multinational sector. The Irish modified current account, which strips out the distorting effects of globalisation, is in a very strong position and is expected to remain in surplus over the medium term. The Irish labour market has also remained resilient, with the unemployment rate of 4.7 per cent in May the lowest since 2006. </p>  <p>  Within a European context, Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery from the pandemic has been particularly remarkable. Modified domestic demand &ndash; a measure of the domestic economy - was almost 6 per cent above its pre-pandemic level in the first quarter of 2022, whilst domestic demand for the EU as a whole remains broadly in line with pre-pandemic level.  </p>  <p>  However, Ireland and our fellow EU member states are currently facing significant headwinds to economic growth. Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine represents a large supply-side shock to the domestic economy, with the main channel of transmission from the war to the Irish economy coming via the sharp rise in energy and other commodity prices.</p>  <p>  Consumer price (HICP) inflation picked up sharply over the second half of last year and stood at 8.3 per cent in May. Almost every advanced economy in the world is in the same position, with euro area inflation reaching a record 8.1 per cent in May. </p>  <p>  Taking account of all factors, the international environment is one of exceptional uncertainty and there are significant risks to the economic outlook for Ireland, as well as for the EU. The war in Ukraine presents a serious headwind to economic activity, with rising inflation and widespread uncertainty posing a threat to consumer spending and business investment throughout Europe. </p></reply>

Almost every advanced economy in the world is in the same position, with euro area inflation reaching a record 8.1 per cent in May. </p>  <p>  The key driver behind the elevated level of inflation at present is the sharp rise in wholesale energy prices, food and other commodity prices since the onset of the war in Ukraine. Global supply chain disruptions, including the availability of inputs and transport bottlenecks have also added to inflationary pressures. The war in Ukraine and China&rsquo;s zero-Covid strategy are compounding these disruptions. Domestically, the ongoing mismatch between demand and supply, including in parts of the labour market, continues to place upward pressure on prices.</p>  <p>  Pass-through price effects from higher energy prices are already being felt in other sectors, such as food (via increased fertiliser and fuel costs) and consumer goods (via higher energy inputs). Indeed, the rise in non-energy or &lsquo;core&rsquo; inflation suggests that inflationary pressures are becoming increasingly broad-based. </p>  <p>  At the time of SPU 2022, the Department forecast average inflation of 6&frac14; per cent for this year. However, with many of the risks outlined in the SPU having already come to pass, there are upside risks to this projection. Needless to say, the war in Ukraine and in particular the escalation of sanctions against Russia will continue to shape the outlook for inflation over the short term.</p>  <p>  The Government is acutely aware of the cost pressures currently facing households and businesses and has announced &euro;2.4 billion in cost of living measures since last October to alleviate some of this pressure. However, the causes of current price pressures are not within our control. Whilst the Government will continue to help with the cost of living challenge, resources are limited and we cannot cushion households and businesses from the entire impact. Furthermore, in calibrating how we respond to the current challenges, it is important that we strike the right balance and ensure that policy doesn&rsquo;t inadvertently add further inflationary pressures into the system.</p>  <p>  Finally, it is worth pointing out that monetary policy is the first line of defence against inflation.  In this context, the European Central Bank has indicated a tightening of policy in the coming months.  By slowing demand in the economy, this should help bring demand and supply back into balance, with positive implications for inflation. </p></reply>

The outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic turned the economy on its head, but we weathered the storm and achieved a remarkable economic recovery. </p>  <p>  The economy is now facing new and significant headwinds as a result of the war in Ukraine, including rising energy and commodity prices.

The labour market has remained resilient, with the unemployment rate of 4.7 per cent in May the lowest since 2006.

The scheme provides income or corporation tax relief for qualifying expenditure incurred in refurbishing/converting qualifying buildings which are located within pre-determined Special Regeneration Areas.</p>  <p>  During Committee Stage of the 2021 Finance Bill, I gave a commitment to review the initiative. This is being done at present in line with my Department's Tax Expenditure Guidelines and before its scheduled sunset date at the end of this year.   I am informed that it is expected to be completed shortly. </p>  <p>  I would further inform the Deputy that it is not proposed that the review will incorporate consultation with local authorities at this time. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, proposals for the amendment of tax reliefs must be assessed in accordance with my Department's Tax Expenditure Guidelines. These make clear the importance that any policy proposal which involves tax expenditures should only occur in limited circumstances. In particular, they provide that a tax-based incentive should only be considered where it would be more efficient than a direct expenditure intervention.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, any decisions regarding taxation measures are made in the context of the annual Budget and Finance Bill processes, at the appropriate time, and having regard to the sound management of the public finances.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-06-16a.527.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022061600072#WRO01200"><p>Section 28B of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 provides for the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) which is an economy-wide enterprise support for eligible businesses in respect of eligible employees. The scheme closed with effect from 31 May 2022.   </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, eligibility to EWSS is based on the employer demonstrating that its business is likely to experience a 30% reduction in turnover or orders during a specific reference period and that this disruption to business is caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.   In addition, the business must also have tax clearance. The eligibility criteria set down in the legislation provides that where a business commenced trading in 2019 (but not later than 1 November 2019), it must be able to demonstrate at least a 30% reduction in either turnover or customer orders by comparing the trading months in 2019 to the equivalent months in 2021.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that the question of whether a business is commencing or is the continuation of an existing business is determined by the facts of the case rather than through EWSS legislation. A substantial body of existing case law, in the wider tax context, exists on this issue and certain principles have been established. These established principles include whether the management and control, employees, activities, customer base, suppliers, and accounting systems of the business are substantially the same following any change in activity. </p>  <p>  Revenue have clarified that EWSS legislation, specifically Section 28B Financial Provisions (Covid-19) (No. 2) Act 2020, makes references to "employer's business". Therefore, tests for eligibility are performed on an employer&rsquo;s business, not separate service offerings or diversification of services but the business as a whole.  As such, actual turnover for 2019, i.e. 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2019, instead of projections, is used to compare to turnover in periods that EWSS was claimed to determine eligibility.  As the employer (details supplied) has not met the eligibility criteria of EWSS that requires a business to have suffered a 30% reduction in turnover as a result of Covid-19, Revenue has advised the company they need to correct all payroll submissions for periods where the EWSS has been incorrectly claimed and repay any relevant EWSS amounts and PRSI credits it has claimed.</p>  <p>  Revenue works closely with businesses to put in place arrangements appropriate to the circumstances and viability of each business in order to secure payment of any debt over a reasonable timeframe. In addition, certain tax and other Revenue debts, including overpayments of EWSS, may be deferred or &lsquo;warehoused&rsquo; if a business is unable to pay these debts as a consequence of the impact of COVID-19.  The scheme allows businesses who are eligible for the warehousing scheme to defer paying such debts until 1 January 2023 (or 30 April 2023 in certain circumstances) and applies a lower interest rate of 3% per annum on the repayment of such warehoused debts after that date. </p>  <p>  I am further advised by Revenue that it has engaged extensively with the Business in question and confirmed that it has made them aware of Revenue&rsquo;s Complaint and Review Procedures and will continue to work with this business to facilitate it in paying its Revenue liabilities.</p></reply>

The revised policy, which applies to staff of the Department of Finance, aims to promote respect, dignity, safety and equality in the workplace. The policy also sets out the process of reporting such instances to a Designated Person. Along with the Civil Service Code of Standards and Behaviour, all new entrants to the Department are provided with a copy of the Dignity at Work Policy and it is also brought to the attention of staff during the induction programme. The policy on bullying and harassment is also included in the Staff Handbook which is provided to all staff. All of these documents are available to the Department&rsquo;s employees on the internal intranet site, as well as publicly on www.gov.ie.</p><p>My Department does not operate in direct contact with the public.</p><p>A number of the bodies under the aegis of my Department have direct contact with members of the public and some of these bodies have employees; they have advised the following:</p><p>The Central Bank has a wide range of people policies which are readily available on the Bank&rsquo;s intranet and website. The Dignity at Work Policy and Charter would be the most appropriate policy in the context of sexual harassment. The section of the Bank&rsquo;s website &lsquo;Make a complaint against the Central Bank of Ireland&rsquo; provides detailed contact details and instructions for members of the public on how to make complaints.  </p><p>The Central Bank provides staff, by way of secondment, to another of the bodies under the aegis of my Department, the Investor Compensation Company DAC (ICC). As such, the ICC is covered by the Bank&rsquo;s policies.</p><p>The Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO) is committed to protecting the dignity and respect of its employees and users of its services and understands its obligations under the Employment Equality Acts 1998-2011 and the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 in this regard. The FSPO has adopted the central policy <i>Dignity at Work - an Anti-Bullying, Harassment and Sexual Harassment Policy</i><i>for the Civil Service,</i>a key aim of which is to provide awareness regarding the steps which employees may take if they believe that they have been bullied, harassed, or sexually harassed. It also outlines the recommended procedures which should be followed by all parties to complaints regarding bullying, harassment, and sexual harassment and provides a clear reporting framework for any instances of bullying, harassment and sexual harassment in the workplace.</p><p>The FSPO has also adopted the Civil Service Code of Standards and Behaviour which outlines the standards expected of civil and public servants in the performance of their official duties. All staff receive training on these policies, which are publicly available, during the FSPO&rsquo;s induction process. The FSPO has published its Customer Charter and Customer Action Plan (2022-2025), which sets out commitments and service standards in the delivery of its statutory remit. The FSPO is committed to fostering an environment of mutual respect between customers and employees. The FSPO has also commenced work on the development of a Safeguarding Policy, which will set out its commitment to safeguard any children, young people and vulnerable adults that come into contact with its services, and which will be published on the FSPO website in due course.</p><p>The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has an Employee Hand Book and HR Manual in place and adheres to the <i>Dignity at Work - an Anti-Bullying, Harassment and Sexual Harassment Policy for the Civil Service</i>for employees to report instances of sexual harassment or assault that occur in the workplace. The Fiscal Council is committed to developing and maintaining a positive work environment. An essential component of this is treating colleagues with respect and dignity. Breaches of this policy are not acceptable within the Fiscal Council. The Fiscal Council does not routinely provide services directly to the public and it would not be the case that members of the public would visit the office. </p><p>The National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) has policies in place for employees to report instances of sexual harassment or assault. These policies are available on the NTMA internal intranet site and are accessible by all employees. The NTMA assigns staff to a number of other bodies under my Department&rsquo;s remit, namely Home Building Finance Ireland, the National Asset Management Agency and the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, all of which operate out of the Treasury Dock building which is not accessible to the public. </p><p>The Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General operates under the framework of civil service policies and procedures including the <i>Dignity at Work Policy - an Anti-Bullying, Harassment and Sexual Harassment Policy for the Civil Service</i>. The Office also has an internal Speak Up policy and procedure where it commits to providing an environment which encourages all staff to voice any concerns they may have about wrongdoing in relation to any aspect of the way it does business or matters concerning personal conduct or behaviour. The Speak Up policy is accessible on the Office&rsquo;s website at www.audit.gov.ie. The Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General does not operate in direct contact with members of the public.</p><p>The Office of the Revenue Commissioners deals with allegations of sexual harassment or assault under the <i>Dignity at Work &ndash; An Anti-Bullying, Harassment and Sexual Harassment Policy for the Civil Service</i>. This policy aims to promote respect, dignity, safety, and equality in the workplace. Every member of staff should be aware that all forms of bullying, harassment, and sexual harassment are unacceptable, and every member of staff has a duty to behave in an acceptable and respectful manner.  Revenue&rsquo;s Employee Engagement Charter supports the policy by specifying that employees should treat everyone with courtesy and respect. Revenue&rsquo;s policy on Protected Disclosure Reporting in the Workplace also covers the disclosure of information by employees in relation to various types of wrongdoing. This policy is available on the Revenue website.</p><p>The Dignity at Work Policy is made available to all staff in Revenue at induction and is also placed on their intranet. It is available to members of the public on the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform website.</p><p>Revenue further advise that they operate in accordance with the Equal Status Acts 2000-2018 which aim to protect individuals from discrimination, harassment and sexual harassment. Revenue&rsquo;s Complaint and Review procedure provides an easily accessible route for a customer to complain about any aspect of their treatment. The procedure is available on Revenue&rsquo;s website at . In line with its commitment to protect and respect equality and human rights in accordance with Public Sector Duty principles, Revenue publishes data on the numbers of complaints, including those to the Ombudsman, and reviews requested and those upheld relating to Equality and/or Human Rights.  </p><p>The Tax Appeals Commission has a Complaints Procedures Policy in place which is accessible to members of the public on its website where any instance of sexual harassment or assault can be reported. A similar policy is available to its employees.</p></reply>

The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth has responsibility for the AMIF while the ESF is managed by the Department of Further and Higher Education. </p>  <p>  The CARE Regulation introduced four main changes to cohesion policy rules to maximise the speed and ease with which Member States can help people fleeing Ukraine, while continuing to support regions' recovery:</p>  <p>  - It extended the time for availing of 100% EU co-financing for 2014-2020 Cohesion policy funding;</p>  <p>  - It allowed full flexibility for Member States and regions to use resources from either the European Fund for Regional Development (ERDF) or the European Social Fund (ESF) for any type of measures to support people fleeing Ukraine;</p>  <p>  - It backdated eligibility for Member State spending on all actions helping people fleeing Ukraine to the start date of the Russian invasion (24 February 2022);and</p>  <p>  - It simplified the reporting and the programme modifications requirements.</p>  <p>  Member States were also permitted to use existing funds not yet programmed under the Recovery Assistance for Cohesion and the Territories of Europe (REACT-EU), a post-COVID recovery package and all unallocated resources under the current 2014-2020 funding period where programmes are drawing to a close. Ireland is making use of remaining unallocated funding under the European Regional Development Fund (&euro;0.4m) and REACT-EU (&euro;53m) for this purpose.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently working closely with other Government Departments and agencies to determine the range of existing activities supporting Ukrainian refugees which could be financed under this mechanism. It is anticipated that these may include:</p>  <p>  - Use of a straightforward, ready-to-use unit cost or &lsquo;Simplified Cost Option&rsquo; (SCO) to provide for a per capita payment of &euro;40 for up to 13 weeks for each Ukrainian refugee. This will support a number of measures assisting Ukrainian refugees on arrival in Ireland including, for example, reception, processing and transport; </p>  <p>  - Short-term and medium term accommodation.</p>  <p>  Funding will be disbursed through programme activities under the European Regional Development Fund and European Social Fund over the period up to July 2023. Programme beneficiaries will submit claims for expenditure on eligible activities and be reimbursed.</p></reply>

These collective agreements have helped to ensure that public pay is managed in a sustainable, affordable and orderly manner. These agreements have also enabled significant reform of public services and changes to work practices.</p><p>The current public service agreement is Building Momentum - A New Public Service Agreement 2021-2022. This Agreement is weighted towards those at lower incomes with headline increases of approximately 5% for the lowest paid public servants. These groups will also benefit more from other measures in the Agreement including the overtime rates and premia payment adjustments.</p><p>Building Momentum is a two year Agreement, which is due to expire at the end of 2022. </p><p>As the Deputies will be aware, exploratory discussions have taken place between the parties to the Agreement following the triggering of the review clause in Building Momentum by public service unions and associations due to the increasing cost in living. These discussions have now moved to formal phase of discussions which are being facilitated by the Workplace Relations Commissions. </p><p>As the Deputies will appreciate, while these discussions are ongoing it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the detail of those talks which should remain confidential to the parties. However, inflation and cost of living issues to which the Deputies have referred will feature in those discussions.</p><p>These are challenging discussions given the impact high levels of inflation are having on living standards of workers but also because of the uncertainty in the global economic outlook. The aim in these talks will be to strike the right balance and seek to achieve a deal that is fair and affordable to both taxpayers generally and public service employees.</p><p>Nevertheless, an agreement on public service pay could play an important role in underpinning stability, minimising industrial unrest and supporting the continued delivery of reform and quality public services over the period ahead.  However, any such agreement would need to reflect the broader economic context and the current fiscal position where significant challenges are emerging.</p></reply>

These are exacerbated by the war in Ukraine, which has added to inflationary pressures globally. This is not a difficulty unique to Ireland and is faced by almost every advanced economy in the world. </p>  <p>  The Government is aware of the challenge posed to many households by the rising costs of living, in particular for those on lower incomes. While the Government cannot fully insulate all from the impact of rising prices, significant resources have been provided to protect those that may be struggling due to price pressures. Budget 2022 set out a &euro;1.2 billion package of expenditure measures to support citizens across a range of sectors with cost of living pressures and also contained an income tax package of just over half a billion euro.</p>  <p>  Since December 2021, over half a billion euro of additional expenditure measures have been put in place to support citizens and businesses with increased costs targeted at energy prices. This includes the Electricity Credit for all domestic account holders of &euro;200. To provide further support towards mitigating fuel cost increases, the Department of Finance introduced temporary reductions in the excise duties charged on petrol, diesel and marked gas oil and reduced the rate of VAT on the supply of gas and electricity. </p>  <p>  In implementing these measures, Government has sought to balance a number of considerations. In the context of increased energy costs driving inflation, measures have been targeted in this area. To ensure swift support to help lower income households experiencing immediate difficulties, it was also important that measures could be enacted in a timely manner. Measures introduced are largely temporary and avoid committing funding for future years to ensure that our public finances remain on a sustainable trajectory. It is also essential that policy avoids generating second round effects which could add to inflationary pressures. </p>  <p>  In terms of the overall budgetary framework, my Department seeks to drive reform and value for money in the management of day-to-day spending as well as the formulation of new policies. It is also a key responsibility of every Department and Minister to manage expenditure within their respective allocations. Careful monitoring of spending against profile and consideration of efficient and effective delivery of programmes and projects is required. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to continuing reform and improvement of the budgetary process. In this context a range of reforms have been put in place in recent years, to support this drive to deliver more efficient and effective public services. This work includes the &lsquo;whole-of-year&rsquo; budgetary framework, the Spending Review process, Performance Budgeting and Equality Budgeting and the development of the Wellbeing Framework for Ireland. </p>  <p>  I am currently engaged in preparations for this year's Summer Economic Statement with my colleague the Minister for Finance. The challenging economic context is adding complexity to the formulation of our fiscal strategy for 2023. In finalising the budgetary parameters, we will seek to strike a balance between helping to mitigate cost of living pressures and ensuring sustainability of the public finances. Overall we aim to design policy to protect the most vulnerable in society while also ensuring measures do not add to inflationary pressures. The Summer Economic Statement and the Mid-Year Expenditure Report will be published in the coming weeks. </p></reply>

This will continue under &lsquo;Building Momentum: A New Public Service Agreement, 2021-2022&rsquo;.</p>  <p>  At this point, salary rates up to &euro;150,000, which account for 99% of the Public Service, have been fully restored.  Section 20 of the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 sets out that public servants with annualised basic salaries above &euro;150,000 should be restored by a date no later than 1 July, 2022.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, I have established an Independent Review Panel into the recruitment and pay determination processes for Senior Public Service posts.</p>  <p>  In addition, each year, under the terms of the FEMPI Act 2013, I am obliged to carry out an annual review of the operation, effectiveness and impact of the FEMPI Acts, having regard to the overall economic conditions in the State and national competitiveness.  In this annual review, I am also to consider whether or not any of the provision of the relevant Acts continue to be necessary having regard to the purposes of those Acts, the revenues of the State and State commitments in respect of public service pay and pensions.</p>  <p>  The 2021 annual review, a written report of which was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on the 25 June, 2021, recommended the continuation of the unwinding of the FEMPI measures in line with the provisions enacted in the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act, 2017.

As a percentage of national income, annual capital investment is now among the largest in the EU. In 2022, almost &euro;12 billion will fund vital infrastructure in areas such as housing, transport, education, enterprise, sport and climate action.</p>  <p>  My Department is responsible for the Public Spending Code (PSC), which sets the value for money requirements and guidance for evaluating, planning and managing Exchequer-funded capital projects.</p>  <p>  Management and delivery of investment projects and public services within allocation and the national frameworks is a key responsibility of every Department and Minister. It is the responsibility of the relevant government department to ensure that the procedures are in place to ensure compliance with the Public Spending Code within their department/office and within the bodies under the aegis of their department.</p>  <p>  It is also the responsibility of each government department to ensure that departments and agencies draw up their own sector-specific procedures for evaluating, planning and managing public investment which aligns with the Public Spending Code.</p>  <p>  The majority of public investment projects are delivered on budget and on time and there is a high level of professionalism across the sectors. However, noting the higher risk profile of larger projects, it was recognised that new procedures were required in order to improve project out-turns, avoid cost overruns and avoid delays to project delivery.</p>  <p>  Responding to this need, my Department put in place an External Assurance Process (EAP) to provide independent scrutiny for major public capital projects (projects which cost in excess of &euro;100m). This involves independent expert reviews at two key stages in the project lifecycle under the PSC (approval in principle and prior to tendering).</p>  <p>  The purpose of the EAP is to improve value for money and support funding departments and Government with expert insight relating to project risks, delivery feasibility, and robustness of costings, governance and procurement. Funding departments can avail of external assurance services and independent expertise through a framework of qualified service providers which has been established by my Department.</p>  <p>  The Major Projects Advisory Group (MPAG) has also been established by my Department. MPAG supports my Department in assimilating the outputs from the external reviews, and aids government departments and agencies in improving the quality of project proposals. informed by the perspective of those who have successfully delivered major public infrastructure in Ireland.  Project proposals and external reviews are scrutinised by MPAG as a prerequisite to seeking Government approval in principle to proceed with the proposal and Government approval for permission to tender.</p>  <p>  Experience from other countries which have introduced similar independent assurance processes shows that such arrangements reduce project schedule delay and cost overruns, providing greater value for money. These arrangements bring Ireland into line with leading international performers and meet a recommendation of the IMF&rsquo;s Public Investment Management Assessment of Ireland.</p></reply>

The CWMF represents the tools that a public body must use to procure and manage the external resources necessary to deliver a public works project that is to be delivered under the Exchequer-funded element of the National Development Plan. It consists of a suite of best practice guidance, standard contracts, generic template documents and procedures that cover all aspects of the delivery process of a public works project from inception to final project delivery and review to assist contracting authorities in meeting their ongoing procurement requirements.</p>  <p>  A review of the policies and practices deployed in the procurement of public works projects commenced in March 2019 and is ongoing.  The focus of the review is on improving the delivery of construction projects in terms of quality, timely delivery and cost outcomes.  The review will deliver significant changes to the CWMF over the coming years. The review process involves extensive engagement, both with industry stakeholders, and with the public bodies charged with the delivery of public works projects on a broad range of issues such as:</p>  <p>  - price variation;</p>  <p>  - risk management;</p>  <p>  - creating a better quality: price balance in the award of contracts;</p>  <p>  - adoption of BIM on public works projects;</p>  <p>  - liability, indemnity and insurance requirements;</p>  <p>  - performance evaluation;</p>  <p>  - encouraging collaborative working.</p>  <p>  A high-level strategy has been developed by the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) with the Government Contracts Committee for Construction (GCCC) that will guide the implementation and will be addressed primarily through the progressive refinement and enhancement of the CWMF.</p>  <p>  Covid-19 impacted the review in 2020 and 2021 as resources were redeployed to address the contractual and procurement issues that arose during construction lockdown. However, progress is being made on a number of fronts.</p>  <p>  - The initial focus is on the engagement of consultancy services, which is aimed at driving better project definition, in order to provide greater certainty for all those engaged in the construction stage.  Overall improvement in project definition is required through establishing minimum standards for information at the different stages of a project&rsquo;s development.  Work is ongoing on the detailed implementation aspects of the review of the engagement of consultancy services, which will be delivered by means of changes to the template tender documents, publication of new guidance material and exploring digital solutions.</p>  <p>  - A review of the price variation mechanisms used in both the CWMF consultancy and construction contracts is currently underway.  Initial research to review the inflation provisions in both the CWMF consultancy and construction contracts has been completed by consultants.  Significant increases in construction material costs is affecting live tenders and contracts.  Procurement guidance for &lsquo;live&rsquo; tenders was published in November 2021.  Interim amendments to the provisions in the public works contracts to address inflation in construction materials were introduced in January 2022.  Following further inflationary pressures arising out of the Russian invasion of Ukraine concerns have been raised about the ability of contractors to withstand prolongation of elevated materials prices and more recent increases in energy and fuel prices. In the interest of safeguarding the delivery of the NDP and key projects underway, a new inflation co-operation framework is being introduced for those parties engaged under a public works contract.  The framework will facilitate the parties to engage with one another on an ex gratia basis for the purpose of addressing the impacts of this most recent onset of exceptional inflation in construction materials and energy, and supply chain disruption. Consultation on broader changes is due to commence with stakeholders in 2022.</p>  <p>  - Building Information Modelling (BIM) has the potential to transform the processes surrounding project and data management on construction projects and can drive significant efficiencies.  The OGP is currently engaged with National Standards Authority of Ireland on preparing a national annex to the international standard (ISO) for BIM implementation and with the Build Digital Project in the development of an implementation plan for the adoption of BIM across the NDP.  A series of masterclasses is ongoing to prepare public bodies for the implementation of BIM. In 2022, external advisers will be engaged to draft contract amendments to incorporate BIM into the CWMF and to prepare template procurement documents for publication.</p>  <p>  - The OGP is engaging with key stakeholders on the issue of liability, indemnities and insurance and is reviewing broader aspects of the required terms in the contracts used to engage design teams and contractors.  Engagement with the insurance sector and construction industry stakeholders has also taken place on issues relating to cost increases on Professional Indemnity Insurance premiums and the reduction in cover available.  Amendments to CWMF documents and additional guidance was published in February 2022.</p>  <p>  - Engagement is ongoing in developing standard metrics for life cycle costing and life cycle analysis that can be applied to the evaluation of projects&rsquo; cost of use in service and full life cycle analysis, including the carbon impact of individual projects.  The OGP is liaising with the GCCC and the Irish Green Building Council in developing these metrics.</p>  <p>  - The Cost Control Templates published under the CWMF are undergoing review to incorporate the International Construction Measurement Standard (ICMS).  A working group has been established and revised templates will be published in 2022. ICMS is a global standard for benchmarking and reporting of construction project cost and covers both capital and whole life costing while providing a way of presenting costs in a consistent format.</p>  <p>  - A review into the performance of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) provisions that were introduced in 2016 has also taken place in 2021. A final report on the review is being prepared by consultants, which will form the basis of a position paper in 2022 on ADR provisions in the public works contracts.</p>  <p>  Together these reform processes will lead to meaningful policy change and will assist in delivering better value for money for the taxpayer in the implementation of Project Ireland 2040.</p></reply>

Prior to the Public Service Pension (Single Scheme and Other Provisions) Act 2012), pension abatement applied only where an individual was re-employed in the same sector.  The Single Scheme Act extended abatement such that an individual in receipt of a public service pension is subject to abatement where they are re-employed in any part of the public service.</p>  <p>  The Act provides for the abatement of a public service pension where a retired public servant, whose pension is in payment, is re-employed in the public service such that no more of the pension when combined with the remuneration in the new position shall exceed the pensionable remuneration of the old position.  It should be noted that it is the pension which is abated and not the salary in the new position.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the measures taken in the 2012 Act were progressive and necessary.  The extension of abatement across the public service was appropriate as a modernising pension reform.  While the high level operation of abatement is monitored on an ongoing basis, there are no current plans to review pension abatement policy.  Abatement policy remains a key component of Public Service pension policy and represents a suitable and measured response to legitimate public concerns about simultaneous payment of a pension and salary in the public service.</p></reply>

The working from home guidance was a public health measure introduced in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  The Government announced, on 10 February this year, a suite of measures to mitigate the impact of recent inflation on citizens and assist with rising costs of living.  This package builds on the measures announced as part of Budget 2022, which included a range of measures to support citizens including social protection rate increases, increases in tax bands and other affordability measures.</p>  <p>  These expenditure measures, along with the excise duty reduction on petrol and diesel introduced by my colleague the Minister for Finance and now extended until Budget day in October 2022, and the VAT reduction from 13.5% to 9% on gas and electricity bills until end October, amount to &euro;1 billion in aggregate.</p>  <p>  These measures provide substantial assistance towards mitigating the impact of rising prices. They have focused on temporary support measures that can quickly provide assistance while also reflecting the need to return the public finances to a sustainable position.</p>  <p>  In terms of working from home, remote working for Civil Servants will be facilitated into the future on a blended basis. Access to blended working by civil servants will be dependent on Departments/Offices having the ability to meet the needs of the business. In general, remote working will not be available to employees on a 100 percent basis, as some physical attendance at workplaces will be required to facilitate face-to-face meetings, training and other key events deemed necessary by the employer.</p>  <p>  My Department, in collaboration with Civil Service employers, Trade Unions and Staff Associations, has developed a Blended Working Policy Framework for Civil Service Organisations. I, along with Minister of State Smyth, published the Framework on 31 March.</p>  <p>  The Framework focuses on the longer-term approach to remote working in the Civil Service and will assist in providing a consistent approach across the wider public service. The Framework supports commitments contained in a number of strategies which this Government has launched. These include, the National Remote Working Strategy, Our Rural Future, the Climate Action Plan and the National Planning Framework.</p>  <p>  The Framework provides broad strategic direction to individual organisations in the Civil Service to develop tailored policies on blended working that are appropriate to their business needs and employees. It is anticipated that Departments and Offices will have these policies completed no later than end-Q2 2022. In developing their own policies, Civil Service Departments and Offices will have the flexibility to determine matters such as the proportion of time individual employees work remotely versus onsite and the roles that are suitable for blended working.</p></reply>

A further amount of &euro;3.2 million was provided in 2021 for this purpose in recognition of the importance of the sector and the positive impact swimming has on the nation&rsquo;s health. The funding was administered by Ireland Active on behalf of Sport Ireland and supported 280 pools throughout the country. The day to day financial management of these public facilities is a matter for the operators of the facilities themselves.</p>  <p>  Capital funding for new swimming pools or the refurbishment of existing pools was previously provided through the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme (LASPP). A total of 52 pools have been completed under the LASPP and three swimming pool projects (Lucan, Buncrana and Edenderry) remain in the programme with the Lucan project currently under construction.</p>  <p>  My Department's capital support for any new swimming pools is now being provided through the Large Scale Sport Infrastructure Fund (LSSIF). The National Development Plan provided a capital allocation of at least &euro;100m for the Fund over the period to 2027.</p>  <p>  The first call for proposals under the LSSIF closed in 2019 with applications confined to local authorities and National Governing Bodies (NGBs) of Sport. All applications were assessed in accordance with the published Evaluation Procedures and Guidelines and the first allocations were announced in January 2020. Thus far, approximately &euro;86.4 million has been awarded to 33 different proposals. These initial allocations include funding for 8 swimming pool projects.</p>  <p>  The priority in the short term is to advance all LSSIF projects, including the swimming pools, to  construction stage.</p>  <p>  In relation to future capital funding for pools, my Department is currently undertaking a review of progress on all existing LSSIF grants. As part of this review, my Department is also considering the timing of any new call for proposals. The review is at an advanced stage and is expected to be finalised shortly.</p>  <p>  In terms of future policy, the National Sports Policy commits to the development of a National Swimming Strategy. As part of this, there will be a review of swimming pool provision to identify where gaps exist and how these can be met. Furthermore, the Sports Action Plan 2021-2023, which was published in November 2021, contains an action to develop and implement a National Swimming Strategy to provide additional swimming opportunities indoors and outdoors. Initial preparatory planning work has been undertaken by my Department in this regard.

The objective of the paper was to provide an overview of the acquisition delivery mechanisms, and other related mechanisms, including an analysis of the level of expenditure and social housing output in the years 2016, 2017 and 2018. The paper is available at the following link: </p><p>As part of Budget 2022 Spending Reviews the IGEES published Budget 2022 Analysis of Social Housing Acquisitions examining social housing acquisitions for 2019, which builds on the Spending Review paper from 2019 examining social housing acquisition taking place between 2016 and 2018. The paper Budget 2022 Analysis of Social Housing is available at the link:</p> <blockquote> 	. </blockquote>  <p>In September 2021, the Government published the Housing for All.  This strategy is the Government&rsquo;s plan to increase the supply of housing to an average of 33,000 per year over the next decade. The annual targets include the delivery of 88,400 new social homes and 53,800 new affordable homes in the period 2022-2030. Housing for All is supported by an investment package of over &euro;4bn per annum, through an overall combination of &euro;12bn in direct Exchequer funding, &euro;3.5bn in funding through the Land Development Agency (LDA) and &euro;5bn funding through the Housing Finance Agency.</p><p>Our clear focus is to increase the stock of social housing through new build projects delivered by local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies (AHB) and, with this, to reduce the numbers of social homes delivered through acquisition programmes. Under Housing for All  social housing acquisitions by local authorities and AHBs have been advised to avoid competition with first time buyers and that acquisitions should be focussed on a number of priority areas, as follows:</p> <blockquote> 	- One-bedroom units to deliver on Housing First and meet the short supply in this category;<br /><br />- Other properties that allow persons/families to exit homelessness; and<br /><br />- Specific housing required for/suitable for individuals with a disability or other particular priority needs. </blockquote>  <p>On 20 April, a further circular letter issued to local authorities in relation to social housing acquisitions. The key purpose of this circular was to advise local authorities that I had reinstated the delegated sanction to local authorities in respect of social housing acquisitions which are: (i) in one of the priority categories set out in the January circular letter; (ii) are in line with acquisition cost guidelines; and (iii) can be completed during 2022. The reinstatement of delegated sanction will allow local authorities to respond more flexibility to secure acquisitions which support a household to exit or to prevent homelessness, in the context of increasing numbers in emergency accommodation.  It is a matter for individual local authorities to identify suitable acquisitions in line with local circumstances and their social housing allocations policy.</p></reply>

For example, the High Level Affordable Housing Delivery Group draws together the key stakeholders responsible for delivering affordable homes. Its functions include monitoring progress under Housing for All affordable housing delivery streams, identifying and monitoring risks and impediments to delivery and developing mitigation measures as appropriate, with the overarching objective of accelerating the delivery of affordable homes.</p><p>Schemes of support are reviewed in my Department in the light of evolving conditions.  For example, following consultation with local authorities last year on the operation of the Serviced Sites Fund (SSF), the Affordable Housing Fund has now replaced it. Changes include expanding the scope of costs covered to subvent the all-in development cost of delivering the housing, which may include land purchase costs; taking applications as they are developed on a rolling basis as opposed to time constrained funding calls; and, allowing funding support to exceed the SSF maximum of &euro;50,000 per affordable dwelling on a stepped scale to &euro;100,000, based on location and density.</p><p>Another important public delivery stream for affordable housing is the Land Development Agency (LDA) and its role in the delivery of homes on State Lands.  The LDA is actively developing 12 sites, capable of<b></b>delivering about 6,000 homes and has recently submitted planning applications for 2,358 social and affordable homes. </p><p>Under Housing for All, 20 further sites (additional to the initial tranche of State lands identified) were designated for transfer to the LDA. The establishing of the LDA allows proactive management of the State&rsquo;s extensive land bank. A State Lands and Property Group monitors progress on the transfer of State lands to the LDA and considers further potential State sites suitable to support housing delivery by the LDA and local authorities. All relevant land-owning Departments and Agencies have been requested to engage fully with the LDA. </p><p>In the longer-term, the LDA will assemble strategic land-banks from a mix of public and private lands, making these available for housing in a controlled manner, helping to provide essential long-term stability to the Irish housing market.</p></reply>

The Residential Tenancies (No. 2) Act 2021 introduced measures in July 2021 to extend the operation of Rent Pressure Zones (RPZs) until the end of 2024 and prohibit any necessary rent increase in an RPZ from exceeding general inflation, as recorded by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP).  The Act also provides that rent reviews outside of RPZs can, until 2025, occur no more frequently than bi-annually. This provides rent certainty for tenants outside of RPZs for a minimum 2 year period at a time. </p><p>To address the rent affordability challenges building on foot of the unexpectedly fast rising inflation rate, as recorded by HICP (CSO data for May 2022 shows HICP inflation of 8.3% p.a.), the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2021 was enacted to provide, from 11 December 2021, a cap of 2% per annum pro rata on rent increases in RPZs where the inflation rate is higher. </p><p>In all cases, section 19(1) of the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004-2021 prohibits the setting of a rent that exceeds market rent. Section 24A of the Acts provides that the Housing Agency, in consultation with housing authorities, may make a proposal to the Minister that an area should be considered as a RPZ. Following receipt of such a proposal, the Minister requests the Director of the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) to conduct an assessment of the area to establish whether or not it meets the criteria for designation and to report to the Minister on whether the area should be designated as a RPZ.</p><p>The criteria to be satisfied by an area under section 24A(4) of the Acts for designation as an RPZ are as follows:</p><p>- the information relating to the area, as determined by reference to the information used to compile  each RTB Rent Index quarterly  report, shows that the annual rate of  increase in the average amount of rent for that area is more than 7% in  each of at least 4 of the 6 quarters preceding the period immediately prior to the date of the Housing Agency's proposal, and </p><p>- the average rent for the  area in the last quarter, as determined by  reference to the information used to compile each RTB Rent Index quarterly report, is &ndash; </p><p>- in  the case of counties Kildare, Meath and Wicklow or a local electoral area (LEA) in any one of those counties, above  the average rent in the State, excluding rents in the 4 Dublin Local  Authority areas, or </p><p>- in the case of any LEA  outside of the Greater Dublin Area (i.e. Dublin, Kildare, Meath and Wicklow), above the average rent in the State excluding rents in the Greater Dublin Area.</p><p>Each RTB quarterly Rent Index Report includes a table of the data used to establish whether each LEA fulfils the criteria for designation as a RPZ. This ensures transparency in relation to the position of individual areas in terms of average rent levels and increases.</p><p>The Housing Agency and the RTB will continue to monitor national rents and if any area meets the designation criteria it will be designated as a RPZ.<b></b></p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-06-16a.634.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1512" speakername="Malcolm Noonan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022061600075#WRR02100"><p>The second All-Ireland Pollinator Plan 2021-2025 is supported by the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) of my Department and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. It identifies a clear need for long-term monitoring mechanisms for wild pollinators, so that the impact of the Plan's actions can be properly assessed. </p>  <p>  On  8 July 2021, Minister Pippa Hackett and I announced support for a pilot initiative to establish a National Pollinator Monitoring Scheme. The scheme will track changes in wild pollinators across Ireland and is part of an initiative across much of Europe.</p>  <p>  The scheme will monitor wild pollinators (bumblebees, solitary bees, hoverflies and butterflies) across a network of 50 sites incorporating farmland, semi-natural and public land. It involves collaboration between the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the NPWS. </p>  <p>  The scheme supports the All Ireland Pollinator Plan (AIPP) and proposed EU pollinator monitoring by establishing a robust national monitoring framework.  This will deliver key metrics on pollinator population status and trends, and complement the long-term citizen science monitoring that is already being done through the All-Ireland Bumblebee Monitoring Scheme. </p>  <p>  There is a commitment to the All-Ireland Pollinator Plan in the Programme for Government and the AIPP is a substantial contribution to improving our understanding of, and conservation of, bees and other important pollinators.</p>  <p>  I would like to acknowledge the important role of the Heritage Council in facilitating this collaboration between the two Departments and the National Biodiversity Data Centre, who are responsible for coordinating implementation of the AIPP.</p>  <p>  Objective 2 of the AIPP is to make public land more pollinator friendly. The AIPP advocates prioritising the protection of existing natural and semi-natural habitats, creating natural meadows and verges through reduced mowing, sustainable pollinator-friendly planting, and reducing pesticide use. </p>  <p>  Local Authorities have embraced this and their positive actions for pollinators across the island are changing the way our landscape is managed for the better. </p>  <p>  Great strides have been made in recent years in caring for pollinators in cities, towns and villages across Ireland. Pollinator friendly areas are increasingly visible in our parks and public spaces as well as in housing and retail developments.</p>  <p>  The Local Authority Biodiversity Grant Scheme, operated by the NPWS, offers funding to assist local authorities with the implementation of projects that promote actions contained in the National Biodiversity Action Plan (NBAP). Projects supported by the grant scheme in recent years include a number of projects to support and protect pollinators, including wild bees. </p>  <p>  Responsibility for matters relating to managed bee populations rests with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine. </p></reply>

FBR staff have since processed 7,000 FBR applications while also continuing to provide support to Passport services due to the unprecedented levels of passport demand.</p><p>The FBR Service provides an emergency service for Foreign Birth Registration in cases of exceptional urgency, such as expectant parents, or stateless persons. Such applicants may continue to contact the Passport Service directly. For other applications, the FBR service operates a transparent general policy of processing applications in order of receipt.</p><p>With regard to the applications to which the Deputy has referred supporting documentation was received on 10 March 2020.  These applications will be processed in the coming weeks.  </p><p>The Passport Service has been scaling up resources to deal with anticipated demand for passports and FBRs since June of last year. A major recruitment drive, in partnership with the Public Appointments Service, has been underway over the past several months. This has seen the Passport Service taken on over 400 staff since June 2021.</p><p>The unprecedented level of staff currently working in the Passport Service will be maintained in the months ahead.  This will allow for the reassignment of additional staff to the processing of FBR applications with the aim of significantly reducing turnaround times for these applications by the end of this year.</p></reply>

I understand that the company has processed the vast majority of applications that they have received for this summer's J1 programme, and that they are making significant efforts to deal with the remaining applications. I also understand that, should processing delays make it impossible for a customer to undertake their travel to the US, that refunds are provided by the company. My officials have underlined to the organisation the importance of timely processing of these applications in order to allow young Irish people the opportunity to undertake a summer working in the US, especially after recent years when this was not possible. </p>  <p>  My Department also remains in regular communication with the US Embassy, who are working to reduce waiting times and have allocated significant additional resources to the processing of J1 visa applications. This development has resulted in a significant increase in the number being processed in recent weeks.</p>  <p>  The J1 visa programme is a valuable part of facilitating mutually beneficial and enriching exchange between the US and Ireland, and we are keen to see participation in this programme return to pre-pandemic levels. Through the J1, thousands of young people are afforded the chance to work and travel in the US every year, forging connections and establishing valuable links between the two countries. Ease of travel is essential to protect our strong transatlantic connections, be that in business, academia, tourism or maintaining family connections.</p></reply>

The UN path is, in our view, the only path forward.</p><p>During the United Nations Security Council consultations on Western Sahara on 21 April 2022, Ireland made clear its longstanding position and urged de-escalation. Ireland has consistently called on all parties to respect the terms of the ceasefire agreement of 1991, to fulfil their obligations under international law, including ensuring full respect for human rights, and to refrain from taking any actions that could lead to further destabilisation of the situation on the ground. During the upcoming MINURSO mandate renewal process, Ireland will continue to promote our support of MINURSO, as well as our respect for human rights, accountability and compliance with international law.</p><p>On 13 May, I met with the Spanish Foreign Minister, Jos&eacute; Manuel Albares Bueno. During discussions, I raised the issue of Western Sahara and Spain&rsquo;s recent decision to support the Moroccan autonomy plan. Throughout my discussion with Minister Albares, I reiterated Ireland&rsquo;s position of full support of MINURSO.</p><p>Ireland fully supports the United Nations Security Council Resolution 2602 on self-determination for the people of Western Sahara. We do not have a view on the outcome of that decision so long as it is decided peacefully and in a genuine exercise of self-determination.</p></reply>

This atrocious attack resulted in multiple deaths, reportedly at least 40, and many others wounded. I would like to express my deepest condolences to all of the families affected. </p>  <p>  The Embassy of Ireland in Abuja, Nigeria, is monitoring developments in the investigation.</p>  <p>  This deadly attack is the latest incident in Nigeria in recent years. The deteriorating security situation has many complex and interwoven drivers provoking tensions within and between groups. Increased violence against civilians is a tragic consequence of these tensions, which can also have a sectarian dimension.</p>  <p>  I condemn all attacks on civilians in Nigeria, and elsewhere, irrespective of who the perpetrators of such violence are, and their purported motives. There is no justification for acts of violence or discrimination based on religion or beliefs. </p>  <p>  The Embassy of Ireland in Abuja advocates for the protection of human rights, including the free expression of thought, conscience and religion including through the Irish Aid programme, working closely with government authorities, civil society organisations, and our EU and UN partners. As an elected member of the UN Security Council, Ireland works with UN partners to promote peace and security in areas affected by insecurity.</p>  <p>  The humanitarian situation in Nigeria, arising from the Boko Haram insurgency in the northeast of the country, affecting millions of people is also of deep concern. Ireland is a member of the International Support Group; a donor forum to coordinate support for Boko Haram-affected areas around Lake Chad. In 2021, Ireland provided &euro;1 million to the Nigerian Humanitarian Fund, which is managed by UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN OCHA) and provides life-saving assistance to communities affected by the conflict in the north east of the country.</p></reply>

At the meeting we discussed a broad range of issues including the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland, the legacy of the Troubles, and the impact of recent British Government decisions on Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  I underlined the Irish Government&rsquo;s deep disappointment at the British Government&rsquo;s intention to table legislation which would allow British ministers to unilaterally dis-apply elements of the Protocol. Such unilateral action would represent a serious breach of international law. I emphasised the damage that such action on the Protocol would do to relationships within Northern Ireland, across our islands, between our governments, and between the UK and the EU and its member states. It would also clearly damage the international reputation of the UK. </p>  <p>  I also emphasised that we have listened and take very seriously all sincerely held concerns about the Protocol. The EU has also consistently engaged with the perspectives of everyone in Northern Ireland and last October produced a package of proposals to directly address these concerns. </p>  <p>  We agreed that only joint solutions can provide the long-term legal certainty and predictability which people and businesses in Northern Ireland need, and that there are solutions to practical issues which have arisen with regard to certain aspects of implementation of the Protocol. </p>  <p>  We also discussed the UK Government&rsquo;s decision to unilaterally introduce legislation on legacy cases in Northern Ireland, which moves away from the process agreed in the Stormont House Agreement, and in a direction that does not have the support of victims or any political party in Northern Ireland. I expressed my real concerns with both the process and substance of the draft legislation that has been introduced. These include concerns about the independence and effectiveness of the proposed review system, and its compliance with international human rights obligations. </p></reply>

During the call, I made it clear to Secretary Truss that publishing legislation would breach the UK&rsquo;s commitments under international law, the Withdrawal Agreement and Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland, would be deeply damaging to relationships on these islands and between the UK and EU. Minister of State Byrne spoke with his UK counterpart James Cleverly MP on 13 June also reiterating these same points. </p>  <p>  This phone call followed a number of contacts I have had with UK Foreign Secretary Truss, including a meeting on 20 May where I have repeatedly outlined Ireland&rsquo;s views on the British Government&rsquo;s approach. </p>  <p>  On 13 June, I also spoke with European Commission Vice-President &Scaron;efcovic and am in ongoing intensive contact with our partners across the EU. Opposition to the UK&rsquo;s illegal unilateral approach is uniform across the Union. Support for the Commission approach and for minimising disruption in Northern Ireland remains steadfast among EU member states.</p>  <p>  The tabling of this legislation marks a particular low point in the UK&rsquo;s approach to Brexit. Brexit and in particular the hard Brexit chosen by the UK Government is the root cause of the uncertainty in Northern Ireland. The Protocol is the solution, jointly designed and freely chosen by the British Government to mitigate the challenges posed by their preferred version of Brexit. </p>  <p>  Arguing that the Good Friday Agreement and the Protocol are incompatible is disingenuous and irresponsible. The Protocol was specifically designed by the UK and EU to protect and uphold the Good Friday Agreement. Taken together, they are a powerful expression of what negotiation and partnership can achieve. Only a jointly agreed solution will consolidate these achievements and bring real stability and opportunities for Northern Ireland. </p>  <p>  Despite this act of bad faith, the EU is still fully committed to addressing issues of concern to people in Northern Ireland and remains open to talks with the UK Government. I continue to urge the British Government to return to the table. No solution can be found through the repudiation of our agreement &ndash; an action that could have wider consequences, in terms of the reputation and the standing of the UK internationally. Reaching a solution requires partnership. It requires the UK Government to engage in good faith, with seriousness and commitment.  </p></reply>

The report was published on the 9th February 2022.  </p>  <p>  The Commission undertook a significant body of work encompassing their wide-ranging terms of reference.  The report contains 69 main recommendations and a number of sub recommendations.  The Commission's terms of reference included the consideration of appropriate capabilities, structures and staffing for the Army, the Air Corps and the Naval Service.  </p>  <p>  The Commission's report proposes significant changes for the Defence Forces, including to Defence Forces culture, high-level command and control structures, and for the level of Defence provision in Ireland.  The report is being fully considered, in consultation with Ministerial colleagues and other stakeholders. </p>  <p>  The intent is that following relevant consideration, and before the summer recess, I will revert to Government with a proposed response to the Commission's recommendations and a high-level action plan.</p>  <p>  One of the Report's recomendations is that the structure of the Army be reviewed and, in that context, the disposition of Units across the Defence Forces may be considered. As the Deputy will appreciate, it would be inappropriate for me to engage in speculative discussion on this matter prior to completion of the ongoing process, Government approval of any proposed plan of action, and completion of any subsequent reviews that may ensue.</p></reply>

There have been an additional 380 teachers recruited to support students to be enrolled in new special classes and new special schools for the 2022/2023 school year.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the extent of this investment, there are some parts of the country where increases in population and other issues have led to concerns regarding a shortage of school places.</p>  <p>  As Minister for Special Education and Inclusion, I recently announced that the Section 37A process to compel schools to increase SEN provision has been initiated for a third time and that this process is now underway. </p>  <p>  The NCSE has formally written to me, as Minister of State, to advise me that it has formed an opinion that there is insufficient special class capacity in primary schools and special school capacity in Dublin.  The second stage of the process is now complete.  I have informed the NCSE in relation to planned additional provision of education for children with special educational needs and available land and buildings.  The NCSE will now provide a detailed report on the matter to me, which will consider existing provision, any relevant proposed building works and which schools may be able to provide additional provision.  In preparing this report, the legislation requires the NCSE to consult school patrons, national parent bodies, school management bodies and teacher unions.  I have insisted that this be done as quickly as possible, and I expect that will be the case. </p>  <p>  All parties would prefer to see schools volunteer to provide more places, rather than places being secured on the back of an order or a direction from the Minister.

I am grateful to all concerned for their ongoing work in this regard.</p>  <p>  I can also reassure the Deputy that the local SENOs continue to be available to assist and advise parents of children with special educational needs.</p>  <p>  Parents seeking special class placements for their children are advised to contact NCSE locally so that their needs can be taken into account for planning purposes.</p></reply>

In the current school year over 121,400 children, including over 15,500 children with special educational needs, are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;289m in 2021. </p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education acts in an advisory role to the Department of Education on the suitability of placements for children with special educational needs. Under the terms of the School Transport Scheme for Children with Special Educational Needs, the Department will consider the report of the Special Education Needs Organiser (SENO).  School transport is provided to children with special educational needs who are attending the nearest school to their place of residence that is or can be resourced to meet their educational needs, as identified by the SENO. </p>  <p>  A parent/guardian should contact the school principal of the school that their child is attending who will assist in making an application for school transport to the SENO that is affiliated with their school.</p>  <p>  Following the application process where there is a transport service available for eligible children, Bus &Eacute;ireann will liaise with eligible families regarding the school transport arrangements.

Information from a range of sources, including Child Benefit data, school enrolment data and information on residential development activity is used for this purpose.  Additionally, Project Ireland 2040 population and housing targets inform my Department's projections of school place requirements.</p>  <p>  Having considered the projected requirements in each school planning area, my Department then makes an assessment of the existing capacity within that particular area and its ability to meet any increased demand. </p>  <p>  Where data indicates that additional provision is required at primary or post primary level, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:</p>  <p>  -  Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,</p>  <p>  -  Extending the capacity of a school or schools,</p>  <p>  -  Provision of a new school or schools.</p>  <p>  My Department's projections of post primary school place requirements in East Cork show some continued growth in enrolments in the short- to medium-term across most areas, with most growth anticipated in the Midleton_Carrigtwohill school planning area. </p>  <p>  However, in response to projected future need and to enrolment pressures in the area, there has been significant capital investment by my Department at post primary schools in East Cork.  A new post primary school, Carrigtwohill Community College, was established in 2016.  A project to deliver a new, modern 1,000 pupil school building for that school is underway.  Additionally, an extension at St. Colman's Community College, Midleton has been recently completed and a number of other large school building projects are also in train, delivering expanded capacity at St. Aloysius' College in Carrigtwohill, Midleton CBS, St. Mary's High School in Midleton, Pobalscoil na Tr&iacute;on&oacute;ide in Youghal, Col&aacute;iste an Phiarsaigh in Glanmire, Col&aacute;iste Mhuire in Cobh and Carrignafoy Community College Cobh.</p>  <p>  While my Department is aware of increasing pressures and demand for additional school places in East Cork, it is important to note that where enrolment pressures arise, it may not be as a result of lack of accommodation but may be driven by the following factors:</p>  <p>  - Duplication of applications &ndash; pupils have applied for a place to a number of schools in the are</p>  <p>  - School of choice &ndash; pupils can&rsquo;t get a place in their preferred school while there are places in other schools in the town/area</p>  <p>  - Some towns/areas have single sex schools and while places are available in the school they are not available to all pupils</p>  <p>  - External draw &ndash; pupils coming from outside the local area</p>  <p>  My Department is working to establish the true extent of any capacity issues through ongoing discussions with the relevant school authorities. In that context, similar to the process adopted in advance of the current academic year, my Department is engaging with patron bodies, including patrons of schools in East Cork areas, to identify particular capacity requirements for the forthcoming years which may necessitate further action to that already in train including, where required, the provision of modular accommodation solutions.</p>  <p>As a result of ongoing discussions with patrons in the School Planning Area, St Colman&rsquo;s College, Midleton has recently offered places for an additional 1st   year class group for the 2022/23 school year. In addition my Department met with some of the relevant schools and patrons last week and there is significant duplication of applications and students accepting places in more than one school and that this is generating considerable pressure locally.  However, work continues to establish the actual number of places required if any for 2022/23.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, my Department will continue to work to advance the planned and current projects in East Cork and to ensure sufficient places for both mainstream provision and for pupils with special education requirements both for the coming academic year and into the future.</p>  <p>  It is the responsibility of my  Department to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places in an area.  Parents can choose which school to apply to and where the school has places available the pupil should be admitted.</p>  <p>  It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of all schools to draft, publish and implement a school admission policy in accordance with the Education Acts 1998 to 2018. In schools where there are more applicants than places available a selection process may be necessary.  This may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in their school of first choice.</p>  <p>  The admission policy, including the selection criterion to be used where the school is oversubscribed, must comply with the Education Acts 1998 to 2018, be non-discriminatory and be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.</p>  <p>  Where a board of management make a decision to refuse admission, a parent/guardian can appeal that decision under section 29 of the Education Act, 1998, and an independent appeals committee will be appointed to consider the appeal. The role of the section 29 hearing committee is to examine the application for enrolment and consider if it was correctly processed by the school, in accordance with the school&rsquo;s Enrolment Policy. The section 29 appeals committee cannot consider matters that are not provided for within the school&rsquo;s Enrolment policy. If a parent/guardian considers that a school has erred in their processing of an enrolment application, a section 29 appeal committee can examine how the  application was processed by the school and identify if the school did not follow its Enrolment policy.  In cases where an error occurred the section 29 appeal committee will consider if the error had a material effect on the application. Where an error had a material effect on an enrolment application, the section 29 appeal committee can direct the school to enrol the student or adjust the students ranking on the waiting list.  My Department has no authority to compel a school to admit a student, except in circumstances where an appeal under section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 has been allowed and the appeals committee directs that the school admit the child concerned.</p>  <p>  A section 29 appeal must be made no later than 63 calendar days from the date of the school&rsquo;s decision to refuse admission.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that if refused admission is due to the school being oversubscribed, and the parent/guardian wishes to appeal this decision they must first make a written request to the school seeking a review of the board of management&rsquo;s decision.  This request for a review to the board of management is time bound and must be made within 21 calendar days from the date of the decision by the school to refuse admission to the child.</p>  <p>  If refused admission is for a reason other than the school being oversubscribed, a parent/guardian may, but are not required to, request a review by the board of management within 21 calendar days from the date of the decision by the school to refuse admission to the child.  Where a parent/guardian has been refused admission for a reason other than the school being oversubscribed and chooses not  to seek a review by the board of management they may make an appeal to an independent appeals committee no later than 63 calendar days from the date of the school&rsquo;s decision to refuse admission.</p>  <p>  Full details on the section 29 appeals process for refused enrolment are available on the Gov.ie  website at the links below:</p>  <p>  www.gov.ie/en/publication/8248c-appeals-in-relation-to-refusal-to-admit-a-student-due-to-a-school-being-oversubscribed/.</p>  <p>  www.gov.ie/en/publication/31c4f-appeals-in-relation-to-refusal-to-admit-a-student-for-a-reason-other-than-the-school-being-oversubscribed/.</p>  <p>  In addition, Tusla Education Support Services (TESS) the Educational Welfare Service  is the legal body which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school placement for their child.

Successful and repeatable results are then incorporated into all new school designs and refurbishments.</p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s Technical Guidance Documents set the benchmark for sustainable design in school buildings with a clear focus on energy efficiency and they are based on solid energy research projects. The Department's policy is supported by a strong research programme with fifty three research projects at various stages including its joint SEAI partnership energy website project www.energyineducation.ie.</p>  <p>  Solar PV is also funded for schools that are having their electrical installations replaced.</p>  <p>  Under Project Ireland 2040, the education sector will receive a total of approximately &euro;4.4 billion capital investment over the period 2021-2025. This significant investment allows us to move forward with certainty on our ambitious plans and deliver high quality building projects, with a real focus on sustainability, for school communities across Ireland. This investment will also build on the good progress being made on adding capacity to cater for demographic changes and provision for children with special educational needs. This investment will also facilitate an increased focus on the modernisation of existing school stock and help transition the school system for an era of net zero carbon by 2050. My Department and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland are involved in an energy efficient retrofit pathfinder scheme for schools since 2017. </p>  <p>  This Pathfinder programme is paving the way for, and informing, a much larger national schools&rsquo; programme for the energy retrofit of schools built prior to 2008 as included in the National Development Plan. It is facilitating research on a range of typical retrofit options, which will have been tried and tested. It is providing valuable development information for a solution driven delivery strategy which will be founded on a solid evidence base that has proven the robustness and scalability of renewable solutions within the schools&rsquo; sector. </p>  <p>  The longer-term outcome of the pathfinder will be to create an accurate and scalable model for energy efficient retrofits of schools across Ireland which will include solar PV. The deep energy retrofit programme for schools built prior to 2008 is due to be rolled out as included in the National Development Plan.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-06-16a.949.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1472" speakername="Josepha Madigan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022061600079#WRY03000"><p>The Special Needs Assistant (SNA) scheme is designed to provide schools with additional adult support staff who can assist children with special educational needs who also have additional and significant care needs.  Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.</p><p>SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. </p><p>The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. </p><p>It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p><p>The NCSE have confirmed that the school in question recently requested a review of their SNA allocation and that the SENO completed the in-school review. The review resulted in an increased SNA allocation to the school and sanction letter confirming the increase was issued to the school by the NCSE on 28/04/2022. </p><p>When a school has been allocated an SNA, the Board of Management, as the employer, is responsible for filling the vacancy. </p><p>In relation to SNA support the NCSE have confirmed that the school has an allocation of SNA support to provide support for children with primary care needs.</p><p>The following arrangements for the allocation of SNA support in respect of students in mainstream classes for 2022/23 will apply: </p><p>a) The SNA allocations for mainstream classes in schools on 31st May 2022 will be maintained for 2022/23. This will provide greater certainty for schools. </p><p>b) A process for schools, whereby if they consider their SNA allocation is in excess of the required care needs, to engage with the NCSE. Schools should contact their local NCSE Special Education Needs Organiser (SENO) to commence the process. </p><p>c) The exceptional review process undertaken by NCSE will remain in place throughout the 2022/23 school year, where schools can seek a review of their SNA allocations which will result in one of the following outcomes: </p><p>i. No change in the level of care need identified (and no change in the resultant SNA allocation); </p><p>ii. Increase in the level of care need identified (which if significant would see an increase in the SNA allocations to the schools) ; </p><p>iii. Decrease in level of care need identified in the school (which if significant would result in a reduction in SNA allocations as the care need could be managed with less resources than are currently allocated); In relation to outcome iii, the SNA allocation will be adjusted at the end of the relevant school term. </p><p>It is expected that schools will review and reprioritise the deployment of SNAs within mainstream settings and allocate resources to ensure those with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support. Providing access to SNA support continues to be based on primary care needs as outlined in DES Circular 0030/2014 circulars.gov.ie/pdf/circular/education/2014/30.pdf  . </p><p>Following such a review and reprioritisation, it is expected that a small number of schools, e.g. developing schools, may not have a sufficient SNA allocation to meet the needs of their students. These schools can apply to the NCSE for an Exceptional Review of their allocation. </p><p>Detailed information of the NCSE Exceptional Review process is published on the NCSE website. ncse.ie/application-for-sna-exceptional-review  .</p><p>The NCSE will endeavour to respond to all applications for Exceptional Review received as expediently as possible and in that regard, it will prioritise applications from schools with no current SNA allocation and developing schools. The Exceptional Review process for mainstream allocations will be available to schools throughout the 2022/23 school year.</p><p>The NCSE has developed an appeal mechanism for schools who are not satisfied with the outcome of the Exceptional Review. Local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) will provide information and clarification to schools on the outcome where requested. Where schools wish to appeal the outcome of the review, they must do so using the prescribed form provided by the NCSE  ncse.ie/ncse-appeals-process.</p><p>The NCSE have published the SNA allocations for the 2022/23 school year and they are available atncse.ie/set-hours-and-sna-allocations.</p><p>All schools have the contact details of their local SENO, and the SENO is available to offer assistance and advice to the school. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie  .</p></reply>

The Ability Programme, introduced in June 2018, was a three-year pre-activation programme for young people with disabilities.  The funding for the programme amounted to approximately &euro;16 million and was provided jointly under the European Union&rsquo;s ESF 2014-2020 Programme for Employability, Inclusion and Learning Operational Programme and the Irish Exchequer. The Ability Programme concluded at the end of August 2021.</p>  <p>  On 30 July last year I announced a new employment support measure for people with disabilities under Dormant Accounts Funding (DAF).  The DAF Measures to Support the Employment of People with Disabilities programme began in September 2021 and runs up to the end of December 2022.  In total, 45 projects were selected on foot of a competitive process and have been funded up to an amount of &euro;7.6 million.  The organisation referred to by the Deputy is funded as a standalone project under this DAF measure. </p>  <p>  A new employment programme for people with disabilities will be included in the measures under a new Operational Programme for Ireland under the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+) 2021-2027.  The new disability focused employment measure will build on the learnings from the former Ability Programme.</p>  <p>  The ESF Managing Authority in Ireland - based in the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science - is currently compiling the Operational Programme which will be submitted for Government Approval in the summer, prior to formal submission to the European Commission.  It is expected that Commission approval will be communicated in the latter part of the year.  </p>  <p>  It is anticipated that the new disability programme will be open by way of a competitive process in 2023 to applications from organisations across the country including the 27 former Ability Programme organisations and the specific organisation referred to by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

In addition, the National Childcare Scheme (NCS) provides financial support to thousands of families to help with the cost of early learning and childcare. There are two types of subsidies available under the NCS:</p><p>- Universal subsidies are available to all families with children under 3 years old. They are also available to families with children over 3 years who have not yet qualified for ECCE. This subsidy is not means tested and provides 50c per hour towards the cost of a registered place for a maximum of 45 hours per week. </p><p>- Income Assessed Subsidies are available to families with children aged between 24 weeks and 15 years. This subsidy is means tested. The subsidy varies depending on family income, child(ren&rsquo;s) age and educational stage, and the number of children in the family. The maximum available income assessed subsidy, dependent on the aforementioned conditions, is &euro;5.10 per hour or a maximum weekly subsidy of &euro;229.50.</p><p>A recent review of the NCS revealed that, as a proportion of total family early learning and childcare costs, 6% of families receiving NCS support reported that all early learning and childcare costs were covered by the NCS, while 38% reported that half or more of their costs were covered by the NCS.</p><p>Since the review took place, I announced a further package of measures to directly address the costs of early learning and childcare in Budget 2022, including:</p><p>- an extension of the NCS universal subsidy to all children under 15, benefitting up to 40,000 children from September this year.</p><p>- an end to the practice of deducting hours spent in pre-school or school from the entitlement to NCS subsidised hours from spring 2022, benefitting an estimated 5,000 children from low income families since 2 May.</p><p>- a new core funding scheme &ndash; worth &euro;221m in a full year &ndash; to support:</p><p>- improved quality through better pay and conditions for the workforce by supporting agreement on an ERO through the JLC;</p><p>- the employment of graduate staff; and</p><p>- improved sustainability and stability for services. </p><p>The new funding model being implemented aims to transform the sector to one that is increasingly publicly funded and publicly managed, delivering a service for the public good, through a partnership between the State and providers, to the benefit of children, parents, educators and practitioners, and society overall.</p><p>A new fee management system, attached to core funding,  will mean no increase in fees from pre-pandemic levels for the September 2022 to August 2023 programme year, which, in tandem with developments to the NCS will together deliver significantly improved affordability for parents.</p><p>We will continue to build on this in Budget 2023 and into the future and as I have indicated before, in this year's budget my focus is on reducing the cost for parents by increased investment in the NCS.</p></reply>

Every year, more than 100,000 children participate on the universal pre-school programme (ECCE) and the National Childcare Scheme (NCS) subsidises up to 80,000 children. </p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s Transition Fund operating from May-August this year and the new Core Funding Scheme to roll out from September include a fee freeze condition, which will ensure that parents feel the full affordability benefits of the ECCE programme and the NCS, including the enhancements to the NCS, which I announced as part of Budget 2022.  </p>  <p>  The reforms I am implementing will for the first time provide Government with the means to meaningfully reduce the cost of early learning and childcare for parents. With these reforms in place, preparations are now underway in my Department to seek significant investment into the National Childcare Scheme in the context of the forthcoming budget that will lead to a substantial reduction in fees for parents without adversely affecting the sustainability and availability of services. </p>  <p>  I am also taking a range of steps to address issues of under supply. Some &euro;70m has been allocated to my Department through the revised National Development Plan (NDP) &ndash; with the majority of this funding earmarked for new places. Under the National Action Plan for Childminding, I have committed to opening up access to the NCS to parents who use childminders following the extension of regulation to childminders, which is expected to happen within the first 2-3 years of the Plan. </p>  <p>  My Department, in partnership with the Department of Housing Planning and Local Government, is in the process of updating the 2001 Planning Guidelines for Local Authorities on Early Learning and Childcare Settings. In addition, City/County Childcare Committees have been mobilised to engage proactively with services to identify vacant places and to explore possibilities for expansion among services, particularly where there is unmet need.</p></reply>

The establishment of the National Centre is a core commitment in the <i>Action Plan for Survivors and Former Residents of Mother and Baby and County Home Institutions; </i>the overarching aim of which is to support the implementation of the 22 commitments made by Government in response to the publication of the Mother and Baby Homes Commission of Investigation Report.</p><p>The National Centre will be located on the site of the former Magdalen Laundry on Sean McDermott Street in Dublin 1. It will stand as a site of conscience, and will be a national memorial to honour equally all those who were resident in institutions such as Mother and Baby Homes, Industrial Schools, Reformatories, Magdalen Laundries and the comparable experiences of those who were boarded out.</p><p>The National Centre will include a museum, an exhibition space, a central repository of records related to institutional trauma and a research centre. It will also contain a dedicated place for solemn reflection and remembrance. In addition, as part of the development of the site, social housing units, local community facilities and an educational and early learning facility will be constructed. The inclusion of these facilities will make a valuable contribution to the social and economic development of Dublin&rsquo;s North East Inner City.</p><p>The central repository of institutional records will sit at the heart of the National Centre. One unique aspect of the central repository will be the inclusion of the personal testimonies of survivors; allowing the lived experiences of survivors to be formally accepted as part of the official record.</p><p>While physically situated in Dublin, the National Centre will be accessible for all survivors, whether in other parts of Ireland or abroad.  It will provide digital access to records and exhibits, to enable survivors to visit more easily.  In this way, the Centre will be a national institution, which achieves a global and national reach, as well as strong connections to, and benefits for, the local community.</p><p>Work is underway to progress the initial planning and development stages of the National Centre.  </p><p>In addition to the development of the National Centre, the Action Plan<i></i>contains a series of measures addressing matters relating to individuals who were boarded out. Notably, the Birth Information and Tracing Bill, which has now passed all stages in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann, provides for a full and clear right of access to birth certificates, birth and early life information for all persons who were adopted, boarded out, the subject of an illegal birth registration or who otherwise have questions in relation to their origins.  </p></reply>

It is therefore not possible to provide an estimate of potential costs as sought.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that under the Department's Free Fees Initiative (FFI), the Exchequer pays tuition fees on behalf of eligible first time undergraduate students attending approved full-time undergraduate courses. In order to qualify for funding under the Department&rsquo;s Free Fees Initiative, students must meet the criteria of the scheme including previous education attendance, progression and attainment.</p>  <p>  Under the terms of the scheme tuition fees will not be paid in respect of students who already hold a postgraduate qualification or students pursuing a second undergraduate course of study.</p>  <p>  A key principle of the scheme is to support students in progressing through a chosen course of study from year to year. To satisfy the terms and conditions of the FFI in relation to progression, a student must be moving from year to year within a course having successfully completed the previous year or, having successfully completed a course, is progressing to another related course where the award for the subsequent course is of a higher level than the previous course.</p>  <p>  The progression criteria was included in the Free Fees Initiative (FFI) to allow for progression to a higher level undergraduate award via an "add-on" years route. This route accommodates students who previously completed a level 6 or 7 course, where the ultimate course award was at level 6 or 7 respectively, to progress to a higher level undergraduate award on a course related to their existing level 6 or 7 qualification (including exceptional circumstances where a student may not necessarily receive an exemption from the normal duration of the course).</p>  <p>  Typically students are not supported for a repeat period of study or for a different course at the same level under the FFI (in exceptional circumstances such as ill health an exception may be allowed). The objective of this policy is to help as many students as possible to obtain an undergraduate qualification. However, once an equivalent period of study has been completed on a new higher level course, the student may be eligible for free fees funding for the remainder of the course. An individual student's eligibility for the scheme, is assessed by the institution in accordance with the terms of the scheme.</p>  <p>  Where undergraduate students do not meet the qualifying criteria of the FFI they are required to pay tuition fees in full to their higher education institution. It is a matter for the higher education institution as an autonomous body to determine the applicable fee rate for students.</p>  <p>  Full details of the free fees criteria are available at the following location: www.hea.ie/funding-governance-performance/funding/student-finance/course-fees/.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-06-16a.1044.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1624" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022061600082#WRBB02900"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 418 and 419 together.</p>  <p>I thank the Deputy for her question on this important matter. Each of our educational institutions and aegis bodies have a duty of care to their students and staff. They have a responsibility to foster a campus culture that is clear in the condemnation of unwanted and unacceptable behaviours, which act as barriers to the safety of both students and staff and their active participation in college life. </p>  <p>  Our higher education situations (HEIs) have dignity and respect policies and procedures in place which actively promote a culture where sexual harassment, bullying and other such behaviours are not tolerated, and where everyone is treated with respect, feels valued and have a sense of belonging to the institute. Information of these policies and procedures are publicly available and can be accessed via the website of the HEIs. These policies and procedures are informed by our Framework for Consent policy document. </p>  <p>  Significant progress has been made regarding the Framework for Consent in Higher Education, since it was first launched in 2019. The Framework aims to ensure the creation of an institutional campus culture which is safe, respectful and supportive. As part of monitoring requirements moving forward, the HEA requires that institutions, in respect of both staff and students, report progress annually on implementation of the Framework for Consent. </p>  <p>  My Department has provided support for a number of consent awareness raising and training initiatives in the HEIs, including the: </p>  <p>  - NUIG Active Consent Programme; </p>  <p>  - UCC Bystander Training; </p>  <p>  - Speak Out report and support online platform; and </p>  <p>  - The ESHTE Toolkit and It Stops Now Campaign led by the NWC in conjunction with USI. </p>  <p>  My Department is partnering with the Department of Justice and the NUIG Active Consent programme to support the development of an online hub that will provide, for the first time, an integrated, publicly available resource on sexual consent awareness and learning, which will be an important resource for our further and higher education institutions and the wider community. </p>  <p>  My Department is also working closely with the Department of Justice to develop a number actions for the further and higher education sector which will be included in the Third Domestic, Sexual and Gender Based Violence Strategy which my colleague Minister McEntee will be publishing shortly. </p>  <p>  Allegations of sexual harassment or assault by a staff member of my Department against another staff member are dealt with in accordance with &ldquo;Dignity at Work &ndash; an Anti-Bullying, Harassment and Sexual Harassment Policy for the Civil Service&rdquo; which is publicly available at: www.cseas.per.gov.ie/wp-content/uploads/Dignity-At-Work-Policy-PDF.pdf . Upon receipt of a bullying or harassment complaint (verbal or written), the Human Resources (HR) Manager will first consider if the complaint may constitute a criminal offence. If there is a possibility that a criminal offence has occurred, the complaint will be referred to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as soon as possible. Any further Departmental investigation may be put on hold pending advice from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as to whether to continue processing the complaint. </p>  <p>  The creation of an institutional campus culture in each of our further and higher education institutions which is safe, respectful and supportive, is a key priority for me. I will continue to lead the way on institutional change, championing the changes required to achieve a cultural norm where bullying and sexual harassment are not tolerated.</p></reply>

Visa processing times for the Ankara Visa Office are published online by the Department of Foreign Affairs at www.dfa.ie/irish-embassy/turkey/visas/visas-for-ireland-weekly-decisions-report/</p><p>The Ankara Visa Office has seen a more than 50% increase in visa applications received in the year to date to the end of May 2022 in comparison with the same period in 2019 (before COVID-19 related travel restrictions). Long stay study visas account for more than 60% of those being received in 2022. In addition to this increase in applications, the Ankara Visa Office has received an extremely high number of incomplete applications, which is also adding to the longer processing times, given the resources that have to go into examining these applications.</p><p>The processing time at each Visa Office and location worldwide is determined by a number of factors, such as: the volume and complexity of applications, whether investigation is required or not, individual circumstances, peak application periods, seasonal factors, and the resources available.  While every effort is made to process applications as quickly as possible, processing times inevitably vary as a result. </p><p>Every effort is made to keep visa processing times to a minimum, and a number of measures have been put in place to deal with the increased demand for visas to come to Ireland, including in the Ankara Visa Office. This includes the assignment of additional staff to deal with applications, and more generally the streamlining of visa processes where possible.  The position in this regard is being kept under review. </p><p>The central concern in deciding on visa applications, as with all visa services worldwide, is to strike an appropriate balance between protecting the country's vital national interests by maintaining an effective immigration regime while at the same time facilitating travel for those who meet the criteria.  Each visa application is therefore decided on its own merits taking all factors into account. </p></reply>

I will shortly, subject to Government approval, publish the Criminal Justice (Hate Crime) Bill which will legislate against hate crime and hate speech and help to ensure that Ireland is safe, fair and inclusive for all.</p>  <p>  The Bill will strengthen the law around hate crime by creating new, aggravated forms of certain existing criminal offences, where those offences are motivated by prejudice against a protected characteristic.</p>  <p>  The protected characteristics under the Hate Crime Bill include sexual orientation and gender.</p>  <p>  Aggravated offences will generally carry an enhanced penalty and the record of any conviction for such an offence would clearly state that the offence was a hate crime.</p>  <p>  In relation to setting up a specific Garda taskforce, as the deputy is aware, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the management and administration of Garda business, including all operational policing matters. As Minister, I have no role in these independent functions. </p>  <p>  The Garda National Diversity and Integration Unit (GNDIU) forms part of the Garda Community Relations Bureau and has a very positive working relationship with minority communities in Ireland.  </p>  <p>  The Garda Diversity and Integration Strategy is externally focused on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s relations with the communities that it serves, delivering on the obligations on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to human rights and equality under Irish, EU law and international conventions.</p>  <p>  Under the National LGBTI+ Inclusion Strategy, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are working to significantly increase reporting of hate crimes to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by members of the LGBTI+ community owing to the more open relationship that has been developed.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has implemented a number of specific operations in Dublin City aimed at addressing anti-social activity.  The operations involve increased uniform and plain clothes proactive patrolling of the city, with a particular emphasis on the city centre.</p>  <p>  Operation Citizen, established in November 2021, is a co-ordinated approach involving Garda&iacute; from both Dublin Metropolitan Region South Central and North Central with an emphasis on providing high-visibility policing in the city centre to provide reassurance to the public and proactively tackle incidents of anti-social behaviour.</p>  <p>  I am further informed that, as part of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s ongoing national response to hate crime, the Garda National Diversity and Integration Unit (GNDIU) provides assurance to members of the public in relation to reports of hate-based occurrences. This includes daily monitoring of all recorded hate crimes / incidents on PULSE and social media, advising investigating members, supporting investigations and providing assurance to victims and their communities.</p>  <p>  A new, non-emergency online hate crime reporting mechanism was launched by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in July 2021 to improve accessibility to the Garda service for victims of all types of Hate Crime. It is available via the garda.ie website and provides a safe and secure environment for victims, who may previously have been reluctant to report in person to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></reply>

This information is collected monthly and reported through the HSE Management Data Report (MDR). The Department oversees the performance of the HSE in relation to the delivery of services and KPIs set out in its National Service Plan. This is achieved through an on-going monthly performance management process where the HSE reports against the targets set out in the Service Plan. Monthly high-level meetings between management in both organisations are held to discuss on-going or emerging performance issues and to determine actions to resolve and improve areas of concern.</p><p>In addition, my Department also closely monitors the waiting list for G.I. Endoscopy services. This waiting list information is collected, collated, validated, and published by the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF). This waiting list data is published by hospital and nationally in standardised time bands of 0-6, 6-12,12-18 and 18+ months. This information is used by my Department to monitor demand for G.I. Endoscopy services, with endoscopy services remaining a key component of the 2022 Waiting List Action Plan. The NTPF data is also a central source of waiting list figures used for answering parliamentary questions by my Department. </p><p>The waiting lists for G.I. Endoscopy consist of procedures for both colonoscopy and upper G.I endoscopy (OGD). In a recent parliamentary questions raised by the Deputy, it was this published total G.I. Endoscopy figure which was provided in respect of University Hospital Kerry, in the standardised time bands made available to my Department by the NTPF. </p><p>In response to the Deputy&rsquo;s current request for specific waiting time bands for endoscopy by 13 week time bands, I have asked the NTPF to extract the figures for colonoscopy for UHK for each month in 2022 and in addition I have also requested the figure for OGD by month, both of which are provided in the attached table. The over-arching G.I. Endoscopy waiting list for University Hospital Kerry by standardised time bands remains available on the NTPF website. </p><p>Total Waiters for a GI Scope Procedure by GI Type by Wait Time Band for 2022 <table>    <tr>       <th>Row Labels</th>       <th>0-13 Weeks</th>       <th>13-26 Weeks</th>       <th>Small Volume Time Band</th>       <th>Grand Total</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Jan-22</td>       <td>305</td>       <td>133</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>439</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Colonoscopy</td>       <td>164</td>       <td>77</td>       <td></td>       <td>241</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>OGD</td>       <td>141</td>       <td>56</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>198</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Feb-22</td>       <td>325</td>       <td>134</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>460</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Colonoscopy</td>       <td>191</td>       <td>62</td>       <td></td>       <td>253</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>OGD</td>       <td>134</td>       <td>72</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>207</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mar-22</td>       <td>359</td>       <td>104</td>       <td></td>       <td>463</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Colonoscopy</td>       <td>209</td>       <td>50</td>       <td></td>       <td>259</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>OGD</td>       <td>150</td>       <td>54</td>       <td></td>       <td>204</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Apr-22</td>       <td>401</td>       <td>82</td>       <td></td>       <td>483</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Colonoscopy</td>       <td>245</td>       <td>44</td>       <td></td>       <td>289</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>OGD</td>       <td>156</td>       <td>38</td>       <td></td>       <td>194</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>May-22</td>       <td>323</td>       <td>90</td>       <td></td>       <td>413</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Colonoscopy</td>       <td>189</td>       <td>44</td>       <td></td>       <td>233</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>OGD</td>       <td>134</td>       <td>46</td>       <td></td>       <td>180</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

Adults with full eligibility can access a range of services including GP services, prescribed drugs and medicines, all in-patient public hospital services in public wards, including consultants&rsquo; services, all out-patient public hospital services including consultants&rsquo; services, dental, ophthalmic and aural services and appliances, and maternity and infant care service.</p><p>  Persons with limited eligibility are eligible for in-patient and outpatient public hospital services including Consultant services, Emergency Department or minor injury care, are subject to certain charges. Other services such as allied healthcare professional services may also be made available to persons with limited eligibility. The EU Cross Border Directive (CBD) provides rules for the reimbursements to patients of the cost of receiving treatment abroad, where the patient would be entitled to such treatment in their home Member State, and supplements the rights that patients already have at EU level. The CBD enables persons resident in the State to access and be reimbursed for healthcare in another Member State by the HSE, provided such healthcare is publicly available within Ireland. Where a person accesses private healthcare in Ireland there is no facility for the cost of that care to be reimbursed by the public health system.</p><p>  Regarding cataract waiting lists, the 2022 Waiting List Action Plan was launched on 25 February this year. The Plan allocates &euro;350 million to the HSE and National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to reduce waiting lists by 18 percent this year which will bring the number of people waiting to their lowest point in five years. Public hospitals will be supported by the NTPF in a number of different ways, including funding the operation of cataract clinics in the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital and in Nenagh General Hospital. While the NTPF will seek to arrange over 150 different types of procedures in public and private hospitals, covering the full range of complexity on the waiting lists, there will be a particular focus on 15 procedures which, prior to NTPF engagement, accounted for more than 50% of the inpatient/day case waiting list. For the 15 high volume procedures, including cataracts, the NTPF will offer treatment for all clinically suitable patients waiting more than 6 months.</p></reply>

Following this the Department of Justice was invited to participate in the Group's work. The Department of Justice accepted the invitation and became a vital part of this process. </p>  <p>  At the inaugural meeting of the Group, which was held on 3rd March 2022, the Group's terms of reference and action-timelines were agreed. The terms of reference are available on the Department's website. Areas being considered by the Group include the recruitment, retention, training, pay and conditions, and the career development of front-line carers in home-support and nursing homes.</p>  <p>  The Group is currently working with key sectoral stakeholders to further explore and define the issues arising and will submit a report for my consideration by September 2022. The report will outline the Group's key findings and recommendations as well as an action plan for the recommendations' implementation.</p></reply>

The plan proposes ambitious additional activity levels which will work to reduce the number of children waiting for spinal orthopaedic procedures (scoliosis and spina bifida) by year end.</p>  <p>  This latest initiative is further evidence of this Government&rsquo;s commitment to address the issues facing these children. Both current and capital funding has been provided in 2022 to support this initiative.</p>  <p>  Both current and capital funding totalling &euro;17.43 million has been approved for this initiative. The plan will result in an additional 67 spinal fusions and 28 spinal other procedures for children with Scoliosis, as well as an additional 141 procedures for children with Spina Bifida. The plan also allocates substantial paediatric orthopaedic procedures at Cappagh orthopaedic hospital, with 720 additional procedures planned for the year.</p>  <p>  By using the capacity provided by Cappagh for less complex orthopaedic patients, including routine scoliosis procedures, CHI can free up space in order that complex orthopaedic procedures, including scoliosis spinal fusions, can be carried out centrally at CHI sites. The impact of the plan has already been recorded with increased activity year to date. Year to date by the end of May 2022, 197 scoliosis procedures had been carried out, compared to 156 for the same period in 2019. The number of patients waiting longer than 6 months for a scoliosis procedure has also reduced to 79 by the end of May 2022, compared to 103 in August 2020.</p></reply>

Ophthalmology services are provided throughout all hospital groups in the country, with cataract removal one of the key procedures carried out as part of this specialty.</p>  <p>  The 2022 Waiting List Action Plan, published in February of this year, allocates &euro;350m to the HSE and NTPF to reduce and reform acute scheduled care waiting lists. Under this plan the Department, HSE, and NTPF will deliver urgent additional capacity for the treatment of patients, as well as investing in longer term reforms to bring sustained reductions in waiting lists. </p>  <p>  Through the Waiting List Action Plan, public hospitals will be supported by the NTPF in a number of ways, including funding the operation of cataract clinics in the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital and in Nenagh General Hospital. </p>  <p>  The Plan also identifies cataracts as one of 15 high-volume procedures for which the NTPF will ensure that people waiting over 6 months will receive an offer of treatment, provided they are clinically ready. As of the end of May, just over 1,500 patients had been waiting more than 6 months for an inpatient day case (IPDC) cataract procedure, and over 1,300 of them have been made an offer of treatment.  </p>  <p>  Implementation of the Waiting List Action Plan is overseen by a Task Force, co-chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and the CEO of the HSE. The Department, HSE and NTPF will continue to work closely to identify ways to improve access to care across the system, including through increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &lsquo;see and treat&rsquo; services, providing virtual clinics, and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.</p></reply>

The Irish Coast Guard provides additional support on an as available basis.</p>  <p>  The ICAA is a charity funded HEMS, which has operated since July 2019 under a service level agreement with the HSE.  Under this agreement the ICAA committed to fund all maintenance, repairs, fuel and other expenses incurred in the provision of the transportation element of the HEMS, while the NAS committed to providing the clinical staff and all medical consumables.</p>  <p>  In early March of this year ICAA advised that it was experiencing financial difficulties.  In order to provide funding to ensure the operation of the HEMS service, it was necessary that the issue of State Aid was addressed with the European Commission. </p>  <p>  The Commission gave approval on 11 May to the establishment of a scheme under the COVID-19 Temporary Framework for State Aid to safeguard the provision of charity-funded HEMS services.   This Framework provides that temporary limited amounts of aid may be allocated to undertakings experiencing liquidity difficulties due to the COVID pandemic. The HSE is now administering the scheme and is engaging with ICAA regarding the ongoing provision of funding. </p>  <p>  Separately, the HSE has commenced a procurement process to ensure the ongoing provision of HEMS in the South-West of the country on a long-term sustainable basis.  This procurement process is ongoing.</p>  <p>  The Temporary Framework Scheme will ensure that the HEMS service is secured until the outcome of the HSE&rsquo;s procurement process is concluded. </p></reply>

Examples include plasters and bandages, wheelchairs, contact lenses, blood pressure meters, ventilators, incubators, hip implants, coronary stents, pacemakers, and defibrillators.</p>  <p>  In the EU, medical devices are regulated by way of an EU wide framework which aims to ensure that all medical devices available for use on the EU market are safe and perform as intended. A valid medical device bears a &lsquo;CE&rsquo; mark, which indicates that it meets the basic requirements for safety and effectiveness under European law and can be placed on the EU market.</p>  <p>  In Ireland, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is the competent authority for medical devices and their role includes enforcing the applicable legislation and monitoring the safety of medical devices after they are placed on the market. </p>  <p>  As such, the HPRA undertakes many functions, including, but not limited to, designating notified bodies within the jurisdiction, assessing clinical investigations of medical devices, and undertaking vigilance and market surveillance for medical devices. The aim of the vigilance system is to reduce a risk of death or serious deterioration in the state of health associated with the use of a medical device that is already placed on the market. Within this context, the HPRA evaluates specific incidents and field safety corrective actions associated with medical devices including events which relate to reusable invasive medical devices . However the HPRA does not monitor rates of hospital acquired infections.</p>  <p>  To answer the specific query it would be most helpful if the Deputy could provide further information such as, a specific incident being referenced, or total number of reports the HPRA may have received for a specific type of device, to assist in providing a more detailed response.</p></reply>

These are provided through community services known as Community Funded Schemes and play a key role in assisting and supporting people to maintain everyday functioning, and to remain living in their homes and local community.</p>  <p>  Applications for such appliances made within Community Health Organisations (CHOs) are assessed by the local Resource Allocation Group and a determination is made regarding approval based on clinical priority and the funding available.  At times, due to the demand for resources exceeding the available capacity, waiting lists may apply for some categories of items but CHOs undertake a range of initiatives to ensure optimum use of resources.</p>  <p>  Amputees, whose amputation arose from either a traumatic or elective event, usually have their primary prosthesis fitted at the hospital where the surgery was undertaken. Subsequent prostheses are provided to eligible clients through the Community Funded Schemes. Rehabilitation services are provided by the National Rehabilitation Hospital (NRH) primarily at their site in Dun Laoghaire and augmented by a number of satellite clinics that they operate throughout the country. There are also a number of smaller services operated at regional level that provide assessment and fitting clinics along with prostheses at a local level.</p>  <p>  A HSE Primary Care led National Service Improvement Programme has the aim of improving the equity of access, value for money, and functional processes of the Community Funded Schemes through the establishment of national guidelines for the provision of medical and surgical aids and appliances. While this work was delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Programme has recommenced. A review of the current prosthetics service is underway and is due to be completed by early 2023.</p>  <p>  The Long Term Illness (LTI) scheme was established under Section 59(3) of the Health Act 1970 (as amended). Regulations were made in 1971, 1973 and 1975, prescribing 16 illnesses covered by the scheme. These are: acute leukaemia; mental handicap; cerebral palsy; mental illness (in a person under 16); cystic fibrosis; multiple sclerosis; diabetes insipidus; muscular dystrophies; diabetes mellitus; parkinsonism; epilepsy; phenylketonuria; haemophilia; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide.</p>  <p>  Under the LTI scheme, patients receive drugs, medicines, and medical and surgical appliances directly related to the treatment of their illness, free of charge.</p>  <p>  People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be eligible for a medical card. In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE. Medical card eligibility is primarily based on an assessment of means and is not granted on the basis of any particular condition.</p>  <p>  In certain circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income guidelines, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from illness. The HSE afford applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting documentation to determine whether undue hardship exists and to fully take account of all relevant circumstances that may benefit them in assessment, including medical evidence of costs and certain expenses.</p></reply>

It is our intention to build on this momentum in 2022.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware of the main targets set out in The Forestry Licensing Plan published at the start of the year.  The Plan sets out a range of forestry priorities set to run for the whole of 2022.</p>  <p>  In order to achieve these targets, we have improved our systems, and given the number of files referred to ecology, we have recruited additional ecologists. There are 35 full-time equivalent ecologists working on forestry applications, with 21 dealing with afforestation. We expect the impact of this recent recruitment to become evident at the beginning of July.</p>  <p>As regards progression towards our overall target at the end of Quarter 1 2022, my Department had 3,862 licence applications on hand. Since 1 January, this figure has reduced from 4,803 and from 6,100 in August 2021. This is significant progress and indicates that output is exceeding output i.e. the number of licences issued in Q1 was 1,307 and the number of applications received was 621.</p>  <p>The number of applications with the Department over 120 days as of the weekending 10 June has further decreased to 2,500 applications. The Department has now brought in a policy on time-bound further information requests (FIRs). This will bring it in line with other planning authorities to ensure efficient use of resources. Files with outstanding FIRs over a set time will be removed from the licensing worklist. Reminders will always be sent to applicants to make them aware of the situation with their file.</p>  <p>  Along with Minister of State Pippa Hackett, who has overall responsbility for the sector, we expect the weekly output to increase once the full impact of all these measure including the new ecologists becomes evident and it remains my commitment to meet the targets set out in the Licencing Plan.</p>  <p>In the interest of full transparency details of all licences issued by category are available on the weekly dashboard. This is published on the Departmental website and is made available to all interested parties as well as being submitted to the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine each week  .</p></reply>
