    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-03-03a.7.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030300058#WRA00500"><p>I am very cognisant of the importance of incentivising greater use of our public transport services; however, I am not convinced that providing free public transport is the most balanced means of achieving this objective. </p>  <p>  COVID gave us some insight into the level of funding that might be required in the absence of fare revenue. For example, in 2020, an additional &euro;370 million was required to enable the continued operation of services due to the collapse of fare intake. In 2021, &euro;659m was required to run PSO services, and this year we have allocated &euro;538 million for the continuation of these essential services. Apportioning such significant levels of Exchequer resources to one goal would undoubtedly impact the State&rsquo;s ability to support other worthy public services. </p>  <p>  While free public transport is available in some European locations, I understand that results have varied. The intention is commendable - encouraging modal shift, reducing congestion, and capitalising on the associated environmental benefits. However, the Schemes can have unintended consequences, most noticeably a significant reduction in active travel. This is counter to our core Government goals of improving citizen&rsquo;s health and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. </p>  <p>  While I might not agree that free transport provides a silver bullet solution - I do believe there is merit in incentivising fares when an appropriate balance can be struck. I am delighted to soon launch the Young Adult Card - allowing those aged between 19 and 23 to avail of an average 50% fare discount. Simultaneously, as part of the suite of measures aimed at tackling the increasing cost of living, we will also introduce an average 20% fare reduction for all PSO passengers  </p>  <p>  Further, the raft of fare initiatives being introduced this year, paired with the significant increase in investment in vehicles and infrastructure, will make public transport an overall more attractive proposition and support greater modal shift ultimately helping us reduce our transport emissions. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-03-03a.11.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030300058#WRA00800"><p>As the Deputy is aware, a decision to remove passenger services on the Waterford to Rosslare line was made in 2010 and a maintenance arrangement was put in place then to allow for its continued maintenance since then. </p>  <p>  I have commissioned a Strategic Rail Review to help inform the development of inter-urban / inter-regional rail on the Island of Ireland over the coming decades.  It will also consider the potential scope for improved rail services and infrastructure along the various existing, or future potential, corridors of the network including disused and closed lines such as the Waterford to Rosslare line. An important aspect of the Review will be to consider the potential for rail freight and whether opportunities exist to increase its role on the island. </p>  <p>  The Deputy is right to highlight the growing importance of our port network in the south east. It is the case that Waterford and Rosslare handle different types of cargo and that can influence the potential of each with regard to rail freight. Waterford port handles LoLo which is suitable for rail freight, while Rosslare is of course principally a RoRo port and RoRo does not lend itself easily to rail freight. </p>  <p>  I do believe there is real potential for Ireland&rsquo;s ports in the area of offshore renewable energy (ORE). That is why I published a policy statement on the matter last December which makes it clear to the offshore industry that the Government is committed to the provision of port facilities in Ireland for ORE developments. In that regard I very much welcome the fact that Rosslare Europort has submitted an application for EU funding to support it ambitious plans to develop an offshore renewable energy hub.   </p></reply>

I think improving the public realm can provide significant benefits for local communities and improve our urban environment generally as well. I imagine the Deputy shares my general perspective on the issue.</p>  <p>  I understand that in relation to this specific issue, Transport Infrastructure Ireland did identify an opportunity to provide a linear park along the R132 to Swords. The proposal was to provide play areas, leisure cycling, biodiversity planting and a very pleasant green environment which would enhance the amenity value of the area for use by all, and especially those living adjacent to MetroLink.</p>  <p>  I am informed that after extensive engagement with residents and local representatives, the design has been modified significantly to address concerns raised by local residents. Some residents still remain opposed to the public realm designs and these concerns will continue to be engaged with, and where possible, solutions will be presented for further consideration. As part of this design development, the project team are committed to working with the residents to achieve optimal outcomes for all. The services of an independent engineering expert have also been made available to the local residents to provide them with impartial assistance.</p></reply>

This is being witnessed across the European Union as well as many other regions. </p>  <p>  The final retail price of fuel is determined by a number of factors which include the costs of production, distribution, global market factors, international exchange rates, taxation, wholesale market contracts negotiated at different rates for the purchase of oil as well as individual retail pricing policies.  </p>  <p>  In order to mitigate the impact of fuel price increases for hauliers, the Diesel Rebate Scheme offers a partial excise refund to qualifying operators when the price of diesel is relatively high. In Budget 2020, in light of the challenges arising from Brexit uncertainty facing the industry, the marginal rate of compensation at prices over &euro;1.32 (VAT inclusive) was doubled up to the maximum repayment rate of 7.5 cents per litre. In recognition of the vital role that the haulage sector plays in the economy, this increase has been maintained since.</p>  <p>  In addition, businesses that are registered for VAT may deduct the VAT charged to them on the purchase of business inputs, such as road diesel and other motoring costs.</p>  <p>  Minister Ryan and I met with the Irish Road Haulage Association (&lsquo;IRHA&rsquo;) on 10 December 2021 and again on 10 February 2022 to discuss the spike in fuel prices for hauliers and the need for the sector to make progress towards decarbonisation.  While no way forward was agreed, discussions are ongoing at official level on these issues. </p>  <p>  Already however some supports are available for operators to switch to alternatively fuelled vehicles. These include a purchase grant and reduced tolls for vehicles powered by a number of alternative fuels including hydrogen, electric, and gas. In addition, Budget 2022 announced an expansion of the Accelerated Capital Allowance (&lsquo;ACA&rsquo;) scheme for Gas Vehicles and Refuelling Equipment. This ACA scheme provides an accelerated wear and tear allowance for capital expenditure incurred on qualifying vehicles and refuelling equipment.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-03-03a.21.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030300058#WRA01500"><p>In line with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and Ireland's National Disability Inclusion Strategy, I am fully committed to strengthening public transport offerings and progressively making them accessible for all, especially for Persons with Disabilities, Persons with Reduced Mobility, and Older People. </p>  <p>  To this end, all new public transport infrastructure and services are accessible from the design stage. This means that accessibility features, such as wheelchair accessibility and audio/visual aids, are built into from the start. Newer public transport systems, such as the Luas for instance, are fully accessible, as are all new buses purchased by the National Transport Authority.</p>  <p>  We also have dedicated funding of over &euro;15 million and a programme of works in place to retrofit our older and legacy infrastructure and facilities to make them accessible as well.</p>  <p>  In addition, to making our &ldquo;hard&rdquo; infrastructure and services accessible, it is crucial to provide the &ldquo;softer&rdquo; types of support as well, to enable Persons with Disabilities to travel independently on public transport. </p>  <p>  The NTA and the transport companies are very active in this field; they have a number of initiatives underway including the provision of Disability Awareness Training to frontline staff, the rollout of the Just A Minute (JAM) Card to assist anyone with a communications difficulty, and ensuring that information is provided in accessible formats for public transport services. </p>  <p>  In addition, there is the Travel Assistance Scheme which is a free service managed by Dublin Bus that aims to give people with disabilities the confidence they need to use public transport.  Under the scheme an assistant can accompany people who need help using public transport and give advice how to plan a journey on Dublin Bus, Luas, DART and Go-Ahead Ireland services. Due to the success of the Scheme in the Greater Dublin Area it is planned to extend it to include Cork later this year which will be of great benefit in the region.</p>  <p>  While my Department and its Agencies have responsibility for open public transport services only, we work closely with other Departments and Agencies which have responsibility for dedicated and specialist disability transport services. An example of such collaboration, with colleagues in Health and the HSE, was the launch last year of non-emergency transport services in Leitrim. This scheme enhanced local rural public transport services and improved the number of stops at key health and care centres, thereby negating some of the need for specialist, dedicated services. All the vehicles used in this pilot are accessible and low floor to meet the needs of many service users.</p>  <p>  I am strongly committed through the provision of new and retrofitting older infrastructure, as well as by supporting softer measures and collaborations, to continue to improve the accessibility of our public transport system.   </p></reply>

Once funding arrangements have been put in place with Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII), under the Roads Acts 1993-2015, and in line with the National Development Plan, the planning, design and maintenance of individual national roads is a matter for TII, in conjunction with the local authorities concerned. </p>  <p>  The matter at issue here - the flooding of the N59 at Kylemore - is not a matter for TII.  I understand from TII that Galway County Council have assessed the cause of the flooding at Kylemore Road and have determined that the problem is associated with the capacity of the river channel and blockage of the bridge opening by material transported by the river. </p>  <p>  It is a matter for Galway County Council as road authority for the area, in conjunction with the Office of Public Works (OPW) to resolve this issue. I understand that works to remove the build-up of material in the river channel, which is leading to the flooding problem, must also have agreement of the National Parks and Wildlife Service and Inland Fisheries Ireland.  I understand that engagement is taking place between Galway County Council, OPW and these agencies in an attempt to find a solution. </p>  <p>  TII has indicated to my Department that it is available to liaise with and provide support to Galway County Council, insofar as it can, in this matter.  I will also bring the matter to the attention of my colleague Minister Patrick Donovan who has responsibility for the OPW.</p></reply>

Under the National Development Plan &euro;1bn has been allocated to specific carbon reduction measures, including vehicle electrification.</p>  <p>  The Government is fully committed to supporting a significant expansion and modernisation of the electric vehicle charging network over the coming years. A national charging infrastructure strategy is being developed which will set out a pathway to stay ahead of demand over the critical period out to 2030. My Department is engaging with relevant stakeholders to inform this work and it is envisaged that the strategy will be published for consultation shortly. </p>  <p>  EV sales continue to grow strongly and it is imperative that a seamless network of recharging infrastructure is available to support that growth. In the development of the strategy officials from my Department have engaged with local authorities. other public sector bodies, and the private sector in identifying how to best support the prompt rollout of infrastructure both to address challenges in domestic and neighbourhood charging as well as the need for fast charging.  My officials have also reviewed international best practice in the provision of EV charging infrastructure to understand what mix of infrastructure provision will best address the needs of Irish EV owners. </p>  <p>  A package of supports aiming to facilitate a swift delivery of infrastructure across the country is being prepared to be launched alongside the strategy. I look forward to providing more information on those aspects towards the end of this month.   </p>  <p>  I am also pleased to say that preparations are progressing well to establish an Office of Low Emission Vehicles.  This Office will play an important role in our transition to zero emission vehicles. It will co-ordinate measures to support the uptake of EVs and the rollout of charge point  infrastructure.   </p></reply>

As such, as part of a suite of new measures is being introduced, I was delighted to be able to bring forward a proposal to reduce fares on PSO public transport services by an average of 20% until the end of 2022. These discounted fares will benefit the hundreds of thousands of people across the country who use public transport every day.</p>  <p>  &euro;54m in Exchequer funding has been secured to allow for the introduction of these discounted fares, this is in addition to the &euro;538m that has already been allocated to PSO and Local Link services this year. </p>  <p>  My Department is working closely with the NTA and the various PSO public transport operators to commence rolling out these fare reductions across the public transport network by late April and early May.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, time is needed to make and test the necessary changes to the wide array of ticketing systems employed across the network, including, the Leap card, on-board ticketing equipment, vending machines and online web platforms. Updates are needed across all the PSO operators, at the different stations and depots, as well as on thousands of individual vehicles, to ensure the discounts are applied across the board.</p>  <p>  In addition to the average 20% fare reduction, and in recognition of the importance of incentivising young people to use public transport, I secured funding to provide for the introduction of a young adult card. This card will allow any person who is between 19 and 23 years old, to avail of an average 50% discount fares across all services, including city, intercity and rural services. It is envisaged that this discount will initially be made available on PSO services at the same time as the average 20% fare discount (April/May) - providing significant travel savings for this age cohort. It is my intention to broaden the eligibility of the Young Adult Card to include commercial operators at a later date.  The NTA are currently assessing deployment options in this regard.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, I anticipate that the average 20% PSO fare reduction will also apply to eligible annual Taxsaver tickets - again from April/May time.   </p>  <p>  Collectively, these fare reduction initiatives, should help promote greater modal shift and encourage a reduced reliance on private transport with associated benefit of transport emission savings.</p>  <p>  In conclusion, the introduction of a 20% average fare discount and the Young Adult Cards in late April/early May, means that 2022 looks set to be an exciting year for public transport provision across the country, as we slowly return to pre-pandemic travel patterns.</p></reply>

Hub ports accommodate very large container vessels that trade on intercontinental trade routes, operated by global shipping lines. The majority of LoLo services to and from the port of Cork link direct to European Hub ports via smaller container vessels (feeder vessels) with seven such services currently trading between Tivoli and Hub ports in the UK and the EU.</p>  <p>  Due to disruptions to global supply chains primarily as a result of COVID, European Ports have been prioritizing large intercontinental container vessels, with much less prioritization of the smaller &ldquo;feeder&rdquo; vessels that serve other ports such as Cork. This has resulted in peaks and troughs in cargo flows to the Port of Cork, resulting in port users leaving their cargo in Tivoli for longer periods than normal.</p>  <p>  I understand from the Port of Cork Company that this, in addition to the recent spate of storms that crossed the country have led to delays in their ship operations at the Tivoli docks.  The Company has put additional resources in Tivoli to alleviate these difficulties.  In addition, underpinning cargo operations, the Company also operates an automated vehicle booking system for hauliers to manage waiting times and reduce delays at the terminal.    </p>  <p>  The development at Ringaskiddy will see the port over time relocate its business from the current city centre Tivoli location and the City Quays to a new facility known as Cork Container Terminal (CCT). The construction work is complete with commissioning works currently underway and the facility is expected to be operational in Quarter 2, 2022. This will bring additional LoLo capacity on stream, easing congestion at Tivoli. Ringaskiddy will future proof the Port as an international gateway for trade and will allow the Port to continue to meet the needs of its customers and the economic developmental needs locally and at regional and national level. Due to planning conditions, the continued operation of Tivoli terminal to accommodate a percentage of the current and future LoLo trade to Cork will be necessary until the M28 dual carriageway is completed.  </p></reply>

Where possible I am incentivizing public transport use through investment in new services and infrastructure as well as reducing fare structures. In recognition that it is not always possible to provide public transport, particularly in remote areas, I also have a complementary suite of incentives to electrify private transport such as the EV purchase grant and the domestic charger grant scheme.  I am also strongly committed to funding active travel infrastructure to provide more walking and cycling facilities to increase peoples green travel options.  </p><p>The Government is strongly committed to helping combat the rising cost-of-living being experienced throughout the country. In this context, a suite of new measures is being introduced by Government to help with this issue, including a 20% average fare reduction on PSO services until the end of 2022. These discounted fares will benefit the hundreds of thousands of people across the country who use public transport every day. A further &euro;54m in Exchequer funding has been secured to allow for the introduction of these discounted fares, this is in addition to the REV22 allocations. The NTA will work with the PSO public transport operators in the coming weeks to commence rolling out these fare reductions across the public transport network in late April/ early May.</p><p>Also, in recognition of the importance of incentivising young people to use public transport, as part of Budget 2022 I secured &euro;25m of funding to provide for the introduction of a young adult card (YAC) which will allow any person nationwide who is between 19 and 23 years old, to avail of an entitlement for discounted travel costs, and to increase the level of discount over and above the current student discount to an average of discount of 50% across all services, including city, intercity and rural services. It is envisaged that the discount will initially be made available on PSO services, and then broadened to include commercial operators at a later date.  This will not only promote modal shift in the transport sector among this age group but should also contribute towards a reduced reliance on private transport with associated benefit of transport emission savings.  The NTA has commenced work in relation to the implementation of the new fares&rsquo; structures for young adults, and this includes the application process and establishing a definitive timeline for the introduction of the Scheme. </p><p>A new 90-minute fare has also been  introduced by the NTA to coincide with Phase 2 of BusConnects  which gives customers the option to transfer between Dublin Bus, Luas and most DART, commuter rail and Go-Ahead Ireland services in Dublin at no additional fare.</p><p>In addition, the Deputy will be pleased to hear that the new Connecting Ireland Rural Mobility Plan will significantly benefit those living in rural Ireland. Starting this year, this plan is a major national public transport initiative funded by my Department and managed by the National Transport Authority. The aim of this plan is to increase public transport connectivity over a five-year period, particularly for people living outside the major cities and towns. That means that by 2025, Ireland will see a 25% overall increase in rural bus services. Over 100 rural towns and villages will benefit from frequent public transport services for the first time ever. To ensure timely rollout, I have secured &euro;5.6 million in Budget 2022 to support the NTA in planning and implementing these services.</p><p>The NTA are currently analysing the feedback received from the public consultation and will issue a report once this process is finalised. They are also in the process of finalising the proposals, with a<b></b>rollout of new and improved services planned on a phased basis starting this year to 2025<b>. </b>I believe that Connecting Ireland will greatly improve the mobility options for many currently unable to avail of public transport services. </p></reply>

This Programme aims to create safer walking and cycling routes within communities, alleviate congestion at the school gates and increase the number of students who walk or cycle to school by providing new or improved walking and cycling facilities. Funding is provided to local authorities as part of the Department of Transport's funding allocation to the National Transport Authority (NTA), is supported by the Department of Education and coordinated by An Taisce&rsquo;s Green Schools.</p>  <p>  &euro;15m has been allocated for projects at the 170 schools included in Round One of the Programme. The schools not included in Round One will be engaged with on a rolling basis in each local authority area. This funding is being provided from the &euro;1.8 billion funding earmarked in the Programme for Government to support sustainable transport</p>  <p>  It is important to note that local authorities have the power to introduce bye-laws to set special speed limits in designated areas such as built up areas or around schools, and typically have done so. The Safe Routes to School Programme is focusing more on urban and suburban areas, as there is greater population densities within walking and cycling distance to schools in these areas. There are also a significant number of schools on the edge of towns and villages, within walking distance, which do not have continuous footpaths on the route to schools. These schools are viewed as urban/suburban for the purposes of the Programme.</p>  <p>  However, the Programme will also work with a small number of rural schools - for example schools on 80km/h roads outside town or village boundaries - to devise some infrastructure interventions that can promote active travel in such locations. These will be based more on slower speeds and highlighting the presence of a school. </p></reply>

Newer systems such as the Luas are fully accessible, as are all new buses purchased by the NTA. </p>  <p>  However, the real challenge is in relation to upgrading older infrastructure and facilities to make them accessible. The difficulties and frustrations experienced by people with disabilities using such legacy infrastructure, bus and train stations, have been outlined many times.</p>  <p>  In relation to these legacy bus and trains stations, or hubs as they are sometimes called, my Department funds the multi-annual ringfenced Public Transport Accessibility Retrofit Programme. This programme, which is managed by the NTA, includes projects to upgrade bus bays at regional bus and train stations and to upgrade train stations to make them accessible to wheelchair users.</p>  <p>  In relation to bus stations, accessibility audits have now been carried out at 18 stations, In 2021, the NTA provided funding to install wheelchair accessible bays for coaches with wheelchair lifts and other external improvements in 23 Bus Eireann stations.</p>  <p>  Turning to train stations, accessibility works have either been recently completed or are ongoing at several stations. For example, footbridges were installed at Carlow, Ennis and Edgeworthstown stations last year, while works are underway at Dalkey and Gormanstown stations.</p>  <p>  This is in addition to the four-year &ldquo;Big Lift&rdquo; programme that Irish Rail is undertaking to upgrade lifts at 52 stations across the network. On the Luas network,  a system-wide upgrade of lifts is planned, with a scoping exercise currently being undertaken. These projects are particularly important as lifts out of service significantly impacts people with disabilities.</p>  <p>  Of course, in addition, to make the &ldquo;hard&rdquo; infrastructure and services accessible, it is crucial to provide the &ldquo;softer&rdquo; type of support to enable Persons with Disabilities to travel independently on public transport, including traversing through bus and train stations.</p>  <p>  The NTA and the transport companies have several initiatives underway which aligns with the UNCRPD, including the provision of Disability Awareness Training to frontline staff, the rollout of the Just a Minute (JAM) Card to assist anyone with a communications difficulty, and ensuring that information is provided in accessible formats for public transport services at stations and platforms.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Travel Assistance Scheme, managed by Dublin Bus, aims to give people with disabilities the confidence they need to use public transport and has been successfully operating for 13 years in the Greater Dublin Area. To further this, the NTA plans to roll out the Travel Assist Scheme to Cork later this year.</p>  <p>  I am fully committed to the continual improvement of accessibility within the public transport system. </p></reply>

In August 2019, my predecessor, Minister Ross, made a submission to the European Commissioner for Transport, Violeta Bulc, regarding the review.  A copy of that submission, and Commissioner Bulc&rsquo;s reply, is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:</p><p><i>www.gov.ie/en/publication/3c921e-submission-to-commissioner-bulc-for-a-revision-of-the-core-ten-t-net/</i>.</p><p>Regarding the rail network, my Department informed the Commission that our position on the TEN-T rail network will be informed by the results of the ongoing all-island Strategic Rail Review and that we would hope to have the outcome of the Review reflected in the maps. The Strategic Rail Review is being undertaken in co-operation with the Department for Infrastructure Northern Ireland and will inform the development of the railway sector on the Island of Ireland over the coming decades.  The Review will consider the potential scope for improved rail services along the various existing, or future potential, corridors of the network.  That scope includes the Western Rail Corridor and connectivity with Northern Ireland.</p><p>For the Deputy&rsquo;s information, the Commission completed its review of the TEN-T Regulation in May 2021 and the evaluation report is available at the following link:</p><p><i>eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52021SC0117</i>.</p><p>In December 2021, the EU Commission published its proposal for a revised TEN-T Regulation and negotiations on the text have now begun in Brussels. My Department is currently examining the proposal in depth to ensure that Irish concerns can be identified and addressed during the negotiation process.</p><p>The full text of the proposal is available here:</p><p><i>eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=COM:2021:812:FIN</i>.</p></reply>

It should be noted this allocation was more than the entire Active Travel budget for 2019.</p>  <p>  This year has seen another increase in my Department's overall funding for cycling and walking, in line with the Government&rsquo;s prioritisation of Active Travel and Greenways. As well as an increased allocation of &euro;289 million administered through the National Transport Authority (NTA) to Active Travel, I was delighted to also announce funding of &euro;60 million for investment in our Greenways.</p>  <p>  The overall increase in funding across urban and rural Ireland will not only support the construction and improvement of safe and connected walking and cycling infrastructure, but also the deployment of almost 250 dedicated Active Travel staff in local authorities around the country.</p>  <p>  In addition to the increased funding for walking and cycling infrastructure, a number of smaller-scale initiatives are being progressed by my Department to support and promote efforts to increase safe Active Travel. The Department of Transport funds the delivery of CycleRight training through Cycling Ireland, which delivers cycling training to school-children around the country and equips them with the skills to cycle safely.</p>  <p>  In partnership with the Department of Education we also launched the Safe Routes to Schools Programme last year, which aims to accelerate the delivery of safe walking, scooting and cycling infrastructure on key access routes to schools. It has had a great response, with applications received from schools in every county in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The step-change in funding and the introduction of various innovative measures to encourage safe and connected Active Travel is proof of the Government's commitment to this area, and I look forward to the delivery of the numerous projects and programmes around the country, including in rural areas. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, TII (Transport Infrastructure Ireland) are developing a National Cycle Network that will identify routes for development all around the country that will work with the Regional and Local Cycle Networks being developed by the NTA. </p></reply>

It is the National Transport Authority (NTA) that has responsibility for the regulation of fares charged to passengers in respect of public transport services, provided under public service obligation (PSO) contracts.</p>  <p>  The Government is strongly committed to helping combat the rising cost-of-living being experienced throughout the country. In this context, a suite of new measures is being introduced by Government to help with this issue, including a 20% average fare reduction on PSO services until the end of 2022. These discounted fares will benefit the hundreds of thousands of people across the country who use public transport every day. A further &euro;54m in Exchequer funding has been secured to allow for the introduction of these discounted fares, this is in addition to the REV22 allocations. The NTA will work with the PSO public transport operators in the coming weeks to commence rolling out these fare reductions across the public transport network in late April/ early May. </p>  <p>  Also, in recognition of the importance of incentivising young people to use public transport, as part of Budget 2022 I secured &euro;25m of funding to provide for the introduction of a young adult card (YAC) which will allow any person nationwide who is between 19 and 23 years old, to avail of an entitlement for discounted travel costs, and to increase the level of discount over and above the current student discount to an average of discount of 50% across all services, including city, intercity and rural services. It is envisaged that the discount will initially be made available on PSO services, and then broadened to include commercial operators at a later date.  This will not only promote modal shift in the transport sector among this age group but should also contribute towards a reduced reliance on private transport with associated benefit of transport emission savings.  The NTA has commenced work in relation to the implementation of the new fares&rsquo; structures for young adults, and this includes the application process and establishing a definitive timeline for the introduction of the Scheme. </p>  <p>  In light of the NTA's responsibility in this area, I have forwarded the Deputies  questions  to the NTA for direct reply.  Please advise my private office if you do not receive a response within ten working days.</p></reply>

This infrastructure was in place at the end of the Transition Period and has been operational since 1 January 2021. This was one of the most critical and visible aspects of the Government&rsquo;s preparations for Brexit. This work was coordinated by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform with the development of the required infrastructure by the Office of Public Works on behalf of the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and the HSE.</p>  <p>  Planning is continuing for a new state of the art Border Control Post in Rosslare Europort for the carrying out of customs, agriculture and health checks on trade with Great Britain. Currently these checks are undertaken in temporary facilities in Kilrane, some 1.3km outside of the Port. Planning permission for the permanent facilities was secured by the OPW in 2021 and a public procurement process is underway. The project will avail of funding under the Brexit Adjustment Reserve. </p>  <p>  Overall, Ireland has seen a significant number of new shipping services develop over the last two years in response to Brexit.  Our ports continue to respond with new and additional direct ferry links to mainland Europe with increased capacity coming on stream in response to Brexit and the pandemic (including to Cherbourg, Dunkerque, Zeebrugge, Rotterdam, Amsterdam, Antwerp, Roscoff and Santander). </p>  <p>  In line with NDP objectives and National Ports Policy, the State ports are continuing to progress projects under their Masterplans. The Ports of Dublin, Cork, Shannon Foynes and Rosslare will spend &euro;144m in capital expenditure in 2022 and up to &euro;473m over the next five years. These non-exchequer funded investments will enhance Ireland&rsquo;s capacity and connectivity and will allow the ports to respond to market needs, handle increases in ship sizes and frequency and serve the import and export needs of the economy.</p>  <p>  In Ireland, the State Ports operate as independent commercial entities with no funding from the State. All infrastructure development must be funded through their own revenues, borrowing or disposal of assets. Additionally eligible TEN-T ports can apply for funding for port infrastructure under the Connecting Europe Funding facility (CEF) which is the funding instrument for the EU's Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T). </p></reply>

Micromobility vehicles like e-scooters have an important role to play as we transition to a cleaner and greener economy and society.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government has committed us to legislating for e-scooters and e-bikes and this process has been commenced through the Road Traffic and Roads Bill, which is shortly expected to move to committee stage before the Oireachtas. </p>  <p>  The bill proposes the establishment of a new vehicle category called &ldquo;powered personal transporters&rdquo;, which will include micromobility vehicles like e-scooters, segways and hoverboards. Registration, taxation, and licensing will not be required for their use.</p>  <p>  The bill will also confer powers to set out appropriate technical and safety standards and rules for the safe use of e-scooters in regulations and preparatory drafting work has already commenced. My Department has consulted with key stakeholders to inform this process, including the Road Safety Authority, the National Transport Authority, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, representation from industry and accessibility advocates and local authorities.</p>  <p>  The Road Traffic Acts do not provide for powers to establish public or private vehicle rental schemes and accordingly such matters are not addressed in the bill. The governance of such schemes would be a matter for the local authority in question.</p>  <p>  I will shortly publish a new Sustainable Mobility Policy which will set out a strategic framework to 2030 for active travel and public transport to support Ireland's overall requirement to achieve a 51% reduction in carbon emissions by the end of this decade.  The policy will primarily focus on measures to promote and facilitate active travel and public transport for all and, in doing so, encourage less private car usage nationally to support our climate commitment.   This will include considering how best to promote the adoption of micromobility schemes and the integration of newer modes such as e-scooters with other modes.</p></reply>

Accordingly, electric vehicles (EVs) are a prominent mitigation measure in the Climate Action Plan and Ireland has set an ambitious target of nearly one million EVs on our roads by 2030. With approximately 50,500 EVs currently in Ireland, this target is very challenging but indicative of the scale of the transformation that is needed across all sectors if Ireland is to reduce national emissions and reach its legally binding emission ceiling in future years.</p><p>A national ambition has been firmly established that by 2030 all new cars and vans sold in Ireland will be zero-emission capable. </p><p>The European Commission have indicated that a complete ban of the marketing, import or registration of new ICE vehicles in a single Member State is not compatible with EU law, and an EU-wide approach is therefore required. Ireland was signatory to a non-paper to the Commission earlier this year requesting a phase-out date for the sale of new petrol and diesel cars and vans in the EU in line with the objective of climate neutrality by 2050 as well as the introduction of a legal framework that allows Member States to move ahead by taking action at national level to incentivise early phase-out of new petrol and diesel cars and vans. The paper can be viewed at <i>www.permanentrepresentations.nl/permanent-representations/pr-eu-brussels/documents/publications/2021/03/10/non-paper---transition-to-zero-emission-light-duty-vehicles</i>.</p><p>In addition, on Transport Day at COP26,  I signed a sponsored declaration to accelerate the transition to 100% zero emission cars and vans. The declaration is an important signal of ambition at a global level. In line with our Programme for Government commitments, Ireland has even greater ambitions, targeting a switch over of one million electric vehicles by 2030 to bring us on a trajectory to achieving electrification of all new car sales well ahead of 2035 </p><p>These declarations are consistent with Ireland&rsquo;s ambitions to tackle transport emissions. They follow the publication of the Climate Action Plan (CAP) &rsquo;21 which outlines a pathway to a radical and equitable transformation in Ireland&rsquo;s transport sector over the next nine years as it moves towards decarbonisation. Car manufacturers are responding to these initiatives by introducing a wide range of electric vehicles to the market, and over the coming decade, I envisage a progressive transition to EVs in our car fleet as electric vehicle technology becomes mainstream. </p><p>In this regard, my Department recently joined together with three other member states (BE, DK and LU) to propose joint amendments of the CO2 standards for cars and vans standards regulation regarding the 2027 targets, the ZLEV incentive mechanism and the small volume derogation. </p></reply>

It will put in place stronger CO<b><sub>2</sub></b>emissions standards for cars and vans to accelerate the transition to zero-emission mobility by requiring manufacturers, on a fleet-wide basis, to reduce the average emissions of cars and vans they produce. </p><p>Under the proposal, average emissions of new cars should be reduced by 55% from 2030 and 100% from 2035 compared to 2021 levels. For new vans, the net reduction targets would be 50% and 100% respectively. As a result, all new cars and vans registered as of 2035 in the EU will be zero-emission.</p><p>The proposal would also remove the ZLEV (zero- and light-emission vehicle) incentive scheme after 2030. This is part of the existing Regulation and allows manufacturers that produce more ZLEVs additional leeway in their overall target. It is expected that, at this stage, the market uptake of ZLEVs will be driven by the stricter CO2 targets applicable from 2030 rather than any incentive mechanisms. </p><p>Accelerating the transition to low emitting light duty vehicles (LDVs) is paramount to achieving Ireland's emission reduction targets. Emissions from cars and vans in Ireland dominate land transport emissions at 51% and 7% respectively, and Ireland has a national commitment to phase out sales of new petrol/diesel cars by 2030. Wider availability of zero-emission vehicles will provide Irish consumers with greater choice and accelerate the transition to zero-emission mobility.</p><p>While the proposed targets are welcome, Ireland is seeking opportunities to accelerate and increase the ambition of the file in recognition that early momentum in this decade is crucial to affect the substantial change required to reach the EU 2030 greenhouse gas emission reduction target and commitments made under the Paris Agreement.</p><p>Analysis for the uptake of EVs in Ireland is based on the assumption that Irish car fleet growth between 2020 and 2030 will be at a rate similar to between 2010 and 2020. It is expected that the sale of electric vehicles will displace those of internal combustion engines in the coming years which will replace CO2 emitting vehicles with zero-emission tailpipe equivalents. While EV battery production can result in higher CO2 emissions, as technology improves and more renewable energy sources are deployed globally, I anticipate that the CO2 impacts of battery production will reduce over the coming years.  I also note that Ireland does not have a vehicle-manufacturing sector, so the issue of production does not arise specifically with regard to our national emissions.  </p></reply>

My Department is very supportive of hydrogen as a transport fuel with a potential role in decarbonising hard to abate sectors such as freight, public transport and moving forward the role it may play in decarbonising aviation and maritime. </p>  <p>  To date, my Department has been acting as a policy advisor for any and all working groups looking at hydrogen development in Ireland such as the Hydrogen Mobility Ireland (HMI). In 2021, three double-deck hydrogen buses were procured, trialled and put into service by the NTA on Bus &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s Rathoath to Dublin route. In continuing to support the hydrogen rollout, the Department established the Alternatively Fuelled Heavy-Duty Vehicle (AFHDV) Purchase Grant Scheme which, while being technology-neutral, will allow applicants to apply for forty to sixty per cent of the cost differential of a new hydrogen FCEV. In Budget 2021, the Department worked with the Department of Finance to introduce hydrogen refuelling equipment into the Accelerated Capital Allowance Scheme which allows applicants to claim 100% of the capital cost of eligible equipment. </p>  <p>  The Renewable Fuels for Transport Policy Statement was published in November 2021. The Policy Statement sets out the pathway for increasing the supply and use of renewable fuels in transport. The Policy Statement also addresses Ireland&rsquo;s obligation under European directives to require increased supply of renewable fuels used in transport, such as hydrogen. As an incentive for producing renewable hydrogen, suppliers will be allowed to claim multiple credits when supplying green hydrogen onto the market. </p>  <p>  The Department has also been working with the Department of the Taoiseach under the Shared Island initiative to progress all-island hydrogen research. On January 31, the Department published a request for tender requesting a desktop study exploring hydrogen safety regulation and how this may be established in Ireland and ensuring the interoperability of refuelling stations on the island. Once finished, this will lead to further work with our colleagues in the Northern Ireland Executive. This in addition to research my Department is co-funding with the SEAI on looking at appropriate fuels for certain contexts in Ireland which will explore where hydrogen is best suited for use.</p>  <p>  Finally, my Department also sits on the Interdepartmental Working Group on Hydrogen which is chaired by officials in the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications and actively contributes to the development of national hydrogen policy. </p></reply>

Other members of Government, including the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste, have also met with taxi driver representatives. On each of these occasions, we have been able to hear first-hand of the issues affecting the taxi industry. </p>  <p>  In relation to supports for the sector, the vast majority of measures taken to support the taxi industry from the start of the pandemic, remain in place. </p>  <p>  As many as 70% of SPSV drivers availed of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment at the height of the pandemic. The PUP was re-opened before the end of last year until 25 March to support people who lost their employment as a result of COVID public health restrictions introduced from 7 December 2021. For some people, PUP will have ended before this date as the payment rates are gradually reduced.     </p>  <p>  In addition to this, in Budget 2022, I secured funding of &euro;6.5 million for a series of specific measures to support the sector, with a view to addressing statutory costs faced by operators which cannot be deferred. Standard licence renewal fees for SPSVs were waived in 2021 and are being waived again in 2022 at an estimated cost of &euro;3 million. The NTA has put in place schemes to refund the Motor Tax paid by SPSV operators in the period 1 September 2021 to 31 August 2022, and to waive NCT fees for the same period. Further details on these schemes are available on the NTA website. Many of the major costs faced by SPSV operators, such as insurance and dispatch operator fees, can be deferred or cancelled during a period of inactivity. </p>  <p>  Recognising that the replacement of a vehicle is the single largest cost faced by any SPSV operator, and in view of my commitment to support the transition of the SPSV fleet towards zero/low-emission vehicles, I announced on February 4th last, the re-opening of the eSPSV Grant Scheme with a further &euro;15 million allocated to it for 2022.  The take-up rate for this Scheme was exceptionally high in 2021: almost 600 drivers successfully applied for grants, with over &euro;11 million paid out as well as &euro;4 million in provisional grant offers. </p>  <p>  As the independent regulator of the sector, the NTA has been in constant contact with taxi operators, drivers and representatives throughout the pandemic via email, text messages and phone calls.  In addition, the Deputy should be aware that the NTA has now started work on a new National Maximum Fare Review and is engaging with its service providers in the matter.  This Review, which is undertaken on a regular basis by the NTA, assesses any changes in the market facing the taxi industry as well as changes in annual taxi operating costs.  These costs include the fixed and running costs of an average taxi and labour costs.  The objective of the Review is to determine whether changes need to be made to the current level of maximum fares and the NTA has confirmed that it is endeavouring to conclude the review process as quickly as possible in 2022, whilst still ensuring that all steps, including a consultation process, are appropriately completed. </p></reply>

As well as an allocation of &euro;289m administered through the National Transport Authority (NTA) to Active Travel I was delighted to announce funding of &euro;60m for investment in our Greenways. This included &euro;60,000 for the feasibility, and pre-appraisal of the Barrow Valley Greenway in Carlow. </p>  <p>In addition to the increased funding for walking and cycling infrastructure, a number of smaller-scale initiatives are being progressed by my Department to support and promote efforts to increase Active Travel. The Department of Transport funds the delivery of Cycle Right training through Cycling Ireland which delivers cycling training to school children around the country. In partnership with the Department of Education we also launched the Safe Routes to School Programme last year which aims to accelerate the delivery of walking, scooting and cycling infrastructure on key access routes to schools. All schools were eligible to apply to the Programme and information was circulated from the Departments of Education and Transport to schools nationwide. By the deadline of 16th April 2021, 931 applications had been received from schools in every county in Ireland. 170 schools were notified on 21st June that they have been selected for inclusion in the first round of the SRTS Programme, including 4 schools in Co. Carlow.</p>  <p>  The step-change in funding committed in Budget 2022 and the introduction of numerous innovative measures to encourage Active Travel is proof of the Government's commitment to this area, and I look forward to the delivery of the numerous projects and programmes around the country. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-03-03a.191.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030300061#WRD03400"><p>The use of e-bikes, including e-cargo bikes, is proving to be an increasingly popular method of travel, whether for commuting or leisure purposes, and is encouraging more people to choose to cycle. </p>  <p>  I welcomed the announcement by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, of increased thresholds under the existing Cycle to Work Scheme as part of the 2020 July Stimulus package, as well as the expansion of the scheme to electric bikes, including e-cargo bikes. The changes to the Scheme are in line with the commitment made in the Programme for Government. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government also committed us to legislating for e-bikes. While e-bikes are already provided for in Irish legislation in the Road Traffic Acts, the Road Traffic and Roads Bill, which is currently before the Oireachtas, proposes to clarify the legal definitions for high-powered and low-powered e-bikes. This will act to encourage the growing cohort of e-cyclists in      Ireland by giving certainty as to the legal status of their vehicle. In line with European legislation, high-powered e-bikes will be considered to be a kind of light moped or &lsquo;L-category&rsquo; vehicle. Accordingly, they will be required to be registered, taxed and insured. Users will require a driver&rsquo;s licence for L-category vehicles and the relevant rules of the road for mopeds and      motorbikes will apply.</p>  <p>  Low-powered pedal-assist e-bikes, capable of achieving speeds up to 25 km/h, will continue to be treated in the same way as pedal bicycles under law and the relevant rules of the road for bicycles will apply accordingly. As is currently the case, this type of e-bike will not require registration, taxation, or a licence.</p>  <p>  No distinction is drawn in the Road Traffic Acts between cycles (bicycles or tricycles) used for the carriage of persons or the carriage of goods and these rules therefore apply equally to e-cargo bikes.</p>  <p>  Providing a sustainable, low-carbon transport system is a key priority of my Department. The Programme for Government commits to 7% average annual emissions reduction to 2030; ultimately, the goal is for a zero-emission mobility system by 2050. Electrification will be key to achieving this objective in the transport sector. </p>  <p>  Electric vehicles (EVs) are the most prominent transport mitigation measure in the Climate Action Plan, and Ireland has set an ambitious target of 945,000 EVs on our roads by 2030. This target is challenging but indicates the scale of the transformation that is needed across all sectors if Ireland is to achieve its climate targets in the coming years. </p>  <p>  Considerable progress has been made, as a result of the work of the Low Emission Vehicle Taskforce, to ensure that conditions and policies are in place to support citizens in making greener vehicle choices. A comprehensive suite of measures is available to EV drivers, including purchase grants for private car owners and taxi drivers, VRT relief, reduced tolls, home charger grants, favourable motor and BIK tax rates, as well as a comprehensive charging network. These measures have collectively contributed to increased take up of EVs in Ireland in recent years, albeit from a low base, to over 50,500 now. </p>  <p>  In addition, my Department convened the Electric Vehicle Policy Pathway (EVPP) Working Group to produce a roadmap to achieving the 2030 EV target. The EVPP Working Group comprises senior officials and has considered regulatory, financial, and taxation policies to help drive a significant ramp-up in passenger EVs and electric van sales.  </p>  <p>  The recommendations of the EVPP Working Group were approved by Government and the full report is available online. </p>  <p>  My Department is acutely aware that the cost of electric vehicles remains an issue for many consumers. To this end, electric vehicle policy is being kept under continuous review to endeavour to make low emission vehicles affordable. </p></reply>

I am not involved in the day-to-day operations of public transport, nor decisions on fares. </p>  <p>  It is the National Transport Authority (NTA) that has the statutory responsibility for the regulation of fares in relation to public passenger transport services and also has statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public transport services by way of public transport services contracts in respect of services that are socially necessary but commercially unviable.  The funding of those services comprises both the fares paid by passengers and the subvention payments from the Exchequer.  The main purpose of the subvention payment is to meet the gap between income from fares and the cost of operating services.</p>  <p>  The provision of public transport services is heavily dependent on passenger fare revenue as it normally contributes about 65% of the operational cost.  The remaining 35% of cost is covered by the PSO grant and the Department of Social Protection grant under the free travel scheme.  </p>  <p>  Prior to COVID-19, &euro;287 million of Exchequer funding was provided for PSO services in Budget 2020; however, since 2020, additional funding has been required to continue to address the significant COVID impacts on public transport provision. All PSO providers are currently in receipt of emergency support funding to compensate for fare revenue loss arising as a result of the impact of Covid-19 on the sector, and the associated fall in passenger numbers (passenger numbers fell to below 10% of 2019 levels at the height of the restrictions in 2020 and 2021). Further, on 25/06/2020 Government approved the introduction of temporary financial supports for the licensed bus sector &ndash; commercial operators (in accordance with EU and national legislation).</p>  <p>  In 2022, I secured &euro;538m to support PSO services including over &euro;200m to address COVID expenses (i.e. loss of fare revenue, cleaning costs). &euro;9m of the &euro;538m allocation has been provided as ongoing support for the licensed bus sector for the first three months of the year. While, over &euro;15m has also been allocated to support Local Link regular service provision in rural Ireland. </p>  <p>  The Government is strongly committed to helping combat the rising cost-of-living being experienced throughout the country. In this context, a suite of new measures is being introduced by Government to help with this issue, including a 20% average fare reduction on PSO services until the end of 2022. These discounted fares will benefit the hundreds of thousands of people across the country who use public transport every day. A further &euro;54m in Exchequer funding has been secured to allow for the introduction of these discounted fares, this is in addition to the REV22 allocations. The NTA will work with the PSO public transport operators in the coming weeks to commence rolling out these fare reductions across the public transport network in late April/ early May.</p>  <p>  Also, in recognition of the importance of incentivising young people to use public transport, as part of Budget 2022 I secured &euro;25m of funding to provide for the introduction of a young adult card (YAC) which will allow any person nationwide who is between 19 and 23 years old, to avail of an entitlement for discounted travel costs, and to increase the level of discount over and above the current student discount to an average of discount of 50% across all services, including city, intercity and rural services. It is envisaged that the discount will initially be made available on PSO services, and then broadened to include commercial operators at a later date.  This will not only promote modal shift in the transport sector among this age group but should also contribute towards a reduced reliance on private transport with associated benefit of transport emission savings.  The NTA has commenced work in relation to the implementation of the new fares&rsquo; structures for young adults, and this includes the application process and establishing a definitive timeline for the introduction of the Scheme. </p>  <p>  The PSO programme represents a significant expenditure of taxpayers' money, and funding has increased in recent years to cater for additional services and growing capacity.  Any assessment of a proposed change to public transport fare structures would be a matter for the NTA to consider in the first instance.  </p>  <p>  In light of the Authority's responsibility in this area, I have forwarded the Deputy's specific question in relation to the possible commissioning of  a study into the impacts and benefits of moving to the provision of fare free public transport across the country, specifically its impact on transport greenhouse gas emissions to the NTA for direct reply.  Please advise my private office if you do not receive a response within ten working days.</p></reply>

A national charging infrastucture strategy is due to be published for public consultation early this year which will set out a pathway to stay ahead of demand over the critical period out to 2030.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s policy regarding the increased usage of Electric Vehicles (EVs) is primarily driven by the Climate Action Plan which sets a target of 945,000 EVs by 2030. </p>  <p>  Home charging is considered the primary method of charging for the majority of EVs in Ireland and is a convenient, cost effective and environmentally friendly means of charging, especially when using night rate electricity. It accounts for circa 80% of EV charging sessions and will continue to be the primary method of charging in the future.</p>  <p>  The Government has introduced a requirement that new buildings and those undergoing substantial renovation works will have to include charging points for electric vehicles if they have more than 10 car parking spaces. </p>  <p>  The EV Home Charger Grant Scheme has been in operation since January 2018 to support the installation of home chargers for purchasers of new and second-hand BEVs and PHEVs.  The grant provides generous support towards the full cost of installation of a home charger up to a maximum of &euro;600. As regards existing apartment buildings, work is currently being progressed to expand the EV home charger grant to include shared parking in apartment blocks and similar developments. My Department is working closely with the SEAI and expects a scheme for apartments to open shortly.</p>  <p>  In terms of existing supports for public charging, the Public Charge Point Scheme continues to be available during 2022 to provide local authorities with a grant of up to &euro;5,000 to support the development of on-street public chargers. The primary focus of the scheme is to provide support for the installation of infrastructure which will facilitate owners of electric vehicles, who do not have access to a private parking space, but instead rely on parking their vehicles in public places near their homes to charge their EVs. My Department is reviewing the Scheme at present to ensure that it is as effective as possible in driving the decarbonisation effort and which will support installation of public chargers particularly in areas without own driveway.</p>  <p>  In addition, the national charging infrastucture strategy will consider this issue in particular and develop proposals to address the current disparity between homeowners with and without off street parking.</p></reply>

The strategic rationale for a metro corridor from north to south Dublin has been well established in numerous strategic transport frameworks, including most recently the statutory Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area.</p>  <p>  The Preferred Route for the MetroLink project is that as consulted upon in 2019 and extends from North Dublin to Charlemont as available to view on the project&rsquo;s dedicated website www.metrolink.ie. The Preliminary Business Case for the project, as well as the environmental impact assessment reports and other associated planning documentation, is prepared on the basis of that Preferred Route.</p>  <p>  Subject to Government approval in the coming months, the project will proceed to the statutory planning process with submission of a Railway Order application to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and will then be subject to further public consultation as part of that process.</p>  <p>  It is my strong belief that we urgently need to see progress on delivery of major public transport infrastructure projects, including MetroLink. It is my view that this focus on delivery is one shared by both citizens and political representatives and, while I recognise there will always be different perspectives on the details of major projects such as MetroLink, my aim is to see this project move off the drawing board and into construction. In that regard I think it important to note that substantial changes to the planning and design of the project as evolved since 2018 through extensive public consultation will add significant delay to the delivery of the project</p></reply>

Aer Lingus transatlantic services to Boston are expected to return on 10 March and New York on 11 March 2022. The United Airlines daily Newark seasonal service will recommence on 27 March.</p><p>During the COVID-19 crisis Shannon Group benefited from a suite of measures to support businesses across the economy, including but not limited to, the wage subsidy scheme, grants, a commercial rates waiver, deferred tax liabilities and the COVID Restrictions Support Scheme.  These supports to Shannon Group totalled almost &euro;17 million in 2020 and 2021.  In an effort to protect jobs in the Mid-West, emergency operational funding of &euro;105,000 was also provided to Shannon Group by my Department in 2020 to ensure two Castles, Bunratty and King John&rsquo;s, operated by Shannon Heritage could remain open at that time.</p><p>In addition to these supports, over &euro;22.7 million in aviation sector-specific supports have been allocated to Shannon Airport in 2020 and 2021.  Over &euro;6 million of this funding was in the form of capital grants under the Covid-19 Regional State Airports Programme in 2021.  Funding under this Programme targeted safety &amp;amp; security related operations as well as projects which focused on reducing emissions and building climate resilience at airports. Over &euro;5.5 million in operational support was also provided under this Programme in 2021, funding 100% of eligible operational costs at Shannon Airport last year.</p><p>Additional emergency capital funding of &euro;5.65m has also been provided to Shannon Airport in 2020 and 2021 for a Hold Baggage Screening (HBS) project and an Embankments project.  A further &euro;5.5m was provided to Shannon Airport under the Department's Covid Supplementary Support Scheme to Irish airports. This funding has provided Shannon Airport with flexibility to roll out route incentives/charge rebates, in consultation with airlines, with a view to supporting recovery and growth of connectivity.</p><p>A summary of funding provided to Shannon Group over 2020 and 2021 is outlined as follows: <table>    <tr>       <th>Shannon Group</th>       <th colspan="2">2020</th>       <th colspan="2">2021</th>       <th>TOTAL </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td>Current<br /><br />&euro;m </td>       <td>Capital<br /><br />&euro;m </td>       <td>Current &euro;m </td>       <td>Capital &euro;m </td>       <td>&euro;m </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Horizontal Supports (approx.) </td>       <td>&euro;8.40 </td>       <td></td>       <td>&euro;8.24 </td>       <td></td>       <td>&euro;16.64 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Covid Support to Shannon Heritage</td>       <td>&euro;0.11 </td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td>&euro;0.11 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Emergency Capital Support</td>       <td></td>       <td>&euro;0.30 </td>       <td></td>       <td>&euro;5.35 </td>       <td>&euro;5.65 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Covid-19 Regional State Airports Programme 2021</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td>&euro;5.53 </td>       <td>&euro;6.07 </td>       <td>&euro;11.60 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Covid Supplementary Support Scheme</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td>&euro;5.49 </td>       <td></td>       <td>&euro;5.49 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>TOTAL </td>       <td>&euro;8.51 </td>       <td>&euro;0.30 </td>       <td>&euro;19.26 </td>       <td>&euro;11.42 </td>       <td>&euro;39.49 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>This year, funding of &euro;36 million will be provided under the Regional Airports Programme 2021-2025, supporting regional airports of Shannon, Cork, Ireland West, Donegal and Kerry.  This budget allocation represents a significant increase in funding available under the Programme in 2022, which takes account of the broadening of the Programme to include both Cork and Shannon Airports.  In addition to this, funding of &euro;1.1m will be provided to Shannon Airport in 2022 for the completion of the airports HBS and Embankments projects.</p><p>The National Aviation Policy recognises the important role of Shannon Airport in the economic and social fabric of Mid-West Region.

Works on those roads are funded from the Council's own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.</p>  <p>  Based on an overall budget of &euro;30 million for the 2022/2023 Community Involvement Scheme, local authorities were allocated funding on a pro-rata basis unless an individual authority had sought less than the pro-rata amount. The 2022 funding allocations for Cavan and Monaghan reflect this approach. </p>  <p>  Towards the end of 2021 local authorities were invited to apply for funding under the Former National Roads Grant Programme. While Cavan County Council was allocated funding under this programme in 2021, the Council indicated that it did not have suitable roads which would be eligible for funding under the terms of the programme in 2022.</p>  <p>  As part of the 2020 July Jobs Stimulus Plan, over &euro;30 million was allocated by the Department&rsquo;s Regional and Local Roads Division to eligible local authorities for active travel schemes. A reallocation of some unspent monies (from 2021) has been provided this year to a small number of local authorities to allow for the completion of works.</p>  <p>  Active Travel funding is now being administered by the National Transport Authority and both Cavan and Monaghan County Councils have been allocated funding in 2022 for active travel projects under the NTA investment programme.</p></reply>

A further action plan will then be developed to cover the remaining period of the policy out to 2030.</p>  <p>  The new policy will be underpinned by capital funding under the National Development Plan which provides &euro;35 billion for transport over the next decade.  This will enable significant investment in active travel, bus and rail infrastructure and expand sustainable mobility options in our cities, towns and villages. This will be complemented by expanded public transport services throughout the country as supported by the Public Service Obligation programme.</p>  <p>  The targets of the policy will be aligned with the transport target metrics in the Climate Action Plan 2021 of 500,000 additional daily active travel and public transport journeys and a 10% reduction in kilometres driven by fossil fuelled cars by 2030.  </p></reply>

The estimated cost of the backlog is in excess of &euro;5 billion. For this reason, grant assistance from the Department continues to be focussed on the protection and renewal of the public road network. </p>  <p>  It bears restating that the public regional and road network is over 96,000 kilometres in size and while there has been significant increases in grant funding in recent years, it has not been possible to address the backlog of works across the country even with 90% of available funds being directed to protection and renewal works.  For this reason and in view of the funding being provided under a Local Improvement Scheme by the Department of Rural and Community Development, I consider that I need to continue to concentrate funding on public roads.</p>  <p>  If I were to consider allocating funding for non-public roads this would reduce the funding available for public roads.  In this context one initiative taken since the Department of Rural and Community Development's introduction of a Local Improvement Scheme is the provision by my Department of ring-fenced funding for the Community Involvement Scheme (CIS).  This scheme is designed to provide for the repair of more lightly trafficked public rural roads, which tend to be considered only towards the end of road authorities&rsquo; annual roadworks programmes.  Under this scheme, &euro;29 million approximately was paid to local authorities over the 2 year 2020-2021 period and this year's grants include funding of a further &euro;15.2 million for the CIS.  </p>  <p>  All available grant funding for 2022 has been allocated.</p></reply>

Over 300,000 new homes will be built by the end of 2030, including a projected 90,000 social homes, 36,000 affordable purchase homes and 18,000 cost rental homes.</p>  <p>  Indications of increased construction activity are becoming evident which will help increase the supply and availability of housing.</p>  <p>  There is a strong supply pipeline, with Commencement Notices data showing a total number of 30,724 residential dwellings commenced in 2021. This is a 42% increase when compared to the number of residential dwellings commenced in 2020 (21,686). The 2021 total is almost equal to the combined totals for 2016 and 2017 (30,816).</p>  <p>  New figures shows that in the past twelve months (February 2021 to January 2022), Commencement Notices for 31,201 new homes were received. This is the highest rolling 12-month total since comparable data was first published. The breakdown, by local authority area, is published on the Housing for All campaign page of gov.ie.</p>  <p>  With regard to the number of homes built, there were 20,433 new dwellings completed in 2021. Completions for 2022 and 2023 are projected to exceed the Housing for All targets of 24,600 and 29,000 respectively. The Central Bank forecasts that some 27,000 and 31,000 homes will be completed in 2022 and 2023 respectively.</p>  <p>  Increasing the supply of housing as set out in Housing for All is the top priority for me and the Government and we have made a good start on our path towards this goal.

I aim to bring the required primary legislation to give effect to the enhanced scheme before the Oireachtas as soon as possible with Spring 2022 being the indicative target timeline.</p>  <p>  In the interim, three enhancements to the current scheme have been brought into effect through amending regulations which I signed on the 24 February. These regulations make provision for the inclusion as an allowable cost of essential immediate repair works, up to a value of &euro;5,555, where such works relate to the structural stability of an affected home. The regulations also make provision in specific circumstances for the recoupment of the fees connected with the provision of the engineer&rsquo;s report without the need for a prior stage 1 confirmation of eligibility and for an increase from 75% to 85% in the value of stage payments which can be recouped prior to the final grant payment.</p>  <p>  It is a matter for the relevant local authorities, as scheme administrators, to roll out the benefits of these immediate enhancements to eligible homeowners.

In 2018, my Department published the updated Sustainable Urban Housing Development Guidelines to respond to changing housing need, in light of emerging dynamics in the urban employment market and ongoing demographic trends. The 2018 Guidelines addressed the relatively new build-to-rent sector and sets out a number of key distinct characteristics.  </p>  <p>  Since 2018, build-to-rent developments have formed a relatively small proportion of all planning applications lodged, accounting for less than 20% of the total units approved under the SHD process.  </p>  <p>  The Government supports home ownership and has taken firm action to protect traditional family homes (from bulk purchases), while maintaining investment where it is needed. Housing for All includes the introduction of the &lsquo;owner-occupier&rsquo; guarantee, the Croi Conaithe (Cities) Fund and the Croi Conaithe (Towns) Fund, in addition to affordable purchase, shared equity, Local Authority Home Loan and Help to Buy Schemes. Build-to-rent is not the only solution but is a legitimate form of tenure, with secure long-term professional landlords that will provide a proportion of much needed accommodation for those who wish to rent. Following a review of co-living in 2020, updated Sustainable Urban Development guidelines were published and I have no plans to further amend the guidelines from this perspective.</p></reply>

They are subject to ongoing review in the interests of safety and the well-being of persons in the built environment and to ensure that due regard is taken of changes in construction techniques, technological progress and innovation.</p><p>The Building Regulations (Part M Amendment) Regulations 2010, and the accompanying Technical Guidance Document M &ndash; Access and Use (2010), which came into effect on 1 January 2012, set out the minimum statutory requirements that a building must achieve in respect of access and use. </p><p>The accompanying Technical Guidance Document M &ndash; Access and Use (2010), sets out the minimum statutory requirements that a building must achieve in respect of access. The TGDs are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at: .</p><p>The requirements of Part M aim to ensure that regardless of age, size or disability:</p><p>-  new buildings other than dwellings are accessible and usable;</p><p>-  extensions to existing buildings other than dwellings are, where practicable, accessible and useable;</p><p>-  material alterations to existing buildings other than dwellings increase the accessibility and usability of existing buildings, where practicable;</p><p>-  certain changes of use to existing buildings other than dwellings increase the accessibility and usability of existing buildings where practicable; and</p><p>-  new dwellings are visitable.</p><p>Part M aims to foster an inclusive approach to the design and construction of the built environment. While the Part M requirements may be regarded as a statutory minimum level of provision, the accompanying technical guidance encourages building owners and designers to have regard to the design philosophy of universal design and to consider making additional provisions where practicable and appropriate.</p><p>Since 2011 housing for disabled people has been addressed in a dedicated joint Strategy between the Department and the Department of Health. A new joint National Housing Strategy for Disabled People (NHSDP) 2022-2027  was launched on 14 January 2022. (See Press release available at .</p><p>The new Strategy sets out the vision for the cooperation and collaboration of Government Departments, state agencies and others in delivering housing and the related supports for disabled people over the next five years. This new Strategy will operate within the framework of Housing for All &ndash; A New Housing Plan for Ireland which is committed to ensuring that affordable, quality housing with an appropriate mix of housing design types provided within social housing, including universally designed units, is available to everyone in Irish society, including those with disabilities and older people. Preparation of an Implementation Plan for the Strategy will begin in the first quarter of 2022 with a target for completion by the second quarter.</p><p>Separately, Action 97 of the National Disability Inclusion Strategy 2017-2021 states &ndash; &ldquo;We will prepare policy advice on ways of achieving universal design solutions for new housing so that new homes can be accessed and used by all persons, irrespective of size, age, ability or disability. We will advise on any implications of same for stakeholders including designers, builders, homeowners and tenants.&rdquo; I understand that the National Disability Authority (NDA), which falls under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration, and Youth, is working on this policy advice. The NDA are an independent statutory body that provides information and advice to the Government on policy and practice relevant to the lives of persons with disabilities.</p><p>The NDA also provides comprehensive guidance on how to design, build and manage buildings and spaces so that they can be readily accessed and used by everyone, regardless of age, size, ability or disability. 'Building for Everyone, A Universal Design Approach', a NDA publication, may be accessed at <i>www.nda.ie</i>.</p><p>The &lsquo;Programme for Government Our Shared Future&rsquo; commits to ensuring that there is an appropriate mix of housing design types provided, including universally designed units, and accommodation for older people and people with disabilities. </p><p>The joint policy statement Housing Options for Our Ageing Population, launched by my Department and the Department of Health in 2019, includes an Action on universal design to &ldquo;In partnership with industry, introduce measures to ensure that over a five year period delivery is increased to ensure that 30% of all new dwellings are built to incorporate universal design principles to accommodate our ageing population.&rdquo;  Appropriate analysis to identify delivery approaches to address this commitment is currently being undertaken by the NDA.</p></reply>

As such, they are not covered by the statutory framework for employees in relation to maternity leave. </p>  <p>  I recognise that this is an obstacle to the participation of women in local government, which I am determined to address urgently and comprehensively.  The role of the councillor must be one that is accessible, manageable and sustainable for all, thus helping to ensure that councillors are more fully representative of the constituents they serve. </p>  <p>  As matters currently stand, it is only under the provisions of Section 18 of the Local Government Act 2001 that councillors may be absent from the role for maternity purposes. Under Section 18, a councillor shall be deemed to have automatically resigned from membership of a local authority if he or she is absent from meetings for a continuous period of 6 consecutive months. Where the absence is due to illness or &ldquo;in good faith for another reason&rdquo;, then the period of absence may be extended first to 12 months and then to up to 18 months by resolution of the Council. </p>  <p>  It should be acknowledged that a councillor who is absent for 6 months for maternity related reasons will continue to receive the full amount of her Representational Payment. Thereafter this payment is reduced by 50% for absences of 6 to 12 months duration. A councillor who is absent for more than 12 months will not receive any further payments regardless of the reason for the absence. </p>  <p>  With effect from January 2017, the Social Welfare Acts were amended so that councillors gained access to the same benefits as self-employed contributors. Accordingly, councillors are now reckonable for the purposes of accessing Class S benefits, including Maternity Benefit. </p>  <p>  On 29 March 2021, I hosted the first meeting of a working group of women councillors established to examine all maternity-related matters, including wider supports other than maternity leave. This group, which is a representative and cross political party group of women councillors, met a number of times in 2021. Their extensive deliberations have given my officials and I greater understanding of the needs of women councillors and have been important in the development of a policy approach.  </p>  <p>  My Department has since engaged extensively with the Office of the Attorney General on legal questions arising. My officials are also engaging very constructively with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth with a view to bringing councillors under the maternity protection legislative framework.   </p>  <p>  Following this work, it is my intention to bring forward a package of maternity-related supports and measures for councillors, including progressive proposals for legislative change, which is currently being finalised by my Department. </p></reply>

These measures will deliver on the Programme for Government commitment to put affordability at the heart of the housing system and prioritise the increased supply of affordable homes through (1) delivering affordable homes on local authority lands, (2) the introduction of a new form of tenure in Cost Rental, (3) a First Home shared equity scheme and (4) expanding Part V planning requirements to increase the 10% contribution requirement to 20% and to apply it to cost rental as well as social and affordable housing.</p><p>At a national level, 2,550 Affordable Purchase homes and 1,580 Cost Rental homes are targeted for delivery for 2022. Annual targets will increase incrementally in subsequent years. These homes will be delivered by the local authorities, Approved Housing Bodies and the Land Development Agency.</p><p>Delivery of affordable housing will be underpinned by local authorities' Housing Delivery Action Plans. Each local authority submitted a Plan to me in December 2021, and my Department has been engaging with local authorities on the Plans.  The Housing Delivery Action Plans will be published in Quarter 2 and will set out details of affordable delivery in each local authority. </p><p>The first Affordable Purchase homes delivered through the Local Authority Affordable Purchase Scheme will be made available in Boherboy, Cork City later this month. Cork City Council indicated the prices to be &euro;218,000 and &euro;243,000 for a 3-bedroom dwelling. Two separate Cost Rental schemes, managed by Cl&uacute;id and Respond, will be provided in Cork City and will be available in the second half of this year.</p><p>The First Home shared equity scheme will be available nationally on a demand-led basis. This scheme will primarily support first-time buyers purchasing new homes through the private market. I expect that a significant proportion of First Home supported home purchases will be located in Cork, in proportion to the market for newly constructed homes.</p></reply>

Part 2 of the 2020 Act provided for the operation of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 during the Covid-19 emergency period up to 1 August 2020, to better protect tenants by prohibiting rent increases in all cases, and tenancy terminations in all but limited and exceptional cases having regard to:</p>  <p>- the threat to public health presented by Covid-19,</p>  <p>- the highly contagious nature of that disease, and</p>  <p>- the need to restrict the movement of persons in order to prevent the spread of the disease among the population.</p>  <p>  From 1 August 2020, the blanket ban on rent increases inside or outside of a Rent Pressure Zone (RPZ) was lifted for all, apart from the most vulnerable tenants, with regard to the prevailing threat to public health at that time. The Residential Tenancies Act 2020 was enacted and came into operation on 24 October 2020. This Act provides for a moratorium on evictions taking place in the event of peoples&rsquo; movements being restricted on public health grounds to within 5km of their home under Section 31A Health Regulations made by the Minister for Health. These tenancy protections also apply during the 10 days directly following the period specified by the Minister for Health in the aforementioned Regulations.</p>  <p>  The Residential Tenancies and Valuation Act 2020 (RTVA) and subsequently, the Planning and Development, and Residential Tenancies, Act 2020 (PDRTA) provided that rent increases were not permitted to take effect during, or in respect of any part of, the period from 1 August 2020 until 12 July 2021, for tenants with rent arrears due to Covid-19 and at risk of losing their tenancy who make the necessary declaration. The Residential Tenancies (No. 2) Act 2021, which was signed into law on 9 July 2021, provided for an extension of the enhanced protections under the PDRTA until 12 January 2022.</p>  <p>  During the 18 months from August 2020 to January 2022, 579 tenants out of almost 300,000 tenancies, sent a self-declaration to the RTB indicating they were unable to pay their rent as a result of the impact of Covid-19. </p>  <p>  The RTVA also provides that permanent protections apply, through new procedures requiring landlords to serve both the RTB and the tenant with both the 28-day warning notice seeking payment of rent arrears and also any related notice of termination. Upon receipt of the warning notice, the RTB acknowledges receipt to the landlord and the tenant and provides information to the tenant to enable him or her to get advice from the Money and Budgeting Advice Service (MABS) and offers assistance to the tenant in obtaining this advice. Any notice of termination grounded on rent arrears must be copied to the RTB and will be invalid if it is not so copied. A notice of termination grounded on rent arrears can only be served by a landlord on the condition that a written rent arrears warning was given to both the tenant and the RTB and that the arrears were not paid within 28 days following receipt of the warning by the tenant or by the RTB, whichever occurs later. The aim is to ensure that early action is taken to address rent arrears, to the benefit of both the tenant and the landlord.</p>  <p>  My Department's role in relation to homelessness involves the provision of a national framework of policy, legislation and funding to underpin the role of housing authorities in addressing homelessness at a local level.  Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of homeless services rests with individual housing authorities.</p>  <p>  While responsibility for the provision of accommodation for homeless persons rests with individual housing authorities, the administration of homeless services is organised on a regional basis, with nine administrative regions in place.  A homelessness consultative forum has been established in each region in accordance with Chapter 6 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2009.  It is a matter for the management group of the consultative forum, in the first instance, to determine the services and the funding required to address homelessness in each region.</p>  <p>  My Department has issued guidance to local authorities on the preparation of Homelessness Action Plans, with particular focus on the incorporation of Housing for All actions into these plans. This guidance advised that the Plans should contain measures to address relevant actions in Housing for All, particularly those that have been identified as to be led by local authorities. Additionally, all measures to be included in these Plans must be accompanied by details on how they will be progressed and monitored.</p></reply>

Responsibility for enforcement of the Regulations rests with the relevant local authority. </p>  <p>  The HAP scheme is underpinned by the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014. Under section 41 of the 2014 Act, local authorities are required to commence the inspection process within 8 months of HAP support being provided in relation to a particular dwelling, if the dwelling was not already inspected within the previous 12 months. Local authorities carry out HAP inspections as part of their overall private rented inspections programme.</p>  <p>  Given the need for inspectors to enter tenants&rsquo; homes, Covid-19 pandemic restrictions did impact on the inspection of all rented dwellings. The City and County Management Association&rsquo;s (CCMA) Local Authority Services Frameworks for Future Covid-19 Pandemic Response did not permit on-site rental inspections from January 2021 until mid-July 2021. This was in order to protect tenants, landlords and inspectors. A revised Framework which issued on 13 July 2021 permitted the resumption of on-site rental inspections from 14 July 2021.</p>  <p>  It is anticipated that &euro;9 million could be spent on rental inspections in 2022. This compares to just under &euro;2.8 million last year.</p></reply>

My Department supports fire authorities through setting general policy, providing the legislative framework, running a central training programme and issuing guidance on operational and other related matters and providing capital funding for priority infrastructural projects. Fire services issues are managed in my Department by the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management (NDFEM).</p>  <p>  Fire services are provided in Ireland by local authorities in accordance with the provisions of the Fire Services Acts, 1981 and 2003. Under this legislation, there are 31 fire authorities which provide fire prevention and fire protection services for communities through 27 service delivery structures. Local authority fire services are delivered by approximately 3,300 local authority staff engaged at 217 fire stations nationwide. 16 of these stations being staffed by full-time firefighters, a further 4 are mixed full-time and retained, and 197 are staffed by retained firefighters, with approximately 2,065 retained firefighters around the country. It is important to note that the numbers of fire service front-line staff have been maintained at a constant high level throughout the economic challenges of the past number of years, even when staffing numbers, by necessity, were reduced in other areas of the local authority sector. </p>  <p>  In 2013, my Department published 'Keeping Communities Safe (KCS) - A Framework for Fire Safety in Ireland'. The adoption of KCS as national policy saw national norms/ standards being established for fire services in Ireland for the first time, against which local authority fire services could benchmark themselves.  The report of the Fire Service Validation Group, ' Fire Services in Ireland, Local Delivery - National Consistency', published in 2016, noted the staffing arrangements in place in fire services across Ireland to achieve these standards and that fire services manage staffing levels in fire stations to achieve the national standards of fire service response.</p>  <p>  The provision of fire services by local authorities is based on a risk management approach which involves an analysis of the nature of the fire hazards and the incidence and extent of fires which occur, as well as the fire protection measures in place. There has been a welcome downward trend in the incidence of fire, with the fire fatality rate per million of population, using a three-year average, currently at 4.3 deaths per million of population. While each death is one too many, this figure is a third of what it was twenty years ago when it stood at 12.9 deaths per million of population and positions Ireland among countries with very low fire fatality rates.</p>  <p>  In May 2021, the Management Board of the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management mandated a small internal project team to undertake a review of the model of local authority &lsquo;retained&rsquo; fire services delivery. This review will have a particular emphasis on the recruitment and retention of staff, with the proviso that due consideration also be given to input from the County and City Management Association (CCMA).</p>  <p>  The objective of the review is to explore and understand the issues that are impacting on service delivery, to undertake research and analysis and to propose options which will underpin the continuing provision of effective and inclusive local authority fire services into the future. The Project Team will work with and report to the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management Fire Service Operations Committee in the performance of its functions.</p>  <p>  The initial engagement element of the review is the gathering of appropriate data and information, to inform the needs analysis and option appraisals for further development. To that end, the project team undertook a procurement process and engaged the services of an independent consultant to survey the views of the personnel who work in the retained fire services and those that have recently retired from the retained fire services. In preparing the survey, the project team sought the views of retained services trade union representatives through the Fire Services National Oversight and Implementation Group.</p>  <p>  That feedback in conjunction with consultation at appropriate stages with all key stakeholders during the review process, including central and local government, fire service management/staff, and the staffing interest groups will form the basis of the final review report. It is the expectation of the project team that the final review report will be submitted to the Management Board of the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management later in 2022. At that time, the Management Board of the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management will make a determination on the publication of the report.</p></reply>

The strategy sets out, over four pathways, a broad suite of measures to achieve its policy objectives together with a financial commitment of in excess of &euro;4 billion per annum.</p>  <p>  The suite of measures and relevant targets under the pathway to addressing vacancy and efficient use of existing stock includes:</p>  <p>  - A new local authority-led programme to help Local Authorities buy or compulsory purchase 2,500 vacant homes in their areas which can then be sold on the open market will ensure homes don&rsquo;t lie vacant.</p>  <p>  - The Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe (Towns) Initiative will be delivered by local authorities for the provision of some 2,000 serviced sites for homes by 2025, to attract people to build their own homes and to support the refurbishment of vacant properties, enabling people to live in small towns and villages, in a sustainable way.</p>  <p>  - A new Town Centre First policy which I launched on 4 February 2022 providing a major new policy that aims to tackle vacancy, combat dereliction and breathe new life into our town centres.</p>  <p>  The Planning and Development Act (Exempted Development) Regulations 2022 were recently made which extends to 31 December 2025 the exemption given by earlier Regulations that provided for an exemption from the requirement to obtain planning permission in respect of the change of use of certain vacant commercial premises, including vacant areas above ground floor premises, to residential use. The regulations are primarily aimed at facilitating the productive re-use of qualifying vacant commercial buildings as homes, while also facilitating urban renewal and the bringing on stream of increased housing supply. In addition, the scope of the exemption was also extended to include an extra class of use, that of &lsquo;public houses&rsquo;.</p>  <p>  All of the initiatives under Housing for All to address vacancy will not only support housing supply but will have a profoundly positive impact from a social and sustainability perspective; utilising existing space, reimaging and regenerating vacant properties and ultimately providing communities with a greater vibrancy.</p></reply>

Ultimately the aim is to secure pathways out of emergency accommodation as quickly as possible, while also ensuring that those experiencing homelessness are provided with appropraite and high quality services.  </p><p>The National Quality Standards Framework (NQSF) for homeless services is in place nationally for local authority and NGO delivered services, and is designed to ensure a consistent approach in how local authorities and service providers respond to the needs of those experiencing homelessness and to improve the quality of services provided. </p><p>In Dublin the oversight of these standards is a matter for the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive (DRHE).  As a number of facilities are operated privately in the Dublin Region, the DRHE have adapted the NQSF standards in order to apply their provisions to private emergency accommodation and presented these standards to the Dublin Region strategic management group and consultative forum in September 2021.These standards are to be applied to private emergency accommodation, with the owner / operator responsible for the physical standards and the visiting support teams responsible for the support and case management standards.  The DRHE appointed a Development Officer in January 2022, to roll out these standards in private emergency accommodation and to co-ordinate training with the HSE for staff working in these settings.  The Development Officer will also co-ordinate quarterly key performance indicator (KPI) returns from the beginning of 2022.</p><p>Monitoring and inspection of services is an important element of the NQSF Framework. The Framework seeks to ensure levels of quality in the provision of temporary accommodation and related services for homeless persons. The standards give service providers a framework for continuous quality improvement in their services.  Local authorities undertake monitoring and review activities to assure that services are operating effectively.  It is matter for the local authorities to ensure compliance with the standards, including through the contractual arrangements and service level agreements in place with service providers.</p><p>The Standards and Facilities Team in the DRHE oversee all emergency accommodation and seek to ensure that all relevant guidelines, policies and procedures are complied with in order to deliver a safe and comfortable place to stay for service users. The DRHE also has a regime in place to deal with complaints and to ensure accommodation is appropriate and safe. This includes engaging with homeless families and individuals on issues arising in their accommodation.  The DRHE have also recently tendered for an inspection service for physical standards in both NGO and privately operated services.  </p><p>It is important to recognise the multitude of agencies that deliver services to those in emergency accommodation including the HSE, Tusla and NGO service delivery partners.  In order to ensure a renewed emphasis is brought to collaborating across Government in delivery of services I have established a National Homeless Action Committee.  As this Committee brings together key Government Departments, agencies and stakeholders involved in providing, overseeing and monitoring services delivered to those experiencing homelessness I intend to bring this matter for discussion at the next meeting of the Committee in April.  This Committee is best placed to consider the most appropriate way forward in ensuring quality services are delivered to all those in emergency accommodation.  </p></reply>

These measures will deliver on the Programme for Government commitment to put affordability at the heart of the housing system and prioritise the increased supply of affordable homes through (1) delivering affordable homes on local authority lands, (2) the introduction of a new form of tenure in Cost Rental, (3) a First Home shared equity scheme and (4) expanding Part V planning requirements to increase the 10% contribution requirement to 20% and to apply it to cost rental as well as social and affordable housing.</p>  <p>  The Local Authority Affordable Purchase Scheme will support eligible purchasers of Local Authority-delivered new homes by bridging the gap between the market value of the home and the combined value of the buyer's mortgage and deposit. Regulations setting out the detailed eligibility criteria for the scheme are at an advanced stage and will be issued in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>   The First Home shared equity scheme, under Part 4 of the Affordable Housing Act, will support eligible buyers purchasing newly constructed homes on the private market. This scheme will be available at a national level and will incorporate regional price caps reflecting median house price sales. Confirmation of the final details of this scheme is ongoing in conjunction with the relevant stakeholders and it is anticipated that the First Home scheme will be available for applications in the second half of this year. This initiative is being designed to ensure support is provided to those that, because of the current income levels, cannot secure a sufficient mortgage to meet the cost of a modest newly constructed home in their preferred location.</p>  <p>  To further support affordability constrained households to purchase a home, the Local Authority Home Loan scheme commenced on 4 January 2022. The Local Authority Home Loan Scheme incorporates a lower interest rate, higher income eligibility thresholds for single applicants in Cork, Dublin, Galway, Kildare, Louth, Meath and Wicklow (increasing from &euro;50,000 to &euro;65,000), and more flexibility on house size. The loan can be used for new and second-hand properties, or for self-builds with a maximum value of 90% of market value of a residential property. The maximum market values are &euro;320,000 in the counties Cork, Dublin, Galway, Kildare, Louth, Meath and Wicklow, and &euro;250,000 in the rest of the country. </p>  <p>  While most affordable purchase measures are primarily targeted at first-time buyers, the Housing for All strategy explicitly provides for the Fresh Start principle. The Fresh Start principle extends the supports available under both affordable purchase schemes and the Local Authority Home Loan scheme to applicants who are divorced, legally separated, or where the relationship has ended and where they retain no beneficial interest in a home. The Fresh Start principle will also apply to those who have previously purchased a residential property but have been divested of this through personal insolvency or bankruptcy arrangement, proceedings or other legal process.  </p></reply>

Greater supply will be key to meeting demand, helping moderate property price increases, and addressing affordability pressures facing renters, homeowners and potential buyers in the coming years.</p><p>Housing for All includes unprecedented direct investment in social and affordable housing, reforms to ensure availability of land, removal of obstacles to and supporting viability of development, and ensuring there is sufficient investment and capacity to support construction. The plan also commits to reducing the cost of construction. </p><p>Recent analysis by the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland indicates that construction build costs account for c.47% of total apartment development costs. These have risen considerably over recent years through a combination of the increased cost of regulatory compliance and general increases in labour and materials costs.

Improved productivity in construction will help address this imbalance.</p><p>Housing For All commits the State to a more central role in leading and funding structures to ensure levels of productivity and innovation materialise.

Heritage Ireland 2030 recognises the fundamental importance of our heritage in all its forms &ndash; natural, built, cultural, linguistic, tangible and intangible &ndash; and provides an overarching strategic framework for the management and protection of our heritage for the next ten years, including over 150 actions aimed at achieving this. Of these, several actions relate to natural heritage and biodiversity, including: a commitment to support the full implementation of the National Biodiversity Action Plan 2017-2021 and subsequent plans; to support and resource the National Biodiversity Data Centre; to support more all-island approaches to biodiversity protection; and, to establish a Citizen&rsquo;s Assembly on Biodiversity. The plan and full list of actions can be found on my Department&rsquo;s website at:</p><p><i>www.gov.ie/en/publication/778b8-heritage-ireland-2030</i>/.  </p><p>Over the coming months, officials in my Department will engage closely with key partners across government and in the Heritage Council to develop and publish, by Q3 of 2021, a plan for implementing these actions. Updates on this process will be posted regularly on my Department&rsquo;s website. </p><p>Following a comprehensive review of national, European and international biodiversity policies and other relevant plans and strategies, the first draft of the Ireland&rsquo;s 4<sup>th</sup>National Biodiversity Action Plan (NBAP) 2022-2026 has been developed. The new Plan acknowledges the intrinsic value of biodiversity to our well being and will increase the focus on the root causes of biodiversity loss. The draft Plan has been sent for stakeholder review to bodies and organisations that will be involved in its implementation and a broader public consultation period will follow. </p></reply>

Responsibility for developing and providing services to support victims rests with my colleague the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  Statutory responsibility for the care and protection of victims of DSGBV rests with Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.</p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s role is to support the work of local authorities and NGOs who provide accommodation support to victims of DSGBV.</p>  <p>  I terms of housing services, in 2017, my Department issued policy and procedural guidance to housing authorities relating to the role they can play to assist victims of domestic violence.  The guidance is a reference for service providers, highlighting where they can best assist their clients.  It covers a range of scenarios that may arise for victims of domestic violence currently in receipt of social housing support and those seeking social housing supports. These include provisions around the use of the Housing Assistance Payment scheme, or the Rental Accommodation Scheme, where a victim has a joint interest in the family home, or ownership of alternative accommodation, but would otherwise qualify for social housing support. </p>  <p>  In addition, where a victim of domestic violence applies for social housing support in their own right while still a joint tenant, it is a matter for the relevant local authority to address the issues arising in relation to the joint tenancy agreement. Accordingly, the household may transfer out of their existing tenancy and into a new tenancy agreement with the local authority or they may access an independent tenancy in the private rented sector utilising the various housing supports offered by the State.</p>  <p>  The guidance was introduced to support a partnership approach by statutory agencies to the delivery of domestic violence services. This is particularly the case in relation to helping prevent and reduce the occurrence of related homelessness and facilitating provision long-term accommodation for victims of domestic violence. This guidance continues to apply in providing direction to housing authorities in supporting the housing needs of victims of domestic violence.</p></reply>

These measures will deliver on the Programme for Government commitment to put affordability at the heart of the housing system and prioritise the increased supply of affordable homes through (1) delivering affordable homes on local authority lands, (2) the introduction of a new form of tenure in Cost Rental, (3) a First Home shared equity scheme and (4) expanding Part V planning requirements to increase the 10% contribution requirement to 20% and to apply it to cost rental as well as social and affordable housing.</p>  <p>  This Act, supported by the unprecedented levels of funding committed to in the Housing for All strategy, averaging over &euro;4 billion annually, will underpin the delivery of affordable housing targets. Specifically, 54,000 affordable homes will be delivered between now and 2030 by local authorities, Approved Housing Bodies, the Land Development Agency and through a strategic partnership between the State and retail banks.</p>  <p>  At a national level, 2,550 Affordable Purchase homes and 1,580 Cost Rental homes are targeted for delivery for 2022. Annual targets will increase incrementally in subsequent years. </p>  <p>  The Local Authority Affordable Purchase Scheme will support eligible purchasers of Local Authority-delivered new homes by bridging the gap between the market value of the home and the combined value of the buyer's mortgage and deposit. Regulations setting out the detailed eligibility criteria for the scheme are at an advanced stage and will be issued in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  Separately, as part of the Housing for All strategy, additional funding of &euro;1bn was committed to the Land Development Agency in order for it to deliver on its pipeline of housing. This includes Project Tosaigh under which the LDA will enter into forward purchase arrangements to kick-start stalled private developments and increase the supply of affordable housing. The LDA initiated a call on 12 November 2021 targeting a scale in excess of 150 affordable units per development and is currently assessing the proposals received.</p>  <p>  Over 1,500 Cost Rental homes are expected to be developed and tenanted through three delivery strands in 2022: Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs), supported by Cost Rental Equity Loan (CREL) funding; Local Authorities through the Affordable Housing Fund (AHF), and the Land Development Agency (LDA), either on their portfolio of sites, or through Project Tosaigh. All Cost Rental homes will deliver rent prices at least 25% below market rates. </p>  <p>  The First Home shared equity scheme, under Part 4 of the Affordable Housing Act, will primarily support first-time buyers purchasing newly constructed homes on the private market. This scheme will be available at a national level and will incorporate regional price caps reflecting median house price sales. Confirmation of the final details of this scheme is ongoing in conjunction with the relevant stakeholders and it is anticipated that the First Home scheme will be available for applications in the second half of this year. This initiative is being designed to ensure support is provided to those that, because of the current income levels, cannot secure a sufficient mortgage to meet the cost of a modest newly constructed home in their preferred location.</p>  <p>  Additionally the Help-to-Buy incentive supports first-time buyers in meeting the deposit requirements for newly-built houses or apartments, as well as self-build homes. Subject to the level of income tax and DIRT paid over the previous 4 years, the Help-to-Buy scheme provides a maximum benefit to first-time buyers of &euro;30,000 or 10% of the cost of the newly constructed home. The Help-to-Buy scheme has already helped over 30,000 first-time buyers achieve the deposit required for a new home.  </p>  <p>  Finally, the Local Authority Home Loan scheme commenced on 4 January 2022 and incorporates a lower interest rate, higher income eligibility thresholds for single applicants in Cork, Dublin, Galway, Kildare, Louth, Meath and Wicklow (increasing from &euro;50,000 to &euro;65,000), and more flexibility on house size. The loan can be used for new and second-hand properties, or for self-builds with a maximum value of 90% of market value of a residential property. The maximum market values are &euro;320,000 in the counties Cork, Dublin, Galway, Kildare, Louth, Meath and Wicklow, and &euro;250,000 in the rest of the country. </p>  <p>  The Help-to-Buy scheme, the Local Authority Affordable Purchase Scheme and the First Home scheme are designed to assist first-time buyers in meeting the higher costs of newly constructed homes and, in doing so, will increase the volume of new homes being developed. Importantly the CSO reported that housing completions amounted to 20,433 in 2021, a welcome increase over the 2015 reported levels of 7,219. The CSO also report that Commencement Notices for 30,724 new homes were issued in 2021, representing a 42% increase compared with 2020, or roughly the same as the combined reported totals from 2016 &amp;amp; 2017.</p>  <p>  While these reported figures represent a significant step forward in the Government&rsquo;s ambition to support the supply of new housing, it remains short of the 33,000 new dwellings annual target under Housing for All. This is why the Government has committed unprecedented levels of funding, averaging &euro;4 billion per year to improve affordability for all families or individuals across society wishing to secure a home. </p></reply>

The average cost is calculated based on claims for operational new units submitted by local authorities and recorded on my Department&rsquo;s SHCEP financial management system and does not necessarily represent the amount delivered in that period. </p>  <p>Up to the end of 2021, the average annual cost of a long-term lease for 25 years with South Dublin County Council was &euro;17,679. This reflects the higher cost of units in the Dublin area as lease payments are linked to market rents and discounted appropriately. This data includes local authority direct leasing, enhanced leasing, and AHB private leasing.   </p></reply>

Following the launch of the strategy last September we issued social housing targets to all local authority Chief Executives for the 5 years 2022 to 2026.  Of the national target of over 50,000 new social homes, I&rsquo;m asking Carlow County Council to deliver 464 over those years, through their own projects and also working with the housing associations.</p><p>For the purpose of tracking social housing delivery, a Social Housing Construction Status Report (CSR) is published each quarter by my Department. This provides details of the individual social housing build projects in the programme of each local authority, including Carlow County Council.. It sets out the locations of the social housing schemes, the number of homes being delivered and the current status of the scheme, including those currently on site and under construction. The most recent CSR publication covers the period up to the end of Quarter 3 of 2021, and is available at the following link: <i>www.gov.ie/en/publication/feea9-social-housing-construction-projects-status-report-q3-2021/</i>.  Information on Quarter 4 of 2021, will be available shortly and will be added to the published data. Further specific information on their build programmes will be available from the local authorities.</p><p>I'm keen that all local authorities progress their social housing schemes as quickly as possible. I want to acknowledge that Carlow County Council with the support of their public representatives, has delivered well against their social housing targets to date and also have a good pipeline of new projects in place. Under Housing for All, the funding is in place to support Carlow County Council and indeed all the Councils and the housing associations, to get these housing projects built. </p><p>The Affordable Housing Act 2021 established a basis for four new affordable housing measures, to deliver on the Programme for Government commitment to put affordability at the heart of the housing system and prioritise the increased supply of affordable homes through (1) delivering affordable homes on local authority lands, (2) the introduction of a new form of tenure in Cost Rental, (3) a First Home shared equity scheme and (4) expanding Part V planning requirements to increase the 10% contribution requirement to 20% and to apply it to cost rental, as well as social and affordable housing. The First Home shared equity scheme will be available nationally on a demand-led basis. This scheme will primarily support first-time buyers purchasing new homes through the private market. It is anticipated this scheme will be open for applications in the second half of this year. The national 2022 target delivery for the First Home Scheme is 1,750.</p><p>At a national level, 2,550 Affordable Purchase homes and 1,580 Cost Rental homes are targeted for delivery for 2022. Annual targets will increase incrementally in subsequent years.</p><p>Delivery of affordable housing will be underpinned by Local Authorities' Housing Delivery Action Plans. Having reviewed the submitted Plans, my Department has held meetings with Local Authorities. The information shared in these meetings, and through a two-day Housing Summit held last week with all local authorities, will facilitate more informed target setting for each area. Updated Housing Delivery Action Plans will be published by the local authorities, including Carlow County Council, later this year.</p><p>Additional affordable housing delivery in Carlow will also happen through the expanded 20% Part V requirement.</p></reply>

Dublin City Council submitted the first iteration of its plan in December and my officials have met with the Council.

This funding was introduced originally to tackle long term vacant units and is now increasingly targeted to support authority's to ensure minimal turnaround and re-let times for vacant stock. </p><p>From 2014 to 2021, expenditure of some &euro;261 million was recouped to local authorities under the Voids Programme which funded the return to productive use of 18,527 properties nationwide. Local authorities also provide significant funding from their own resources to address the level of vacancy within the social housing stock.</p><p>There has been extensive funding provided particularly over the last two years under the Voids programme which not only catered for standard relets but also for vacant properties requiring more extensive works prior to relet. It is up to each local authority to submit a programme of works based on their individual allocation or targets.</p><p>In 2020, &euro;56.4m exchequer funding was provided to bring a total of 3,607 vacant homes back into productive use within the social housing stock. This represents the highest ever yearly spend and the highest number of homes to be refurbished under the voids programme. Within this programme local authorities had the opportunity to remediate long term vacant properties (houses vacant over 12 months) the funding for which was uncapped. Again in 2021, the Voids programme catered for a non-standard refurbishment option which allowed local authorities claim an average of &euro;50,000 funding in this category (no vacancy limit). Full details in relation to output up to and including the 2021 programme is available on the link below.</p><p><i>www.gov.ie/en/collection/0906a-other-local-authority-housing-scheme-statistics/#voids-programme</i>.</p><p>My Department will continue to support local authorities in their work in this area in 2022, however, as result of the significant investment by the Department in the Voids Programme, local authorities should also now be in a strong position to begin the transition to a strategic and informed planned maintenance approach to stock management and maintenance. To that end my Department and local authorities are working to transition from a largely response and voids based approach to housing stock management and maintenance to a planned maintenance approach. This will require the completion of stock condition surveys by all local authorities and the subsequent development of strategic and informed work programmes in response. My Department will support these work programmes by ensuring that the funding available under the various stock improvement programmes are aligned with this approach.</p><p>It is also of note that Local authorities will always have a level of vacancy in their housing stock. This will fluctuate over time as tenancy surrender and re-letting of dwellings is an ongoing process. Details in relation to the number of voids are not collated by my Department, however, statistics in relation to social housing stock, at a point in time, are published by the National Oversight and Audit Commission (NOAC) in their Annual Reports on Performance Indicators in Local Authorities. These reports provide a range of information in relation to social housing stock, including levels of vacancy in local authority owned properties. The most recent report, relating to 2020, is available on the NOAC website at the following link:</p><p>  </p></reply>

Rent levels for Cost Rental tenancies are based on the cost of the provision of homes, rather than being subject to the pressures of the open market. Once tenanted, rents will increase only in line with consumer inflation, remaining stable in real terms, while continuing to cover management and maintenance costs for the properties.  Cost Rental homes will be delivered by Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs), the Land Development Agency (LDA) and local authorities.</p>  <p>  A Housing Delivery Action Plan prepared by each Local Authority will underpin delivery of affordable purchase and cost rental homes to 2026.  Each local authority submitted the first iteration of their plans in December and my officials have now met with each authority. I expect that the final Delivery Action Plans will be published in Q2. </p>  <p>  The first 65 Cost Rental homes were tenanted in 2021, with 25 at Taylor Hill in Balbriggan and a further 40 at Barnhall Meadows in Leixlip. The latter were completed in December, with cost-covering rents at least 40% below comparable open-market prices in the area: 2-bed houses with rent of &euro;900 per month and 3-bed houses at &euro;1,250 per month. These homes were provided by AHBs and supported by Cost Rental Equity Loan (CREL) funding. The COVID-19 pandemic, and associated closures and restrictions of construction sites, had significant impacts on the anticipated timelines for the delivery of Cost Rental developments in 2021.</p>  <p>  AHBs are targeting the provision of up to 700 homes through CREL in 2022. In addition, another 50 two-bedroom Cost Rental apartments are in the final stages of completion at Enniskerry Road, Stepaside, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, by the Respond and Tuath AHBs, alongside 105 social housing units. This project is the result of an innovative collaboration between the two AHBs and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council. The 50 Cost Rental apartments are due to be tenanted over the next few weeks. </p>  <p>  Over the period to 2030, Housing for All commits to delivering a total of 18,000 Cost Rental homes, and delivery will incrementally increase to an average of 2,000 Cost Rental homes per year. The delivery of these homes will be supported by funding across three delivery strands: AHBs supported by CREL funding; Local Authorities through the Affordable Housing Fund and the LDA, either on their portfolio of sites, or through Project Tosaigh. </p></reply>

A detailed Social Housing Construction Status Report (CSR) is published each quarter by my Department. The CSR shows that there were 11 schemes of 88 homes on site in Mayo at the end of Quarter 3 2021 with a further 15 schemes of 225 homes at various stages of design and procurement process. The 2022 social housing build target for Mayo County Council is 90 homes. </p>  <p>  The Affordable Housing Act 2021, the first ever standalone affordable housing legislation, established a basis for four new affordable housing measures. These measures will deliver on the Programme for Government commitment to put affordability at the heart of the housing system and prioritise the increased supply of affordable homes through (1) delivering affordable homes on local authority lands, (2) the introduction of a new form of tenure in Cost Rental, (3) a First Home shared equity scheme and (4) expanding Part V planning requirements to increase the 10% contribution requirement to 20% and to apply it to cost rental as well as social and affordable housing.</p>  <p>  At a national level, 2,550 Affordable Purchase homes and 1,580 Cost Rental homes are targeted for delivery for 2022.  Annual targets will increase incrementally in subsequent years. These homes will be delivered by the local authorities, Approved Housing Bodies and the Land Development Agency.  Additional affordable housing delivery will be facilitated through the expanded 20% Part V requirement and the introduction of the First Home Scheme. The First Home shared equity scheme will be available nationally on a demand-led basis. This scheme will primarily support first-time buyers purchasing new homes through the private market. It is anticipated this scheme will be open for applications in the second half of this year. The national 2022 target delivery for the First Home Scheme is 1,750. </p></reply>

The County and City Management Association&rsquo;s (CCMA) Local Authority Services Frameworks for Future Covid-19 Pandemic Response did not permit on-site rental inspections for long periods in 2020 and 2021. This was in order to protect tenants, landlords and inspectors. Even when restrictions were relaxed there was still a reluctance on the part of some tenants to allow authorised inspectors access their homes. Inspections have been and continue to be frustrated by some tenants needing to self-isolate due to having Covid-19 or being a close contact.</p><p>In response to the disruption caused by the pandemic some local authorities piloted virtual inspections which my Department supported with Exchequer funding. Dublin City Council led this initiative and commenced virtual inspections in May 2020. The  Department incorporated and standardised the approach taken countrywide into a pilot programme, requesting business cases from participating local authorities to ensure that processes are suitably robust and comprehensive. </p><p>It is a key component of the virtual inspection model that local authorities reserve the right to conduct a physical on-site inspection when it is safe to do so and landlords were advised accordingly. Many rented dwellings have been subsequently re-inspected physically, since pandemic restrictions have eased.</p><p>Since the CCMA allowed the resumption of on-site inspections in July 2021 many councils participating in the pilot programmes ceased virtual inspections, but a number have continued to undertake some. Q4 2021 inspection data is currently being collated and verified but indications are that virtual inspections accounted for circa 5% of all inspections undertaken in that period.</p><p>As set down in <i>Housing for All</i>I envisage virtual inspections playing an important supporting role to the traditional on-site inspection regime, with on-site inspections accounting for the majority of inspections undertaken. I believe that the potential offered by a virtual inspection approach needs to be fully explored. This is being progressed through an ongoing process of evaluation by my Department of the sector's experience with virtual inspections since 2020. </p></reply>

Nevertheless, I can confirm that EirGrid prepare an annual report outlining the levels of dispatch-down of renewable energy on the island of Ireland.</p><p>The latest such report can be found here: <i></i>.</p><p>This report contains information on historic dispatch down quantities dating back to 2011. The dispatch-down energy from wind resources in 2020 was 1,448 GWh in Ireland. This is equivalent to 11.4% of the total available wind energy.</p><p>In order to meet Ireland's target of up to 80% renewable electricity by 2030, very high penetration of variable renewable electricity on the grid will be required. Currently EirGrid operate the power system with up to 70% of renewable power at a given time, including onshore wind and solar. By 2030, this will need to rise to 95% in real time and higher.</p><p>EirGrid have a number of measures in place that seek to limit the amount of dispatch down and they continue to evolve them further in line with European policy such as the Clean Energy Package. Such measures include the DS3 programme of system services. Investing in and strengthening the electricity grid network, as well as increasing storage, are also critical to minimising the levels of renewable energy sources that are curtailed or constrained down. In addition, the Climate Action Plan 2021 includes a number of actions to address storage policy and higher levels of renewable electricity on the network. My own Department will publish a storage consultation later this year leading to the development of a national storage policy next year. </p></reply>

This Office will play an important role in our transition to zero emission vehicles. It will co-ordinate measures to support the uptake of EVs and the rollout of charge point infrastructure.</p><p>Having an effective and reliable recharging network is essential to enabling drivers to choose electric. Charging at home is the most convenient and cheapest way to recharge. Targeting the installation of smart home chargers is a priority as we look to moving towards more energy efficient and sustainable ways to charge. A grant is available from the SEAI for those individuals seeking to install a home charger. Work is currently being progressed to expand the EV home charger grant to include shared parking in apartment blocks and similar developments. My Department is working closely with the SEAI and expects a scheme for apartments to open in the near future.</p><p>There is also a need for a seamless public charging network that will provide for situations or instances where home charging is not possible such as on-street and residential charging, destination charging, and workplace charging. </p><p>&euro;10 million was committed from the Climate Action Fund to support ESB investment in the charging network and this has leveraged a further &euro;10 million investment from ESB, with the infrastructure to be in place by the end of 2022. This intervention alone will result in:</p><p>- 90 additional high power chargers, each capable of charging two vehicles</p><p>- 52 additional fast chargers, which may replace existing standard chargers</p><p>- 264 replacement standard chargers with more modern technology and with each consisting of two charge points</p><p>Further details on the progression of this project can be found at <i>esb.ie/ecars/our-network/network-upgrades</i>.</p><p>There is a need for a seamless public charging network that will provide for situations or instances where home charging is not possible such as on-street and residential charging, destination charging, and workplace charging. </p><p>In terms of existing supports for public charging, the Public Charge Point Scheme, which is administered by the SEAI, provides local authorities with a grant of up to &euro;5,000 to support the development of on-street public chargers. The primary focus of the scheme is to provide support for the installation of infrastructure which will facilitate owners of electric vehicles, who do not have access to a private parking space, but instead rely on parking their vehicles in public places near their homes to charge their EVs. It should be noted that this scheme facilitates the installation of standard charge points.</p><p>My Department has committed to reviewing the Scheme later this year to ensure that it is as effective as possible in driving the decarbonisation effort. </p><p>Thirteen local authorities have been in touch with SEAI in relation to the Public Points Scheme including Cork County Council. However no application has been submitted to date. Cork City Council have not contacted the SEAI in relation to this scheme. Letters of offer have issued to Louth County Council and Dublin City Council in 2021, to install a total of 29 charge points within their administrative areas. </p><p>I am also aware that a report was published by the CCMA on the provision of guidance to local authorities on the provision of charging infrastructure. The document is available for viewing online at www.lgma.ie/en/publications/general-publications/local-authority-electrification-of-fleet-and-ev-charging-guidance.pdf </p><p>My Department is also developing a new scheme which will support the installation of destination charge points in locations such as visitor centres and parks. This new initiative will help provide another critical link in the overall network for public charging.</p></reply>

It identified the spending objectives of the programme, including existing arrangements and relevant business needs. It also included an appraisal of various service delivery options, including the State assuming full responsibility for the service, either through the Air Corps or a dedicated IRCG Aviation Branch. Both were ruled out for a variety of reasons including the significant challenges of establishing such a service before the current contract expires and the level of risk which  would be assumed by the State.</p>  <p>  While it was acknowledged in the preliminary report that the Air Corps would not be in a position to take full responsibility for the service, the Department of Transport agreed to explore the viability of the Air Corps providing some element of the SAR aviation service at the request of the Department of Defence as part of this phase. </p>  <p>  The Air Corps proposal, received in March 2021, was considered in the business case as part of a so-called &ldquo;hybrid&rdquo; option whereby the Air Corps would provide one helicopter base with a fixed wing component, which would then require a civil operator to provide the remaining element to meet the specification for the national service.  The Air Corps provided costings in their proposal for their element. KPMG supplemented with estimates for the costs of the civil operator element. The business case analysis demonstrated, among other things, that there is an inherent cost implication in splitting the helicopter service between two or more providers. </p>  <p>  The single provider option can achieve economies of scale and address availability requirements more cost effectively. There is flexibility in relation to how the fixed wing element, which would be a new element of the service, could be provisioned.</p>  <p>  However, provision has been made within the Pre-Qualification Questionnaire to allow for the Air Corps to undertake the Fixed Wing element of the service when / if it has capacity.</p></reply>

To this end, my Department sought and received submissions to consultation in 2019 and again in 2021 from stakeholders including the Irish Wheelchair Association. A subsequent representation from the NCBI, Irish Wheelchair Association and Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind was also received in 2021.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Road Traffic and Roads Bill proposes the introduction of a new category of vehicle to the Road Traffic Acts called powered personal transporters, which will include micromobility vehicles like e-scooters. Vehicles designed and constructed for a person with restricted mobility are precluded from the scope of this category of vehicle. All relevant road traffic legislation will apply to powered personal transporters, however unlike mechanically propelled vehicles such as cars, vans, trucks and buses, registration, taxation and licensing will not be required. </p>  <p>  The Bill provides for powers to set out in Regulations minimum technical and safety standards for such vehicles and rules for their safe use. Many of the recommendations in the submission from the Irish Wheelchair Association which the Deputy has shared refer to matters proper to those Regulations and will be considered in that context. </p>  <p>  I would also advise the Deputy that the Road Traffic Acts do not provide for powers to establish or govern public or private vehicle rental schemes and accordingly I do not have a role in this regard.

Applications may be made in person at an NDLS office, where the required documents are examined and a face-to-face verification is made. </p>  <p>  A public services card (PSC) is not required for an application made in an NDLS office. It may be used to establish identity but it is not mandatory and an applicant has several options for verifying their identity. For online applications, the same information is required but verifying a person&rsquo;s identity is more difficult. Accordingly, a MyGovID account, which requires a PSC, satisfies this requirement.</p>  <p>  Legal proceedings, in which the Department of Social Protection appealed an enforcement notice from the Data Protection Commission on processing of personal data for PSCs, were resolved in 2021. The agreement acknowledged that other public bodies specified in social welfare legislation may use the PSC for verifying the identity of the people they deal with, provided that they also accept other methods of authenticating identity. The Road Safety Authority is a specified body for the use of a PSC under the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 (as amended by the Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Act 2009). </p>  <p>The agreement also accepted that the Department of Social Protection and other specified bodies can continue to use MyGovID as the sole means of authenticating identity for the purpose of accessing online services, provided that an alternative service provision channel is made available.  </p></reply>

Firms should be monitoring the situation closely given the potential for further sanctions.</p><p>- Firms are reminded of their obligation to ensure that they have robust controls in place, including policies and processes, to ensure that risks to the business are effectively identified, monitored and mitigated on an ongoing basis.</p><p>- Firms need to be aware of the significantly increased cyber threat landscape resulting from Russia's invasion into Ukraine. Firms need to be on heightened alert for cyber-attack and have measures in place to detect, defend and recover as needed, to both protect and ensure continuity of their operations.  </p><p>- Firms should assess their exposure to cyber risks, including indirect exposures via third parties, and keep a watching brief for advisories from the National Cyber Security Centre.  In particular, firms should review the below advisory which provides recommendations on actions firms should be already taking: <i>www.ncsc.gov.ie/pdfs/TLP_WHITE_Heightened_Threats_Feb22.pdf</i>.</p><p>I can further inform the Deputy that there is a robust framework in place known as the Fitness and Probity Regime that was introduced by the Central Bank Reform Act 2010.  It is critical to the protection of the public interest and to ensuring there is public trust and confidence in the financial system.</p><p>The core function of the Fitness and Probity Regime is to ensure that individuals in key and customer facing positions - referred to in the legislation as Controlled Functions (CFs) and Pre-Approval Controlled Functions (PCFs) - within a Regulated Financial Service Provider (Regulated Firm) are competent and capable, honest, ethical and of integrity and also financially sound.</p><p>The Central Bank's vision for the Fitness and Probity Regime is that Regulated Firms and individuals who work in these firms are committed to high standards of competence, integrity and honesty, and are held to account when they fall below these standards.</p></reply>

I am aware of this research, and the issue of access to financial services for this particular group. It is important to note that neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can intervene in the provision or pricing of insurance products. This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive).</p>  <p>  I note the recommendations of the Report prepared for the Irish Cancer Socirety, particularly in relation to legislating for the concept of a &ldquo;Right to be Forgotten&rdquo;. I am aware that a number of EU Member States have implemented such a policy, and my officials have examined the approach taken in these jurisdictions. With respect to home ownership, which is recognised as a challenge within the report, officials have been considering issues around access to insurance, such as mortgage protection cover, for individuals who have recovered from cancer, and have consulted Insurance Ireland on this matter. </p>  <p>  Insurance Ireland has advised that life insurance must be underwritten on a case-by-case basis, and that different types of cancers present different risks, which is reflected in current underwriting practices. Insurers must be able to use relevant statistical, medical, and actuarial data to make underwriting decisions to ensure terms and conditions of insurance are appropriate in the interests of all policyholders.</p>  <p>  Separately, as the Deputy may be aware, this matter is being considered at EU level, and the European Commission&rsquo;s Europe&rsquo;s Beating Cancer Plan, published last year, includes an initiative for 2021-2023 to &ldquo;Address fair access for cancer survivors to financial services (including insurance), via a code of conduct and a reflection on long-term solutions&rdquo;. My Department has examined this development, and will closely monitor any outputs from this work, as it continues to consider relevant issues in this area. </p></reply>

The eligibility conditions for the scheme, requires that a business has tax clearance and that a minimum 30% decline in business turnover/orders has occurred due to the impact of COVID-19. </p>  <p>  The eligibility criteria set down in the legislation provides that where a business started trading in 2019, but not later than 1 November 2019, it must be able to demonstrate at least a 30% reduction in either turnover or customer orders by comparing the trading months in 2019 to the equivalent months in 2021. To be considered a &lsquo;new business&rsquo; for the purpose of EWSS, a business should have started trading from or after 1 November 2019.

In December, I announced funding of &euro;2 million for local authorities in 2022, to support their leading role in developing community-led commemorative activities, for the final phase of the Decade of Centenaries Programme.</p>  <p>  The provision or maintenance of memorials, erection of monuments, plaques, busts or statues and the production of commemorative medals or pins are not currently supported under my Department's funding allocation. My Department has developed comprehensive guidance for the allocation of funding to assist local authorities.  However, it is, of course, within the discretion of individual local authorities to provide support from within their own resources to local communities who wish to erect and maintain monuments, where this is deemed the appropriate approach.  </p>  <p>  It is anticipated that local authorities will receive a number of requests from commemorative committees and community groups seeking support for the erection of monuments and other memorials as we navigate through the sensitive forthcoming period of commemorations.  </p>  <p>  While it is recognised that these incidents and actions are undoubtedly of great local significance in the narrative of the part played by individual counties during the Struggle for Independence and Civil War, this is just one element within the Community Strand of the overall Decade of Centenaries programme. Our approach is aligned with the guidance of the Expert Advisory Group on Centenary Commemorations, which advocates that initiatives which will serve as &lsquo;living legacies&rsquo; for the Decade of Centenaries would be particularly beneficial, such as those that highlight the importance of original research and scholarship at national and local level, promoting free, public access to authentic historical sources.  </p>  <p>  The Expert Advisory Group advises that local commemorative endeavours could helpfully focus on acknowledging the significance of the event or action, rather than on the individual personalities involved, which would be a matter for personal commemoration and personal remembrance. The Group advocates that the emphasis must always be on remembrance and commemoration of locally significant historical events and the avoidance of any sense of celebration.  </p></reply>

The project aims to collect authoritative data on Sport and Recreation Amenities, provide clear and concise information to the public and facilitate national and local policies. This database will be a digital portal, which will provide a base registry of sports and recreation amenities in Ireland. It will also provide improved data quality and data management for stakeholders; meet open data requirements (EU Directive July 2021) as well as access to additional data from other stakeholders and sources. The database will also provide tools for audits, condition surveys and assessment as well as options for public feedback for live reporting on conditions or issues.</p>  <p>  This is a major, multi-annual project involving the integration of multiple datasets.

However, as the detailed analysis for the project progressed, the differences between the standalone nature of the BCMS system and the complexity of e-Planning, including the level of integration required with the different systems already operated by local authorities, highlighted that a divergent approach would be required.</p><p>The approach from the outset was to, build on, rather than replace existing systems for cost and time efficiency reasons. The planning system itself is complex with many different processes, scenarios and timelines so the development of a solution that takes account of the complex planning code together with the required integration of the developed system with 3 existing back-end planning systems and 8 existing document management systems across 31 planning authorities was not a straightforward process. </p><p>However, following initial system development and a re-scoping exercise carried out in 2020, a revised project schedule for agreed functionality was agreed. This schedule committed to delivering online planning in two pilot local authorities by the end of 2021. The National Online Planning Portal (<i></i>) went live in Tipperary County Council and Galway County Council in Q4 2021 and is progressing well, with already over 35% of planning applications received in both these counties being received online. </p><p>The development of remaining functionality which includes the facility to make online submissions to planning applications and part 8 proposals is well advanced and is scheduled for completion by the end of May, after which time this aspect will also be piloted in Tipperary County Council and Galway County Council. </p><p>It is envisaged that the rollout of the National Online Planning Portal enabling both the making of online planning applications and the making of online submissions will begin across all remaining local authorities on a phased basis, including the integration necessary to enable planning applications for all local authorities, who may use different systems, to be received via the National Portal. </p><p>At present Cork City Council, Cork County Council and Kildare County Council are in the process of replacing their planning system after which they will complete the integration necessary to enable planning applications to these local authorities to be received via the National Portal.</p><p>The project is advancing in line with the programme agreed in 2020 and it is envisaged that e-planning functionality will be further rolled out across local authorities during the current year. </p></reply>

This funding was introduced originally to tackle long term vacant units and is now increasingly targeted to support authority's to ensure minimal turnaround and re-let times for vacant stock. </p><p>From 2014 to 2021, expenditure of some &euro;261 million was recouped to local authorities under the Voids Programme which funded the return to productive use of 18,527 properties nationwide. Local authorities also provide significant funding from their own resources to address the level of vacancy within the social housing stock.</p><p>There has been extensive funding provided particularly over the last two years under the Voids programme which not only catered for standard relets but also for vacant properties requiring more extensive works prior to relet. It is up to each local authority to submit a programme of works based on their individual allocation or targets.</p><p>In 2020, &euro;56.4m exchequer funding was provided to bring a total of 3,607 vacant homes back into productive use within the social housing stock. This represents the highest ever yearly spend and the highest number of homes to be refurbished under the voids programme. Within this programme local authorities had the opportunity to remediate long term vacant properties (houses vacant over 12 months) the funding for which was uncapped. Again in 2021, the Voids programme catered for a non-standard refurbishment option which allowed local authorities claim an average of &euro;50,000 funding in this category (no vacancy limit). </p><p>In relation to the announcement in May 2021 it is important to note this was not a stimulus Voids Programme but rather a normal Voids Programme. The Voids stimulus programme was announced in July 2020 and made available to local authorities in recognition of the very challenging financial circumstances which they were experiencing with a very real risk that the vacant homes, which would normally be refurbished by local authorities using their own resources, would be significantly impacted in 2020.  </p><p>Full details in relation to output of Galway County Council, Galway City Council and all other local authorities is available on the link below.</p><p><i>www.gov.ie/en/collection/0906a-other-local-authority-housing-scheme-statistics/#voids-programme</i>.</p><p>My Department will continue to support local authorities in their work in this area in 2022, however, as result of the significant investment by the Department in the Voids Programme, local authorities should also now be in a strong position to begin the transition to a strategic and informed planned maintenance approach to stock management and maintenance. To that end my Department and local authorities are working to transition from a largely response and voids based approach to housing stock management and maintenance to a planned maintenance approach. This will require the completion of stock condition surveys by all local authorities and the subsequent development of strategic and informed work programmes in response. My Department will support these work programmes by ensuring that the funding available under the various stock improvement programmes are aligned with this approach.</p><p>It is also of note that Local authorities will always have a level of vacancy in their housing stock. This will fluctuate over time as tenancy surrender and re-letting of dwellings is an ongoing process. Details in relation to the number of voids are not collated by my Department, however, statistics in relation to social housing stock, at a point in time, are published by the National Oversight and Audit Commission (NOAC) in their Annual Reports on Performance Indicators in Local Authorities. These reports provide a range of information in relation to social housing stock, including levels of vacancy in local authority owned properties. The most recent report, relating to 2020, is available on the NOAC website at the following link:</p><p><i>noac.ie/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/NOAC-Local-Authority-Performance-Indicator-Report-2020.pdf</i>.</p></reply>

It is intended that this group will set the agenda, prepare a high level action plan and ultimately oversee the implementation of the overall TCF programme. This group will be made up with representation from local government/government departments, agencies &amp;amp; wider expert representation. It is intended that recruitment to this group will take place once the National TCF Office is established. </p></reply>

Housing estates with DPI are a small subset of estates nationally awaiting taking in charge by Planning Authorities. </p>  <p>  Under Section 180 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended), it is a matter for the relevant Planning Authority to take housing estates in charge. </p>  <p>  A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between Irish Water and local authorities addresses the arrangements necessary for taking in charge of estates provided they are connected to the public (Irish Water) network. I assume that this is the agreement that the Deputy is referring to. </p>  <p>  My Department is supporting the progressive taking in charge of estates with DPI and is not aware of applicants being refused mortgages on houses in such estates. I secured funding of &euro;68.5 million under the National Development Plan has for period 2021-2025 for water legacy issues in relation to lead pipe remediation and the Developer Provided Water Services Infrastructure Resolution Programme (DPI) to underpin this support.</p>  <p>  My Department introduced a multi-annual programme to provide funding for the progressive resolution of housing estates with legacy DPI. The focus of this first tranches of funding is on estates in towns and villages where the resolution is to connect their water services to the public networks. The MoU agreement allows for this.</p>  <p>  In September 2020, I announced the first tranche of funding under the multi-annual programme. Just over &euro;3.36 million was made available for 26 estates across 10 counties with almost 950 households to benefit. </p>  <p>  The Expert Panel is currently considering further bid submissions from local authorities and this, subject to my approval, will lead to a further wave of funding allocations in Q2, 2022. These projects, together with a major study being undertaken by Irish Water, will inform future policy and funding needs on resolving sub-standard developer provided water services infrastructure in the areas involved.</p></reply>

Affordability and the chance to own a home are at the heart of this Government&rsquo;s housing policy. It recognises that significant new supports are needed so that those who want to own their own home can do so, and that those who wish to rent are able to do so at an affordable rate. </p><p>While many housing issues are complex to tackle, a simple lack of supply to meet demand is a significant part of the problem. Housing for All addresses this and aims to increase the supply of housing to an average of 33,000 homes per year over the next decade. Over 300,000 new homes will be built by the end of 2030, including a projected 90,000 social homes, 36,000 affordable purchase homes, and 18,000 cost rental homes. </p><p>To help support this ambitious delivery, Housing for All is backed by historic levels of investment with in excess of &euro;20bn through the Exchequer, the Land Development Agency (LDA) and the Housing Finance Agency over the next 5 years. This will provide the sector with the certainty and stability it needs. </p><p>There is a targeted approach right across the country to supply housing where it is needed most. A key action of Housing for All is that local authorities will develop and submit Housing Delivery Action Plans to include details of social and affordable housing delivery. The Plans set out details of both social and affordable housing delivery as appropriate over the period 2022 - 2026, in line with targets set under Housing for All. </p><p>All local authorities submitted their Housing Delivery Action Plans to me in December. My Department is now working closely with each local authority and the Housing Delivery Coordination Office to review the Plans, having regard to the targets and policy objectives set out in Housing for All. This will require further engagement with local authorities in the coming weeks. It is intended to publish the Plans in Quarter 2 of 2022 when this process of assessment and engagement has concluded.</p><p>There are a number of encouraging indications of increased construction activity at this early stage. We are seeing a strong supply pipeline, with Commencement Notices data showing a total number of 30,724 residential dwellings commenced in 2021. This is a 42% increase when compared to the number of residential dwellings commenced in 2020 (21,686). The 2021 total is almost equal to the combined totals for 2016 and 2017 (30,816).</p><p>New figures shows that in the past twelve months (February 2021 to January 2022), Commencement Notices for 31,201 new homes were received. This is the highest rolling 12-month total since comparable data was first published. The breakdown, by local authority area, is available in the Statistics Dashboard of the Housing for All campaign page at following weblink:<i>www.gov.ie/en/campaigns/dfc50-housing-for-all/#</i>. </p><p>With regard to the number of homes built, there were 20,433 new dwellings completed in 2021. Completions for 2022 and 2023 are projected to exceed the Housing for All targets of 24,600 and 29,000 respectively. The Central Bank forecasts that some 27,000 and 31,000 homes will be completed in 2022 and 2023 respectively.</p><p>Increasing the supply of housing as set out in Housing for All is the top priority for me and the Government and we have made a good start on our path towards this goal. However, I acknowledge that we are coming from a low base of supply and that it will take some time before the full benefits of the plan are tangible to our citizens. There are however a number of key schemes and initiatives that will support the delivery of affordable homes at scale:</p><p>The Local Authority Affordable Homes scheme and the First Home scheme are primarily focused on supporting first-time buyers purchasing newly built homes. Both of these schemes will be targeted at households constrained by the maximum mortgage and deposit available to them. The gap between the market value and what the household can afford (including with the assistance of the &lsquo;Help to Buy&rsquo; incentive) will be bridged via the provision of equity support. The equity support can subsequently be redeemed at any time at the home-owners discretion, or remain outstanding until the home is sold or passed on.</p><p>Changes have also be made to the current Local Authority Home Loan Scheme which enable first-time buyers, on middle incomes, to access sustainable mortgages to purchase new or second-hand properties, or to self-build. The product has been changed by lowering the interest rate for new borrowers by 0.25% and raising the maximum income ceiling for single persons to &euro;65,000 in counties Cork, Dublin, Galway, Kildare, Louth, Meath and Wicklow. </p><p>New Cost Rental homes are now becoming available as we speak. Under Cost Rental, homes will be provided at rents that are set to cover only the cost of financing, building, managing and maintaining the homes. Over the period to 2026, it is intended that approximately 10,000 Cost Rental homes will be delivered in our urban centres that will provide affordable rental homes in the order of 25% below market rents.</p><p>The LDA also has a key role to play, including through &ldquo;Project Tosaigh&rdquo; aimed at accelerating the delivery of up to 5,000 homes. The first delivery stream of this LDA initiative to bring privately developed units to market affordably and quickly was launched on 12 November 2021. The LDA issued a call for Expressions of Interest for advance purchase agreements to developers, with a target scheme scale in excess of 150 units per development, in the Greater Dublin Area, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford. The Expressions of Interest submitted are currently being assessed by the LDA with their priority focus and engagement being on schemes with potential delivery in 2022 and 2023. These homes will be targeted at those middle-income households that do not qualify for social housing, but struggle to afford open market housing, i.e. household incomes of broadly &euro;45,000 to &euro;80,000 per annum.</p><p>The Affordable Housing Fund has replaced the Serviced Sites Fund. The Fund has been open for applications from 1 September 2021. My Department is actively engaging with the Local Authorities to support and encourage them to develop and submit proposals. The homes that Local Authorities deliver under the Affordable Housing Fund will be sold at least 15% below open market value in respect of Affordable Purchase homes and in the order of 25% below open market value prices in respect of Cost Rental homes. </p><p>The housing challenge remains immense, and continues to be affected by ongoing challenges including COVID-19 related delays, supply chain difficulties and inflationary pressure. The cost of housing &ndash; for those buying or renting will continue to be a challenge in the short-term. Narrowing the gap between supply and demand through the implementation of Housing for All will ultimately result in a moderation of prices and provide greater certainty to buyers and the sector alike.</p><p>Finally, in terms of tracking progress on Housing for All the Government has committed to publishing a report each quarter throughout the lifetime of the plan. </p><p>The first of these progress reports, for Q3 2021, was published on 20 October 2021 and can be accessed at the following link: <i>www.gov.ie/en/publication/44df1-housing-for-all-q3-2021-progress-report/</i>.</p><p>The second progress report, for Q4 2021, was published on 26 January 2022 and can be accessed at the following link: <i>www.gov.ie/en/publication/84e61-housing-for-all-q4-2021-progress-report/</i>.</p></reply>

Our annual targets include the delivery of 90,000 new social homes and 54,000 new affordable homes in the period 2022-2030. Housing for All is supported by an investment package of over &euro;4bn per annum, through an overall combination of &euro;12bn in direct Exchequer funding, &euro;3.5bn in funding through the Land Development Agency (LDA) and &euro;5bn funding through the Housing Finance Agency and through a strategic partnership between the State and retail banks.</p><p>In relation to increased delivery of social homes and the reduction of housing waiting lists, there is a target to build 9,000 new social homes in 2022 and there is a strong pipeline in place to support this delivery. The Social Housing Construction Status Report (CSR) published each quarter provides scheme level detail on social housing new build activity in each local authority, including those delivered by Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs). The most recent report for Quarter 3 2021 shows that there were 9,746 social homes under construction onsite with an additional 9,559 homes at various stages of design and procurement. </p><p>Through Housing for All, we are also strengthening the capacity of local authorities to initiate, design, plan, develop and manage housing projects. I approved over 200 new staff for local authority housing delivery teams in December 2021. These posts will increase the capacity of local authorities to initiate, manage and deliver new build housing schemes. </p><p>In relation to affordable housing, the Affordable Housing Act 2021, the first ever standalone affordable housing legislation, established a basis for four new affordable housing measures. These measures will deliver on the Programme for Government commitment to put affordability at the heart of the housing system and prioritise the increased supply of affordable homes through (1) delivering affordable homes on local authority lands, (2) the introduction of a new form of tenure in Cost Rental, (3) a First Home shared equity scheme and (4) expanding Part V planning requirements to increase the 10% contribution requirement to 20% and to apply it to cost rental as well as social and affordable housing.</p><p>This Act, supported by the unprecedented levels of funding committed to in the Housing for All strategy, averaging over &euro;4 billion annually, will underpin the delivery of affordable housing targets. Specifically, 54,000 affordable homes for purchase or rent will be delivered between now and 2030 by local authorities, Approved Housing Bodies, the Land Development Agency and through the First Home Scheme, a strategic partnership between the State and retail banks.</p><p>A Housing Delivery Action Plan currently being prepared by each Local Authority will underpin delivery targets to 2026.  Local authorities submitted the first iteration of their plans in December and my officials have now met with each authority. I expect that the final Delivery Action Plans will be published in Q2 and these will contain projected delivery over the years 2022 to 2026.</p><p>In relation to deposits, in the first instance deposit requirements are set in line with current mortgage regulations which were introduced and are governed by the Central Bank of Ireland, Any review of the macro prudential rules and first-time buyer regulations are a matter for the Central Bank as an independent body.</p><p>The Central Bank referenced these requirements in its recently published Financial Stability Review 2021 II. This report is available at the following link; <i>www.centralbank.ie/docs/default-source/publications/financial-stability-review/financial-stability/financial-stability-review-2021-ii.pdf?sfvrsn=4</i>.</p><p>In this report, the Central Bank concluded that these limits are reducing systematic financial risk, as well as preventing credit dynamics from increasing house prices further than the levels recently experienced.</p><p>The Help-to-Buy incentive helps support first-time buyers in meeting deposit requirements for newly-built houses or apartments, as well as self-build homes, and it can be used in conjunction with the Local Authority Affordable Purchase and First Home schemes. Subject to the level of income tax and DIRT paid over the previous 4 years, the Help-to-Buy scheme provides a maximum benefit to first-time buyers of &euro;30,000 or 10% of the cost of the newly constructed home. The Help-to-Buy scheme has already helped over 30,000 first-time buyers achieve the deposit required for a new home.</p></reply>

Greater supply will be key to meeting demand, helping moderate property price increases, and addressing affordability pressures facing renters, homeowners and potential buyers in the coming years.</p><p>Housing for All includes unprecedented direct investment in social and affordable housing, reforms to ensure availability of land, removal of obstacles to and supporting viability of development, and ensuring there is sufficient investment and capacity to support construction. The plan also commits to reducing the cost of construction. </p><p>Recent analysis by the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland indicates that construction build costs account for c.47% of total apartment development costs. These have risen considerably over recent years through a combination of the increased cost of regulatory compliance and general increases in labour and materials costs. As a result, new-builds, especially apartments, are beyond the reach of many first-time buyers. Improved productivity in construction will help address this imbalance.</p><p>Housing For All commits the State to a more central role in leading and funding structures to ensure levels of productivity and innovation materialise. The most recent Progress Report for Housing for All (Q4 2021) provides an update on the significant progress being made on delivering this integrated set of policies, as well as on the considerable level of collaboration across Government, the actions being taken to increase capacity and efficiency of delivery of both public and private sectors, and the continued collaborative engagement with the construction sector and other important stakeholders, who are pivotal to its success.</p><p>The Progress Report is available at: <i>www.gov.ie/en/publication/84e61-housing-for-all-q4-2021-progress-report/</i>.</p></reply>

However, 2021 planning statistics are expected to be published in Q2 2022. It is apparent that almost 9 out of every 10 planning applications made (89%) were granted planning permission in 2020.</p><p>Since 2018, the National Planning Framework (NPF) is the national planning policy document providing overall strategic policy for the future development of Ireland through specific National Policy Objectives (NPOs) that support the overall rural and small town pattern of development in Ireland.</p><p>In policy terms, NPO 19 of the NPF aims to ensure that a distinction is made between areas experiencing significant overspill development pressure from urban areas, particularly within the commuter catchment of cities, towns and centres of employment, on the one hand, and other remoter and structurally weaker rural areas where population levels may be low and or declining, on the other. NPO 19 is also aligned with the established approach whereby considerations of social (intrinsic part of the community) or economic (persons working full or part time) need may be applied by planning authorities in rural areas under urban influence.</p><p>Under the Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Sustainable Rural Housing 2005, which were issued under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 as amended, planning authorities are required to frame the planning policies in their development plans in a balanced and measured way that ensures the housing needs of rural communities are met, while avoiding excessive urban-generated housing.  The Guidelines are available on the Government&rsquo;s website at the following link: <i>www.gov.ie/en/publication/23809-sustainable-rural-housing-development-guidelines/</i>.</p><p>Updated Rural Housing Planning Guidelines are currently being prepared that will continue to allow for the development of homes in rural areas while also highlighting the need to manage certain areas around cities and towns in order to avoid over-development of those areas.  Given the complexity of the issues involved, the need for environmental assessment and both internal and external consultation, the updated Rural Housing Guidelines, which are at an advanced stage of drafting, will expand on the high level policy of the NPF and will continue to allow county development plans to provide for rural housing in line with the Guidelines. </p><p>Subject to the need for any environmental assessment that may be required such as Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) or Appropriate Assessment (AA), the draft guidelines will be the subject of public consultation. The timeline for publication of the draft guidelines will be dependent on whether &ldquo;full&rdquo; SEA or AA of the guidelines are required.</p><p>In relation to the granting of permissions by local authorities, in making a decision in respect of an application for planning permission, planning authorities (and An Bord Plean&aacute;la in relation to planning appeals) are required to consider such applications in the context of the relevant Development Plan, or Local Area Plan where one exists for the area, as well as any relevant Ministerial Guidelines.</p><p>It is noteworthy that there has been strong delivery of single new homes in rural areas nationally in recent years, comprising around one in three of all houses (i.e. excluding apartments), completed in the 5 years between Q4 2016 and Q3 2021. </p></reply>

Russia&rsquo;s unjustified and unprovoked attack is causing immense suffering for the people of Ukraine. Russia&rsquo;s war is illegal and immoral, and Ireland&rsquo;s support for Ukraine&rsquo;s sovereignty and territorial integrity is unwavering. Ireland will do all it can to support the humanitarian response both in Ukraine and in neighbouring countries.</p>  <p>  As an Taoiseach announced last week, a &euro;10 million Irish Aid Ukraine humanitarian package has been put together to enable organisations on the ground, including the UN and the Red Cross Movement, to provide life-saving assistance to the people of Ukraine. Ireland is also sending urgent medical supplies, including protective suits and masks and disinfectants, in response to a request from Ukraine via the EU Civil Protection Mechanism (UCPM).</p>  <p>  In addition, Ireland contributes to global funds and core funding to key agencies that are allocating funding to Ukraine, including WHO, OCHA, UNHCR, IFRC, ICRC and the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF). Ireland was the 9th largest donor to the CERF in 2021. Last week, the CERF allocated more than &euro;17.8 million to Ukraine. This year we will increase our annual contribution to the CERF from &euro;10m to &euro;11.5m, as I announced at the CERF pledging conference in December.</p>  <p>  My officials are coordinating closely with our EU partners and at UN level on the rapidly evolving situation in Ukraine and the related humanitarian response. </p></reply>

The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. </p><p>It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p><p>SNA support is allocated to special classes and special schools by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE). The NCSE has published the SNA alltions on their website www.ncse.ie. </p><p>Under the allocation model for special classes and special schools, the SNA allocation can change from year to year as children with care needs leave the school, as new children with care needs enrol in a school and as children develop more independent living skills and their care needs diminish over time. There is a prescribed special class to SNA ratio.</p><p>ASD special classes have an allocation of 1 teacher and 2 SNA posts to cater for the educational and care needs of 6 students. </p><p>Additional SNA support may also be sanctioned by the NCSE where there are individual children who have significant care needs which require support above the level of support already sanctioned to the school. In such circumstances, the school may apply to the NCSE for access to additional care supports, clearly outlining the reason why the additional support is necessary.</p><p>Detailed information on the NCSE exceptional review process is published on the NCSE website </p><p>The NCSE has confirmed that as of Monday 28th February 2022, the school has not submitted an application for additional SNA support.</p><p>My Department does not have a role in making individual school determinations and the school should liaise with the NCSE directly in the event that additional supports are required.</p></reply>

The refined DEIS identification model is an objective, statistics based process, based on school enrolment data and data available from Census 2016 under the HP Deprivation Index. It is important to note that there is no application process for the DEIS programme and all schools will be considered under the refined DEIS model when it is applied.

Supports provided under the SWA scheme can consist of a basic weekly payment, a weekly or monthly supplement in respect of certain expenses, as well as single exceptional needs payments (ENPs) and urgent needs payments (UNPs). </p><p>The basic supplementary welfare allowance provides immediate assistance for those in need who are awaiting the outcome of a claim or an appeal for a primary social welfare payment or do not qualify for payment under other State schemes. </p><p>Rent supplement provides short-term income support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.  The scheme ensures that for those who were renting, but whose circumstances have changed due to temporary loss of employment, can continue to meet their rental commitments.</p><p>Under the SWA scheme, a supplement can be awarded to assist with ongoing or recurring costs that cannot be met from the client&rsquo;s own resources and are deemed to be necessary.  In addition, officers can make a single exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off expenditure, which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income.  Decisions on ENPs and SWA supplements are made at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case.</p><p>Statistics are maintained on the number of applications awarded under the SWA scheme.  Statistics are not maintained on the number of applications refused, including over the period January/February 2021 and January/February 2022.  My Department is currently compiling more extensive statistics in relation the number of applications made to the SWA schemes in 2022.</p><p>As expenditure on the SWA schemes is reported on an annualised basis, the amounts paid out for the months in question are not available.</p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p><p>Table 1 shows the number of Basic SWA and supplement recipients by county, at end of January 2021.</p><p>Table 2 shows the number of Basic SWA and supplement recipients by county, at end of February 2021.</p><p>Table 3 shows the number of Basic SWA and supplement recipients by county, at end of January 2022.</p><p>Table 4 shows the number of Basic SWA and supplement recipients by county, at end of February 2022.</p><p>Table 5 shows the number of ENPs and UNPs paid by county for January 2021, February 2021, January 2022 and February 2022 (To the 25th).</p><p>Table 6 shows the number of ENPs and UNPs paid by category for January 2021, February 2021, January 2022 and February 2022 (To the 25th).</p><p><b></b></p></reply>

The evidence suggests that it has been successful in supporting the sustainability of services and preventing increasing costs being passed onto parents.</p>  <p>  Government has now decided to remove public health restrictions based on the recommendations from the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET). </p>  <p>  In line with NPHET recommendations, physical distancing measures such as play-pods, and mask wearing, are no longer be required in ELC and SAC settings with effect from 28 February. If members of staff or children wish to continue wearing face masks or coverings, they should be facilitated to do so. </p>  <p>  My Department provided updated sector-specific infection, prevention and control guidance to the sector on 25 February.</p>  <p>  The recommendations do still place a huge importance on continued Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) measures, isolation if symptomatic, vaccination and booster programmes. Hygiene measures remain important, and both staff and children should stay at home if symptomatic. In general, services should now resume normal routines and normal learning and care activity.</p></reply>

More than 100,000 children now participate on the universal pre-school programme on an annual basis and the National Childcare Scheme subsidises up to 80,000 children.</p><p>To ensure that the supply of early learning and childcare places meets demand, my Department has, since 2015, funded the creation of more than 27,000 new places through an Annual Capital Programme. Through this Annual Programme, priority has been attached to, inter alia, the creation of places for children under 3.</p><p>Before the onset of Covid-19, national data indicated that, on the whole, supply of early learning and childcare places was meeting demand, with evidence of undersupply for certain age groups including children under 3, and in certain areas.</p><p>Data gathered throughout the Covid-19 pandemic revealed lower demand for early earning and childcare, and reduced occupancy among early learning and childcare services. Indeed, data captured in June 2021 found significant vacancy rates across the country &ndash; with the national vacancy rate averaging at 21% and the vacancy rates for all age groups having risen significantly compared to two years ago. <table>    <tr>       <th>National Vacancy Rate By Age (June 2021)</th>       <th></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Up to 1 year (0-12 months)</td>       <td>20% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>1 year+ to 2 years (13-24 months)</td>       <td>10% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2 years+ to 3 years (25-36 months)</td>       <td>17% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>3 years+ to 4 years (37-48 months)</td>       <td>17% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>4 years+ to 5 years (49-60 months) Non-School-Going</td>       <td>12% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>4 years+ to 5 years (49-60 months) School-Going</td>       <td>42% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>5 years+ to 6 years (61-72 months) Non-school going</td>       <td>30% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>5 years+ to 6 years (61-72 months) School going</td>       <td>48% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>6 years+ to 8 years (73-96 months)</td>       <td>37% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>8 years+</td>       <td>34% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total </td>       <td>21% </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>My Department is continuing to monitor early learning and childcare capacity, particularly in light of the recent lifting of Covid-19 restrictions.</p><p>Pobal has, using the data captured in June 2021 and current registration data, recently projected vacancy rates in February 2022. While this analysis shows a fall in vacancy rates from June 2021 to February 2022 &ndash; with vacancy rates falling from 21% to 19%, this analysis suggests that there is unused capacity across the country. Further analysis is being undertaken by Pobal to establish if this unused capacity varies by type of provision or location, to establish the degree of mismatch is supply and demand for certain cohorts or children or in certain areas.</p><p>Pobal will also commence new data collection in April 2022, as part of the Annual Early Years Sector Profile survey. This will allow for updated information on capacity among early learning and childcare services to be established. </p><p>In addition to these efforts to monitor capacity issues across the country, my Department is planning a range of steps to address any issue of under supply. A new funding model, to roll out in September, will provide funding for services aligned to costs of delivery so, for example, greater funding will be available to services that cater for younger children where costs of delivery are higher than older children. Some &euro;70m has been allocated to my Department through the revised National Development Plan (NDP) &ndash; with the majority of this funding earmarked for new places. Another important step being taken by my Department, in partnership with the Department of Housing Planning and Local Government (DHPLG), is to update the 2001 Planning Guidelines for Local Authorities on Early Learning and Childcare Settings.</p><p>Parents experiencing difficulty in relation to their early learning and childcare needs should contact their local City/County Childcare Committee (CCC) for assistance. Contact details for CCCs may be found on www.myccc.ie.</p></reply>

The regulations were signed by the then Minister for Health, following consultation with my predecessor as Minister for Justice and Equality, Mr Charlie Flanagan TD, as well as the then Minister for Finance and for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>  <p>  On foot of this, the Garda Commissioner and his senior team implemented a carefully graduated policing response, based on its strong tradition of policing by consent. Garda members engaged, explained and encouraged members of the public to comply and, only as a last resort, made use of their enforcement powers under these regulations. </p>  <p>  With regard to the figures requested by the Deputy, I am informed by the Garda authorities that there are 48 recorded instances of a fine being issued due to breaches of regulations relating to face coverings on public transport.</p>  <p>  I am further advised that there are 34 recorded instances of a summons being issued due to breaches of regulations relating to face coverings on public transport.</p>  <p>  I am informed that the above figures were collated based on data from Pulse and the Fixed Charge Processing System as of 1:30am on 1 March 2022.  The Deputy will appreciate that these figures are operational and may be liable to change. </p></reply>

At this point, this legislative initiative remains a proposal and thus is not in force. </p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that the proposal is still in the early stage of negotiations in the Council working party on Information Exchange and Information Management, and Department officials participate in these negotiations, along with other Member States and Schengen associate countries in line with the ordinary legislative procedure.  It is not therefore possible at this stage to predict with accuracy the timeframe for adoption of the measure.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the specific policy objectives of the Pr&uuml;m II proposal are to:</p>  <p>  -  Provide a technical solution for efficient automated exchange of data between law enforcement authorities to make them aware of relevant data that is available in the national database of another Member State;</p>  <p>  -  Ensure that more relevant data (in terms of data categories) from national databases in other Member States is available to all competent law enforcement authorities;</p>  <p>  -  Ensure that relevant data (in terms of sources of data) from Europol&rsquo;s databases is available to law enforcement authorities;</p>  <p>  -  Provide law enforcement authorities with efficient access to the actual data corresponding to a &lsquo;hit&rsquo; that is available in the national database of another Member State.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that in preparing the published proposal, the European Commission undertook extensive consultations including targeted consultations of concerned stakeholders, including end-users of the system, namely Member States&rsquo; authorities using the Pr&uuml;m automated data exchange, ranging from law enforcement and judicial authorities, national vehicle registration authorities, national database custodians and forensic laboratories. The European Fundamental Rights Agency and non-governmental organisations such as EDRi (European Digital Rights) also provided input in light of their expertise. An impact assessment study was completed and published and a public consultation exercise was undertaken by the European Commission and advertised on their website.</p>  <p>  Without prejudicing ongoing deliberations and negotiations, Ireland&rsquo;s general position on law enforcement cooperation with our European partners is positive. Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the existing Pr&uuml;m Decisions and our potential participation in the proposal is in accordance with our rights and obligations under Protocol 21 annexed to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. No decision has been made at this point as to whether Ireland will seek to opt-in to the proposal and importantly any decision to seek such an opt-in will be subject to a vote and the approval of motions in both Houses of the Oireachtas.</p></reply>

It is relatively rare with estimations that a small proportion of ticks in Ireland are infected.</p>  <p>  The infection is known to be endemic in certain locations and in these areas GPs are very familiar with the most typical presentation which is a rash, often with a bull&rsquo;s eye appearance. In this setting early treatment can be initiated by the GP and further testing is not required or recommended. More complicated cases require referral to Infectious Diseases clinics, which are currently present in all but one level 4 and all but two level 3 hospitals in Ireland. There is no need for Irish residents to travel to other countries for diagnosis or treatment. </p>  <p>  The Infectious Diseases clinical program, which has been in place for one year, has a workforce strategy to establish a network of Infectious Diseases clinics that will address any current geographic inequity. The publicly funded Infectious Diseases clinics all support the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines regarding the diagnoses and treatment of Lyme disease. These clinics do not currently have waiting lists and patients are seen in a timely manner. Many hospital laboratories have the capacity to do Lyme serology (ELISA) locally and where not, referral of samples to the National Virus Reference Laboratory (NVRL) occurs.

Targeted increases across a number of specialist training programmes are planned for July 2022 and the HSE is currently working with all relevant stakeholders to agree the July 2022/23 specialist training intakes, including Surgery, Medicine, Psychiatry and General Practice.</p>  <p>  The number of GPs entering training has increased steadily over the past number of years, rising from 120 in 2009 to 233 in 2021. The transfer of GP training from the HSE to the Irish College of General Practitioners (ICGP) which was concluded in 2021 will allow for the introduction of a new service model for GP training in Ireland and the further expansion GP training capacity in the years ahead.</p>  <p>  Endometriosis is a common condition with one in ten women of reproductive age affected. The variable and broad symptoms of endometriosis mean that healthcare workers do not easily diagnose it and many individuals suffering from it have limited awareness of the condition. Given that enhanced awareness, followed by early diagnosis and management may slow or halt the natural progression of the disease and reduce the long-term burden of its symptoms, it is critical that GPs are well informed regarding the typical symptoms which should raise a suspicion of endometriosis. GPs should be competent in the basic management of endometriosis and its possible complications in the community. Therefore, the ICGP has been delivering education around endometriosis to its members including a webinar on endometriosis in June 2021 which was attend by 1,567 GPs and a course in community gynaecology, which included the topic of endometriosis, in January of this year.  Over 200 GPs attended this education module.  In addition, endometriosis is included in the curriculum for all GP trainees in ICGP.</p>  <p>  As part of its plans for 2022, the ICGP is engaging with the HSE's National Women and Infants Programme (NWHIP) to develop a Quick Reference Guide for GPs on the topic of endometriosis which aligns with the Model of Care for Endometriosis that is under development. To launch the guide ICGP would deliver a webinar to members and disseminate the guide through the college website, Ezine and Forum magazine. </p>  <p>  The Government is committed to developing women&rsquo;s health services. Building on progress made in rolling out ambulatory gynaecology clinics in 2020 and 2021, funding has been provided under Budget 2022 which will facilitate the establishment of additional ambulatory gynaecology clinics, thereby completing the implementation of the Ambulatory Gynaecology Model of Care. This will bring the total number of these clinics to 20 nationally. Funding has also been provided to enable the expansion of the endometriosis service at Tallaght University Hospital as well as the establishment of a new service for more complex endometriosis cases at Cork University Maternity Hospital.</p></reply>

An ambulatory care model is a more efficient and effective use of resources than the traditional outpatient model and it is also better for the patient as it reduces the requirement for multiple outpatient appointments.</p>  <p>  The roll out of the Ambulatory Gynaecology Model of Care began in 2020, and funding provided last year is enabling roll out to be significantly progressed through development of new clinics and expansion of some existing ambulatory gynaecology clinics. A number of these clinics are operational, while work is underway in relation to recruitment, refurbishment and equipping of the remaining ambulatory gynaecology clinics that were funded in 2021. </p>  <p>  Building on this progress, funding has been provided under Budget 2022 which will facilitate the establishment of further ambulatory gynaecology clinics, thereby completing the implementation of the Ambulatory Gynaecology Model of Care. This will bring the total number of these clinics to 20 nationally. These clinics will be associated with each of the 19 maternity hospitals across the country as well as in Tallaght University Hospital (TUH). </p>  <p>  In terms of other initiatives relating to improving access to gynaecology services, I would also like to highlight that the recently launched 2022 Waiting List Action Plan allocates &euro;350 million to the HSE and NTPF to reduce waiting lists by 18% this year.

Ireland is participating alongside 25 other European countries. </p>  <p>  We are interested in the policy direction this takes at European level. To that end, the Department of Health and the Health Research Board are engaged in a number of TEHDAS work packages and policy forums, where we can learn from other countries&rsquo; experiences in developing health information infrastructure. In turn, Ireland&rsquo;s experiences in this area provide valuable input into the work of TEHDAS. Furthermore, Ireland&rsquo;s health information system will undergo an expert assessment by the TEHDAS project in May 2022.  </p></reply>

This mandatory requirement for open disclosure will ensure that patients and their families receive appropriate timely information in relation to an incident that may have occurred in relation to their care. </p>  <p>  The Patient Safety (Notifiable Patient Safety Incidents) Bill 2019 will also bring private hospitals within the remit of the Health Act 2007. The relevant provisions extend the remit of the Health Information and Quality Authority, allowing it to set standards for the operation of private hospitals, to monitor compliance with them and to undertake inspections and investigations as required. The Bill also contains provisions to support clinical audit within the health service.</p>  <p>  The Bill was introduced into D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on the 12 December 2019 and passed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il at that time.  The Bill is a Programme for Government commitment and is expected to go to D&aacute;il Committee stage in the near future, after which it will be progressed to D&aacute;il Report Stage and through all Stages in the  Seanad.</p>  <p>  The Patient Safety (Notifiable Patient Safety Incidents) Bill 2019 is part of the broader programme of legislative and policy initiatives to improve the ability of the health service to anticipate, identify, and respond to patient safety issues, and to improve the quality and safety of health services for patients. Creating a culture of open disclosure and learning from the things that go wrong is the bedrock of making services safer.</p></reply>

The plan proposes ambitious additional activity levels which will work to reduce the number of children waiting for spinal orthopaedic procedures (scoliosis and spina bifida) by year end.</p>  <p>  This latest initiative is further evidence of this Government&rsquo;s commitment to address the issues facing these children. Both current and capital funding has been provided to a value of &euro;19 million in 2022 to support this initiative.</p>  <p>  In relation to the funding of this initiative, all capital funding, by its nature, is on a once-off basis. In terms of revenue costs, the &euro;4.7 million in funding for 24 additional beds and 2 additional critical care beds has been provided to CHI since 2021 as part of its base allocation on a recurring basis. The balance of funding is sourced from the 2022 Access to Care fund, which as the Deputy will be aware is allocated annually, and therefore is once off for 2022. The commitment to fund the activities in this plan, and the associated requirement to ensure continued funding for the staffing needs of this initiative, will mean that securing recurring funding for these positions will be prioritised as part of the 2023 Estimates and Budget process.</p></reply>

This work is being undertaken through the EU Steering Group on Health Promotion, Disease Prevention and Management of Non-Communicable Diseases (SGPP) Subgroup on Cancer, which includes representation from Ireland. The Department of Health will closely monitor any developments at the SGPP Subgroup on Cancer regarding this issue, and will liaise with other Government departments as required.</p>  <p>  The Irish Cancer Society Report also calls for the Government to ensure additional capacity, resources and funding for the National Cancer Registry of Ireland (NCRI). The Department of Health continues to engage closely with the NCRI to ensure it has the resources to effectively address its core functions, while expanding the cancer patient data it collects and ensuring a focus on increasing and optimising the uses of available data to drive improvements in cancer care for patients, as recommended in the National Cancer Strategy 2017-2026.</p>  <p>  Through the continued implementation of the National Cancer Strategy and by working together, with EU Member States, the European Commission and cancer organisations across the EU, we can achieve the aims of Europe&rsquo;s Beating Cancer Plan, to the ultimate benefit of patients and their families.</p></reply>

This is because UK Forest Commission have surveyed and continue to survey and found it to be free from Protected Zone (PZ)  bark beetles. This roundwood must be accompanied by a Phytosanitary Certificate from the UK authorities with a declaration of pests freedom. No other area of GB outside the PFA or Europe can deliver this pest freedom status, hence such coniferous roundwood logs with bark are not imported from these locations.</p><p>Before 1<sup>st</sup>January 2021 these logs from the PFA in Scotland were not subject to mandatory notification and import control. This became a requirement as a result of Brexit which is why we have figures for 2021.  In anticipation and for Brexit planning purposes detailed figures were gathered and retained for 2020 and part of 2019.</p><p>There has been a significant reduction in log imports over the last few months mainly as a result of increased log supply in Ireland.  Felling licences issued for over 8.4 million cubic metres of timber in 2021 and to date in 2022 felling licences for over 1.7 million cubic metres have issued.  </p><p><b>log imports into Ireland (All from PFA in Scotland)  </b> <table>    <tr>       <th>-</th>       <th>2019</th>       <th></th>       <th>2020</th>       <th></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td>No. of imports</td>       <td>Total tonnage</td>       <td>No. of imports</td>       <td>Total tonnage</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>January</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td>1 </td>       <td>2,300 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>February</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td>2 </td>       <td>4,990 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>March</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td>3 </td>       <td>6,800 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>April</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td>4 </td>       <td>5,167 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>May</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td>4 </td>       <td>7,238 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>June</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td>3 </td>       <td>8,350 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>July</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td>6 </td>       <td>8,260 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>August</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td>5 </td>       <td>7,680 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>September</td>       <td>5 </td>       <td>7,850 </td>       <td>8 </td>       <td>13,925 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>October</td>       <td>4 </td>       <td>7,150 </td>       <td>13 </td>       <td>19,850 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>November</td>       <td>2 </td>       <td>4,500 </td>       <td>14 </td>       <td>25,392 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>December</td>       <td>2 </td>       <td>1,480 </td>       <td>10 </td>       <td>15,898 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p><b>log imports into Ireland (All from PFA in Scotland)</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>-</th>       <th>2021</th>       <th></th>       <th>2022</th>       <th></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td>No. of imports</td>       <td>Total tonnage</td>       <td>No. of imports</td>       <td>Total tonnage</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>January</td>       <td>13 </td>       <td>21,487 </td>       <td>3 </td>       <td>3,400 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>February</td>       <td>7 </td>       <td>10,200 </td>       <td>6 </td>       <td>10,700 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>March</td>       <td>18 </td>       <td>28,000 </td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>April</td>       <td>13 </td>       <td>22,050 </td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>May</td>       <td>11 </td>       <td>22,200 </td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>June</td>       <td>13 </td>       <td>20,850 </td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>July</td>       <td>14 </td>       <td>20,900 </td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>August</td>       <td>12 </td>       <td>20,050 </td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>September</td>       <td>13 </td>       <td>19,700 </td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>October</td>       <td>8 </td>       <td>15,200 </td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>November</td>       <td>8 </td>       <td>14,050 </td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>December</td>       <td>5 </td>       <td>7,700 </td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

However, the Commission has consistently directed Member States instead to deminimis and other state aids. </p><p>A number of measures have been brought forward to support the Irish pig sector including intensification of promotion activity by Bord Bia and advisory supports from Teagasc. </p><p>There is also support for access to finance through the Brexit Impact Loan Scheme and the COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme, both of which are financed by my Department in partnership with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and can be used for working capital.</p><p>I announced on 22nd February, the Pig Exceptional Payment Scheme (PEPS) which is a &euro;7 million support scheme for commercial pig farmers who produced 200 or more pigs in 2021.

The VFI will pursue an initiative supporting rural pubs to re-imagine their existing business and introduce new service offerings with a view to developing a more sustainable and viable operating model.   I expect to announce further details of this pilot shortly.</p></reply>

This will include towns that are at different stages of the TCF process who will be supported through the different funding streams underpinning the policy.</p><p>A central objective of TCF is to assist those towns that in the past have not had sufficient capacity to shape their own development. The Pathfinder Towns will help to inform the approach to supporting towns that are at an earlier stage in the TCF process and particularly those towns which have not historically been in a position to leverage investment opportunities.</p><p>On 9 December 2021 I announced &euro;2.6 million in funding to deliver Town Centre First Plans in 26 pathfinder towns across the country. The list of the 26 towns are shown in Table 1 below.  The &euro;2.6 million funding will support each local authority, working with a collaborative Town Team, to develop a bespoke Town Centre First plan to guide the development of each town. As part of the initiative, each local authority will be provided with &euro;100,000 to support the development of a unique vision for the town which will also outline specific interventions required to deliver on this vision. </p><p>Other pathfinder towns will be selected as the TCF policy is rolled out and will be identified in collaboration with the new Town Centre First National Office.</p><p>Table 1:<b>Towns selected for funding under the Masterplan Initiative 2021</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>County </th>       <th>Town</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Carlow</td>       <td>Tullow</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cavan</td>       <td>Bailieborough</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Clare</td>       <td>Sixmilebridge</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork</td>       <td>Skibbereen</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Donegal</td>       <td>Milford </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Fingal</td>       <td>Lusk</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway</td>       <td>Gort</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerry</td>       <td>Milltown</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare</td>       <td>Clane</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilkenny</td>       <td>Urlingford </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Laois</td>       <td>Rathdowney</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Leitrim</td>       <td>Carrick On Shannon</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick</td>       <td>Abbeyfeale</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Longford</td>       <td>Longford   Town</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth</td>       <td>Dunleer</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mayo</td>       <td>Killala </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Meath</td>       <td>Enfield</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Monaghan</td>       <td>Carrickmacross</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Offaly</td>       <td>Clara</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Roscommon</td>       <td>Strokestown</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Sligo</td>       <td>Tubbercurry</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Tipperary</td>       <td>Roscrea</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Waterford</td>       <td>Portlaw</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Westmeath</td>       <td>Moate</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wexford</td>       <td>New Ross</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wicklow</td>       <td>Blessington</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>
