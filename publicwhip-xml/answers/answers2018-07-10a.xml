He was accompanied by Commissioner Hogan and Michel Barnier, the EU&rsquo;s Chief Brexit Negotiator. </p><p>At our meeting we discussed the state of play in the Brexit negotiations in advance of the June European Council.</p><p>Mr. Barnier reiterated his assessment that serious divergences remain between the EU and the UK on how to resolve the border issue.</p><p>As the EU side has made clear, the Withdrawal Agreement must contain a fully operational backstop so there can be no hard border on this island in the future, whatever circumstances prevail. </p><p>For there to be a Withdrawal Agreement &ndash; and a period of transition &ndash; there has to be full agreement on all issues. </p><p>As we both made clear, there is now an urgent need to intensify efforts if we are to conclude a Withdrawal Agreement and have it operational by the time the UK leaves the EU next March.</p><p>I, of course, took the opportunity to convey my sincere appreciation to both President Juncker and Michel Barnier for their unwavering support and solidarity throughout the negotiations - as the President reiterated when he spoke in this Chamber.  It is clear that EU partners remain absolutely steadfast in their support around the Irish issues.</p><p>We also discussed a number of other important EU issues ahead of the June European Council, including migration. </p><p>While noting Ireland was less directly affected than other Member States, I made clear our wish to play our part  in developing a comprehensive EU approach, based on ensuring strong external borders; solidarity between Member States; and working in partnership with countries of origin, including in Africa, to underpin political and economic development, so that people can enjoy better lives and opportunities in their home countries.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-07-10a.20.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1351" speakername="John Halligan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018071000065#WRC00400"><p>As Minister, I am fully focused on ensuring that we are in a position to make the most of any potential Brexit-related opportunities.  I am also fully confident that my Department and the enterprise agencies under my remit are doing everything they can to capitalise on any opportunities that Brexit presents.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2018 a further additional &euro;3m in pay funding was provided to the enterprise agencies to support recruitment and assist in their response to the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the European Union.  That additional &euro;3 million will support the recruitment of 40-50 staff across the Department and its Agencies to meet the Brexit challenge.  This brings the number of new Brexit related staff posts to around 100 in the last two years and demonstrates the Department&rsquo;s determination to ensure that it, together with its Offices and Agencies, are sufficiently resourced to meet the Brexit challenge.</p>  <p>  As per its Brexit-strategy, IDA Ireland has continued to engage with its clients - supported by a targeted marketing campaign - to highlight Ireland&rsquo;s advantages in a post-Brexit context.  The reasons why companies invest in Ireland are well-known: the availability of talent, the ease of doing business, a competitive and transparent taxation regime, positive demographics, a common law system and, critically, Ireland&rsquo;s continued access to EU markets.  This approach has worked well as IDA Ireland has secured a substantial number of Brexit-related investments in 2017 and 2018.  </p>  <p>  The IDA&rsquo;s mid-year results for 2018 clearly indicate that we can continue to rely on the selling points that make investing in Ireland so attractive in the first place.  In fact, the Agency has indicated that in excess of 40 companies across the Financial Services, Life Sciences, Technology and Engineering sectors have chosen Ireland as a result of Brexit.  I can state with certainty that as Brexit negotiations intensify in the time ahead, IDA Ireland will be continuing its efforts to attract mobile investment by highlighting Ireland&rsquo;s suitability as a location for international business and by constantly engaging with clients across its entire portfolio. </p>  <p>  In addition, IDA Ireland continues to work on ensuring that the Agency&rsquo;s strategy is fit for purpose in light of Brexit.  In 2018, the agency has reorganised its European footprint, with the United Kingdom now being treated as a separate territory from the rest of Europe and continental European business being managed from the Frankfurt office. </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland also provides a range of supports that exist to help companies plan for both the opportunities and risks that Brexit poses.  While the outcome of the Brexit negotiations remains uncertain, Enterprise Ireland is actively supporting Irish companies to respond to the challenges and opportunities posed by Brexit and to take the necessary steps to ensure they are more innovative, competitive and market diversified to tackle the challenges ahead. </p>  <p>  Budget 2018 also contained some important pro-business measures to help companies compete in the face of &lsquo;Brexit&rsquo; including the &euro;300m Brexit Loan Scheme which will provide affordable financing to Irish businesses that are either currently impacted by Brexit or will be in the future.  It will be open to all trading SMEs and large firms employing less than 500 people.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-07-10a.23.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1272" speakername="Pat Breen" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018071000065#WRC00700"><p>I understand that the dispute at the company referred to by the deputy relates to certain terms and conditions of employment, including that of pay and contractual security which the trade union Mandate is seeking to negotiate on behalf of its members.</p>  <p>  At the outset, I must emphasise that Ireland&rsquo;s system of industrial relations is, essentially, voluntary in nature and responsibility for the resolution of industrial disputes between employers and workers, rests with the employer, the workers and their representatives.  </p>  <p>  For its part, the State provides the industrial relations dispute settlement mechanisms i.e. the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court, to support parties in their efforts to resolve their differences.  These bodies are independent in the delivery of their quasi-judicial functions, in which I as Minister have no role.  This approach has served Ireland well over the years and in a large number of high profile disputes.  </p>  <p>  This particular dispute was the subject of a Labour Court recommendation last April which urged the parties to engage with each other in order to seek agreement in relation to the matters at issue.  Furthermore, the Court recommended that if, following such engagement, matters remained unresolved, the parties should avail of the services of the Workplace Relations Commission and the Court in furthering efforts to secure resolution.  In line with the voluntary nature of industrial relations in Ireland, recommendations of the Labour Court made under industrial relations legislation are not binding on the parties.</p>  <p>  I understand it is the company's position that it does not recognise trade unions but has in place an internal mechanism for employee engagement.  Under Irish law there is no obligation on employers to recognise trade unions.  However, successive Governments have committed to the concept of collective bargaining and to this end, legislation was introduced in 2015 in the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2015 to strengthen the ability of workers to collectively engage with employers. </p>  <p>  The 2015 legislation allows for application to be made to the Labour Court to examine the issue of independence of internal employee engagement mechanisms in instances where it is contested that such mechanism is not genuinely independent of the employer.  If the Court finds that the mechanism is not independent it can then proceed to hear the dispute at issue.   </p>  <p>  In conclusion, I would like to emphasise the need for workers and employers to make every effort to reach a resolution in this dispute which presents a significant inconvenience for members of the public. The dispute handling mechanisms of the State are of course willing, where possible, to assist the parties in coming to a resolution. This will ensure a positive outcome for the employees, the company and the customers of the company.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-07-10a.26.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1249" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018071000065#WRC01000"><p>A key focus of the Government's enterprise strategy, as set out in Enterprise 2025 Renewed, which I published earlier this year, is to ensure we continue to enhance the business environment so that it is conducive to entrepreneurship, start-up and growth of Irish-own enterprises across all strands of the economy and society. </p>  <p>  The most recent Global Entrepreneurship Monitor showed that Ireland&rsquo;s rate of entrepreneurship among women is the 7th highest in Europe.  However, men are still twice as likely to be entrepreneurs as women in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Female founders have traditionally been underrepresented in start-ups, and that is why my Department and its agencies have a range of initiatives aimed at supporting women to start and scale businesses that provide quality jobs throughout the country. </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland is committed to supporting cohorts of ambitious, capable founders, and placing them on faster growth trajectories.  Research undertaken by Enterprise Ireland in 2012 found that there were a number of key inhibitors to female entrepreneurship rates, and it developed an integrated strategy to address these issues and increase the number of female-founded start-ups in Ireland.</p>  <p>  One of the key ways in which Enterprise Ireland supports female entrepreneurship is through its dedicated Competitive Start Funds.  The first Competitive Start Fund for Female Entrepreneurs was launched in 2012, and since then there have been 8 dedicated female competitive start funds.</p>  <p>  The most recent Competitive Start Fund for female entrepreneurs, which I launched earlier this year, made a total of &euro;1m funding available for up to 20 female-led companies.</p>  <p>  The demand is there. Enterprise Ireland received over 100 funding applications for this Fund, and the final selection for funding is currently taking place.  </p>  <p>  In 2017, 46 per cent of all companies who received CSF investment from Enterprise Ireland were female founded.</p>  <p>  Every year Enterprise Ireland holds a Fuelling Ambition Roadshow, which aims to encourage, support and drive the ambition of female entrepreneurs (existing and new).  A total of 7 roadshow events were held in 2018, attended by c600 female entrepreneurs, across the country. </p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) are also actively engaged in encouraging and inspiring an increase in female-led businesses through initiatives such as the annual National Women&rsquo;s Enterprise Day and the Women in Business Networks.  In addition, 61% of participants attending LEO training programmes in 2017 were female with 46% of the LEO mentoring participants female.</p>  <p>  Another key Enterprise Ireland supported initiative is the 'Going for Growth' programme.  Currently in its 10th cycle, the initiative supports female entrepreneurs who have been trading for at least two years and are strongly focused on growth.  Feedback shows that participants&rsquo; businesses experienced a growth in sales over the 9th cycle of over &euro;20million and employment rose by 17.5%.</p>  <p>  We are making progress and I feel confident that we can achieve further increases in the future.</p></reply>

It will include the following elements: </p><p>1.  Research on Current Issues in the Waste Sector; </p><p>2.  An Economic Assessment of the Household Waste Collection Market; </p><p>3.  An Overview of Waste Collection in Other Countries; and </p><p>4.  Recommendations</p><p>To date, I am informed that the CCPC has carried out an extensive series of interviews and meetings with over 20 relevant stakeholders in the waste market including the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and other entities with a policy or a regulatory role (at national or regional level), academics, representative groups and individual household waste collection operators. </p><p>In addition, it has also conducted desk based research, issued a request for information from over 40 domestic operators, commissioned consumer research and an external econometric analysis, and engaged with other national competition agencies on how waste markets operate in their jurisdictions. The CCPC has also undertaken a public consultation to collect information on the household waste collection market and to gather the views of stakeholders in a formal capacity.</p><p>I understand this exercise is still underway and it is anticipated that the report will be finalised over the summer months.  The issue of publication will be considered at that stage.</p></reply>

The average time to assess a personal injury claim was 7.3 months compared to several years if litigation is involved.</p>  <p>  The average PIAB award in 2017 was &euro;24,879. Award values vary depending on the nature and severity of cases received.  This demonstrates that the PIAB model continues to deliver major benefits, by providing a low-cost, quick and fair option in injury compensation.  </p>  <p>  The General Scheme addresses issues highlighted in submissions made to the public consultation held in 2014, by the then Minister, on the operation of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Acts 2003 and 2007.  Issues highlighted by the Cost of Insurance Working Group Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance published in January 2017 and the Report of the Rising Costs of Motor Insurance published by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach are also addressed.</p>  <p>  This is a technical and complex piece of legislation and it required careful consideration during drafting in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General.  </p>  <p>  Drafting of the Bill has been finalised by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and I will shortly seek Government approval for publication of the Bill.</p>  <p>  The PIAB model is a positive one for society as a whole as it delivers compensation more quickly, with lower costs.  Therefore, encouraging more claimants to finalise their cases through the PIAB model rather than resorting to litigation should lead to cost savings in the claims environment that will benefit consumers and businesses.</p></reply>

Earlier this year, Indian-owned Leetha Industries announced that it is to establish a manufacturing and supply operation called Red Seal Cups Ltd. in Ireland.  This will create over 100 jobs in Longford over the next three years.  The Avery Dennison Corporation is also planning a significant expansion of its Finesse Medical manufacturing facility in the County.  Announcements like these are a great vote of confidence in what the Midlands has to offer for FDI clients.  The IDA actively engages with its existing client base to support them in growing their business to retain jobs and expand their existing footprint in the region.</p>  <p>  The IDA is involved in a number of initiatives to attract additional FDI to Westmeath and Longford, including a focused digital marketing campaign.  This is designed to market the Midlands Region to potential investors by showcasing locations such as Westmeath and Longford.  The Agency also maintains regular engagement with the Chief Executives of Longford, Westmeath, Laois and Offaly County Councils to attract further investment to the region. </p>  <p>  FDI, of course, represents only one part of our wider efforts to generate economic growth in regional locations. Indigenous enterprise also plays a crucial role in creating employment opportunities.  Enterprise Ireland (EI) supports companies in every county of Ireland to start and scale, innovate and remain competitive on international markets. </p>  <p>  I am pleased to say that total employment in EI supported companies in Co. Westmeath now stands at 3,741, an increase of 30% since 2012. Total employment in EI supported companies in Co. Longford now stands at 2,970, an increase of 43.5% since 2012.  These numbers clearly reflect the valuable contribution of EI client companies to our economy, particularly from a regional perspective.</p>  <p>  We have made progress in creating opportunities in Longford and Westmeath but we are determined to achieve more.  We are working hard, across Government, to further unlock the economic potential of the region.  The Enterprise Agencies remain pivotal to this and they continue to engage with their clients, and with one another, to create jobs and source new investment for the Midlands region.</p></reply>

Were a deal to be concluded between the EU and Mercosur, the relevant text would proceed to so-called &ldquo;legal scrubbing&rdquo;, and translation, a process which can take between several months and up to two years to complete.  </p>  <p>  Insofar as ratification is concerned, some EU trade agreements are 'EU-only' meaning that all the policy areas they cover fall under the sole responsibility of the EU institutions.  Other agreements may be presented as 'mixed' where they have areas of shared responsibility between the EU and Member States.  Ratification requirements differ between the two categories.  Only at the conclusion of negotiations and when the Commission presents an Agreement to Council can an agreement be determined definitely as being 'EU-only' or &lsquo;mixed&rsquo;.  The ratification process regarding individual trade agreements must be taken on a case-by-case basis depending on the issues comprehended in the final agreement.  Where appropriate, my Department seeks legal advice on the appropriate ratification process to follow in each case.</p>  <p>  Mixed agreements enter into force only once each individual EU Member State has approved it in line with its own national procedures.  As this process may take several years, the Council can decide to provisionally apply an agreement ('provisional application').  Provisional Application generally applies to those parts of the agreement over which the EU has exclusive competence.  Provisional Application requires the agreement by Council and ratification by the European Parliament. </p>  <p>  For any EU/Mercosur Free Trade Agreement, I am not in a position to be definitive about the ratification process that will apply, nor any timeframes, until any Agreement is finalised and its scope and terms have been examined.</p></reply>

They are agrifood, pharma-chemicals, engineering and machinery, wholesale and retail and air transport.  Around 80% of the employment in these sectors is outside the Dublin region. As noted in the study, Brexit will therefore be felt more in rural parts of the country where these sectors dominate, particularly agrifood. </p>  <p>My Department also funded the InterTradeIreland/ ESR study Implications of Brexit for Trade between Ireland and Northern Ireland.    The report assesses the particular impacts that the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU could have on North-South trade in goods and models how the impact of Brexit could be especially acute in the border region.</p>  <p>Furthermore, my Department jointly with Deloitte, undertook a detailed engagement with 170 regionally-dispersed firms as part of our analysis into &ldquo;Firm-Level Impacts of Brexit on Most Exposed Sectors&rdquo;.     The study found that firms are likely to be affected differently both across different sectors and within individual sectors. Therefore, the report concludes that firm-level responses are likely to be the most effective means of preparing businesses for Brexit. </p>  <p>The Regional Action Plans for Jobs   are central to my Department&rsquo;s targeted approach to boosting regional employment. While progress has been very good, it is clear that we also have new challenges since the Regional Action Plan for Jobs process started, not least Brexit. In this context I have asked the Implementation Committees in each region to lead a process to Refresh and Refocus their Plans to 2020 which will focus on building each region&rsquo;s own competitive advantage, develop areas that are already strong, examine vulnerabilities and take account of the challenges which Brexit presents. </p>  <p>To support the ambition, goals and implementation of the Regional Action Plans for Jobs, the Regional Enterprise Development Fund, worth &euro;60 million, was launched in May 2017.  The objective of the Fund is to support the development and implementation of collaborative and innovative projects to strengthen regional enterprise development potential.</p></reply>

The last three years has seen 30,000 new FDI jobs created outside Dublin. </p>  <p>  The availability of marketable serviced land and buildings in advance of demand is a key element in the IDA's ability to compete for mobile FDI.  Not only does such a supply of properties help the Agency to secure job-rich investment but it also allows projects to begin at an earlier date by diminishing many difficulties associated with land acquisition, planning and construction. It is therefore an important means by which the IDA can encourage and attract new investors to Ireland, particularly to the regions. </p>  <p>  I understand that IDA Ireland owns 30 properties across the country.  Of these, 13 are currently occupied by IDA clients with a further 17 properties available for prospective or existing investors.  </p>  <p>  As regards site visits, they remain an important tool through which investors can be encouraged to invest in regional areas and the IDA always does its utmost to ensure that overseas firms consider all potential locations when visiting Ireland.  This is in line with the priority that has been placed on investment outside of our main cities, with the Agency continuing to target an increase in investment of 30% to 40% in every region of the country by the end of its current strategy in 2019.</p>  <p>  While site visits can help highlight the benefits of the regions to the IDA's client companies, we need to remember that the final decision as to where to invest always rests with the firm concerned.  It is also the case that some companies will only consider investing in urban areas, for a variety of commercial reasons.  It should not be forgotten either that site visit activity does not necessarily reflect investment potential, as at least 70% of all new FDI comes from existing IDA client companies.</p>  <p>  Excluding Dublin, there has been a total of 66 site visits across Ireland in the first three months of 2018.  The IDA will continue to bring new and existing clients to potential investment locations all over the country in the time ahead.</p></reply>

These bodies are independent in the delivery of their quasi-judicial functions, in which I as Minister have no role.  This approach has served Ireland well over the years and in a large number of high profile disputes. </p>  <p>  Under Irish law there is no obligation on employers to recognise trade unions and there are no plans to bring forward legislation to provide for mandatory trade union recognition. </p>  <p>  While Ireland&rsquo;s system of industrial relations is essentially voluntary in nature, it has been the consistent policy of successive Irish Governments to promote collective bargaining through the laws of this country and through the development of an institutional framework supportive of a voluntary system of industrial relations that is premised upon freedom of contract and freedom of association. </p>  <p>  There is an extensive range of statutory provisions designed to back up the voluntary bargaining process.  The freedom of association and the right to organise and bargain collectively are also guaranteed in a number of international instruments which the State has ratified and which it is, therefore, bound to uphold under international law.  </p>  <p>  The most recent legislation to facilitate this is the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2015 which came into effect on 1 August 2015 and was the result of an in-depth consultation with stakeholders, including employer and worker representatives, and a review of the experience of the operation of the existing legislative framework.  </p>  <p>  The 2015 Act makes provision, in instances where employers engage in collective bargaining with an &lsquo;internal excepted body&rsquo; as opposed to a trade union, for a referral to be made to the Labour Court to establish if internal bargaining bodies are genuinely independent of their employer.  If the Court finds that the mechanism is not independent it can then proceed to hear the dispute at issue.</p></reply>

My Department and its agencies are working hard to ensure that all potentially impacted firms are taking the necessary steps to mitigate the risks and take advantage of potential opportunities resulting from Brexit.</p>  <p>  My Department is engaged in helping SMEs prepare to withstand all Brexit scenarios, including a hard Brexit scenario.  Encouraging companies to take action to identify their individual areas of exposure and to take positive steps to address them will build strong resilient businesses that can prosper in the face of difficult economic circumstances. </p>  <p>  A major initiative that my Department is advancing is the &euro;300 million Brexit Loan Scheme, under which accessible finance is made available to businesses at favourable terms.  There has been a steady stream of applications under this scheme.</p>  <p>  Work on the development of a Business Finance Advisory Hub continues, to strengthen financial management and strategic planning of Irish SMEs.  It will assist businesses to make more informed financial decisions, building on existing supports available from bodies such as Enterprise Ireland (EI) and Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs). </p>  <p>  I am confident that the agencies under my remit have the supports available to enable companies to both consolidate market share within the UK, and become more resilient by broadening their exports to other international markets.</p>  <p>  EI has an extensive range of supports to encourage clients to become more competitive, innovative and to diversify export markets, including: </p>  <p>  - Brexit Scorecard: This interactive online platform can be used by all Irish companies to self-assess their exposure to Brexit under six business pillars.  The Scorecard generates an immediate report which contains suggested actions and resources, and information on events for companies to attend, to prepare for Brexit. </p>  <p>  - Be Prepared Grant: This grant offers SME clients a grant of up to &euro;5,000 to assist them in preparing an action plan for economic shocks such as Brexit.  The grant can be used to help cover consultancy, travel and travel expenses associated with researching the direction of their action plan. </p>  <p>  - Brexit Advisory Clinics: Enterprise Ireland held five Brexit Advisory Clinics over the past few months in Portlaoise, Mayo, Cavan, Cork and last month in Dublin&rsquo;s Aviva Stadium.  The purpose of these Clinics is to support companies affected by Brexit to take immediate action to address their exposure.  More Clinics are due to take place throughout the year. </p>  <p>  - Brexit 'Act On' Programme:  This funding is to support the engagement of a consultant to draw up a report with tailored recommendations to help clients address weaknesses and become more resilient.</p>  <p>  - Strategic Consultancy Grant:  This grant helps client companies to hire a strategic consultant for a set period to assist the company to develop and implement significant strategic initiatives. </p>  <p>  In addition, EI is implementing extensive trade mission and event schedules focussed on further developing in-market expertise and networks, new sectorial opportunities and stimulating demand for Irish products and services through international marketing campaigns.  In 2017, EI launched a new Eurozone Strategy to increase exports to Eurozone countries by 50% by 2020.</p>  <p>  The suite of LEO Brexit supports available to micro and small businesses through the 31 LEOs nationwide include: </p>  <p>  - A &lsquo;Technical Assistance for Micro-enterprises&rsquo; grant designed to support qualifying businesses to diversify into new markets, enabling companies to explore and develop new market opportunities; </p>  <p>  - Rollout of &lsquo;Lean for Micro&rsquo; nationwide which will make small businesses more efficient and competitive; </p>  <p>  - Tailored mentoring to address Brexit related business challenges; </p>  <p>  - Targeted training on specific Brexit challenges, including financial aspects and capability building in innovation, competitiveness and opportunity diagnosis; and </p>  <p>  - Continued information, advice and guidance across all 31 LEOs and regionally. </p>  <p>   The additional Brexit supports on offer through the LEOs are focused on capability building, market diversification, driving increased competitiveness, and promoting innovation so that LEO client companies can better cope with the challenges arising on foot of Brexit and to explore any opportunities presented. </p>  <p>  InterTrade Ireland (ITI), has also been very active in assisting businesses address the challenges that Brexit may present for future cross-border commerce.  A series of information and awareness raising events have been underway in towns across both North and South over recent months.  ITI is also rolling out a &lsquo;Start to Plan&rsquo; readiness voucher scheme, which enables companies to purchase specialist advice in areas such as customs, tax, tariff and non-tariff barriers, legal and labour mobility issues. </p>  <p>  I also launched the second call of the Regional Enterprise Development Fund, which is aimed at supporting the development and implementation of collaborative and innovative projects that can sustain and add to employment at a national, regional and county level.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that across a range of supports and initiatives, work of my Department is focused on supporting businesses throughout the country to withstand current challenges and succeed into the future.  I feel, therefore, that all our efforts will put Ireland in a strong position in the event of a hard Brexit scenario.</p></reply>

In Co. Kildare, 9,134 people were employed in Enterprise Ireland supported companies, representing an increase of 5% on 2016. </p><p>Underpinning Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s 2017 employment results are a range of activities and supports to help companies in Kildare to innovate and remain competitive in international markets, now and into the future.  In the period 2015 - 2017 Enterprise Ireland paid &euro;11.7million to client companies in Kildare to support companies to be innovative, improve competitiveness and to diversify their global footprint.  </p><p>Enterprise Ireland is working with established client companies in Kildare through teams of sectorial focused development advisors.  Using a company led diagnostic approach, the agency can tailor a support package to the company&rsquo;s growth potential based on their ambition, capability and need. </p><p>In addition to direct client support, Enterprise Ireland has funded the establishment of a national network of business innovation centres and specialist bio-incubation facilities across the Higher Education Sector including the Innovation Centre located at Maynooth University.  These internationally recognised facilities are important drivers of regional development, with the majority of companies located at these facilities remaining in their region after they have completed their incubation period. </p><p>Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s<b></b>New Frontiers Development Programme, the national entrepreneur development programme for early-stage startups, is run in partnership with 14 Institutes of Technology throughout the country.  New Frontiers Midlands &amp;amp; Mid-East Entrepreneurial Programme is run at Athlone Institute of Technology in partnership with Maynooth University and supported 13 entrepreneurs in 2017.</p><p>In late 2017 , under the Regional Enterprise Development Fund, over &euro;11m was approved for projects in the Eastern and Midlands region including funding to the County Kildare Community Network Company CLG. </p><p>The Technology Centre Programme is a joint initiative between Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland allowing Irish companies and multinationals to work together in these centres including the Innovation Value Institute (IVI) Technology Centre at Maynooth University.  These centres are resourced by highly qualified researchers associated with research institutions who are empowered to undertake market focused strategic R&amp;amp;D for the benefit of industry.</p><p>Enterprise Ireland funding has supported the establishment of Community Enterprise Centres in every county throughout the country, including three in Allenwood, Clane and Athy.  These centres provide space in a supportive environment for budding entrepreneurs and serve to help the development of entrepreneurship locally. </p><p>Brexit presents a significant challenge for Irish companies and Enterprise Ireland is seeking to build resilience within client companies to deal with any kind of Brexit.  The launch and development of a Brexit SME Scorecard, an interactive online platform which can be used by all Irish companies to self-assess their exposure to Brexit under six business pillars.  There have been 2328 engagements on the scorecard to date, with 78 Scorecards engaged with in Kildare.</p><p>The Mid East Regional Action Plan for Jobs is a key policy response for supporting employment growth in the Kildare, Meath and Wicklow. </p><p>Some 22,800 jobs have been created in the Mid East region since the initiative was launched in January 2015 while the unemployment rate in the Mid East region has fallen since then and now stands at 5.4% according to the CSO (Q1 2018).</p><p>Furthermore, Live Register numbers continue to fall in County Kildare, down from 19,368 in July 2012 to 9,427 in May 2018, a decrease of almost 10,000.  There is of course always room for improvement but the latest CSO figures are testament to the Government&rsquo;s efforts to help create jobs and reduce unemployment.</p><p>I am aware that further efforts are needed to ensure that jobs continue to be created in Kildare and in doing so, ensure that employment creation is sustainable.  To this end, the I will ensure that Enterprise Ireland will continue to work with companies in Kildare and across the region to promote job creation.</p></reply>

This commitment has been made in order to assist and provide some certainty for applicants in the planning and preparation of proposals.

This process benefits applicants in that they have a defined process and timelines, feedback on the strengths and weaknesses of their application and an opportunity to reapply in future.  It also gives the assessment panel an opportunity to assess, rank and rate these projects relative to one another and select the best for support.</p>  <p>  Operating a rolling-fund application process open all year round can be useful, where applicants can be funded once they reach a defined milestone(s), but the retention of external panel members to assess this process on a continuous basis is not feasible or practical.  </p>  <p>  This process has been defined to be the best solution to deliver this REDF funding which is transparent and above board.  It also has the advantage of providing feedback to unsuccessful applicants and assistance outside the competition period to submit stronger applications for subsequent calls.</p></reply>

My Department actively supports placing Irish artists in a more beneficial position to ensure that they can gain the most remuneration possible for their music.  New business models are currently emerging to help musicians to license their works to online platforms and ultimately it is a commercial matter for rights holders to negotiate the use of their works on any platform or media.  However, I agree that there should be a regulatory framework to help them not just in Ireland, but at an EU-wide level.</p>  <p>  On 14 September 2016, the EU Commission published a package of copyright reform proposals as part of its Digital Single Market strategy.  This included a Directive on copyright in the Digital Single Market (hereinafter the &ldquo;Copyright Directive&rdquo;).  The intention of the Directive is to craft modern copyright legislation suitable for all European citizens.  Among the Directive&rsquo;s many proposals is a provision aimed at addressing the &ldquo;value gap&rdquo;, whereby rights holders are receiving less remuneration despite the increased usage of their works (Article 13).</p>  <p>  Officials of my Department have been thoroughly engaged in negotiations since publication of this proposal and have been successful in achieving a number of amendments to address the concerns of our stakeholders.  The Copyright Directive has been discussed by EU Ambassadors and the Presidency has gained approval for a mandate to commence negotiations with the European Parliament.</p>  <p>  Negotiations on the Copyright Directive have been exhaustive and, while I appreciate the concerns that have been raised, I fully support the intention of this proposal which is vitally important to both the DSM and the digital economy.  Our focus has always been on achieving the best balance for the competing interests of all stakeholders, including digital economy actors, rights holders, and citizens.  To that end, there has been extensive engagement with stakeholders across the various issues in Ireland, Brussels, and with other EU Member States, including at Ministerial level.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to engage positively with the negotiations on the proposal going forward to ensure that Ireland can benefit from its many merits, particularly with regard to the value gap, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

My Department and its agencies are working hard to ensure that all potentially impacted firms are taking the necessary steps to mitigate the risks and take advantage of potential opportunities resulting from Brexit.</p>  <p>  My Department is engaged in helping SMEs prepare to withstand all Brexit scenarios, including a hard Brexit scenario.  Encouraging companies to take action to identify their individual areas of exposure and to take positive steps to address them will build strong resilient businesses that can prosper in the face of difficult economic circumstances. </p>  <p>  A major initiative that my Department is advancing is the &euro;300 million Brexit Loan Scheme, under which accessible finance is made available to businesses at favourable terms.  There has been a steady stream of applications under this scheme.</p>  <p>  Work on the development of a Business Finance Advisory Hub continues, to strengthen financial management and strategic planning of Irish SMEs.  It will assist businesses to make more informed financial decisions, building on existing supports available from bodies such as Enterprise Ireland (EI) and Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs). </p>  <p>  I am confident that the agencies under my remit have the supports available to enable companies to both consolidate market share within the UK, and become more resilient by broadening their exports to other international markets.</p>  <p>  EI has an extensive range of supports to encourage clients to become more competitive, innovative and to diversify export markets, including: </p>  <p>  - Brexit Scorecard:  This interactive online platform can be used by all Irish companies to self-assess their exposure to Brexit under six business pillars.  The Scorecard generates an immediate report which contains suggested actions and resources, and information on events for companies to attend, to prepare for Brexit. </p>  <p>  - Be Prepared Grant: This grant offers SME clients a grant of up to &euro;5,000 to assist them in preparing an action plan for economic shocks such as Brexit.  The grant can be used to help cover consultancy, travel and travel expenses associated with researching the direction of their action plan. </p>  <p>  - Brexit Advisory Clinics: Enterprise Ireland held five Brexit Advisory Clinics over the past few months in Portlaoise, Mayo, Cavan, Cork and last month in Dublin&rsquo;s Aviva Stadium.  The purpose of these Clinics is to support companies affected by Brexit to take immediate action to address their exposure. More Clinics are due to take place throughout the year. </p>  <p>  - Brexit 'Act On' Programme: This funding is to support the engagement of a consultant to draw up a report with tailored recommendations to help clients address weaknesses and become more resilient. </p>  <p>  - Strategic Consultancy Grant: This grant helps client companies to hire a strategic consultant for a set period to assist the company to develop and implement significant strategic initiatives. </p>  <p>  In addition, EI is implementing extensive trade mission and event schedules focussed on further developing in-market expertise and networks, new sectorial opportunities and stimulating demand for Irish products and services through international marketing campaigns. In 2017, EI launched a new Eurozone Strategy to increase exports to Eurozone countries by 50% by 2020.</p>  <p>  The suite of LEO Brexit supports available to micro and small businesses through the 31 LEOs nationwide include: </p>  <p>  - A &lsquo;Technical Assistance for Micro-enterprises&rsquo; grant designed to support qualifying businesses to diversify into new markets, enabling companies to explore and develop new market opportunities; </p>  <p>  - Rollout of &lsquo;Lean for Micro&rsquo; nationwide which will make small businesses more efficient and competitive; </p>  <p>  - Tailored mentoring to address Brexit related business challenges; </p>  <p>  - Targeted training on specific Brexit challenges, including financial aspects and capability building in innovation, competitiveness and opportunity diagnosis; and </p>  <p>  - Continued information, advice and guidance across all 31 LEOs and regionally. </p>  <p>  The additional Brexit supports on offer through the LEOs are focused on capability building, market diversification, driving increased competitiveness, and promoting innovation so that LEO client companies can better cope with the challenges arising on foot of Brexit and to explore any opportunities presented. </p>  <p>  InterTrade Ireland (ITI), has also been very active in assisting businesses address the challenges that Brexit may present for future cross-border commerce.  A series of information and awareness raising events have been underway in towns across both North and South over recent months.  ITI is also rolling out a &lsquo;Start to Plan&rsquo; readiness voucher scheme, which enables companies to purchase specialist advice in areas such as customs, tax, tariff and non-tariff barriers, legal and labour mobility issues. </p>  <p>  I also launched the second call of the Regional Enterprise Development Fund, which is aimed at supporting the development and implementation of collaborative and innovative projects that can sustain and add to employment at a national, regional and county level.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that across a range of supports and initiatives, work of my Department is focused on supporting businesses throughout the country to withstand current challenges and succeed into the future.  I feel, therefore, that all our efforts will put Ireland in a strong position in the event of a hard Brexit scenario.</p></reply>

This is critical for promoting economic resilience and long-term business growth.</p>  <p>  EI supports Irish companies that export to the Gulf States through its office network in Dubai and Abu Dhabi (UAE), Riyadh (Saudi Arabia) and Doha (Qatar).  In addition, EI employ Pathfinders in other Gulf States where it has no physical presence. EI assist suitable clients to avail of opportunities in Gulf States by working with each client one-on-one; arranging trade missions, company market visits, and in-country networking events; and by providing information and trade mission supports, as well as information and Gulf State related networking events in Ireland. EI also brings corporate buyers from the Gulf States to Ireland annually, to meet Irish producers. </p>  <p>  Over the past 12 months, EI has organised trade missions and networking events with the participation of Irish government ministers in Saudi Arabia, UAE, Oman, Kuwait and Qatar, with further events scheduled in 2018.  In addition to its own export activities, Enterprise Ireland cooperates closely with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade Embassy network, Bord Bia, Tourism Ireland, IDA and the Department of Justice as part of Team Ireland to deepen and widen Irish trade links with the Middle East and the Gulf region. </p>  <p>  EI also ran an international trade event to the annual 'Arab Health' Exhibition in Dubai in January of this year, which was led by the Minister of State for Mental Health and Older People, Jim Daly T.D.  Arab Health is the largest healthcare exhibition and conference in the Middle East and North Africa region. The trade visit focused on maximising business opportunities for the 20 EI clients exhibiting and participating.  The Gulf Food Manufacturing Exhibition in Dubai will take place later this year, where Enterprise Ireland will support exhibiting clients.  </p>  <p>  Currently, EI&rsquo;s Middle East and North Africa office network does not actively support Irish companies seeking to do business directly with Syria, due to the ongoing security situation.  Any future change in EI trade promotion activities on behalf of Irish companies in Syria will be primarily dependent on the security situation in Syria.  However, Enterprise Ireland will keep the situation under continuous review.</p></reply>

The combination of existing research strengths and this targeted funding mechanism will help to deliver jobs, exports and other economic impacts for Ireland.  This will help achieve the National Strategic Outcomes (NSOs) set out in Project Ireland 2040, in particular National Strategic Outcome 5 (A Strong Economy supported by Enterprise, Innovation and Skills).  Ultimately, the projects funded under the Disruptive Technologies Innovation Fund will create the jobs of the future.</p><p>The Fund will have a resource allocation of &euro;500 million over the period 2018-2027 consisting of an initial Exchequer allocation of &euro;180 million to 2022.  It will be competitive and see investment in the research, development and deployment of disruptive technologies and applications on a commercial basis.

The Expressions of Interest phase will run until 17th August 2018. It is envisaged that the first tranche of successful projects will be confirmed by November 2018.</p><p>The type of projects that will receive funding will be: </p><p>- Collaborative enterprise-driven partnerships that will develop, deploy and commercialise disruptive technologies to transform business; </p><p>- Impactful projects seeking at least &euro;1 million in funding over 3 years and involving enterprises and research partners; </p><p>- Projects involving SME participation; </p><p>- Focussed on &ldquo;industrial research&rdquo;.</p><p>An Expressions of Interest form and a Reference Document for applicants are available on my Department's website and I encourage potential applicants to familiarise themselves with the detail to ascertain their eligibility and to apply.

The National Development Plan 2018-2027 commits a total of almost &euro;116 billion to underpin the implementation of the National Strategic Outcomes identified in Project Ireland 2040.</p><p>Aligned with Enterprise 2025 Renewed, our aim in Ireland 2040 is to achieve sustainable full employment, to bring unemployment rates in all regions down to within 1 percentage point of the national average and to progress greater convergence in productivity in the regions.  This requires a competitive, innovative and resilient enterprise base, which is essential to provide the jobs and employment opportunities for people to live and prosper in all regions. </p><p>The priorities I and my Department will be focusing on include: </p><p>- Further expansion of Advanced Manufacturing Supports linking centres and capacity across all regions. </p><p>- The &euro;500m Disruptive Technologies Innovation Fund which I recently launched, that will allow Ireland become a leader in future technologies, through funding projects on a competitive basis. </p><p>- Strengthening Science Foundation Ireland Research Centres and Enterprise Ireland Technology Centres in higher education facilities across all regions. </p><p>- The upgrading of the Tyndall National Institute in Cork. </p><p>- Facilitating Institutes of Technologies in creating new regional &lsquo;Technology and Innovation Poles&rsquo;. </p><p>- A New Space Technologies Programme, to the benefit of firms in the regions </p><p>- New cycles of the Programme for Research in Third Level Institutions, benefitting higher education in all regions. </p><p>- New Regional Sectorial Clusters to scale and internationalise enterprise in all regions. </p><p>- Providing the appropriate types of firm level supports in the context of Brexit to enable business transformation, building firm resilience and strengthening firm competitiveness. </p><p>- Expanding the Enterprise Ireland budget for research and development. </p><p>- Expanding IDA Regional Property Programme to attract investment to regions, with a particular focus on the border region. </p><p>- The creation of a National Design Centre. </p><p>- Seed and Venture Capital Funding to support regional start-ups and growth eHubs for entrepreneurship and start-ups in every county. </p><p>- Participation in the EU High Performance Computing Programme.I </p><p>- increases in the number of researchers trained under my Department&rsquo;s research, development and innovation (RD&amp;amp;I) programmes.</p><p>To further strengthen rural economies and communities, under the Regional Action Plan for Jobs (RAPJ) process, the focus on enterprise development and employment generation in the regions has intensified through a collaborative approach involving both public and private sector stakeholders in the regions.  The RAPJ is also supported through competitive calls for enterprise initiatives under the Regional Enterprise Development Fund, with &euro;30m to be allocated in 2018.  This will continue to be rolled out in the first five years of the Plan delivered through Enterprise Ireland.</p><p>Further, my Department and the enterprise development agencies are engaging  with the three Regional Authorities on the development of their Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies (RSES) which are an important next step in implementing the Ireland 2040 plan.  These will for the first time put regional planning on a statutory basis, and will play an important role in directing investments towards realising the full potential of our regions as dynamic places to live and work.</p></reply>

These bodies are independent in the delivery of their quasi-judicial functions, in which I as Minister have no role.  This approach has served Ireland well over the years and in a large number of high profile disputes.</p>  <p>  I understand it is the company's position that it does not recognize trade unions but has in place an internal mechanism for employee engagement. Under Irish law there is no obligation on employers to recognize trade unions and there are no plans to bring forward legislation to provide for mandatory trade union recognition.  However, it has been the consistent policy of successive Irish Governments to support a voluntarist system of industrial relations with a robust statutory framework supportive of collective bargaining.</p>  <p>  The most recent legislation to facilitate this is the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2015 which came into effect on 1 August 2015 and was the result of an in-depth consultation with stakeholders, including employer and worker representatives, and a review of the experience of the operation of the existing legislative framework.</p>  <p>  The 2015 Act makes provision, in instances where employers engage in collective bargaining with an &lsquo;internal excepted body&rsquo; as opposed to a trade union, for a referral to be made to the Labour Court to establish if internal bargaining bodies are genuinely independent of their employer.  If the Court finds that the mechanism is not independent it can then proceed to hear the dispute at issue.</p>  <p>  I would like to stress the merit of both parties working closely and with the dispute handling mechanisms of the State to make every effort to reach a resolution on the issues in dispute to achieve a positive outcome for the employees, the company and the customers of the company.</p></reply>

This commitment was reiterated in Innovation 2020 in 2015.</p>  <p>  Expenditure on Innovation, Research &amp;amp; Development consists of both public and private expenditure. Gross investment in R&amp;D was &euro;3.2 billion in 2016.  This is an increase of over half a billion euro since 2011.  The estimated expenditure on R&amp;D by Government Departments in 2017 is &euro;768 million.  This represents an increase of almost &euro;40 million over 2016 and is the highest level of public expenditure on R&amp;D since 2012.</p>  <p>  A very significant part of our innovation policy has been to align public investment efforts in a manner that leverages R&amp;D activity in the enterprise sectors.  While private spending on R&amp;D slowed during the financial crisis, it has been increasing steadily since 2011.  Business Expenditure on RandD rose to &euro;2.3 billion in 2016 from &euro;1.7 billion in 2011, an increase of over 35%.</p>  <p>  Despite the fact that overall expenditure in R&amp;D has increased every year since committing to Europe 2020 targets, reaching the 2.5% of GNP intensity rate target presents a very significant challenge.  In 2016 our GNP intensity level stood at 1.43%, down from 1.91% in 2012.  Even when using GNI* as a complementary indicator (GNI* removes globalisation impacts on the Irish economy), the R&amp;D intensity rate is estimated at 1.72% for 2016.</p>  <p>  This is in part due to the strength of our economic performance and subsequent increases in GNP growth rates year on year over the last number of years.  Our challenge is to increase the level of investment in R&amp;D to keep pace with GNP growth rates, in the context of significant demands on the public purse.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the level of the R&amp;D intensity rate, I am pleased to note that Ireland performs well in international comparison tables.  In the European Innovation Scoreboard published by the European Commission in June, Ireland gained one place to be ranked 9th in the EU for innovation performance.</p>  <p>  In aggregate terms, Ireland is one of the best innovation output performers, making it one of the most efficient performers overall in terms of outputs relative to investment.</p>  <p>  However, it is clear that significant investment in RandD is a key characteristic of the top four Innovation Leaders in the EU (Sweden, Denmark, Finland and the Netherlands).  The Government must continue to prioritise investment in R&amp;D in order to realise its ambition of becoming a Global Innovation Leader.</p>  <p>  My Department is commencing an interim review of Innovation 2020 this year and this will give us the opportunity to take stock of what has been achieved under Innovation 2020 since December 2015 and will inform the development of its successor.</p></reply>

The OECD states that further analysis is required in order to achieve an agreed evidence backed solution focused on the alignment of taxing rights with the location of real substantive value creating activity.  Suffice to say that, as it stands, there is no clarity on what approach will be taken.</p>  <p>  It is therefore not possible to determine the impact on employment.  it is likely that any changes to how digital businesses are taxed will impact Ireland&rsquo;s corporation tax receipts as the changes would likely see greater taxing rights in larger countries.  The Summer Economic Statement published sets out that the Government will be prudent in its approach in 'setting aside some of the historically high levels of Corporation Tax for the purpose of creating the Rainy Day Fund'.</p>  <p>  Regardless of the final outcome, it must be borne in mind that Ireland&rsquo;s corporation tax regime will continue to be competitive while also offering long-term certainty to international business.  Crucially, our regime is underpinned by substance.  Enterprise 2025 Renewed reaffirms our focus on export-led growth that is underpinned by innovation, talent and investments in place-making.  We cannot predict the future, but we are taking action to deepen resilience across our enterprise base.  Our policies place an emphasis on strengthening the productivity performance and potential of our Irish owned enterprises.  We will continue as a country to be anticipatory and adaptive to global challenges. </p>  <p>  The continued competitiveness of our corporation tax regime, whilst important, is only one element of Ireland&rsquo;s value proposition for FDI. Business location decisions are informed by a range of factors.  Access to the EU market is, and will remain, a key factor in attracting FDI.  Other key factors involved in attracting and maintaining FDI here include: </p>  <p>  - Talent: we have a talented workforce that is hardworking, flexible and adaptable to change and a first-class education system that helps nurture the future talent required </p>  <p>  - Innovation: we have developed leading edge capabilities in R&amp;D, have a supportive regime for innovation and continuously work with enterprises to gain more investment in high value added research, development and innovation activities.</p>  <p>  - We have a proven track record of delivery for enterprise and it is easy to do business here. </p>  <p>  - We are English speaking yet can service over 140 languages from Ireland which greatly assists ICT and Financial Services companies in particular. </p>  <p>  - Through Project Ireland 2040, the National Planning Framework and National Development Plan, we will focus coordinated investments to ensure that we offer a range of compelling, dynamic and competitive locations for investment throughout Ireland. </p>  <p>  My officials and I, as well as the IDA, remain in regular contact with companies and with colleagues across Government as this area of international taxation evolves.  </p>  <p>  I will remain alert and responsive to any changes with regards to the taxation of the digital economy or indeed the overall global tax environment, working with colleagues across Government to ensure that Ireland can react and adapt when required.</p>  <p>  Background to Digital Tax developments</p>  <p>  In March 2018, the EU Commission published two proposed Directives.  The first one, a Digital Services Tax (DST), proposes a &lsquo;temporary&rsquo; solution of a 3% levy on turnover from certain digital service activities.  The thresholds for application is for a global turnover of &euro;750m and EU turnover of at least &euro;50m.  The second, "comprehensive solution", requires an overhaul of international taxation, establishing the concept of a "digital permanent establishment", allowing countries taxing rights over the digital business carried out by a company in that country, even where the company has no physical presence in the country.</p>  <p>  Prior to the publication of the Commission&rsquo;s proposals, the OECD had released their interim Report on the Digital Economy, which acknowledges the lack of consensus in the area and that further analysis is required in order to achieve an agreed evidence backed solution focussed on the alignment of taxing rights with the location of real substantive value creating activity.</p>  <p>  The Commission proposals are now being debated and it would seem that there is now a widespread acceptance among Member States that the value of these EU discussions is primarily to give impetus to the OECD debate.  This is illustrated by the recently issued joint statement from the Finance Ministers of Sweden, Denmark and Finland calling for the EU to abandon plans for a digital tax based on turnover and to support reform of digital taxation at OECD.</p>  <p>  While a number of Member States remain committed to the interim proposal of a Digital Services Tax on turnover, it should be recalled that the OECD&rsquo;s Task Force on the Digital Economy found that there is no consensus on the merit or need for such short-term measures which it is widely acknowledged can be economically damaging. </p></reply>

The IDA shares this objective and I am pleased that its results for 2017 show that 45% all jobs created last year were for locations outside Dublin.  Every region in Ireland, including the Border Region, posted net gains in jobs last year and there are now over 122,000 people employed across 649 firms in IDA client companies outside of Dublin. </p>  <p>  Employment numbers for 2018 will not be available until my Department's Annual Employment Survey is carried out in November 2018.  In the last year IDA client companies conducted two site visits to County Cavan and one site visit to County Monaghan.  Site visit activity, however, does not necessarily reflect investment potential, as at least 70% of all new FDI comes from existing IDA client companies. </p>  <p>  I want to stress that IDA Ireland is working hard to promote Counties Cavan and Monaghan to potential investors.  The Agency has a dedicated regional manager for the North East/North West Region and has an office in the Cavan Innovation and Technology Centre.  As part of its strategy to encourage investment to the area, it is focusing on sectors including agrifood, manufacturing, tourism, internationally traded services and cleantech.  The IDA also regularly engages with key stakeholders on the ground in Cavan and Monaghan, including with local authorities, public bodies, the education sector and companies from both its own client base but also from the indigenous sector.  IDA Ireland also owns lands in both Cavan and Monaghan that are being actively marketed to its clients.</p>  <p>  It is important to emphasise that foreign direct investment only forms one part of investment in regional locations.  Indigenous enterprise is responsible for a significant portion of employment growth, especially outside Dublin.  My Department and all its agencies, including Enterprise Ireland and the LEOs, work together constantly and collaboratively to ensure that jobs and investment are spread as fairly as possible across this country. </p>  <p>  The success of this Government's strategy for regional job creation is reflected in Combilift's new &euro;50 million Research and Development and Testing Centre in County Monaghan.  This new investment will create 200 jobs and is an example of a home-grown Monaghan success story.  The positive impact that Combilift has on the county, the border region and Ireland cannot be underestimated.  </p>  <p>  I am pleased to say that Enterprise Ireland supported companies employed 10,817 people in Cavan and Monaghan in 2017.  Companies supported by the LEOs in Cavan and Monaghan employ a total of 2304 people, representing a net increase of 239 over the previous year.  I think that these numbers clearly reflect the growing domestic industries which are so important to both counties.  </p>  <p>  We recognise that there is room for improvement in Cavan and Monaghan and we are working hard, across Government, to further unlock the economic potential of the region.  The Enterprise Agencies under my remit will continue to engage with their clients, and with one another, to create jobs and source new investment for the region.</p></reply>

We &ndash; all 28 EU Member States and the EU Commission &ndash; are clear that these tariffs are not justifiable on national security grounds.  We fully subscribe to the EU position that these tariffs are unjustified and in conflict with WTO rules. </p>  <p>  The EU Commission, which leads on Trade Policy for the Member States under the Treaties, and working in full consultation with the Member States, has prepared a measured, proportionate, and WTO-compatible response, which Ireland has fully supported.  These measures include the launching of proceedings by the EU against the US at the WTO, the introduction of rebalancing tariff measures by the EU and the possible imposition of provisional safeguard measures comprising import quotas or tariffs to shield EU producers from a sudden influx of steel or aluminium into the EU market which would ordinarily have been destined for the US market.</p>  <p>  EU leaders have also endorsed a positive agenda for dialogue on trade issues with the US, once the steel and aluminium tariffs against the EU are lifted.  Ireland is of the view that the EU should not negotiate under threat, and that any talks must be preceded by a permanent exemption.  The EU and its Member States are also working with other like-minded countries &ndash; such as Japan, Canada, and Mexico &ndash; to develop an agreed approach to issues of concern.  We continue, of course, to keep open the lines of communication with the US Administration and other key &lsquo;influencers&rsquo;. </p>  <p>  The US has sought to use the threat of tariffs as leverage to obtain trade concessions from the EU.  The EU&rsquo;s united approach that we are willing and able to respond when necessary in the face of such unilateral non-WTO-compliant actions is vital.  We believe the US Administration is resolute on these issues at this time and, therefore, we believe the EU must remain as resolute and stay united.  The alternative is to accept such action in breach of WTO rules as the EU understands them.  Over the past number of months, the EU has engaged with the US at all possible levels, and with other partners, to find a solution to the problem of overcapacity in the steel sector.  Indeed, I met with Secretary Ross in Washington to discuss these and related matters in May.</p>  <p>  At a national level, we continue to monitor potential impacts of the trade measures being taken by the US, as well as those being contemplated.  We remain alive to the fact that while certain actions may have limited impact at macro level, this could possibly mask individual firm level impacts.  To this end, my Department and its agencies are keeping the situation under review.  Indeed, I convened a meeting of my Enterprise Forum on Brexit and Global Challenges last week to discuss our strategy and hear, first hand, from a variety of representative bodies, their issues and concerns.</p></reply>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-07-10a.133" nospeaker="true" ><p>The cost of foreign and domestic travel expenses for me and those who travelled with me on official business since my appointment is as follows: 

June 2017 - December 2017  - &euro;118,245.32

January 2018 &ndash; end June 2018  - &euro;108,894.43

The figures above include, but are not limited to, expenditure on items such as flights, hotel accommodation, rail tickets, bus and taxi fares, ground transport and subsistence payments. The 2018 figures to date are provisional and may be subject to revision once credit notes/refunds are processed in a small number of cases. 

Not all invoices relating to travel undertaken in the first half of 2018 have been received.

I have not made any claims for subsistence allowance while on official travel abroad or within Ireland since my appointment as Taoiseach.

As Taoiseach, I regularly travel to participate in formal and informal meetings of the European Council, in Brussels and elsewhere. Particularly in the context of Brexit, I also place a high importance on engaging actively with fellow Heads of State and Government, both within the EU and more widely, to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s interests and concerns are fully appreciated and understood. 

In keeping with the Government&rsquo;s Global Ireland 2025 strategy, I also use international visits to promote Ireland&rsquo;s trade, culture, investment and enterprise interests, as well as to engage with Irish communities and to hear at first hand their experiences and concerns.

On my visits I am accompanied by a small delegation, comprising senior officials/advisers and members of my private office, according to the particular requirements of the programme. The Minister of State for European Affairs also accompanies me to meetings of the European Council and on other European engagements as appropriate, however her travel expenses are met by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.

Detailed information on foreign travel costs for myself, my Advisers and senior officials, as well as costs related to the Government Chief Whip and Ministers of State are published on a monthly basis on my Department's website, once finalised.</p></speech>

Irish Naval vessels have also been deployed to the Mediterranean since 2015.  For operational &amp;amp; security reasons, it would not be appropriate to disclose precise matters affecting Naval Service patrols. The total number of days on patrol in each of the years 2015 to 2017 and to end May 2018 is set out in the following table.</p><p><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Number of days on patrol</th></tr><tr><td>2018 (up to 31st May)</td><td>725</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>1408</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>1376</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>1204</td></tr></table></p><p>With regard to the number of personnel in the Naval Service, I would note that the current establishment for the Naval Service is 1,094. As of 31 May 2018 the effective strength of the Naval Service is 1,047. The current establishment of the Naval Service Reserve is 200. As of 31 May the effective strength of the Naval Service Reserve is 115. </p><p>The Naval Service Reserve trains its members to supplement and aid the work of the Naval Service in carrying out its wide variety of roles. As part of their training, Naval reservists receive instruction in sail training, navigation, marine communications, weapons training, fire fighting and sea survival. Subject to the availability of seagoing berths, Naval reservists also receive annual training on board Naval Service ships when on patrol, especially during summer months. </p><p>The Naval Service Reserve has carried out 29 training days on-board Naval Service Ships in 2018 to date. I understand that there are currently two Naval Service Reserve personnel on-board one of the Naval ships, with more planned to take part in training in the coming weeks. The presence of Naval Service Reserve personnel contributes positively to the overall operational capability of the ship and this situation benefits both the Naval Service and the Naval Service Reserve. I wish to place on record my great admiration for the members of the Naval Service Reserve who provide valuable support to the Naval Service both at sea and on land.</p></reply>

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade maintains and administers a roster of individuals to participate in election observation missions, organised in the main by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the European Union (EU).  I refer the Deputy to the responses to previous Parliamentary Questions on this matter, Question 167 of 4 July 2018, Questions 167 and 172 of 25 October 2017 Questions 357 and 358 of 13 December 2016, Question 243 of 2 November 2016 and Questions 335, 336 and 337 of 14 June 2016.</p>  <p>  The criteria for selection for observation missions were set out in the Information Note for Applicants accompanying the call for applications to join the Election Observation Roster established in 2013.  This is unchanged, both in selection criteria and methodology. </p>  <p>  For each election observation mission to which Ireland proposes to deploy observers, all roster members are invited to express their interest in the mission with a view to ensuring the widest possible participation.  A short-list is drawn up based on the specific criteria set out by the EU or OSCE, including relevant local and regional experience, language proficiency, gender and length of time since serving on a mission.  In many cases, the EU and OSCE also invite Member States to nominate new observers or observers with limited experience.  However, the final decision rests with the inviting body, usually the OSCE or the European Union.</p>  <p>  The recent call for Election Observers to participate in the upcoming EU EOM to Zimbabwe attracted a high volume of applications with a total of twenty four Short-Term and eight Long-Term Observer applications.  Four Long-Term Observers (LTOs) and four Short-Term Observers (STOs) were nominated from which the EU EOM selected two LTOs, one LTO reserves and two STOs, reflecting the highly competitive nature of selection.</p>  <p>  Roster members are individually notified of the outcome of the selection and in the case of EU Missions, the EU made the actual final selection.  There are important concerns about the release of personal data in terms of legislation and security to third parties. Circulating such information about individual observers would require the consent of observers and doing so without their consent may be in breach of EU General Data Protection Regulation.</p></reply>

An online passport application service was launched in March 2017 and offers the convenience of an online application system 24 hours a day, 7 days a week for Irish citizens anywhere in the world, without the need for application forms, printed photos or witnesses.  At present, the online passport application service accommodates adult passport renewal applications and passport card applications.  It is planned to extend the online application facility to other categories of renewal by the end of 2018. People who cannot or do not wish to apply online have the option of applying through their local post office. The vast majority of applications received by the Passport Service from applicants residing in the island of Ireland are submitted through Passport Express and Northern Ireland Passport Express.  Northern Ireland Passport Express allows applicants living in Northern Ireland to apply for their passport through more than 70 post offices. Applicants residing in Great Britain can post their applications directly to the Cork Passport Office.  Bearing in mind the availability of both the online and postal application channels, very few citizens living in the island of Ireland are required to travel a significant distance in order to apply for their passport. In the relatively small number of cases where citizens need to travel very urgently and do not have a valid passport, the Passport Offices in Dublin and Cork offer an appointment service.</p><p>Given the variety of options available, I am satisfied that the current needs of passport applicants are being met without the need for the establishment of a further passport office. </p><p>Advice and guidance on the above channels and other useful information on passports is available on the Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.dfa.ie/passport</i>.</p></reply>

The area is inhabited by members of the Jahalin tribe, which was expelled from its home in the Negev to the West Bank in the 1950s.  One village in particular, that of Khan Al Ahmar, home to some 181 Palestinian Bedouin, 95% of whom are Palestinian refugees, has been under threat of demolition for many years.</p>  <p>  The communities are located in a particularly sensitive part of Area C in the West Bank, an area which is critical for the viability of a future Palestinian state.  Any attempt to develop the land for illegal settlements is therefore a threat to the Two State solution.  There is no doubt that the removal of the Bedouin community to another site, to which they have not agreed, is illegal under international law.</p>  <p>  These plans have been subject to a number of legal proceedings.  Many in the international community, including Ireland, have raised our concerns on numerous occasions with the Israeli authorities.  As a result of international pressure and legal actions plans for the demolition had been delayed. However, following an Israeli Supreme Court ruling in May 2018, the Israeli authorities were given permission by that court to proceed with the demolition.</p>  <p>  The UN Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process has said that the proposed demolition in Khan Al Ahmar is contrary to international law and has called on Israel to halt the demolitions.</p>  <p>  I have made two public statements in relation to Khan al Ahmar specifically, on 31 May and most recently on 4 July, calling on the Israeli authorities to halt the demolitions of Palestinian property and the removal of Palestinian communities.  I also condemned the demolitions and the forced evictions of the neighbouring Palestinian community of Abu Nuwar.  The Irish Representative in Ramallah has visited Khan al Ahmar on a number of occasions, along with other European Missions, as a show of support for the villagers.  Ireland has also pressed strongly for EU action on this, and the EU has issued statements in Brussels and at local level calling on the Israeli authorities to reverse the decisions.</p>  <p>  Following Palestinian petitions last Thursday, the Israeli High Court has issued a temporary restraining order freezing the demolition of Khan Al Ahmar.  The Court has ordered the Israeli authorities to respond to the Palestinian claims by 11 July before making a decision whether to accept or reject the petition. </p>  <p>  I again call upon the Israeli authorities to halt the demolitions of Palestinian property and the removal of Palestinian communities.  I will continue to raise this issue in my interactions with the Israeli authorities.</p></reply>

Over 13 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance inside Syria, including 1.5 million people trapped in hard-to-reach and besieged areas.  Over 6 million people are displaced internally, and a further 5.6 million have fled to neighbouring countries and the wider region.  The Assad regime and its allies have repeatedly targeted civilians, through deliberate attacks, including chemical attacks, on civilian infrastructure such as homes, hospitals and schools, the use of &quot;starve or surrender&quot; techniques and the denial of humanitarian assistance, and forced displacement in the interest of demographic engineering. </p><p>I am particularly concerned by the recent escalation of violence in the south west, including air strikes by the regime and its allies, which forced over 300,000 civilians from their homes and destroyed critical infrastructure including several health facilities.  I am aware of the report to which Deputy Shortall refers which highlights some of the shocking attacks that have taken place in Daraa province in recent weeks.  I welcome the truce announced on Friday, but I am concerned by reports that it has already been breached.  I take this opportunity to call for an immediate cessation of hostilities, the respect of the de-escalation agreement and full humanitarian access to all Syrians in need.</p><p>I have frequently called on all regional actors, and all those involved in the Syria conflict, to show restraint and avoid any escalation, which could further undermine regional stability, as well as adding to the suffering of civilians.  I have also called on all parties with influence on the Syrian regime to exert that influence to ensure that civilians are protected, and to encourage the Syrian Government to engage fully with the UN-led peace process. </p><p>It is clear that Russia's support for the Assad regime has prolonged the suffering of the Syrian people.  Russia has also repeatedly vetoed UN Security Council resolutions on Syria, which has seriously undermined the protection of Syrian civilians.  Ireland's has communicated its concerns directly to the Russian authorities on numerous occasions.  In October 2017, I met with Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vladimir Titov.  I relayed Ireland&rsquo;s condemnation of the ongoing attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure, and the use of chemical weapons.  I called on Russia to ensure civilians are protected, and to exert its influence on other parties to the conflict to do the same.  These messages have also been relayed to the Russian Ambassador on numerous occasions at Ministerial and official level.</p><p>I am aware of the issue related to property rights to which Deputy Shortall refers.  Ireland recently co-sponsored a resolution at the UN Human Rights Council that &quot;deplores the existence and application of national legislation, in particular 'Syrian Law Number 10/2018', which would have a significant detrimental impact on freedom of movement and the right of Syrians displaced by the conflict to return to their homes in a safe, voluntary and dignified manner when the situation on the ground allows it, and calls for their repeal&quot;.</p><p>Ireland and the EU believe that there can be no military solution to the Syrian conflict.  The human suffering caused by the Syrian conflict can only be brought to an end by reaching a sustainable political solution.  Ireland and the EU fully support UN Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura in his efforts to lead political negotiations to end the conflict based on the 2012 Geneva Communique and UN Security Council resolution 2254.  The EU provides direct assistance to the UN-led Geneva peace talks and has launched, in coordination with the UN, an initiative to develop political dialogue with key actors from the region to identify common ground.</p><p>Ireland and the EU also provide political and financial support to a broad range of measures which aim to ensure full legal accountability for all war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Syria.  This includes the International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism established by the UN General Assembly to assist in the investigation and prosecution of persons responsible for the most serious crimes under international law committed in Syria, the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria established by the UN Human Rights Council, and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) Fact Finding Mission and Joint Investigative Mission with the UN.  Last month, Ireland co-sponsored the decision adopted by the States Parties to the Chemical Weapons Convention introducing an attribution mechanism to identify the perpetrators of chemical weapons attacks in Syria and elsewhere.<i></i>In addition, Ireland has consistently supported EU sanctions targeting the regime and its supporters, and will continue to do so as long as the situation on the ground justifies these measures.</p><p>The EU and its Member States constitute the largest single donor to the humanitarian response to the Syria crisis and have to date mobilised more than &euro;10.6 billion for humanitarian, stabilisation and resilience assistance inside Syria and in neighbouring countries.  The EU hosted two international donors&rsquo; conferences for Syria in April 2017 and April 2018 at which pledges totalling over &euro;9 billion were made.</p><p>Since 2012, Ireland has provided over &euro;110 million in humanitarian assistance to the humanitarian response to the Syria crisis, making this Ireland&rsquo;s largest contribution to a single crisis in recent years.  In 2017 alone, Ireland provided almost &euro;25.5 million to the humanitarian response.  At the 2018 Brussels Donor conference, Ireland pledged to contribute a further &euro;25 million in 2018 and almost &euro;22 million of this has been disbursed so far.  Through its annual contributions to the EU Institutions, Ireland also supports the EU&rsquo;s humanitarian response in Syria.</p></reply>

This information is not circulated to the full Roster as there are important concerns about the release of personal data in terms of legislation and security to third parties.

Conditions are likely to deteriorate over the coming months as the monsoon season progresses.</p>  <p>  This exodus of refugees has been accompanied by credible claims of serious human rights violations by the Myanmar Security Forces.  These include reports of widespread killing of civilians, sexual and gender based violence, arbitrary arrests, and the burning of Rohingya villages.</p>  <p>  Efforts by the international community to address this crisis have focused on responding to the humanitarian crisis, promoting a political solution and pressing for accountability for crimes and other violations of human rights abuses that have occurred.</p>  <p>  While efforts aimed at achieving accountability and a political solution to the crisis are vitally important, there is an immediate need for a coherent humanitarian response to the extremely difficult conditions faced by the huge numbers of displaced members of the Rohingya community now mainly in Bangladesh.  To this end, Ireland has actively supported the international humanitarian response to the refugee crisis and we provided direct funding of &euro;1 million in 2017 with an additional &euro;1 million allocated for 2018. Our support has focused on food, shelter, water and sanitation.  Through the Irish Aid Rapid Response facility, we have provided 37 tonnes of hygiene, sanitation and shelter kits and deployed experts in water and sanitation and humanitarian coordination on the ground.  In addition, as the 6th largest donor to the UN-administered Central Emergency Response Fund, Ireland's estimated contribution through UN pooled funding amounted to a further &euro;1 million to deliver life-saving support.</p>  <p>  In Northern Rakhine, Ireland provided funding to the Red Cross at the end of 2017 to provide cash transfers to 10,000 households and food and non-food items to 20,000 households; first health and assisted childbirth services; access to sanitation for 5,000 households; and reunification of separated families in Rakhine State.</p>  <p>  Elsewhere in Myanmar, over the course of 2017-18, Ireland is providing over &euro;3.5 million to humanitarian and development NGOs, primarily to Tr&oacute;caire for its work on gender equality, resource rights and humanitarian assistance to conflict affected communities.</p>  <p>  Humanitarian access in Northern Rakhine has been extremely limited since the start of this crisis.  Only the Red Cross Movement and to a lesser extent the World Food Programme have access.  As a result it has not been possible to provide adequate lifesaving assistance to the estimated 100,000-150,000 Rohingya that remain in Rakhine, or to other affected persons in that region.</p>  <p>  Ireland has strongly and consistently pressed for humanitarian access to Myanmar and has added its voice to that of the international community in pushing for this crucial first step in addressing the humanitarian crisis.  I repeat that call here and for the full implementation of the recommendations of the Advisory Commission on Rakhine State.  The report of the Commission urges the Government of Myanmar to ensure full and unimpeded humanitarian access &ndash; for both national and international staff &ndash; at all times and to all communities in Rakhine State.</p>  <p>  An intensive political response by the international community continues to be pursued and on 6 June, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) has been agreed between the Myanmar government, the UN High Commission for Refugees and the UN Development Programme, to establish a framework for cooperation between the parties aimed at creating conducive conditions for the voluntary, safe, dignified and sustainable repatriation of these refugees from Bangladesh to their places of origin.  The MoU also aims to help create improved and resilient livelihoods for all communities living in Rakhine State.</p>  <p>  Ireland continues to actively engage with our international partners in supporting these efforts through bilateral contacts in Myanmar and via participation in the EU and UN responses including at the recent 38th Session of the Human Rights Council.</p>  <p>  Ireland has consistently called for an independent and impartial investigation into the serious and credible allegations of human rights violations by the Myanmar security forces.  In that regard, we have strongly supported the extension of the mandates of the UN Fact Finding Mission and UN Special Rapporteur to Myanmar Yanghee Lee, and have asked the Government of Myanmar to cooperate with them and allow them access to the country.  Their work in investigating allegations, recording victim testimony and gathering other evidence, so that it can be preserved for further criminal proceedings, is crucial to ensuring full accountability.</p>  <p>  Ireland has also actively engaged in the formation of the EU&rsquo;s position including in the most recent EU Foreign Affairs Council&rsquo;s Council Conclusions on Myanmar, which were adopted on 26 February last.  These conclusions condemn the human rights violations in Myanmar, support the mandates of the Fact Finding Mission and Special Rapporteur and provide for targeted restrictive measures against senior military officers of the Myanmar armed forces responsible for these acts.  Targeted sanctions have since been put in place.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to liaise closely with EU and other international partners to press for progress in resolving this crisis including through our Embassies in Thailand and in Hanoi who are closely monitoring the situation.</p></reply>

Our candidature was first announced in 2005 and the campaign has been building since then under successive Governments.</p>  <p>  The official launch of Ireland&rsquo;s candidature took place at UN headquarters in New York on 2 July, marking the beginning of an intensive period of lobbying which will continue until the election in June 2020.  I, along with all my Cabinet colleagues, will be intensifying efforts to make Ireland&rsquo;s case. This political engagement is being supported by my Department&rsquo;s diplomatic personnel.</p>  <p>  The campaign is being coordinated at official level by a core team of staff in the UN Policy Unit, within the Political Division of my Department.  This team currently consists of 6 staff members.  While the UN Policy Unit has a number of other areas of responsibility, the UN Security Council candidature is central to its work.  One secondment is currently envisaged to assist with the implementation of the Global Ireland initiative and this will include support to the Security Council campaign among other tasks.</p>  <p>  In addition to Dublin based staff, Ireland&rsquo;s Mission to the UN in New York is also fully engaged on the election effort.  I would also stress that the campaign is a whole of Department, and whole of Government, undertaking.  Thus messaging and activities relevant to Ireland&rsquo;s candidature are being integrated into the work of all sections and offices of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, as well as that of other Government departments.</p>  <p>  Up to this point Ireland&rsquo;s UN Security Council campaign has been managed within existing resources by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  As we move forward there will be a need for additional resources to promote Ireland&rsquo;s candidature as we seek to secure support from UN Member States.</p>  <p>  Over the coming two years until the election in June 2020, Ireland will seek to build awareness of our achievements and experience globally.  This will be realised through the use of Ireland&rsquo;s diplomatic network, engagement on substantive policy issues at the UN, and the organisation of events on a range of themes which will highlight Ireland&rsquo;s track record globally and our principled commitment to the value of multilateralism.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s traditional policy of military neutrality goes hand in hand with our promotion of international peace and security, including our obligations as members of the United Nations.  This aspect of our history and track record as a UN Member State is one which has resonated across the membership of the UN since we joined in 1955 and we continue to highlight it.  The themes of empathy, partnership and independence are intended to capture Ireland&rsquo;s lived experience and outlook, giving primacy to cooperation, agreement and reasonable compromise.</p></reply>

This is a further deterioration of the terrible situation inside Syria, where over 13 million people require humanitarian assistance.  An additional 5.6 million Syrians have fled to neighbouring countries and the wider region. Ireland recognises that countries in the region have more than played their part.  Jordan as an example, is the second-largest refugee hosting country in the world when compared to the size of its population.</p>  <p>  The safety and protection of civilians inside Syria is an utmost priority and I call on all parties to respect their obligations under International Humanitarian Law.  I welcome the truce announced on Friday, but I am concerned by reports that it has already been breached.  I reiterate my call for an immediate cessation of hostilities and respect for the de-escalation agreement.</p>  <p>  Crucially, unimpeded and sustained humanitarian access must be facilitated. UN agencies and partners are providing support to the Syrian Arab Red Crescent to respond to the urgent needs of the displaced.  This includes health, water and sanitation, food, shelter and other core relief items as well as ensuring the protection of civilians. In addition, UN convoys, in cooperation with the Government of Jordan, have in recent days transported assistance for the tens of thousands of Syrians near the Jordanian border.  These efforts must be sustained and increased.</p>  <p>  Ireland has provided over &euro;110 million towards the Syria crisis since 2012.  Our humanitarian assistance responds to those in need inside Syria as well as Syrian refugees and vulnerable host communities in neighbouring countries.  During a recent visit to a refugee camp in Jordan, where I witnessed first-hand the impact of Ireland's humanitarian assistance, I announced a further &euro;1.25 million in funding for the valuable work of UNICEF and UNHCR.</p>  <p>  At the recent meeting of EU Ministers of Foreign Affairs and Development on June 25th I discussed with my EU counterparts the issue of Syrian refugees from south-western Syria and possible solutions.  Last April, the EU hosted the Brussels II Conference for Syria and the Region, which included a focus on sustaining and increasing humanitarian assistance to all those affected by the crisis in Syria, including Syrian refugees and vulnerable communities in neighbouring countries.  The EU and its Member States contributed &euro;4.8 billion out of the total &euro;6.2 billion pledged until 2020, to support both immediate assistance and longer term response.</p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to advocate for sustained European response to this crisis.  Ultimately, only a political solution to the conflict will end the suffering of the Syrian people.</p></reply>

Prior to 1 July 2013, collection of the original &euro;100 HHC was the responsibility of the Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) on behalf of the Local Authorities.  </p>  <p>  With regards to the Local Property Tax, the Government decided that a liability to the LPT should apply to all owners of residential properties with a limited number of exemptions.  As a matter of Government policy, and in order to keep the rate of the tax low, the Government agreed that reliefs should be targeted at owner occupiers where there is inability to pay the tax.  </p>  <p>  Accordingly, the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012, as amended, provides for the possibility of deferring the charge to LPT in certain circumstances to assist individuals who may have difficulty paying the tax.  To qualify for a deferral, the residential property must be occupied as a sole or main residence.  The gross income thresholds for a full deferral are &euro;15,000 for a single person and &euro;25,000 for a couple, whether married persons, civil partners or qualifying cohabitants.  A person may claim a deferral if their gross income will not, "as can reasonably be foreseen at the liability date" exceed these thresholds in that year.  </p>  <p>  A deferral of up to 50% of the LPT liability will be possible where the gross income of the liable person does not exceed &euro;25,000 for a single person or &euro;35,000 for married persons/civil partners/cohabitants.  The full and partial deferral thresholds may be increased in the case of properties occupied as a sole or main residence and subject to a mortgage.  In such cases, the gross income thresholds may be increased by 80% of the mortgage interest payments.  </p>  <p>  Where a liable person does not qualify for, or does not wish to avail of, a deferral, phased payment of LPT can be used to assist with budgeting.  The Government is aware of the difficulties facing many individuals and families, and for this reason a wide variety of methods for payment of the LPT are available from which liable persons can choose the method most suited to their individual circumstances.  The LPT can be paid by way of phased payments rather than in a single payment; it can also be paid by direct debit; or through payment service providers such as An Post TaxPay, Payzone and Omnivend.  </p>  <p>  I have initiated a review of the LPT which is looking in particular at the impact on LPT liabilities of property price developments.  It includes an examination of the outstanding recommendations of the 2015 Thornhill review of the Local Property Tax.  It is expected that the review will be completed at the end of August and that the review report will provide a number of policy choices for consideration.  The review will be informed by the desirability of achieving relative stability, both over the short and longer terms, in LPT payments of liable persons.  It also included a consultation process to enable all interested parties and individuals to submit their views on the future of the LPT.</p></reply>

This model has been successfully used in the past in establishing other entities such as the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI).  </p>  <p>  In order to ensure that the entity is established in the most efficient manner possible it is envisaged that the NTMA shall first draw upon any relevant resources, services and experience that are already available within NAMA when appointing staff to HBFI. NAMA has amassed considerable expertise in this area through the implementation of its existing residential funding programme and this will be a key asset for HBFI.  </p>  <p>  Ultimately, it will be a matter for the Board of HBFI to determine the precise staffing levels required which will be commensurate with the level of demand for lending from developers.  As a result it is not possible to estimate the number of NAMA staff that may ultimately transfer to HBFI at this time.  The transfer of any NAMA staff will depend on HBFI's requirements and the availability of appropriate resources in NAMA at that point in time.</p></reply>

The Agency announced in October 2017 that it had redeemed all of its &euro;30.2bn in Senior Debt which was guaranteed by the State and since April 2018 it has commenced the redemption of its &euro;1.6bn in subordinated debt.  However, notwithstanding the successful achievement of repaying the State&rsquo;s contingent liability, three years ahead of schedule, there is still a significant body of work yet to be completed by NAMA.  </p>  <p>  Subject to current market conditions prevailing NAMA projects a surplus in the region of &euro;3.5bn to be returned to the State once it completes it work.  The realisation of this surplus depends on the redemption of NAMA&rsquo;s remaining subordinated debt by March 2020 and completion of its Dublin Docklands SDZ and residential funding programmes.  </p>  <p>  As per section 60(2) of the NAMA Act 2009, NAMA may use surplus funds to redeem and cancel its senior and subordinated debt.  Surplus funds may only be returned to the Central Fund once NAMA's debt has been redeemed in full in 2020.  </p>  <p>  Any NAMA surplus paid, while Exchequer positive, will not impact the general government balance, in line with EUROSTAT rules.  It will be a decision for the Government as to how any surplus returned by NAMA will be utilised within the framework of the fiscal rules. However, the intention has always been to use such receipts from the resolution of the financial sector crisis to pay down our national debt and reduce our debt servicing costs.</p></reply>

The Commission was set up as an independent body with its own vote and Accounting Officer and is a body under the aegis of the Department of Finance.  </p>  <p>  Significant additional resources have been applied to the TAC since its inception with the staffing levels more than doubling over its first two years of operation.  Where additional resources have been sought to date, my Department have engaged with each request received.  Indeed the budget for the TAC has almost quadrupled between 2014 and 2018 despite the fact that in 2016 and 2017 the TAC did not spend its full budget allocation.  </p>  <p>  The following information relates to staffing requests received from the TAC.  </p>  <p>  In June 2016 the TAC proposed the re-engagement of two former Commissioners on a temporary basis.  This was followed in July 2016 by a request to recruit two additional temporary clerical staff.  The re-engagement of the former Commissioners was not considered to be in keeping with the mandate of openness and transparency, so in July 2016 sanction was instead given for the appointment of 5 temporary Appeal Commissioners, to be appointed by a competitive process, and 2 full-time clerical staff.  </p>  <p>  An amended request was received from the TAC in August 2016 for 4 clerical staff (to include the 2 clerical staff sanctioned in July), and this was sanctioned in August 2016.  </p>  <p>   In February 2017, following the return to D/Finance of an experienced Principal Officer on secondment to assist with the set-up of the TAC, the TAC requested the secondment of another experienced Principal Officer from my Department.  The position was filled by the appointment of a Principal Officer on secondment from the Department of Finance in May 2017.  </p>  <p>   In August 2017 a request was made by the TAC for 2 additional tax qualified staff at Assistant Principal level to act as case managers and this request was sanctioned.  In parallel to commencing the recruitment process via the Public Appointments Service (PAS) the TAC requested that my Department consider filling some of these positions by sending further staff to the TAC on secondment.  This was not possible as my Department has a limited number of staff with the requisite qualifications/skills and experience and is also dealing with staffing challenges caused by an annual turnover rate of over 23% (including resignations, retirements and staff that have moved to other Departments through promotions etc.).  My officials offered assistance with the process of recruitment via PAS, including the provision of interview board members if required.  The assistance of my Department's HR manager to provide advice and guidance has also been offered to the TAC, but the TAC to date have not availed of this offer.  </p>  <p>  The TAC's 2018 Estimates were submitted to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER) in September 2017, noting that the required additional staffing from January 2018 would be 2 Assistant Principal case managers (the 2 case managers requested in August for which recruitment had commenced), 1 Assistant Principal, 1 Higher Executive Officer and 1 temporary Clerical Officer.  </p>  <p>   This request was sanctioned, and my Department facilitated the transfer of an experienced Higher Executive Officer on secondment to the TAC in October 2017.  I understand that the 2 Assistant Principal case managers were appointed in January 2018.</p>  <p>  In February 2018, the Accounting Officer of the Commission submitted a request to my Department for significant additional resources to meet the increased caseload of the Commission, including an additional 10 administrative staff.  The addition of these resources would involve an effective doubling of the Commission&rsquo;s budget for 2018 from &euro;1.626 million to an estimated &euro;3.226 million which includes extra resources for ICT and new office space.  </p>  <p>   Due to the substantial increase in public resources now being sought by the TAC, my officials requested further information to support the resource request to ensure that the proposed balance of administrative staff and the existing Commissioners would be effective in addressing that workload.  The TAC informed my Department in early March of this year that it had commenced commissioning a review of its resources and operations.  I am awaiting receipt of this report and, in the meantime, I have commissioned an independent reviewer with significant experience of civil service bodies and operations to assess the current position and advise how best to address the TAC's resource needs.  This review has been expedited in order that resourcing decisions, based on a sound business case for the resolution of the current backlog, can be made as soon as possible.</p></reply>

This project is ongoing across all regions and to date site visits have been carried out by Revenue officials to 285 separate premises.  A range of follow-up actions are being pursued with respect to the tax and licensing issues identified, including seizure of unlicensed gaming machines where necessary.</p>  <p>  I am also advised that legislative proposals are being developed at present for the gambling sector  by my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality.  To support this process, the Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality has recently chaired a Gambling Regulation Working Group which has met on 5 occasions since January 2018, with the final meeting taking place last month.  All relevant Government Departments, an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Revenue Commissioners have taken part in the Working Group.  I understand that a report for Government is now being prepared by the Minister of State on foot of the group&rsquo;s discussions.</p></reply>

Ireland&rsquo;s tax regime is designed to encourage the location of real, substantive and high-value adding investment in this country.  We have a competitive tax regime that is fully in line with international standards for fair tax competition as agreed at the EU and the OECD.</p>  <p>  The best way for Ireland to address any reputational issues on tax is to continue to support international tax reform efforts and to continue to implement the various recommendations that we have agreed at EU and OECD level. </p>  <p>  I recognise the importance of ensuring effective taxation of multinational companies and the need for internationally agreed solutions to counter aggressive tax planning, base erosion and profit shifting.  Ireland has fully engaged with international efforts to counter aggressive tax planning to date, through both the OECD&rsquo;s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting and the subsequent coordinated action at EU level leading to the agreement of the two Anti-Tax Avoidance Directives.</p>  <p>  We continue to play our part in this ongoing work.  It is widely acknowledged that difficulties in the international tax system mainly arise from asymmetries between the taxation systems of different countries.  Only by acting together can we ensure that companies are taxed appropriately.</p>  <p>  I should also add that my officials are currently finalising a roadmap setting out a clear programme of action in relation to Ireland&rsquo;s Corporation Tax regime for the coming years having regard to developments at EU, OECD and the wider international level.  This Roadmap follows on from the independent review of Ireland&rsquo;s Corporation Tax Code conducted by Mr. Seamus Coffey, and will set out a comprehensive schedule of actions under way to action the Coffey recommendations, implement the remaining OECD BEPS recommendations and transpose the EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directives. This Roadmap will be published in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

These proposals are being considered by the relevant agencies with a view to their earliest possible implementation.</p>  <p>  In addition a potential permanent coastal protection option has been identified but further assessment of this is required.

This Study enables Local Authorities to meet their responsibility to develop appropriate plans and strategies for the sustainable management of the coastline in their counties.</p>  <p>  The Local Authorities may carry out coastal erosion works using their own resources. Where coastal erosion could give rise to a coastal flood risk, the OPW operates the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme, under which applications for funding from Local Authorities are considered for measures costing up to &euro;750,000 in each instance. In that context, funding for coastal erosion risk management studies may also be applied for under this scheme. Funding of up to 90% of the cost is available for projects which meet the eligibility criteria including a requirement that the proposed measures are cost beneficial.</p>  <p>  The OPW guidelines for coastal erosion risk management measures and funding applications under the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme, are available on the OPW website www.opw.ie</p></reply>

As home based tuition takes place outside the usual school structure it is important that the educational programme provided generally reflects that which would be provided in a school environment.</p>  <p>  It is appropriate therefore that the qualification standard for home based tuition generally reflects that required in a school environment. Accordingly, it is a condition of the scheme that parents/guardians must recruit a tutor who is qualified in the relevant sector, and is registered with the Teaching Council, similar to the requirement for teachers in schools.  </p>  <p>  Where all efforts have failed to secure the services of a teacher qualified to teach in the sector concerned, the Department may consider the engagement of a person who is registered with the Teaching Council and has a primary degree (minimum Level 7 on the National Framework of Qualifications) in a relevant area.</p>  <p>  It is also a requirement of the scheme that all tutors must be vetted prior to commencing the delivery of tuition. Parents are required to satisfy themselves that tutors have been vetted by the Teaching Council of Ireland 2016 via the Teaching Council&rsquo;s online vetting process. </p>  <p>  The terms and conditions of the July Provision Grant Scheme 2018 is set out in the Department's Information Note on the scheme which was published with the application forms on 11 April 2018 and is available on my Departments website at www.education.ie. </p>  <p>  Parents engage tutors for the provision of home based tuition in a private arrangement. It is the responsibility of the parent to source a tutor at the earliest possible opportunity to allow for applications for registration/vetting to be made by the tutor to the Teaching Council, if necessary.  </p>  <p>  The application for the July Provision Grant referred to by the Deputy cannot be approved until the Parent sources a tutor that is registered and vetted by the Teaching Council of Ireland.</p></reply>

A target of 200 students that are blind or visually impaired participating in higher education has been set for 2019 in the NAP.</p>  <p>  While a progress review of the NAP is currently underway which will assess progress towards targets, evidence from the data on the FSD already suggests that this target has been achieved.  In 2016-17 there were over 174 students who are blind or visually impaired supported by the FSD and provisional data indicates that over 200 students have been supported by the Fund in the academic year 2017-18.</p>  <p>  It is expected that the measures that have been implemented through the Plan, including the Programme for Access to Higher Education (PATH) and work to advance the recommendations of the Review of the Fund for Students with Disabilities (FSD) have assisted in the realisation of this target.</p>  <p>  There are other steps taken to improve participation in higher education by students that are blind or that have a visual impairment.  The Disability Access Route to Education (DARE) is a third level alternative admissions scheme for school leavers whose disabilities have had a negative impact on their second-level education.  DARE offers reduced points places to school leavers with a disability under the age of 23.  Students with sensory disabilities, including students that are blind or visually impaired, are prioritised for reduced point&rsquo;s places.</p>  <p>  Each higher education institution offers a range of post-entry supports to students with disabilities.  Supports include a dedicated disability officer, assistive technology, examination accommodations and tailored induction programmes.</p></reply>

This can be due to significant difficulties in areas such as behaviour or sensory needs which have not been ameliorated, even with appropriate intervention, in mainstream.</p><p>In order to access a special class a student must have a report from a relevant professional stating that:</p><p>- S/he has a disability in line with the designation of the special class in question and</p><p>- S/he has complex learning needs that require the support of a special class setting and the reasons why this is the case.</p><p>The NCSE is aware of emerging need in Dublin, from year to year, and where special provision is required it is planned and established to meet that need.</p><p>There are 37 special schools and 218 special classes attached to mainstream schools in Dublin. Of these, 18 are ASD early intervention classes, 124 are primary ASD classes and 36 are post primary ASD classes. The number of ASD special classes in Co. Dublin have increased from 66 in 2011/2012 to 178 in 2017/2018.</p><p>The NCSE has informed my Department that to date they have sanctioned 17 new Special Classes in Co. Dublin for 2018/19 school year.  This process is ongoing.  The NCSE is continuing to work with schools, parents, NEPS, health professionals and other staff who are involved in the provision of services for children with special educational needs in Dublin, to ensure that each child has a school placement appropriate to their needs for the 2018/19 school year and beyond.</p><p>My Department continues to work with the NCSE to ensure that there is appropriate planning in place to ensure that all children who require special class placements can access such placements in schools within their communities.</p><p>My Department has acknowledged that in recent years the establishment of special class provision in some schools and communities has been challenging.</p><p>As part of the process of planning for future provision, a number of measures have been included in the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2016 to provide certain powers to the NCSE to designate a school placement for a child in circumstances where a child is experiencing difficulties in securing enrolment.</p><p>The Bill also proposes powers for the Minister, in certain circumstances, to require a school to open a special class for children with special educational needs.  This amendment will give the Minister the power to compel a school to open a special class or classes where the National Council for Special Education has identified a need for such provision within an area.</p><p>These proposed measures would further enhance the ability of my Department and the NCSE to plan for special class provision and to address issues in provision that may arise from time in time at local levels.</p><p>Guidelines for Boards of Management and Principals of Primary and Post Primary schools contain information on setting up and organising special classes, including information on resources which may be provided to schools to establish special classes are available to download from <i>www.ncse.ie</i>.</p></reply>

In general, children are eligible for school transport if they meet the distance criteria and are attending their nearest school.</p>  <p>  Children who are not eligible for school transport may apply for transport on a concessionary basis only which is subject to a number of conditions including the availability of spare seats on an existing service and payment of the annual charge.</p>  <p>  The annual charge for school transport services is &euro;100 per annum for primary children and &euro;350 for post primary children with a maximum family charge of &euro;220 for primary children only or &euro;650 overall.</p>  <p>  Only children who are eligible for school transport and who hold valid medical cards (GMS Scheme) are exempt from paying the annual charge.</p>  <p>  Arising from commitments in the Programme for Government, a review of the Concessionary Charges and Rules element of the School Transport Scheme was undertaken.  The review was published in December 2016 and made recommendations on both the charges and the rules element of concessionary school transport.</p>  <p>  With regard to the charges for concessionary school transport the recommended course of action was to continue with the current position whereby charges remain in place for those in receipt of concessionary places.  I agreed with this recommendation on the basis that those applying for concessionary transport are making a conscious decision to do so, understand that they are not eligible for school transport and understand the implications of this choice at the time of application.</p>  <p>  Based on current estimates, it is estimated that the cost of extending the medical card waiver to all children who are currently availing of school transport on a concessionary basis would cost in excess of an additional &euro;2m annually.</p>  <p>  The terms of the School Transport Schemes are applied equitably on a national basis.</p></reply>

A new 16 classroom school with special needs unit was constructed in 2016 for Glasnevin Educate Together National School.  In addition, the construction of a new 16 classroom school with special needs unit for Gracepark Educate Together National School is included in my Department&rsquo;s 6 Year Construction Programme.  This project is currently at planning permission stage and when planning is received, it will proceed to tender.  In the meantime, the school is located in temporary accommodation pending the construction of the new permanent school building.</p>  <p>  In relation to school admissions, parents can choose which school to apply to and where the school has places available the pupil should be admitted.  However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available, a selection process may be necessary.  This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.  However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</p></reply>

Under these arrangements my Department pays for a substitute teacher to be employed by a school to facilitate administrative functions to be undertaken by the teaching principal.</p>  <p>  Building on measures in previous budgets to enhance school leadership, Budget 2018 made &euro;0.4 million available to fund almost 4600 additional release days for teaching principals in primary schools.  This additional funding will see an increase in the number of release days available to teaching principals in the 2018/19 school year to 17, 23 or 29 days depending on the size of the school.</p>  <p>  Budget 2017 allowed for the commencement of restoration of middle management posts as part of an agreed distributed leadership model and meant lifting the rigidity of the longstanding moratorium on these posts at primary and post-primary levels.  This recognises the key role school leadership has in promoting a school environment which is welcoming, inclusive and accountable.</p>  <p>  &euro;2.75m was allocated in Budget 2017 to restore middle management positions i.e. the equivalent of approximately 1,300 middle management posts (Assistant Principal I and Assistant Principal II) at both Primary and Post-Primary. (2,600 in total).</p>  <p>  Circular 63/2017 was issued by my Department in September 2017 which sets out a leadership and management framework for posts in recognised primary schools.  Flexibility in identifying and prioritising the evolving leadership and management needs of the school, and in assigning and re-assigning post holders to specific roles and responsibilities to meet the evolving needs of a school, is an essential feature of this school leadership model.</p>  <p>  While the Principal is ultimately responsible to the Board of Management for the management and leadership of the school, the Deputy Principal also occupies a position of vital importance within the senior leadership team in each school.  The Deputy Principal co-operates with the Principal in the fulfilment of the Principal's role and acts or deputises as the Principal in the Principal's absence.</p>  <p>  In relation to the duties assigned to Assistant Principal posts, the Principal following consultation with staff, agree the schedule of duties as best meet the needs of the school.  These duties are designed to reduce the workload of the Principal.</p>  <p>  The selection and recruitment process is well under way in most of our primary schools and the majority of these new middle management posts will be filled in the current school year, including schools where the Principal is a "Teaching Principal".</p>  <p>  I recently announced an extension to the arrangements for schools with teaching principals to cluster their release days into full-time posts, with one teacher covering the release days of all the schools in the cluster.  Up to 50 principal release cluster posts will be put in place for the 2018/19 school year.  This measure will assist teaching principals to more effectively plan their release days for the benefit of the school.</p>  <p>  The Teacher Allocation section of my Department are currently processing these applications and schools are being notified as the cluster posts are approved.</p>  <p>  Any additional increase in the number of release days will be considered as part of the next annual budgetary process alongside the many other demands from the education sector.</p></reply>

The distribution of the population necessitates a relatively large number of small primary schools.  In the case of Principals in smaller schools, while management and administrations duties may be smaller in scale than those of larger schools, they must be undertaken in addition to their full-time teaching duties.</p><p>The enrolment required for administrative principal in ordinary schools, gaelscoileanna and schools in the Gaeltacht is 176 pupils, or 113 if operating a specialist autism unit.</p><p>Schools that have less than this enrolment have teaching principals.  Recently published Circular 40/2018 is available on the Department&rsquo;s website, which outlines the number of days that teaching principals may take as release time in a school year in order to assist them fulfilling their principal duties.  Under these arrangements my Department pays for a substitute teacher to be employed by a school to facilitate administrative functions to be undertaken by the teaching principal.</p><p>Building on measures in previous budgets to enhance school leadership, Budget 2018 made &euro;0.4 million available to fund almost 4600 additional release days for teaching principals in primary schools.  This additional funding will see an increase in the number of release days available to teaching principals in the 2018/19 school year to 17, 23 or 29 days depending on the size of the school.</p><p>Budget 2017 allowed for the commencement of restoration of middle management posts as part of an agreed distributed leadership model and meant lifting the rigidity of the longstanding moratorium on these posts at primary and post-primary levels.  This recognises the key role school leadership has in promoting a school environment which is welcoming, inclusive and accountable.</p><p>&euro;2.75m was allocated in Budget 2017 to restore middle management positions i.e. the equivalent of approximately 1,300 middle management posts (Assistant Principal I and Assistant Principal II) at both Primary and Post-Primary. (2,600 in total).</p><p>The selection and recruitment process is well under way in most of our primary schools and the majority of these new middle management posts will be filled in the current school year, including schools where the Principal is a &quot;Teaching Principal&quot;.</p><p>Circular 63/2017 was issued by the Department in September 2017 which deals and sets out a leadership and management framework for posts in recognised primary schools.</p><p>While the Principal is ultimately responsible to the Board of Management for the management and leadership of the school, the Deputy Principal occupies a position of vital importance within the senior leadership team in each school.  The Deputy Principal co-operates with the Principal in the fulfilment of the Principal's role and acts or deputises as the Principal in the Principal's absence.</p><p>In relation to the duties assigned to Assistant Principal posts, the Principal following consultation with staff, agree the schedule of duties as best meet the needs of the school.  These duties are designed to reduce the workload of the Principal.</p><p>I recently announced an extension to the arrangements for schools with teaching principals to cluster their release days into full-time posts, with one teacher covering the release days of all the schools in the cluster.  Up to 50 principal release cluster posts will be put in place for the 2018/19 school year.  This measure will assist teaching principals to more effectively plan their release days for the benefit of the school.</p><p>Any additional increase in the number of release days will be considered as part of the next annual budgetary process alongside the many other demands from the education sector.</p><p>Attached is the breakdown of the number of teaching principals in primary schools in Kildare, Laois and Offaly, as requested.</p><p><b>Number of schools with teaching principals</b><table><tr><th>County</th><th>Number of teaching principals in 2017/18 school year</th></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td>39</td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td>42</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>31</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Where the introduction of digital devices is planned, consultation with members of the school community including parents is advised. The cost and other implications must be fully considered by the Boards of Managements before a decision is made. I believe it is important for schools, in conjunction with parents, to retain local autonomy for decisions on the use of tablet devices and how best to manage their integration into classroom practice.  In making this decision each school should consider all the available information. </p>  <p>  The Professional Development Service for Teachers Technology in Education (PDST-TIE) offers advice to schools and have developed an advice sheet, on the adoption of tablets in schools, on its website which covers areas such as what tablets can offer a school, educational and purchasing considerations, and software.</p>  <p>  I am keenly aware of the challenges faced by educators and parents, in relation to costs of digital devices including eBooks, and my Department continues to work to help support schools and families meet these costs. In 2017 a circular letter issued to schools with measures to be adopted to reduce the cost of school uniforms and other costs. This circular also instructed schools to consult with parents and their school community on the issue of ensuring costs are reasonable for parents, and how to avoid costs acting as a barrier. This circular specified that wherever possible, generic rather than branded items should be specified (e.g. uniform, clothing, IT tablets, sports equipment etc.). The issue of costs to parents will also be included in the Guidelines that will issue with the Education (Parent and Student Charter) Bill 2018.</p>  <p>  Direct assistance is provided through the School Books Grant Scheme for books including eBooks for children in all recognised primary and post-primary schools. All schools are encouraged to operate such a scheme, under which some &euro;7 million in funding to primary schools in 2017.  </p>  <p>  In addition, the Digital Strategy for Schools 2015-2020, sets out a plan to embed the use of digital technology in teaching, learning and assessment. The Strategy recognises that schools require investment in their ICT infrastructure.  Funding of &euro;210m has been committed to support the implementation of this strategy with &euro;60m issued to schools over the 2016/17 and 2017/18 school years. This will increase to &euro;50m a year over the lifetime of the strategy.</p></reply>

This announcement follows nationwide, demographic exercises carried out by my Department into the future need for primary and post-primary schools across the country and the 4-year horizon will enable increased lead-in times for planning and delivery of the necessary infrastructure. </p><p>A patronage process is run after it has been decided, based on demographic analysis, that a new school is required.  This patronage process is open to all patron bodies and prospective patrons.  Parental preferences for each patron, from parents of children who reside in the school planning areas concerned, together with the extent of diversity currently available in these areas, are key to decisions in relation to the outcome of this process.  </p><p>An Online Patronage Process System (OPPS) has been developed by my Department to provide objective information to all parents which will allow them to make an informed choice about their preferred model of patronage for their child&rsquo;s education. Parental preferences were previously collected based on direct engagement with patron bodies. The Online Patronage Process System (OPPS) website is currently live for the post-primary schools to be established in 2019.</p><p>All new schools established since 2011 to meet demographic demand are required to prioritise enrolments from the designated school planning area(s) which the school was established to serve.  Therefore, only parents of eligible children residing in the relevant school planning area(s) can express a preference with regard to the patronage of the new school. This does not preclude schools from enrolling pupils from outside of the designated school planning area, rather it reflects the need to accommodate in the first instance the demographic for which the school was established. </p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, there are currently 27 primary schools located in the Drogheda school planning area, including 2 primary schools in Duleek. Parents of children, including children attending a primary school in Duleek, who are due to start post-primary education in the 5 year period 2019 to 2023 and who are resident in the Drogheda school planning area may be eligible to express a preference with regard to the patronage of the new post-primary school. Parents can visit the OPPS website at <i>https://patronage.education.gov.ie</i>to check their eligibility and to view the relevant school planning area map.</p></reply>

The current school planning areas take account not only of local groupings of schools, but also of natural boundaries, Census Small Areas and other local conditions. These school planning areas are used in the demographic exercise as a basis for the assessment of areas of growth and to inform recommendations on the establishment of any new schools required in that school planning area. </p><p>As the school planning areas were aligned with the Census Small Areas and a townland or electoral division can fall into more than one school planning area, the information is not readily available in the format requested by the Deputy. </p><p>A patronage process is currently under way in respect of four post-primary schools announced to be established in 2019 for the following school planning areas:</p><p>- Laytown and Drogheda (Regional Solution),</p><p>- Galway City and Oranmore (Regional Solution),</p><p>- Donaghmede_Howth_D13; and</p><p>- Wicklow. </p><p>A list of the Census Small Areas which are located within each of the above school planning areas are outlined in the following link for the Deputy's information.</p></reply>

In employing an individual, it is up to the school to determine what terms and conditions the individual is employed under.  My Department has no plans to develop an alternative scheme for schools to employ secretaries separate to the current system of capitation grant assistance.</p><p>Notwithstanding that, in 2015 my Department agreed to engage with the union side in relation to the pay of school secretaries (and caretakers) who are employed using grant funding and to enter an arbitration process.  The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for school secretaries (and caretakers) comprehended by the terms of the arbitration process and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 for such staff be phased in over the period 2016 to 2019.  Grant funding used by schools to fund the salaries of ancillary staff is also being improved on a phased basis between 2016 and 2019 following the arbitration process.  These increases are in order to enable schools implement the arbitration outcome for grant funded secretaries (and caretakers).</p><p>In December 2017, my Department published circular letter 0078/2017 for primary schools and circular letter 0079/2017 for voluntary secondary schools, setting out the application of the third phase increases of the Arbitrator&rsquo;s recommendations.  The circulars are available at:</p><p>Circular 0078/2017:  <i></i><i><i>https://www.education.ie/en/Circulars-and-Forms/Active-Circulars/cl0078_2017.pdf</i></i></p><p>Circular 0079/2017:  <i><i>http://www.education.ie/en/Circulars-and-Forms/Active-Circulars/cl0079_2017.pdf</i></i></p><p>The increases recommended by the Arbitrator are binding and must be applied by all schools who employ staff to whom the Arbitrator's recommendation applies.</p></reply>

However, I must be prudent in the context of ongoing budgetary pressures and prioritise where it is not possible to do everything that I would like to do in the education sector in any one year.  In the last two budgets, I made provision for 6,000 extra teachers and 3,000 extra SNAs and over 3,000 new middle management posts.  These resources were allocated to improve the learning experience right across the sector, with a particular focus on children with special needs.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that Budget 2018 marked the second year of major reinvestment in the education sector, as we continue to implement the Action Plan for Education, which has the central aim to make the Irish Education and Training service the best in Europe within a decade.  In 2018, the budget for the Department of Education increased by &euro;554 million to over &euro;10 billion.  Through budget 2017 and Budget 2018, we are now investing &euro;1 billion more in education.</p>  <p>  Improvements have been made for the restoration of grant funding that is used by schools to fund the salaries of ancillary staff.  The ancillary grant was increased by &euro;6 in 2016, &euro;5 in 2017 and &euro;5 in 2018, in order to enable primary schools to implement the arbitration salary increase for grant funded school secretaries and caretakers and to also implement the restoration of salary for cleaners arising from the unwinding of FEMPI legislation.  </p>  <p>  The level of funding provided to all schools and the drivers of costs at school level are kept under review by my Department.</p></reply>

Capitation related grants are issued to the majority of primary and post-primary schools to employ such staff.  Within the capitation grant schemes, it is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs.</p><p>Where a school uses the capitation grant funding to employ a secretary, such staff are employees of individual schools.  My Department has no plans to develop an alternative scheme for schools to employ school secretaries separate to the current system of capitation grant assistance.</p><p>Notwithstanding that, in 2015 my Department agreed to engage with the union side in relation to the pay of school secretaries who are employed using grant funding, and to enter an arbitration process.  The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for school secretaries (and caretakers and cleaners) comprehended by the terms of the arbitration process and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 for such staff be phased in over the period 2016 to 2019.  Grant funding used by schools to fund the salaries of ancillary staff is also being improved on a phased basis between 2016 and 2019 following the arbitration process.  These increases are in order to enable schools  implement the arbitration outcome for grant funded secretaries (and caretakers and cleaners).</p><p>In December 2017, my Department published circular letter 0078/2017 for primary schools and circular letter 0079/2017 for voluntary secondary schools, setting out the application of the third phase increases of the Arbitrator&rsquo;s recommendations.  The circulars are available at:</p><p>Circular 0078/2017: <i>https://www.education.ie/en/Circulars-and-Forms/Active-Circulars/cl0078_2017.pdf </i></p><p>Circular 0079/2017: <i>http://www.education.ie/en/Circulars-and-Forms/Active-Circulars/cl0079_2017.pdf</i></p><p>The increases recommended by the Arbitrator are binding and must be applied by all schools who employ staff to whom the Arbitrator's recommendation applies. </p></reply>

This pilot project was funded by Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII).</p>  <p>  According to TII, an analysis of driver behaviour carried out in October 2015 confirmed that 58% of drivers using the Dublin Port Tunnel exceeded the 80 km/h speed limit, and 20% exceeded this limit by more than 10 km/h. </p>  <p>  Following the introduction of the average speed camera system at the Dublin Port Tunnel, the percentage of drivers exceeding the limit by more than 10 km/h has fallen to 0.15%. This suggests that the system has had a significant effect on driver behaviour. TII also emphasises that this reduction in excessive speed is particularly notable, occurring, as it does, against the backdrop of increasing weekday traffic volumes, with Monday-Friday traffic volumes rising by 40% over the past five years.</p>  <p>  Prior to the introduction of this system, speed checks at the Dublin Port Tunnel were conducted using handheld laser-based technology, and required a Garda presence to identify and intercept speeding vehicles. For safety reasons, these checks could only be conducted outside the tunnel and, therefore, could not influence driver behaviour inside the tunnel itself. </p>  <p>  The average speed camera system allows the enforcement of the speed limit within the tunnel itself, with automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) used to identify vehicles that have exceeded the speed limit and the relevant fixed charge notices (FCNs) are issued by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na without the vehicle being intercepted.</p>  <p>  I understand that TII has recommended the extension of the average speed camera project for an additional four years and has committed to continuing its funding and operation of the system during the extension period.</p>  <p>  In terms of speed enforcement on other roads, I would remind the Deputy that this is accomplished by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na through the use of both intercept and non-intercept methods, with safety cameras being used in specific locations, known as speed enforcement zones, around the country in order to provide non-intercept detection of speeding vehicles. </p>  <p>  The overall impact of the safety cameras can be seen in the impact on the fatal collisions in the designated speed enforcement zones. The designation of specific sections of road as speed enforcement zones is based on an analysis of collision data by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. In the years 2004 to 2009 (the 6 years before the introduction of the safety camera network began), approximately 3 out of 10 (30%) fatal collisions occurred in these zones. In 2015, this figure had reduced to 16% (or 24 road deaths) in safety camera zones.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that the deployment of Garda resources is, of course, a matter for the Garda Commissioner, and I, Minister for Justice and Equality, have no role in such operational matters.</p></reply>

In determining whether to make a deportation order, in addition to the factors set out in Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, I must also consider all relevant constitutional and international human rights arising including those enshrined in the Refugee Convention, the UN Convention Against Torture and the European Charter of Human Rights. The question of not returning a person to a place where certain fundamental rights would be breached (or non refoulement as it is referred to) is fully considered in every case when deciding whether or not to make a deportation order. This involves consideration of whether returning the person would result in the life or freedom of that person being threatened on account of his or her race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, or whether the person would be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.</p><p>A deportation order requires the person concerned to remove themselves from the State and it is only where they fail to do so that the State is forced to remove them and enforce the rule of law. A deportation order is of no definite duration but it is open to the subject of such an Order to make an application to have it revoked where there is a change of circumstances since the Order was made. </p><p>It is to be noted that the enforcement of deportation orders is an operational matter for the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB). </p><p>I should<b></b>remind the Deputy that queries in relation to the status of individual Immigration cases may be made direct to INIS by Email using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.  The service enables up-to-date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek this information through the more administratively expensive Parliamentary Questions process.</p></reply>

As the Deputy will appreciate, in some cases it is necessary for the Garda authorities to conduct further enquiries in respect of the requirements of the Acts, for example to verify identity or establish the outcome of an investigation. In such cases processing times may be longer than the general average.</p>  <p>   Once the processing of a vetting application has been completed by the National Vetting Bureau the result is returned to the relevant registered organisation.  It is a matter for that organisation to complete whatever processes are in place with the individual applicants.</p></reply>

That is reflected by its inclusion on the Government&rsquo;s list of priority legislation for publication during this Oireachtas session. </p>  <p>  My officials have been working very intensively on this important Bill, together with the Office of Parliamentary Counsel, and the drafting is now well advanced.  I expect to bring the Bill to Government very shortly for agreement to publish.  </p>  <p>  I agree that it has taken considerably longer than I had wished or intended, to finalise the Bill for publication.  The reasons for this are genuine.  It is a complex Bill, both in drafting terms and on the substance.  The Deputy will be aware that this Bill will, among other matters, make provision regarding coronial investigation of maternal deaths, in response to the Private Member's Bill tabled by Deputy Clare Daly in that regard. Both Deputy Daly's Bill, and much of the work done by my Department on the reform of coronial law, refer to the text of the Coroners Bill 2007, which provided for a comprehensive reform of coronial law and of the administrative structure of the coroner service in Ireland.  That administrative reform requires significant updating and is not yet ready to proceed.  That means that we have had to translate the key reforms of coronial law that we are now seeking to make, from the structure and language of the 2007 Bill, into the existing legislation, which dates from 1962.  I am satisfied that the Bill I intend to bring forward will fully meet these rather demanding technical drafting requirements, but they have slowed down the drafting process and rendered it more complex. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Deputy will be aware there is a huge amount of overall legislative activity &ndash; and even of priority legislation - at present in relation both to Private Members&rsquo; Bills, and to the Government&rsquo;s legislative programme, across a large number of fronts.  The volume of legislative work means that the resource of the specialists who are available to do it is often spread very thinly. </p>  <p>  My officials are currently finalising the Bill together with the Office of Parliamentary Counsel, and I expect to seek Government agreement to publish before the end of this month.  </p>  <p>  I intend to move the Bill as early as possible after publication, so that, with the cooperation of all sides, we can facilitate its swift passage through the Houses.</p></reply>

The examination includes the concerns raised by the Law Reform Commission in 2013 such as those relating to how representative juries are of their communities, the wide group of people who can at present be excused as of right from jury service; juries serving in lengthy or complex criminal trials; the reasonable accommodation of persons with disabilities to serve as jurors; the implications of on-line internet activity and wireless technology for the work and conduct of juries and issues of remuneration arising from jury service.  The Working Group will consider some additional areas relevant to the reform of policy in this area including, for example, its constitutional aspects and the overall fit of the existing legislative architecture provided by the Juries Act of 1976 as amended which sets out relevant law in this jurisdiction particularly in terms of qualification and selection for service as a juror. </p>  <p>  The membership of the Working Group, which is chaired by my Department, is drawn from senior officials of the relevant Divisions of the Department of Justice and Equality, the Courts Service, Forensic Science Ireland, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Its inaugural meeting took place on 30 April 2018 when it had an initial opportunity to discuss its proposed Terms of Reference and gave its first consideration to the Draft Juries Bill and the other aspects of the Law Reform Commission Report of 2013.  The current focus of the Working Group is on engaging in a work programme based on that approach.  The conclusions of the work of the Group will form the basis of a report and a draft General Scheme of a Juries Service Bill building on the initial draft for such a scheme proposed by the Law Reform Commission in its 2013 Report.  This represents a substantial body of work given that the Commission's Report made 56 recommendations of which 32 are expected to require legislative intervention.</p>  <p>  While the time-frame of actions to be taken on foot of the Working Group&rsquo;s deliberations will be dependent on its specific findings and recommendations the aim would be to have the anticipated General Scheme of a new Juries Bill, subject of course to receiving the necessary Cabinet approval, early in 2019.</p></reply>

However, I do have plans to introduce legislation to strengthen the existing law on coronial investigation of maternal deaths. </p>  <p>  The Coroners (Amendment) Bill, already approved for drafting by the Government in May 2017, is a very important Bill, which I expect to bring to Government shortly for agreement to publish.</p>  <p>  This Bill will, among other key reforms of coronial law, introduce mandatory reporting, post-mortem examination and inquest, in cases of direct or indirect maternal death.  It will also extend the legal aid provisions, introduced for certain inquests in the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013, to a family member of the deceased at an inquest into a maternal death. </p>  <p>  This will ensure clarity for responsible persons, including hospital authorities, and will support the development of transparent and accountable oversight for checking and investigating certain types of death.  Most importantly, it will provide clarity and transparency for bereaved families.  I take this opportunity to acknowledge the contribution made by Deputy Clare Daly to the Bill, through her earlier Private Member's Bill. </p>  <p>   It will be an offence for a responsible person not to report a mandatory reportable death to the coroner.  There will also be improved provisions on the reporting of certain peri-natal and infant deaths, to support prompt and transparent provision of information by health and other authorities to bereaved families.  More broadly, the Bill will also update and strengthen the legal powers available to coroners regarding reporting, post-mortem and inquest of unnatural deaths; and including more robust powers to compel attendance by witnesses and the production of documents at inquest.  The Bill will also allow a wider scope for inquests, from investigating the immediate cause of death to establishing the circumstances in which the death occurred.   </p>  <p>  The public importance of effective and transparent independent investigation in such cases is obvious.  In addition, these measures will strengthen our compliance with the European Convention on Human Rights.</p></reply>

It is carried out by the Garda National Vetting Bureau in accordance with the provisions of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012-2016 and other relevant laws.  Neither I nor my Department has any role in the processing of vetting applications.</p>  <p>  The Criminal Justice (Spent Convictions and Certain Disclosures) Act 2016 sets out in detail the arrangements in law whereby certain past convictions may not be disclosed and may be regarded as spent. This Act made a series of amendments to the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 in respect of the arrangements for the disclosure or otherwise of past convictions in the context of the vetting process.</p>  <p>  Generally speaking, the Act provides that in certain circumstances and in respect of certain offences a person is not obliged to disclose convictions which are over seven years old.  I would emphasise that these arrangements are subject to specified limitations and these are detailed in the 2016 Act. It should be noted in particular that sexual offences or convictions in the Central Criminal Court are not eligible to become spent convictions.</p>  <p>  These provisions are applied by the National Vetting Bureau in the context of processing all vetting applications.</p></reply>

In this regard, the European Council called on the Council and the Commission to explore the concept of regional disembarkation platforms, in cooperation with third countries as well as UNHCR and the International Organisation for Migration (IOM).  Furthermore, the European Council agreed to set up 'controlled centres' in willing Member States to allow for rapid processing to distinguish between irregular migrants and those in need of international protection.  </p>  <p>  These measures are at the very early stages of development. I and my officials will play an active role in any discussions on their development and the Council itself confirmed in its Conclusions that any centres established must operate in full compliance with international law.    </p>  <p>  The European Council also called on Member States to contribute further to the EU Trust Fund for Africa.  In this regard, Ireland has pledged a further &euro;9 million to the Fund in addition to the &euro;6 million already pledged bringing Ireland's total contribution to the Fund to &euro;15 million.

However, I can assure the Deputy that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continue to take all forms of anti-social and drug-related behaviour very seriously. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continue to monitor all new and emerging crime trends in our communities, particularly in the summer months and deploy Garda resources accordingly to address any problems that arise.</p>  <p>  Working with communities to tackle public disorder and reduce anti-social behaviour remains a key priority for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. This approach includes a strong focus on quality of life issues and collaboration with local authorities to help address the causes of anti-social behaviour. I might add that there is a range of strong legislative provisions available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to combat anti-social behaviour, including provisions under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Acts, the Criminal Damage Act and the Intoxicating Liquor Acts. There are also the incremental provisions contained in the Criminal Justice Act 2006 which provide, in Part 11, for warnings and civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by adults and, in Part 13 of the Act, for warnings, good behaviour contracts and civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by children.</p>  <p>  Anti-social behaviour has no place in a civilised society. For its part, the Government remains committed to ensuring that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have all the necessary resources to tackle all forms of criminality in our communities. In this context, the Deputy will be aware that a very substantial budget of &euro;1.65 billion has been allocated to the Garda Vote for 2018 and &euro;98.5m has been provided for Garda overtime for 2018, which inter alia supports Garda activity to tackle these types of problems.</p>  <p>  While An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to tackle these problems head-on, they cannot eradicate the problem of anti-social behaviour alone. Specifically in relation to young offenders, it is also up to us as adults, particularly the parents and guardians of our young, to ensure that children are raised to be respectful and law-abiding. These lessons begin in the home, are further reinforced in our schools and then by wider society in general. We must all work together to ensure that such behaviour is never normalised and is tackled immediately. </p>  <p>  Clearly, Garda visibility is very important and this Government remains committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime. To this end, the House will be aware that 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during 2018, some 200 of whom attested in March, with a further 200 attesting recently. The new recruits are visible proof of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 including 15,000 Garda members. </p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. </p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that the overall Garda strength on 31 May 2018, the latest date for which information is readily available, was 13,604. There are also 558 Garda Reserves and more than 2,300 civilians attached to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.  </p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime. To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal. </p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, almost 2,000 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide. Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 &ndash; a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016. </p><p>I am pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College. In total, 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year, 400 of whom have attested to date. Further, Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, are on track to reach 14,000 by the end of 2018.</p><p>In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties. There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018. </p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Division to increase Garda visibility in our communities and to support all Garda activity including Community Policing. </p><p>For the Deputy's information, I have set out in the attached tables the number of Garda&iacute;, Community Garda&iacute;, Garda Reserve in each Division and Civilian Staff in each Garda Station, as of the 31 May 2018, the latest date for which figures are available.</p><p><b>Civilian by

Under the European Communities (Reception Conditions) Regulations 2018, which transposes the Directive into Irish law, applicants for International Protection who have been granted a labour market access permission and who are self-employed cannot employ any person or carry on a business in partnership with another person. </p>  <p>  As I am sure the Deputy will appreciate, every individual applicant is at different stage in the international protection determination process and the temporary permission to access the labour market expires as soon as the applicant receives a final decision on their application, i.e, after all appeals procedures have been exhausted. Restricting applicants from employing any other person or carrying on a business in partnership with another person, including another applicant, recognises the applicant's temporary permission to access the labour market. This protects potential employees or partners from a situation where an applicant's labour market permission expires, is otherwise withdrawn or partners who ends up with different outcomes of the protection process.  </p></reply>

Changes to the Scheme will be subject to further consultations with the Office of the Attorney General and other relevant Departments.</p>  <p>  The key element of the Government Decision of 10 January 2018 is the establishment of a new gambling regulatory authority as an independent statutory body under the auspices of the Department of Justice and Equality. </p>  <p>  This approach to independent regulation is, I believe, critical for the development of modern gambling legislation. It mirrors the situation in most EU Member States and would bring Ireland in line with best international practice.</p>  <p>  An independent regulator would offer assurance that decision-making would be free from any potentially undue influence. </p>  <p>  Effective modern licensing, regulation and enforcement of the gambling industry will require additional significant resources, primarily for the operation of the new regulatory authority.

Further, the programme of replacement and refurbishment of Garda accommodation is progressed by the Garda authorities working in close co-operation with the Office of Public Works. As Minister, I have no direct role in these matters.</p>  <p>  There has been very significant investment in Garda resources across the State in recent years. Considerable efforts are being made by the Government to enhance the working environment generally for members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and major investment has been committed under the Capital Plan 2016-2021 to upgrade Garda premises.</p>  <p>  The Garda Station Building and Refurbishment Programme 2016-2021 is an ambitious 5 year programme, based on agreed Garda priorities, that will benefit over thirty locations around the country and includes over &euro;60 million of Exchequer funding as part of Government&rsquo;s Capital Plan 2016 &ndash; 2021 as well as a major Public Private Partnership project.</p>  <p>  The programme is providing new stations and modernising older stations at key locations around the country, ensuring safe, modern working environment for members and staff of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as well as fit-for-purpose facilities for visitors, victims and suspects. The works carried out at each location are agreed on a case-by-case basis as between OPW and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p>  <p>  In addition to the Building and Refurbishment Programme, I am informed by the Garda authorities almost &euro;650,000 is available in the Garda Vote for 2018 for minor maintenance works, including fire protection, throughout the Garda estate.  I am informed that there is no specific budget allocated to refurbish official Garda living accommodation. Applications for refurbishment of properties in the Garda estate, including official accommodation, are made by Divisional Officers and are assessed with having regard to the overall accommodation requirements of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the budget available.</p></reply>

The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 created new offences around the online sexual grooming of children and strengthened existing laws relating to child pornography. The Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime Act) 2017 has also enhanced protections for victims of these crimes. </p>  <p>  In addition, a detailed review of Ireland&rsquo;s compliance with the Convention is being conducted with a view to identifying any barriers to ratification.  As part of this review, my Department has engaged with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs with respect to the prevention and protection aspects of the Convention. The views of a number of other relevant Government Departments and agencies have also been sought. Once the review is complete and it is assessed that Ireland can fully meet the requirements of the Convention, the necessary formal steps towards ratification will be taken.</p></reply>

They are also matters on which I can assure the Deputy both my Department and the Authority are in ongoing discussion with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>  <p>  As had been reflected in my Written Reply to Question No. 404 of 13 July 2017, the Authority has been supported in this endeavour by an advance of &euro;1 million during each of the years 2016 and 2017 from my Department's Vote and a similar allocation of &euro;1 million has been made for the current year. These advances are being made, as provided under section 32 of the 2015 Act, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform for the purposes of expenditure by the Authority in the performance of its functions. As also reflected in that Written Reply and since set out in more detail in the Authority's published Annual Report for 2017, the Authority spent its first year completing a series of statutory and time-bound reports and public consultations while also establishing a start-up office and recruiting its first full-time Chief Executive who was appointed in November 2017.</p>  <p>  As part of the roll-out of the 2015 Act, a number of legal and technical issues have arisen in relation to the practical application of the funding framework that the Act provides. These provisions were intended, from a policy perspective, to provide the means whereby the Authority, having been funded for an initial and short start-up period on a recoupable basis, could then become self-funding in the longer term. This would be achieved by means of a levy based on actual expenditure by the Authority in the immediately preceding financial year and raised from those legal practitioners being regulated in the terms currently set out in Part 7 of the 2015 Act. The fact that the effective roll-out of the Authority's remaining functions will require substantially more time than initially considered and that the levy also needs time to generate actual income have revealed a potential gap in the original model of recoupability that now needs to be reconsidered and resolved. This is made more complex because the levy is also intrinsically linked, in its application, to a number of other measures including the current work of the Authority in setting-up the Roll of Practising Barristers in support of which I recently commenced the necessary provisions of Part 9 of the 2015 Act. </p>  <p>  My Department has, therefore, acknowledged the Authority's position, which it has reflected in its risk register, that the levy provisions as drafted in the 2015 Act may not, in their practical implementation and in the transpiring circumstances of the start-up, provide an adequate source of funding to the Authority and may not similarly provide for the recoupability of advances as may originally have been foreseen. My Department has also been informed by the Authority that it has engaged a financial consultant to examine the current levy provisions and to provide an expert economic/financial opinion on them. This is expected to be provided soon and will be given early and detailed consideration by my Department and the Authority in conjunction with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform who are, as I have said, aware of the issues concerned. Both my Department and the Authority are committed, on that basis, to the prompt and robust analysis and examination of the funding provisions within the 2015 Act to ensure that there is a sustainable levy-based framework under which the Authority is sufficiently funded going forward to fulfil its broad remit as a new regulatory body. We also wish to ensure that there is no setback to the progress it has made to date and to the important programme of reform it has undertaken under its Strategic Plan for 2018-2020. Along with the relevant officials of my Department I will, therefore, be giving detailed consideration to any necessary measures proposed including legislative amendments or refinements, if any, that may be considered appropriate.</p></reply>

There is no specific determination process for recognition of stateless persons in Ireland; claims of statelessness can arise at any point in the immigration and protection processes and the numbers involved are very low.  These cases are frequently disposed of without recourse to a determination of statelessness through procedures (e.g. permission to remain) set out under the Immigration Acts or International Protection Acts.  Such cases are not centralised in a single process or section of the immigration service and, as such, statistics on stateless persons are not available in the way sought by the Deputy. </p></reply>

The LEOs can also offer advice and guidance in areas such as Local Authority rates, Public Procurement and other regulations affecting business.</p>  <p>  The LEOs can offer direct grant aid to microenterprises (10 employees or fewer) in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sectors which, over time, have the potential to develop into strong export entities. Subject to certain eligibility criteria, the LEOs can provide financial assistance within three main categories: Feasibility Grants (investigating the potential of a business idea); Priming Grants (to part-fund a start-up); and Business Development Grants for existing businesses that want to expand. (It should be noted that the LEOs do not provide direct grant-aid to areas such as retail, personal services, local professional services, construction/local building services, as it may give rise to the displacement of existing businesses). In addition, there is a Technical Assistance Grant available for eligible micro-exporter applicants who are seeking to explore alternative markets for their product or service.</p>  <p>  For anyone interested in starting or growing a business, the LEOs may be able to offer &lsquo;soft&rsquo; support in the form of training (e.g. a Start Your Own Business course); a mentor to work with the business proposer; or targeted programmes such as Lean for Micro (to help boost business productivity and competitiveness).</p>  <p>  Micro-enterprises may also avail of the Trading Online Voucher Scheme (TOVS) from the LEOs. The Scheme offers the opportunity for businesses to develop their website or digital marketing strategy by availing of vouchers of up to &euro;2,500 or 50% of eligible expenditure.</p>  <p>  Anyone with a viable business proposal can also use the LEO to make an application to MicroFinance Ireland, which offers support in the form of loans of up to &euro;25,000 to start-ups with viable business propositions that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by the banks. Successful applicants can avail of a more favourable interest rate from MFI if they make their application through the LEO.</p>  <p>  The LEO Capital budget was increased by four million in 2017 and was retained this year, bringing the total Capital funding to &euro;22.5m. </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland supports companies in regional and rural areas to start, innovate and remain competitive in international markets, now and into the future. Enterprise Ireland provide a range of financial and non-financial supports for home-grown business start-ups to scale and succeed in international markets, these supports are tailored to a company&rsquo;s stage of growth and level of ambition.   </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s focus for 2018 is to help clients, including homegrown business start-ups to build on the strength of their 2017 performance by supporting them to innovate, be competitive and to diversify their global footprint -  key attributes required to be resilient to economic shocks:</p>  <p>  - launched a new Market Discovery Fund to incentivise companies to research viable and sustainable market entry strategies in new geographic markets; and</p>  <p>  - launched a new fast-track Agile Innovation Fund which gives companies rapid access to innovation funding to enhance processes and adapt products for new markets.</p>  <p>  - Providing supports such as The Be Prepared Grant and the Act On consultancy grant to assist companies, such as homegrown business start-ups. </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland will continue to work with homegrown business start-ups to assist them scale and succeed in international markets.</p>  <p>  I should also draw your attention to the &lsquo;Supporting SMEs&rsquo; Online Tool, which is a cross-governmental initiative to help start-ups navigate the range of Government business supports for which they could be eligible. The tool is available at www.supportingsmes.ie By answering the eight questions in the Online Tool, a small business will, in one location, be able to:</p>  <p>  - find out which of the over 170 Government business supports from 27 different Government Departments, Agencies and Initiatives are available to them;</p>  <p>  - obtain information on the range of Government supports for accessing credit;</p>  <p>  - identify their nearest Local Enterprise Office where they can discuss the outcomes of the guide further;</p>  <p>  - download all these filtered results into a document for their further use.</p></reply>

The Group has a broad sectorial membership including representatives from the business community, education and training providers, trade unions, and a small number of Government Departments and agencies. </p>  <p>  The Group&rsquo;s mandate is to carry out research, analysis and horizon scanning in relation to emerging skills requirements at thematic and sectorial levels. This analysis can include the identification of any reasons for shortages or barriers to participation in particular sectors. Its follow up work involves engagement with the Department of Education and Skills, Higher Education Authority, SOLAS and other relevant bodies to produce an agreed action plan to address the skills needs identified. </p>  <p>  Recently completed and ongoing work being undertaken by the EGFSN includes analyses of skills needs or skills implications relevant to the food and drink sector, design, high level ICT, trade related skill sets in the context of Brexit and digitalisation.</p>  <p>  As part of the new national skills architecture, the EGFSN presents its findings to the National Skills Council, chaired by the Minister for Education and Skills, which, together with additional skills and labour market intelligence provided by the Regional Skills Fora, Skills and Labour Market Research Unit (SLMRU) in SOLAS, and information on employment permit trends, provides a mechanism for mediating demands on resources in a manner that facilitates the prioritisation of investment in identified skills needs, and enhancing the responses by education and training providers to provision and delivery of those needs.</p>  <p>  The research of the EGFSN and the SLMRU also informs my Department&rsquo;s Economic Migration Policy Unit. This Unit has the responsibility for the employment permits system which is managed by the operation of the Highly Skilled Eligible Occupations List and the Ineligible Categories List. The employment permits regime is designed to facilitate the entry of appropriately skilled non-EEA migrants to fill skills shortages. The objective is balanced by the need to ensure that there are no suitably qualified Irish/EEA nationals available to undertake the work and the shortage is a genuine one. The rationale underpinning the inclusion or omission from the occupation lists is informed by EGFSN, the SLMRU and is augmented by a consultation process that includes calls for submissions. This process is regularly reviewed to ensure that it is operating efficiently. </p>  <p>  The analysis of the Expert Group on Future Skills has been reflected in the overarching strategies for the education and training system published in recent years. These include Ireland&rsquo;s National Skills Strategy 2025, and the Action Plan for Education 2016-2019, including its associated annual implementation plans, both of which have been developed by the Department of Education and Skills. </p>  <p>  This analysis has also informed the development of my own Department&rsquo;s framework policy for enterprise policy, Enterprise 2025- Ireland&rsquo;s National Enterprise Policy 2015-2025, its recent refresh, Enterprise 2025 Renewed, and the instrument for the annual implementation of the objectives set out in Enterprise 2025,   the Action Plan for Jobs, which seeks to create the optimum conditions for job creation within the economy, including through ready availability of relevant skills and talent.</p></reply>

These bodies are independent in the delivery of their quasi-judicial functions, in which I as Minister have no role.  This approach has served Ireland well over the years and in a large number of high profile disputes.  </p>  <p>  I understand that the case in question relates to a redundancy payment situation that was heard by the Labour Court on 23 March 2018 and that the Court recommended a payment in excess of the statutory redundancy payment amount.</p>  <p>  The Labour Court engages with parties in industrial relations disputes in which resolution of issues at local level has not proved possible. In such instances, the dispute can be referred to the Court for an opinion in the form of a recommendation of the Court.</p>  <p>  However, in line with the voluntary nature of industrial relations in Ireland, it is the case that recommendations of the Labour Court are not binding on the parties although of course it is expected that Labour Court recommendation are given serious consideration by the parties involved.</p></reply>

The Government&rsquo;s immediate concern is for those workers and their families that are directly affected by this announcement. Every relevant State support will, of course, be made available to these employees. </p>  <p>  The IDA will also be working with the company to complete a skills audit on the current employee base which will be shared with local enterprise in the region. The Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection is aware of the situation as well and we will be collectively, across Government, doing our utmost to help these workers transition and find new employment opportunities. </p>  <p>  While this news in respect of Fullwood Packo is deeply regrettable, it is important to emphasise that the overall trend in terms of job creation in Ireland is very positive. 2017, for example, was another record year for the State in terms of FDI-driven employment and investment, and strong employment growth is expected to continue in 2018. </p>  <p>  The Government is committed to supporting job creation in the regions and my Department and its agencies are working towards ambitious targets to ensure that employment and investment are distributed as evenly as possible across the country. The employment situation on the South West, which covers Cork and Kerry, has been steadily improving in recent years. IDA Ireland client companies in Cork alone now employ over 35,000, representing an increase of 48% since 2010.</p></reply>

Research commissioned by my Department estimates significant exposure to Brexit in our Agri Food, Pharmaceutical, Electrical Machinery, Wholesale and Retail and Air Transport Sectors.  </p>  <p>  There are, of course, other challenges too, such as the imposition by the US of tariffs on imports of steel and aluminium to the US, including from the EU.</p>  <p>  In the context of these challenges, I believe that we have the right policies to build resilience where possible and firmly strengthen our competitiveness and innovative capacity, thus ensuring the economy is properly positioned to meet any external challenges.  "Enterprise 2025 Renewed" and "Building Stronger Business; Responding to Brexit by Competing Innovating and Trading" are part of that policy mix. </p>  <p>  Last month the Government formally launched the &ldquo;Global Ireland &ndash; Ireland&rsquo;s Global Footprint to 2025&rdquo; initiative which will double the scope and impact of Ireland&rsquo;s global footprint in the period to 2025.  Global Ireland 2025 will support Ireland&rsquo;s efforts to grow and diversify export markets, inward investment and tourism. It will ensure that Ireland is better positioned to build the alliances necessary to advance its interests and defend its positions in a post-Brexit EU, while also helping to secure our deep and positive relationship with the UK and its constituent parts into the future. Global Footprint 2025 envisages further increases in our enterprise agency global footprint and Embassy network. </p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s Trade Strategy, &lsquo;Ireland Connected: Trading and Investing in a Dynamic World&rsquo;, supports an extensive programme of Ministerial-led trade missions, as part of a major drive towards market diversification.  This includes markets that are growing and have scale as well as markets where we are already well established but with potential for further growth.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s Enterprise 2025 Renewed strategy published in March 2018 sets out targets for export growth and diversification within the indigenous exporting base, with ambitions to increase exports as a percentage of total sales of Irish owned companies from 52 percent to between 55 and 60 percent by 2020 and increase Enterprise Ireland client exports beyond UK markets from &euro;14.1 billion to &euro;17.4 billion by 2020.  The strategy also targets a 50 percent increase in the number of FDI investments from non-US markets by 2020. </p>  <p>  In 2017, Enterprise Ireland launched its Eurozone Strategy as a key element of its supports to help companies diversify their export markets. In particular, it aims to increase exports to the Eurozone by &euro;2bn per annum by 2020, equivalent to 50 percent increase. This would represent one of the most significant shifts in Enterprise Ireland supported client exports into the Eurozone and is particularly important in the context of Brexit. </p>  <p>  As well as the global efforts supported by our Enterprise Agencies, key to our success has been our commitment to trade liberalisation in order to open new markets for our indigenous sectors.  The EU suite of Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with third countries help to open new markets, break down barriers and provide new opportunities for Irish based firms.  Brexit has reinforced the importance of accelerating the delivery of EU trade deals with leading economies and regional blocs.  We continue to support the EU&rsquo;s ambitious programme of negotiating new Free Trade Agreements giving Irish based firms expanded market access and a predictable trading environment in third countries, including SMEs.  To this end, my Department has commissioned a major examination of the economic opportunities and impacts for Ireland arising from EU Free Trade Agreements which will be available later this year.  The objective is to deepen our understanding of how Ireland can best take advantage of these opportunities, and ensure that our businesses are prepared to access new markets.</p></reply>

Improving competitiveness performance is a core focus for Government, and as part of this work my Department, its agencies and the National Competitiveness Council are continually engaged with relevant stakeholders on the particular policy needs required to strengthen our international competitiveness. </p>  <p>  In its 2017 Competitiveness Challenge Report, the Council has identified a range of threats to Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness, including the potential impact of Brexit, the concentration of our export markets and the range of products and services exported.</p>  <p>  At firm level, Enterprise Ireland (EI) actively supports firms to develop new products and services for new and existing markets. EI&rsquo;s Strategy 2017-20 &ldquo;Build Scale-Expand Reach&rdquo; looks to increase the reach of its client company exports, with two-thirds of exports going beyond the UK.  To broaden the export footprint across the globe, the EI Strategy focuses on training and supports to enhance management capability, leadership and productivity, marketing/sales skills, innovation and R&amp;D, access to funding to help companies to build market share and create new market opportunities.</p>  <p>  Sustaining and growing jobs and diversifying the export base is a challenge when aligned with the key objective of reducing the overall dependence on the UK market as a percentage of overall exports. Therefore, my Department has allocated additional funding in both 2017 and 2018 to enable EI achieve its objectives.</p>  <p>  Extra staff has been placed in EI&rsquo;s overseas offices with sectorial knowledge and expertise such as in engineering, food, life sciences and construction. This will drive export growth to international markets where there are known opportunities and reduce reliance on the UK. </p>  <p>  There is now a major focus on directing resources and expertise to the Eurozone markets where EI sees opportunities, targeting a 50% increase in exports by 2020. A new &lsquo;Irish Advantage&rsquo; communications campaign is targeting Eurozone buyers to buy Irish innovation in key Brexit impacted sectors.</p>  <p>  There are also significant opportunities in various other international markets for quality Irish goods and services. The future relative importance and forecasted growth rates of China, India, the South-East Asian countries, the Gulf States, Latin America and Africa combined with the scale of these markets means we will support Irish companies to continue to work to build exports in these markets. In January of this year, EI launched its new Market Discovery Fund to help more Irish companies accelerate their market diversification efforts. </p>  <p>  EI is undertaking 200 international and domestic trade events in 2018 to accelerate the number of EI clients diversifying into new markets, beyond the UK and into the Eurozone and global markets. The number of trade events being undertaken represents a 50% increase on 2017, reflecting the serious challenge that Brexit poses for Irish businesses.</p>  <p>  A more diverse export base can reduce exposure to external demand shocks, exchange rate fluctuations and instability in export earnings and enhance growth and jobs.  I will continue to work with my Department and EI to ensure Irish-based exporters, particularly in exposed sectors such as traditional manufacturing and agrifood, will continue to be supported to scale and diversify sustainably and strategically. </p>  <p>  Innovation remains at the forefront of any business to ensure that they grow and expand to ensure they are at a level to compete on the EU and global markets effectively.  Innovation involves helping companies improve competitiveness by developing new processes, products or services or by modernising and adapting current processes, products or services to bring them to a standard that will allow the company to enter new and existing markets internationally.  Innovation is an essential component in a company&rsquo;s ability to maintain a competitive edge in overseas markets.  EI has a suite of supports available to assist client companies innovate and develop their enterprise.  These supports help new and existing companies to develop new and improved products and services which serve as the basis for sustainable export growth.</p></reply>

Supporting research and innovation will therefore continue to remain an integral part of Ireland&rsquo;s campaign to maximise impact in EU and global markets. Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s support for research, development and innovation involves helping companies improve their competitiveness through the development of new processes, products or services or by modernising and adapting current processes, products or services to bring them to a standard that will allow the company to enter new and existing markets internationally.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland's core objective is to help companies start, grow, innovate and win export sales in global markets and there are financial and non-financial supports available at every stage of that journey to the point where companies are in a position to export to new markets. Enterprise Ireland supported clients have grown and achieved total exports of over &euro;21bn per annum and achieved the benefits of same such as increased profits and company growth. Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s strategic aim is to increase this figure to &euro;26bn per annum by 2020. </p>  <p>  In terms of innovation, more specifically, Enterprise Ireland supports and de-risks RDI by supporting companies to do RDI in-house, by supporting collaboration with Higher Education Institutions (HEIs); or by sourcing/licensing new technologies from HEIs which can provide a step change in their innovative capabilities.  At the same time Enterprise Ireland has supports in place to help companies maximise the funding they can receive from the European Union through programmes such as Horizon 2020.  These supports all help new and existing companies to develop new and improved products and services which serve as the basis for sustainable economic growth.</p>  <p>  Brexit is forcing Irish companies employ RDI in a bid to protect their current exports in the UK and to explore different markets and innovation will continue to play a central role in this regard.  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s annual business results survey shows that companies that invest in innovation are higher performing in terms of employment, export sales and are more sustainable through recessionary and other economic shocks such as Brexit.  It is essential that Irish companies produce products and services that are more novel than their competitors, better performing, more efficiently delivered, and cost effective for their customers.   </p>  <p>  There are a wide range of Enterprise Ireland RD&amp;I Programmes available to companies and they all contribute hugely to company development, growth and expansion, some of which are outlined below: </p>  <p>  In Company RD&amp;I</p>  <p>  In Company RD&amp;I supports the development of new or substantially improved products, services or processes which will have a competitive advantage in their target market. The Agile Innovation Fund launched in Quarter 4 2017 now facilitates fast track approval of such awards. </p>  <p>  Commercialisation Fund </p>  <p>  The Commercialisation Fund is aimed at improving the competitiveness of Irish industry through both the creation of technology-based companies and through the development of licenses.  It is available for projects that address a gap or need in the market by developing innovations that will ideally be ready for licensing to Irish industry or may form the basis of a new start-within 5 years.</p>  <p>  Innovation Vouchers </p>  <p>  The Innovation Voucher initiative provides vouchers worth &euro;5,000 to small businesses to introduce them to research, development and innovation, linking them with a network of knowledge providers, North and South of the border.  </p>  <p>  Innovation Partnerships </p>  <p>  The Innovation Partnership programme helps industry to engage in collaborative research projects with Irish universities and Institutes of Technology to develop new products and services.</p>  <p>  Technology Gateways </p>  <p>  The Technology Gateway Programme provides Business Development resources to the Institutes of Technology to help them interact with industry on a local, regional and national basis.</p>  <p>  Technology Centres</p>  <p>  Technology Centres are organised to respond rapidly to industry defined needs and conduct market-relevant R&amp;D in partnership with collaborating groups of companies.</p>  <p>  Campus Incubators </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland funding has supported the development of a national network of business innovation centres and specialist bio-incubation facilities. Incubators now exist on every university and Institute of Technology Campus in the country. Such facilities are internationally recognised as an important element of public assistance for technology intensive start-ups. They are also an important driver of regional development with the majority of companies remaining in their region after they have completed their incubation period.  </p>  <p>  EU Funding</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland continues to lead the Horizon 2020 National Support Network in order to secure as much Irish engagement with this funding programme as possible.  This assistance available from the European Union for new enterprises, is the instrument which supports collaborative R&amp;D in Europe and provides an important source of non-exchequer funding for companies. Irish companies that compete successfully for funding from Horizon 2020 will boost their innovative capability and competitiveness which in turn will deliver strong national economic impacts, including job creation, exports and sales.</p>  <p>The Horizon 2020 SME Instrument   is available and is specifically for single or groups of highly innovative SMEs with international ambitions, determined to turn strong, innovative business ideas into winners on the market.  The instrument provides full-cycle business innovation support from the stage of business idea conception and planning over business plan execution and demonstration to commercialisation. </p>  <p>The research and innovation supports provided by Enterprise Ireland and other agencies of my Department will be complemented by the Government&rsquo;s new &euro;500 million Disruptive Technologies Innovation Fund  .

Research undertaken by EI in 2012 found that there were a number of key inhibitors to female entrepreneurship rates and developed an integrated strategy to address these issues and increase the number of female-founded start-ups in Ireland.</p>  <p>  One of the key ways in which EI supports female entrepreneurship is through its dedicated Competitive Start Funds.  The first Competitive Start Fund for Female Entrepreneurs was launched in 2012.  Since then there have been 8 dedicated female competitive start funds.</p>  <p>  The purpose of these targeted Funds is to accelerate the growth of female founded start-up companies that have the potential to employ more than 10 people and achieve &euro;1 million in export sales within three years.  This is achieved by putting a &euro;50,000 equity investment in the company.  The Funds are designed to enable companies to reach key commercial and technical milestones, which will ensure the delivery of their product or service to an international audience. </p>  <p>  The most recent Competitive Start Fund for female entrepreneurs, which I launched earlier this year, made a total of &euro;1m funding available for up to 20 female-led companies.  EI received over 100 funding applications for this Fund and the final selection for funding is currently taking place.</p>  <p>  In 2017, 46 per cent of all companies who received CSF investment from Enterprise Ireland were female founded.</p>  <p>  Another key Enterprise Ireland initiative is the Going for Growth programme.  Currently in its 10th cycle, the initiative supports female entrepreneurs who have been trading for at least two years and are strongly focussed on growth.  For zero fee, participants are offered a unique learning environment with a peer-led approach based on the shared experiences of both the Lead Entrepreneur and the other participants facing similar challenges.  Feedback shows that participants&rsquo; businesses experienced a growth in sales over the 9th cycle of over &euro;20million and employment rose by 17.5%.</p>  <p>  Every year EI holds a Fuelling Ambition Roadshow, which aims to encourage, support and drive the ambition of female entrepreneurs (existing and new) nationally by showcasing thriving Irish female entrepreneurs.  A total of 7 roadshow events were held in 2018, attended by c600 female entrepreneurs, across the country during March, April and May in Waterford, Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Killarney, Monaghan and Roscommon.  </p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) are also actively engaged in encouraging and inspiring an increase in female-led businesses through initiatives such as the annual National Women&rsquo;s Enterprise Day and the Women in Business Networks.  Last year we saw the National Women&rsquo;s Enterprise Day rolled out on a regional basis.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s Best Young Entrepreneur (IBYE) Programme, run by the LEOS, has also been strongly supportive of female entrepreneurs.  Since it began in 2014 over 1430 applicants (over 37% of total applicants) have been female.</p>  <p>  We are making progress.  The number of female founded start-ups supported by EI has increased from 12 in 2011 to 67 in 2017.  This includes a significant increase in the proportion of female founded High Potential Start-ups supported by EI which accounted for 28% of EI HPSUs in 2017 compared to 7% in 2011.  In addition, 61% of participants attending LEO training programmes in 2017 were female while 46% of the LEO mentoring participants were female. </p>  <p>  I feel confident that with continued support we will continue to see increases in female led businesses in Ireland.</p></reply>

This is the EU programme which supports research and innovation throughout the 28 EU Member States.  Funding is secured for the final work programme for Horizon 2020 which will run until the end of 2020.  Brexit is therefore not expected to have a significant impact upon the activity or the funding for Horizon 2020.</p>  <p>  In terms of European research and innovation activities, the UK is one of a number of important collaborators for Ireland under Horizon 2020.  In addition to the UK, Ireland has a diversified range of collaborative links with Member States, particularly Germany, Spain and France.  An analysis of Ireland's collaborations under Horizon 2020 indicates that collaborations occur in multi partner projects and that Ireland is not overly dependent on the UK for scientific collaboration in successful EU programmes. </p>  <p>  The European Commission has recently published its proposals for the next Framework Programme, named Horizon Europe.  The new proposal contains an increase in overall funding for the support of research and innovation in the remaining 27 member states, and is currently under discussion between the Commission and the Member States.  </p>  <p>  The UK has indicated that it would like the option to fully associate with the EU's research and innovation programmes.</p></reply>

Nevertheless, multinational companies continue to invest and re-invest here with leading global firms from many sectors - including life sciences, ICT, engineering and digital media - all based in Ireland.  The contribution that these investments make to our wider economy is undoubtedly significant and the Government is working hard to ensure that the country remains a destination of choice for overseas firms. </p>  <p>  Ireland's strengths when it comes to attracting FDI are well-documented.  These include our competitiveness, talented and productive workforce, favourable demographics and membership of the European Union.  Our pro-enterprise business environment, and track record as a home to FDI, are also key factors.  Reinforcing and sustaining these strengths is important to ensuring Ireland's continuing FDI competitiveness. </p>  <p>  The IDA's 2017 Annual Results provides evidence of our continuing capacity to attract FDI to Ireland.  Total employment by overseas companies in Ireland has now surpassed 210,000 people - a record level - with the numbers of investments also increasing.  We are also attracting more investment to the regions.</p></reply>

The KDB provides an effective 6.25% rate of corporation tax which is internationally competitive.  The KDB complements the existing suite of initiatives available to companies that undertake R&amp;D activities in Ireland across the life cycle of research and development &ndash; providing a competitive proposition for continued business investment. </p>  <p>  The continuing imperative to establish Ireland as the best place in which to succeed in business is reinforced in our national Enterprise and Innovation strategies - strategies based on export-led growth, underpinned by innovation and talent - strategies that aim to embed resilience, to deliver sustainable employment opportunities and a higher standard of living for all. </p>  <p>  As a key part of Ireland's competitive offering as a location of choice from which to do business, the KDB has helped secure investment since its introduction in 2016.  It will continue to form part of Ireland's proposition and stimulate further investment in R&amp;D activities by both Irish and foreign owned enterprises - ultimately delivering jobs and economic substance in Ireland.</p></reply>

The annual cost of the Mobility Allowance scheme at the time that it closed was &euro;9.3 million.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Motorised Transport Grant, this scheme operated as a means-tested grant to assist person with severe disabilities with the purchase or adaptation of a car, where that car was essential to retain employment.  The maximum Motorised Transport Grant, which was payable once in any three year period, was &euro;5,020.  Following the closure of the scheme in February 2013, no further Motorised Transport Grants have been payable.  The annual cost of the Motorised Transport Grant scheme at the time that it closed was &euro;1.3 million.</p>  <p>  The Government decided that the detailed preparatory work required for a new Transport Support Scheme and associated statutory provisions should be progressed by the Minister for Health.  The Programme for a Partnership Government acknowledges the ongoing drafting of primary legislation for a new Transport Support Scheme, to assist those with a disability to meet their mobility costs.  The Health (Transport Support) Bill is on the list of priority legislation for publication in the Spring/Summer session 2018.  </p>  <p>  My colleague, the Minister for Health and I recently brought a Memorandum to Government for proposals for a new Transport Support Payment Scheme.  Following consideration of the matter, it was decided to withdraw the Memorandum from the Cabinet agenda on 8 May last.  I intend to revert to Government with revised proposals to reflect the discussion at Cabinet, in due course.</p>  <p>  While I cannot comment on the specific proposals under consideration, I can confirm that the proposals seek to ensure that:</p>  <p>  - There is a firm statutory basis to the Scheme's operation;</p>  <p>  - There is transparency and equity in the eligibility criteria attaching to the Scheme;</p>  <p>  - Resources are targeted at those with the greatest needs; and</p>  <p>  - The Scheme is capable of being costed and is affordable on its introduction and on an ongoing basis.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers scheme, operated by the Revenue Commissioners, remains in place.  This scheme provides VRT and VAT relief, an exemption from road tax and a fuel grant to drivers and passengers with a disability, who qualify under the relevant criteria set out in governing regulations made by the Minister for Finance.  Specifically adapted vehicles driven by persons with a disability are also exempt from payment of tolls on national roads and toll bridges.  Transport Infrastructure Ireland has responsibility for this particular scheme.</p>  <p>  There are improvements in access to a range of transport support schemes available to persons with disabilities in the State and on-going work is being carried out by Government Departments, agencies and transport providers to further improve access to public transport services.  Under the National Disability Inclusion Strategy, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has responsibility for the continued development of accessibility and availability of public transport for people with a disability.</p></reply>

There is no provision under the GMS GP contract for persons who hold a medical card or GP visit card to be charged for routine phlebotomy services provided by their GP which are required to either assist in the diagnosis of illness or the treatment of a condition.</p>  <p>  The HSE has advised GPs that where a blood test forms part of the investigation or necessary treatment of a patient&rsquo;s symptoms or conditions, this should be free of charge for patients who hold a medical card or GP visit card.  Notwithstanding this, I am aware that some GPs have begun to charge GMS patients for phlebotomy services in some circumstances.  </p>  <p>  This is a matter of concern for me as it has long been the position, under successive Governments, that no user charges should apply to GP services provided to GMS and GP visit card patients.  If a patient who holds a medical card or GP visit card believes he or she has been incorrectly charged for routine phlebotomy services by his or her GP, then that patient may take the matter up with their HSE Local Health Office, who will investigate the complaint.</p>  <p>  If the local office determines that the charge was inappropriate, it will inform the HSE Primary Care Reimbursement Service who will arrange to refund the cost of the blood test to the patient and recoup this amount from the GP.  The local office will inform the GP of the decision to deduct the payment.</p></reply>

This Framework sets out the staffing requirements and skill mix needed in our hospital wards to achieve the best outcomes for patients.  It sets out a framework to determine the appropriate number of nurses and healthcare assistants required for each ward, based on the number of patients and their particular needs, rather than solely on the ward size.  My Department is currently in the process of undertaking a similar exercise to establish appropriate staffing levels in Emergency Departments and the Department will publish its findings in due course.  </p>  <p>  I am also aware that a WRC agreement was reached with the INMO in 2016 in relation to nursing staff levels in Emergency Departments.  The parties recently reaffirmed their commitment to this agreement.</p>  <p>  In terms of the recommended staff to patient ratio in the Emergency Department in University Hospital Kerry, I have asked the HSE to reply directly to the Deputy on that matter.</p></reply>

In addition to population needs, international trends and the findings of a public consultation process, the development of the Strategy was informed by previous reports and experiences of our maternity services, both positive and negative. Indeed, the development of the Strategy delivered on a recommendation from the report, Investigation into the safety, quality and standards of services provided by the Health Service Executive to patients, including pregnant women, at risk of clinical deterioration, including those provided in University Hospital Galway, and as reflected in the care and treatment provided to Savita Halappanavar.  Consequently, many recommendations made in past reports are addressed in the Strategy.</p>  <p>  The Strategy aims to ensure that appropriate care pathways - Supported, Assisted and Specialised - are in place in order that mothers, babies and families get the right care, at the right time, by the right team and in the right place.  It recognises that, while all pregnant women need a certain level of support, some will require more specialised care.  Accordingly, it proposes an integrated model that delivers care at the lowest level of complexity and encompasses all the necessary safety nets in line with patient safety principles.  </p>  <p>  The phased implementation of the Strategy is being led by the National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme, which has been established in the HSE to lead the management, organisation and delivery of maternity, gynaecology and neonatal services across primary, community and acute care.  One of the Programme's objectives is to ensure, where relevant, that learning from individual sites is disseminated to all maternity hospitals/units nationwide.</p>  <p>  Additional development funding of &euro;4.15 million is being allocated to maternity services this year.  The Programme has prioritised improving quality and safety, establishing community midwifery teams and increasing access to anomaly scans.  Such initiatives represent essential building blocks to provide a consistently safe and high quality maternity service and will continue to deliver tangible benefits for the 80,000 families who access maternity care each year.</p></reply>

Majority of those with the disease are seen in the two centres of expertise - Our Lady's Children Hospital in Crumlin and St. James's Hospital. To ensure an early diagnosis and prevent early deaths, the team at Crumlin, over many years, organised a neo-natal screening in the majority of maternity hospitals.</p>  <p>  Sickle cell disease, among many other rare diseases, is addressed as part of the generic policy framework in the National Rare disease plan which was published in 2014.  The scope of the plan is broad given that there are 8,000 rare diseases approximately affecting millions of EU citizens; and consequently, there can be a dearth of expertise and knowledge about some rare diseases, simply because they are so rare.</p>  <p>  One of the achievements of the Rare Disease Plan was to encourage designated centres of expertise to participate in European Reference Networks (ERNs) for Rare Diseases. ERNs are European networks connecting health care providers and centres of expertise so that international expertise on specific rare diseases may be pooled together for the benefit of patients. Any centre applying for membership of an ERN must have strategies in place to ensure that care is patient-centred; that patient' rights and preferences are respected; and must show a research component to their work.</p>  <p>  The recommendations in the national plan related to empowering and protecting patients and carers, and research on rare diseases will be fulfilled in part through this process. It is expected that ERNs will have a major structuring effect by linking thematic expert centres across the EU. </p>  <p>  With the encouragement of the National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases and the Department of Health, five centres of expertise were designated in June 2016 during the first round of calls from the European Commission for participation in European Reference Networks. Three of these designated centres applied for membership of ERNs and two were approved.</p>  <p>  The issue of rare diseases and of the creation of an all-island patient register has been raised in the context of on-going discussions at North-South meetings. It is also anticipated that the Model of Care for Rare Diseases will set out recommendations for rare disease registries. This model of care is in development by the National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases. At the EU level, the Joint Research Centre is developing a joint European Platform on Rare Disease Registration which will promote EU level standards for data collection and contribute to the development of rare disease registries across the EU. </p>  <p>  As Minister I consider meeting any organisation that requests to do so.  However due to busy parliamentary and other business it is not always possible to meet all representative groups that contact my office.  </p>  <p>  In respect of the other issues raised, I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Task Force consisted of a Strategy Group and an Advisory &amp;amp; Consultative Group.  It included officials from the relevant Government Departments and agencies, HSE, academic and policy experts, stakeholder organisations and a wide range of people with lived experience of disability and disability services (both intellectual and physical).  </p>  <p>  Its remit was to consider people whose primary disability was physical or sensory, intellectual, autism, neurological or any combination of these and to make recommendations on personalised budgets models which will give people with disabilities more control in accessing health funded personal social services, giving them greater independence and choice in accessing services which best meet their individual needs. The Report, which I intend to publish in the near future, will outline the next steps for the development of personalised budgets in Ireland.</p></reply>

The Task Force consisted of a Strategy Group and an Advisory &amp;amp; Consultative Group.  It included officials from the relevant Government Departments and agencies, HSE, academic and policy experts, stakeholder organisations and a wide range of people with lived experience of disability and disability services (both intellectual and physical).  </p>  <p>  Its remit was to consider people whose primary disability was physical or sensory, intellectual, autism, neurological or any combination of these and to make recommendations on personalised budgets models which will give people with disabilities more control in accessing health funded personal social services, giving them greater independence and choice in accessing services which best meet their individual needs. I have considered the findings of the Task Force Report and intend to publish it in the near future.</p></reply>

The cost of all inpatient and daycase activity is calculated as part of the Activity Based Funding (ABF) system for acute hospitals. However, the resulting ABF price only applies to public patients because certain costs which would be relevant to private patients are funded through the block grant to these hospitals. A new methodology and detailed costing study would therefore be required in order to accurately calculate the full economic cost of private activity. This matter will be considered as part of the further roll-out of the ABF funding model. </p></reply>

For example, the reference basket of countries, used to set drug prices in Ireland, has been expanded from 9 to 14 countries, including lower cost countries. Also, the Agreement now provides for an annual price realignment, so that Irish medicine prices can be reduced in line with price reductions across the reference countries.  This will ensure the State achieves better value for money on medicines as prices in other basket countries are adjusted downwards over time. In addition, the Agreement provides for a 30% reduction in the price of biologic medicines when a biosimilar medicine enters the market.</p><p>A key focus of this agreement is to achieve lower prices in the face of both demographic pressures on expenditure and the continued development of new medicines, many of which pose affordability challenges to the Irish health service and internationally.</p><p>The estimated saving for 2018 from the Agreement is &euro;185 m.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-07-10a.1281.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1261" speakername="Jim Daly" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018071000091#WRDD00700"><p>In advancement of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to promote community-care so that people can continue to live independently in their own homes for as long as possible, the Department of Health is currently engaged in the development of a new, stand-alone statutory scheme and system of regulation for home-care services.</p>  <p>  The new home-care scheme will introduce clear rules in relation to the services for which individuals are eligible and in relation to service-allocation. It will therefore be an important step in ensuring that the system operates in a consistent and fair manner and will help to improve access to home-care services on an affordable and sustainable basis. The introduction of a system of regulation for home-care will help to ensure public confidence in the services provided. The new scheme will also be designed to support family/unpaid carers and will complement and integrate effectively with other health and social-care services such as long-term residential care (including the Nursing Homes Support Scheme), primary and community services and hospital services. </p>  <p>  As an initial step in the development of the new scheme, the Department of Health commissioned the Health Research Board to undertake a review of the home-care systems in place in four European countries. The review, which was published last April, will help to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s new home-care scheme and system of regulation is informed by international experience. In addition a public consultation on the financing and regulation of home-care was undertaken last year. The purpose of this consultation, to which approximately 2,600 submissions were received, was to enable the Department to find out about the views of service-users, their families and healthcare workers on current and future home-care provision. A report on the findings of the consultation was published on 26   June and will inform the development of the new scheme. Further consultation with service-users will take place later this year, in addition to which the Department is actively engaging with the key NGOs and representative groups. </p>  <p>  The development of a statutory scheme and system of regulation for home-care services is a complex undertaking. While the publication of the HRB review and of the report on the findings of the public consultation represent important milestones in the process of developing the new scheme, a significant amount of additional work remains to be carried out before final decisions are taken on the form of the home-care scheme and system of regulation. This is required if the reforms are to be successful, affordable and sustainable. The Department will continue to prioritise its work in developing the new scheme and every effort will be made to progress this matter as quickly as possible. However a realistic timeframe for the establishment of the new scheme on a statutory basis is 2&ndash;3 years.</p>  <p>  While the new home-care scheme is under development, the Department of Health and Health Service Executive are continuing efforts to improve existing home-care services. In 2018 the HSE brought the funding for home help and Home Care Packages together into a single home support service for older people. As well as simplifying the application-process for home-care, the new service will be more responsive to service-users' changing needs. More broadly the HSE will continue to encourage local integration of services and to build appropriate care-pathways, in particular for people with complex needs. A consumer-directed approach to home-support provision will be introduced, giving service-users greater choice in relation to when they receive services and their selection of a service-provider. This enhancement of current service-provision is being supported by increased investment in home-care services. In line with the commitment in A Programme for a Partnership Government (2016) to increase funding for home-care annually, funding for Older Persons&rsquo; Services rose from &euro;763m in 2017 to &euro;811m in 2018, including approximately &euro;417m for the provision of home-support services. </p></reply>

In addition, Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 precludes me from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual. It would be inappropriate to comment on the cases of individual patients.</p><p>In Ireland the majority of patients&rsquo; access medicines through the publicly funded Community Drug Schemes.</p><p>In line with the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, if a company would like a medicine to be reimbursed by the HSE and available through the community drugs schemes, the company must first submit an application to the HSE to have the new medicine added to the reimbursement list.</p><p>The HSE strives to reach a decision in as timely a manner as possible. However, because of the significant monies involved, it must ensure that the best price is achieved, as these commitments are often multi-million euro investments on an on-going basis. This can lead to a protracted deliberation process.</p><p>Pembrolizumab is currently reimbursed for the following indications:</p><p>- Pembrolizumab (Keytruda) as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma in adults.</p><p>- Pembrolizumab (Keytruda) as monotherapy is indicated for the first-line treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) in adults whose tumours express PD-L1 with a ≥ 50% tumour proportion score (TPS) with no EGFR or ALK positive tumour mutations.</p><p>I have been informed by the HSE that they are currently deliberating on the following indications for reimbursement:</p><p>- Pembrolizumab (Keytruda) as a monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma who have failed autologous stem cell transplant and brentuximab vedotin (BV), or who are transplant-ineligible and have failed BV.</p><p>- Pembrolizumab (Keytruda) as a monotherapy for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC in adults whose tumours express PD-L1 with a ≥ 1% TPS and who have received at least one prior chemotherapy regimen. Patients with EGFR or ALK positive tumour mutations should also have received targeted therapy before receiving Keytruda.</p><p>The National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE) completed a health technology assessment on 28 May 2018 for the latter indication. They recommended that pembrolizumab (Keytruda) be considered for reimbursement if cost-effectiveness can be improved relative to existing treatments.  The HSE will now evaluate this application for reimbursement in line with criteria laid out within the 2013 Act before making a final reimbursement decision.</p><p>In addition to this, the HSE have commissioned HTAs on the following indications:</p><p>- Pembrolizumab (Keytruda) for the first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who are not eligible for cisplatin-containing chemotherapy.</p><p>- Pembrolizumab (Keytruda) as monotherapy for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma in adults who have received prior platinum-containing chemotherapy.</p><p>There are no other indications for Pembrolizumab approved in the European Union at this time. Clinical trials are ongoing globally in relation to a range of other possible indications which may receive marketing authorisation in the EU over the next number of years. Each of those indications will be considered for reimbursement as market authorisations are received.</p><p>Nivolumab is currently reimbursed for the following indications:</p><p>- Nivolumab (Opdivo) for monotherapy treatment for patients diagnosed with unresectable metastatic melanoma.</p><p>- Nivolumab (Opdivo) for the treatment of relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma after autologous stem cell transplant and treatment with brentuximab vedotin.</p><p>- Nivolumab (Opdivo) for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma after prior therapy in adults.</p><p>- Nivolumab (Opdivo) for the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) in adults progressing on or after platinum-based therapy.</p><p>- Nivolumab (Opdivo) plus ipilimumab (Yervoy) for the treatment of advanced melanoma.</p><p>The Department has been informed by the HSE that the following indications are currently in process for reimbursement:</p><p>- 2nd line use in locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in adult</p><p>- 2nd line use in locally advanced unresectable or metastatic urothelial carcinoma</p><p>- Adjuvant melanoma indication</p><p>These applications for reimbursement will be processed in line with the 2013 Act.</p><p>In relation to the issue of VAT exemption for self-funding patients, as you will appreciate that is a matter for my colleague Mr Paschal Donohoe TD, Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform for his attention.</p></reply>

This work will include identifying the appropriate specialist clinical expertise and facilities required at hospital group level and nationally to provide comprehensive aftercare services, including the role of specialist diagnostic services such as translabial scanning. Pending the completion of this work, there may be a need to look at sourcing services from abroad to address any immediate shortfalls identified, either through utilisation of the treatment abroad scheme or by commissioning services from abroad.</p><p>  A Learning Notice concerning mesh devices in uro-gynaecological procedures was circulated by the NWIHP on 26th June 2018 to all maternity hospitals and acute hospitals with gynaecological services to highlight the importance of appropriate patient selection, adequate information and consent and also to inform the service providers that a Response Group has been convened to propose remedies for and address the provision of aftercare for complications. This learning notice has been posted on the NWIHP website which can be found at this https://www.hse.ie/eng/about/who/acute-hospitals-division/woman-infants/quality-and-safety/learning-notice-0518-transvaginal-mesh.pdf.</p></reply>

The specific purpose of this Amendment Bill is to correct a typographical and technical error in the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015, which will facilitate the subsequent commencement of Parts 2 and 3 of that Act and makes no change to the policy intention of the Act of 2015.</p>  <p>  The Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 was enacted to modernise family law in a way that is inclusive of and sensitive to the reality of contemporary family life in Ireland and to meet the needs of children living in diverse family types.  Parts 2 and 3 of the Act, for which I am responsible, are key elements of the Act and are concerned with the rights of children conceived through the use of donor embryos or gametes. </p>  <p>  The Children and Family Relationships Act specifically relates to procedures where the intending mother is also the birth mother.  As such this Act does not encompass surrogacy. </p>  <p>  Provisions relating to the regulation of surrogacy are included in Part 6 of the General Scheme of the Assisted Human Reproduction Bill 2017.

I have received advice from the HSE and there is some further work required on the detail.  I have asked my Department to proceed without delay to engage with the HSE on the next steps in providing a modular lab.  This will include consideration of the specific details he requests regarding tendering, project design, planning processes, construction and commissioning work.</p>  <p>  The timeframe for the development of modular builds as outlined by the HSE must include tendering, project design work, planning, construction and commissioning so it will take until next year to deliver the modular cath lab.  I have committed that this will be funded in the 2019 Estimate.</p></reply>

This draft legislation sets out procedural safeguards to ensure that people in residential settings who lack capacity are not unlawfully deprived of their liberty.  The approach taken in the draft legislation makes use of the decision-making procedures, supports and safeguards that already exist under the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 and also includes some additional safeguards specific to deprivation of liberty.  The proposals build on the machinery of the Decision Support Service, which is provided for under this Act.  The 51 submissions that were received are currently being analysed.</p>  <p>  An Advisory Group comprised of key stakeholders has been formed to consider the findings of the public consultation, advise on appropriate amendments to the draft Heads of Bill and ensure that the approach taken integrates effectively with existing legislation.</p>  <p>  Every effort is being made to progress the legislation as quickly as possible and the implications of the recent Court of Appeal judgment will be considered as part of this process.

The programme includes a number of facilities in Donegal. Significant work was undertaken to determine the most optimum scheduling of projects within the phased provision of funding to achieve compliance and registration with the Health Information and Quality Authority.  Furthermore, the National Development Plan, published earlier this year as part of the Ireland 2040 policy initiative, acknowledges the need for additional capacity requirements and it is expected that 4,500 additional short-term and long-term beds will be required across the public system in Community Nursing Units and other step-down facilities, as identified by the Health Capacity Review.</p>  <p>  Under the NDP, health capital projects and programmes currently underway will continue -  including the Capital Investment Programme for Community Nursing Units.  These major priority projects and programmes will require the bulk of the notified capital allocation over the initial period of the Plan, 2018-2022.  It is important to recognise that the NDP is a long-term plan, which will roll out over ten years and includes provision for a large number of developments across the country.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Mental Health and Older People Jim Daly TD is aware of local concerns that have been raised relating to the future of long-stay residential care provision in the East Donegal area.  There is a process in place for the agreement and prioritisation of capital projects.  Since his visit to Donegal earlier this year officials from the Department have engaged with the HSE to ensure that investment in facilities in the area will meet the needs of the community.  The Minister is pleased to note that additional dementia beds are now available  within St Joseph's Hospital.</p></reply>

As Minister for Health, I do not have any statutory power or function in relation to the reimbursement of medicines.  The Act specifies the criteria for decisions on the reimbursement of medicines.  </p>  <p>  In line with the 2013 Act, if a company would like a medicine to be reimbursed by the HSE pursuant to the Community Drugs scheme, the company must first submit an application to the HSE to have the new medicine added to the Reimbursement List.  </p>  <p>  As outlined in the IPHA agreement, and in line with the 2013 Act, the HSE will decide, within 180 days of receiving the application (or a longer period if further information is sought from the company), to either add the medicine to the reimbursement list or agree to reimburse it as a hospital medicine, or refuse to reimburse the medicine.  </p>  <p>  HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE).  </p>  <p>  The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) for the HSE and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions.  The NCPE uses a decision framework to systematically assess whether a drug is cost-effective as a health intervention.  </p>  <p>  The HSE strives to reach a decision in as timely a manner as possible.  However, because of the significant monies involved, it must ensure that the best price is achieved, as these commitments are often multi-million euro investments on an on-going basis.  This can lead to a protracted deliberation process.  </p>  <p>  I have been informed that Ocrelizumab for the treatment of adult patients with early primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) and for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS) is currently undergoing a full pharmacoeconomic assessment by the NCPE.</p></reply>

This provides clear guidelines and procedures for staff to follow both in cases of suspected abuse and of neglect of vulnerable adults (including older people).  This safeguarding policy was the first such HSE policy to encompass both elder abuse and neglect as well as concerns of abuse and neglect relating to people availing of disability services.  </p>  <p>  The HSE has established a number of structures to implement its national safeguarding policy.  This includes a National Safeguarding Office, an advisory National Safeguarding Committee, Specialist Safeguarding and Protection Teams in each of the 9 CHO Areas, more than 1,500 designated safeguarding officers, and over 41,000 attendances at safeguarding policy and procedures training.  </p>  <p>  In December 2017 the Government approved the development of a national adult safeguarding policy for the health sector.  The policy will apply across the wide spectrum of the health sector, i.e. in the public, private and voluntary sectors, and will be supported by any necessary legislation.  </p>  <p>  A detailed review of the operation of the HSE&rsquo;s operational safeguarding policy is at an advanced stage and is expected to be completed soon.  The findings of the HSE&rsquo;s safeguarding review will assist the Department of Health&rsquo;s development of appropriate policy approaches for the wider health sector.  </p>  <p>  HIQA and the Mental Health Commission are currently in the process of jointly developing National Standards for Adult Safeguarding, with advisory input from the Department of Health among others.  </p>  <p>  Together these initiatives should greatly improve the safeguarding of adults at risk of abuse and neglect in the health sector.</p></reply>

Following detailed financial analysis the Minister decided to extend this Scheme to all persons in receipt of Carer's Benefit.  The legislation to provide this service, the Health (General Practitioner Service) Bill 2018 has been passed by the Seanad on 05 June 2018. </p>  <p>  The provision of medical cards to this particular cohort is not intended under this Bill.</p>  <p>  A detailed costing of the actual additional cost of providing a medical card to persons in receipt of either Carer's Allowance or Carer's Benefit, whom do not already hold a medical card, is not available as it would require an examination of the HSE and Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection datasets.</p>  <p>  However, the estimated total cost of providing a medical card to all recipients of Carer's Benefit and Carer's Allowance could be in the region of &euro;80 million.  This figure is based on the figures current in December 2017 for the number of recipients of Carer's Benefit and Carer's Allowance and the 2018 average cost of a medical card.  It should be noted that a significant majority of persons in receipt of Carer's Allowance will already hold a Medical Card.</p></reply>

Any individuals employed by these organisations are not HSE employees.  Consequently, it is a matter for the care companies concerned to ensure that the care workers possess the necessary qualifications, skills and attributes required to fully and effectively carry out the functions of the role.</p></reply>

This is known as the three year cap.  This cap does not apply to productive assets such as farms and businesses, except in cases of sudden illness or disability where specific conditions are met.</p>  <p>  It is proposed to amend the scheme to treat farm and business assets in the same manner as the principal private residence where a family successor commits to working the farm or business, i.e. to cap contributions at three years.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health has been examining the potential for changes to the treatment of business and farm assets under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme.</p>  <p>  A Memorandum for Government setting out the details of the proposed policy change and seeking Government approval to draft the General Scheme of a bill to amend the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009 was circulated to other Government Departments for observations in the last few weeks and is expected to be submitted to Government shortly.</p></reply>

As Minister for Health, I do not have any statutory power or function in relation to the reimbursement of medicines.  The Act specifies the criteria for decisions on the reimbursement of medicines.</p>  <p>  In line with the 2013 Act, if a company would like a medicine to be reimbursed by the HSE pursuant to the Community Drugs scheme, the company must first submit an application to the HSE to have the new medicine added to the Reimbursement List.</p>  <p>  As outlined in the IPHA agreement, and in line with the 2013 Act, the HSE will decide, within 180 days of receiving the application (or a longer period if further information is sought from the company), to either add the medicine to the reimbursement list or agree to reimburse it as a hospital medicine, or refuse to reimburse the medicine.</p>  <p>  HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE).</p>  <p>  The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) for the HSE, and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions.  The NCPE uses a decision framework to systematically assess whether a drug is cost-effective as a health intervention.</p>  <p>  The HSE strives to reach a decision in as timely a manner as possible.  However, because of the significant monies involved, it must ensure that the best price is achieved, as these commitments are often multi-million euro investments on an on-going basis.  This can lead to a protracted deliberation process.</p>  <p>  I am keen to engage with Industry and to explore ways in which new medicines might be more easily introduced in Ireland.  However, any innovative approaches that may be tabled must be compatible with the statutory provisions which are in place and must also recognise the fundamental pricing/funding issues in the context of finite Exchequer resources.</p>  <p>  I have indicated willingness to meet with MS Ireland and my office is in contact with the organisation to arrange a mutually convenient date.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost.  The scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.</p><p>The Report of the NHSS Review published in 2015 identified a number of issues for more detailed consideration, including a review of the pricing mechanism used by the NTPF, with a view to:</p><p>- Ensuring value for money and economy, with the lowest possible administrative costs for clients and the State and administrative burden  for providers;</p><p>- Increasing the transparency of the pricing mechanism so that existing and potential investors can make as informed decisions as  possible; and</p><p>- Ensuring that there is adequate residential capacity for those residents with more complex needs.</p><p>The terms of reference for the review of the pricing mechanism also includes consideration of the appeals mechanism available to nursing homes.</p><p>A steering group was established to oversee this review, chaired by the NTPF and including representatives from my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The NTPF are close to completing the review and will bring a draft of report to the steering group shortly.</p></reply>

The report of the review group is due shortly.  Following on from this Report, it is expected that a review of the ineligible and eligible list of occupations for employment permits will be conducted in the second half of this year.</p>  <p>  To remove a skill from the ineligible list, it must be demonstrated that recruitment difficulties are due to shortages and not to factors such as pay and/or working conditions.  It is important therefore that a detailed business case, which sets out the necessary data and evidence to justify the need for the nursing home sector to go outside the EEA to find workers, is provided.</p>  <p>  I have indicated my willingness to work with the Nursing Home industry on this matter so that the Department of Health, as the lead Department for the sector, can in turn make the case to the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department have also agreed to meet with Nursing Homes Ireland, along with officials from the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation.

Under the Health (Amendment) Act 2013, a person who has been referred to a hospital for an in-patient service, including that provided on a day case basis, will have to pay the statutory daily charge, currently &euro;80 per day, up to a maximum of &euro;800 per year. On this basis, where venesection is classed as a day case procedure and is not carried out in an out- patient setting, the public in-patient charge applies.</p><p>There are a number of exemptions to the in-patient charge (including that provided on a day-case basis), as listed in the Health (Amendment) Act 2013:</p><p>- A person with full eligibility;</p><p>- A woman receiving services in respect of motherhood;</p><p>- A child who is no more than six weeks of age;</p><p>- A child receiving services in respect of a defect identified as a health examination held pursuant to the service provided under  section 66;</p><p>- A person receiving services for the diagnosis or treatment of infectious diseases prescribed under Part IV of the Health Act 1947;</p><p>- A person receiving services in respect of which service the person is deemed pursuant to section 45(7) to be a person with full eligibility;</p><p>- A person who pursuant to section 2 of the Health (Amendment) Act 1996, in the opinion of the Health Service Executive, has contracted Hepatitis C directly or indirectly from the use of Human Immunoglobin Ant-D or the receipt within the State of another blood product or a blood transfusion.</p><p>My Department met with the HSE recently to discuss the provision of venesection services for hereditary haemochromatosis patients.

Work on this review is progressing in 2017.</p>  <p>  The National Ambulance Service (NAS) has been undertaking a significant and ongoing reform programme, to reconfigure the management and delivery of pre-hospital care services.  This programme will ensure a clinically driven, nationally co-ordinated system, supported by improved technology.  The Programme for a Partnership Government commits to additional annual investment in terms of ambulance personnel and vehicles.  In that regard additional funding of &euro;10.7m has been made available to the NAS in 2018.  This includes &euro;2.8m to fund new developments.</p>  <p>  With regards to the individual named, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to you directly as soon as possible.</p></reply>

Imports of such products can be divided into three categories; products of animal origin, products of plant origin and composite products (may contain materials of both animal and plant origin). Imports of food products coming from countries outside the European Union are subject to checks to verify compliance with European legislation.</p>  <p>  In Ireland these checks are required to be carried out at ports or airports approved or designated for this purpose. The decision to seek approval or designation for this purpose is a commercial decision to be made by port and airport authorities, balancing the income to be derived from such imports against the costs of providing the necessary facilities required by the legislation. </p>  <p>  My Department is always available for discussions with any port or airport authority interested in having such a facility. The outcome of Brexit negotiations may have implications for the volume of non-EU products imported through ports, including Rosslare. My Department is examining the potential implications of this in the context of its preparatory work for Brexit.</p></reply>

Ideally, such places should be part of the neighbourhood, and it is for these (and other) reasons that my Department operates the NeighbourWood Scheme.  </p>  <p>  The NeighbourWood Scheme, which is funded by the Government under the Forestry Programme 2014-2020, offers financial support for community groups working with local authorities, to develop attractive woodland amenities close to where people live. Funding is available towards the establishment of new neighbourwoods on open &lsquo;greenfield&rsquo; sites, the silvicultural enhancement of existing woodland already used as neighbourwoods (or proposed for development as neighbourwoods), and the installation and upgrade of appropriate recreational facilities within certain areas. </p>  <p>  These neighbourwoods vary greatly in size and location, from forests in the countryside and on the outskirts of villages, towns and cities, to woodlands located in more built-up areas. The resulting benefits are numerous and far-reaching. Neighbourwoods provide accessible opportunities for recreation and regular exercise, and offer people &lsquo;time-out&rsquo; and contact with the natural world and the changing seasons. They also deliver a wide range of environmental benefits, providing vital habitats for wildlife, removing atmospheric carbon, promoting air quality and improving the visual landscape, to mention just a few. </p>  <p>  The new neighbourwood amenity at Vartry, Roundwood, Co Wicklow, which was officially opened last month by the Taoiseach and my colleague, Minister of State Andrew Doyle, highlights the opportunities available to local communities to avail of financial support under the NeighbourWood Scheme. Further details on the Neighbourwood scheme can be found on my Department's website.</p></reply>
