He was accompanied by Commissioner Hogan and Michel Barnier, the EU&rsquo;s Chief Brexit Negotiator. </p><p>At our meeting we discussed the state of play in the Brexit negotiations in advance of the June European Council.</p><p>Mr. Barnier reiterated his assessment that serious divergences remain between the EU and the UK on how to resolve the border issue.</p><p>As the EU side has made clear, the Withdrawal Agreement must contain a fully operational backstop so there can be no hard border on this island in the future, whatever circumstances prevail. </p><p>For there to be a Withdrawal Agreement &ndash; and a period of transition &ndash; there has to be full agreement on all issues. </p><p>As we both made clear, there is now an urgent need to intensify efforts if we are to conclude a Withdrawal Agreement and have it operational by the time the UK leaves the EU next March.</p><p>I, of course, took the opportunity to convey my sincere appreciation to both President Juncker and Michel Barnier for their unwavering support and solidarity throughout the negotiations - as the President reiterated when he spoke in this Chamber.  It is clear that EU partners remain absolutely steadfast in their support around the Irish issues.</p><p>We also discussed a number of other important EU issues ahead of the June European Council, including migration. </p><p>While noting Ireland was less directly affected than other Member States, I made clear our wish to play our part  in developing a comprehensive EU approach, based on ensuring strong external borders; solidarity between Member States; and working in partnership with countries of origin, including in Africa, to underpin political and economic development, so that people can enjoy better lives and opportunities in their home countries.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-07-10a.20.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1351" speakername="John Halligan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018071000065#WRC00400"><p>As Minister, I am fully focused on ensuring that we are in a position to make the most of any potential Brexit-related opportunities.  I am also fully confident that my Department and the enterprise agencies under my remit are doing everything they can to capitalise on any opportunities that Brexit presents.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2018 a further additional &euro;3m in pay funding was provided to the enterprise agencies to support recruitment and assist in their response to the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the European Union.  That additional &euro;3 million will support the recruitment of 40-50 staff across the Department and its Agencies to meet the Brexit challenge.  This brings the number of new Brexit related staff posts to around 100 in the last two years and demonstrates the Department&rsquo;s determination to ensure that it, together with its Offices and Agencies, are sufficiently resourced to meet the Brexit challenge.</p>  <p>  As per its Brexit-strategy, IDA Ireland has continued to engage with its clients - supported by a targeted marketing campaign - to highlight Ireland&rsquo;s advantages in a post-Brexit context.  The reasons why companies invest in Ireland are well-known: the availability of talent, the ease of doing business, a competitive and transparent taxation regime, positive demographics, a common law system and, critically, Ireland&rsquo;s continued access to EU markets.  This approach has worked well as IDA Ireland has secured a substantial number of Brexit-related investments in 2017 and 2018.  </p>  <p>  The IDA&rsquo;s mid-year results for 2018 clearly indicate that we can continue to rely on the selling points that make investing in Ireland so attractive in the first place.  In fact, the Agency has indicated that in excess of 40 companies across the Financial Services, Life Sciences, Technology and Engineering sectors have chosen Ireland as a result of Brexit.  I can state with certainty that as Brexit negotiations intensify in the time ahead, IDA Ireland will be continuing its efforts to attract mobile investment by highlighting Ireland&rsquo;s suitability as a location for international business and by constantly engaging with clients across its entire portfolio. </p>  <p>  In addition, IDA Ireland continues to work on ensuring that the Agency&rsquo;s strategy is fit for purpose in light of Brexit.  In 2018, the agency has reorganised its European footprint, with the United Kingdom now being treated as a separate territory from the rest of Europe and continental European business being managed from the Frankfurt office. </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland also provides a range of supports that exist to help companies plan for both the opportunities and risks that Brexit poses.  While the outcome of the Brexit negotiations remains uncertain, Enterprise Ireland is actively supporting Irish companies to respond to the challenges and opportunities posed by Brexit and to take the necessary steps to ensure they are more innovative, competitive and market diversified to tackle the challenges ahead. </p>  <p>  Budget 2018 also contained some important pro-business measures to help companies compete in the face of &lsquo;Brexit&rsquo; including the &euro;300m Brexit Loan Scheme which will provide affordable financing to Irish businesses that are either currently impacted by Brexit or will be in the future.  It will be open to all trading SMEs and large firms employing less than 500 people.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-07-10a.23.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1272" speakername="Pat Breen" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018071000065#WRC00700"><p>I understand that the dispute at the company referred to by the deputy relates to certain terms and conditions of employment, including that of pay and contractual security which the trade union Mandate is seeking to negotiate on behalf of its members.</p>  <p>  At the outset, I must emphasise that Ireland&rsquo;s system of industrial relations is, essentially, voluntary in nature and responsibility for the resolution of industrial disputes between employers and workers, rests with the employer, the workers and their representatives.  </p>  <p>  For its part, the State provides the industrial relations dispute settlement mechanisms i.e. the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court, to support parties in their efforts to resolve their differences.  These bodies are independent in the delivery of their quasi-judicial functions, in which I as Minister have no role.  This approach has served Ireland well over the years and in a large number of high profile disputes.  </p>  <p>  This particular dispute was the subject of a Labour Court recommendation last April which urged the parties to engage with each other in order to seek agreement in relation to the matters at issue.  Furthermore, the Court recommended that if, following such engagement, matters remained unresolved, the parties should avail of the services of the Workplace Relations Commission and the Court in furthering efforts to secure resolution.  In line with the voluntary nature of industrial relations in Ireland, recommendations of the Labour Court made under industrial relations legislation are not binding on the parties.</p>  <p>  I understand it is the company's position that it does not recognise trade unions but has in place an internal mechanism for employee engagement.  Under Irish law there is no obligation on employers to recognise trade unions.  However, successive Governments have committed to the concept of collective bargaining and to this end, legislation was introduced in 2015 in the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2015 to strengthen the ability of workers to collectively engage with employers. </p>  <p>  The 2015 legislation allows for application to be made to the Labour Court to examine the issue of independence of internal employee engagement mechanisms in instances where it is contested that such mechanism is not genuinely independent of the employer.  If the Court finds that the mechanism is not independent it can then proceed to hear the dispute at issue.   </p>  <p>  In conclusion, I would like to emphasise the need for workers and employers to make every effort to reach a resolution in this dispute which presents a significant inconvenience for members of the public. The dispute handling mechanisms of the State are of course willing, where possible, to assist the parties in coming to a resolution. This will ensure a positive outcome for the employees, the company and the customers of the company.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-07-10a.26.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1249" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018071000065#WRC01000"><p>A key focus of the Government's enterprise strategy, as set out in Enterprise 2025 Renewed, which I published earlier this year, is to ensure we continue to enhance the business environment so that it is conducive to entrepreneurship, start-up and growth of Irish-own enterprises across all strands of the economy and society. </p>  <p>  The most recent Global Entrepreneurship Monitor showed that Ireland&rsquo;s rate of entrepreneurship among women is the 7th highest in Europe.  However, men are still twice as likely to be entrepreneurs as women in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Female founders have traditionally been underrepresented in start-ups, and that is why my Department and its agencies have a range of initiatives aimed at supporting women to start and scale businesses that provide quality jobs throughout the country. </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland is committed to supporting cohorts of ambitious, capable founders, and placing them on faster growth trajectories.  Research undertaken by Enterprise Ireland in 2012 found that there were a number of key inhibitors to female entrepreneurship rates, and it developed an integrated strategy to address these issues and increase the number of female-founded start-ups in Ireland.</p>  <p>  One of the key ways in which Enterprise Ireland supports female entrepreneurship is through its dedicated Competitive Start Funds.  The first Competitive Start Fund for Female Entrepreneurs was launched in 2012, and since then there have been 8 dedicated female competitive start funds.</p>  <p>  The most recent Competitive Start Fund for female entrepreneurs, which I launched earlier this year, made a total of &euro;1m funding available for up to 20 female-led companies.</p>  <p>  The demand is there. Enterprise Ireland received over 100 funding applications for this Fund, and the final selection for funding is currently taking place.  </p>  <p>  In 2017, 46 per cent of all companies who received CSF investment from Enterprise Ireland were female founded.</p>  <p>  Every year Enterprise Ireland holds a Fuelling Ambition Roadshow, which aims to encourage, support and drive the ambition of female entrepreneurs (existing and new).  A total of 7 roadshow events were held in 2018, attended by c600 female entrepreneurs, across the country. </p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) are also actively engaged in encouraging and inspiring an increase in female-led businesses through initiatives such as the annual National Women&rsquo;s Enterprise Day and the Women in Business Networks.  In addition, 61% of participants attending LEO training programmes in 2017 were female with 46% of the LEO mentoring participants female.</p>  <p>  Another key Enterprise Ireland supported initiative is the 'Going for Growth' programme.  Currently in its 10th cycle, the initiative supports female entrepreneurs who have been trading for at least two years and are strongly focused on growth.  Feedback shows that participants&rsquo; businesses experienced a growth in sales over the 9th cycle of over &euro;20million and employment rose by 17.5%.</p>  <p>  We are making progress and I feel confident that we can achieve further increases in the future.</p></reply>

It will include the following elements: </p><p>1.  Research on Current Issues in the Waste Sector; </p><p>2.  An Economic Assessment of the Household Waste Collection Market; </p><p>3.  An Overview of Waste Collection in Other Countries; and </p><p>4.  Recommendations</p><p>To date, I am informed that the CCPC has carried out an extensive series of interviews and meetings with over 20 relevant stakeholders in the waste market including the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and other entities with a policy or a regulatory role (at national or regional level), academics, representative groups and individual household waste collection operators. </p><p>In addition, it has also conducted desk based research, issued a request for information from over 40 domestic operators, commissioned consumer research and an external econometric analysis, and engaged with other national competition agencies on how waste markets operate in their jurisdictions. The CCPC has also undertaken a public consultation to collect information on the household waste collection market and to gather the views of stakeholders in a formal capacity.</p><p>I understand this exercise is still underway and it is anticipated that the report will be finalised over the summer months.  The issue of publication will be considered at that stage.</p></reply>

The average time to assess a personal injury claim was 7.3 months compared to several years if litigation is involved.</p>  <p>  The average PIAB award in 2017 was &euro;24,879. Award values vary depending on the nature and severity of cases received.  This demonstrates that the PIAB model continues to deliver major benefits, by providing a low-cost, quick and fair option in injury compensation.  </p>  <p>  The General Scheme addresses issues highlighted in submissions made to the public consultation held in 2014, by the then Minister, on the operation of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Acts 2003 and 2007.  Issues highlighted by the Cost of Insurance Working Group Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance published in January 2017 and the Report of the Rising Costs of Motor Insurance published by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach are also addressed.</p>  <p>  This is a technical and complex piece of legislation and it required careful consideration during drafting in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General.  </p>  <p>  Drafting of the Bill has been finalised by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and I will shortly seek Government approval for publication of the Bill.</p>  <p>  The PIAB model is a positive one for society as a whole as it delivers compensation more quickly, with lower costs.  Therefore, encouraging more claimants to finalise their cases through the PIAB model rather than resorting to litigation should lead to cost savings in the claims environment that will benefit consumers and businesses.</p></reply>

Earlier this year, Indian-owned Leetha Industries announced that it is to establish a manufacturing and supply operation called Red Seal Cups Ltd. in Ireland.  This will create over 100 jobs in Longford over the next three years.  The Avery Dennison Corporation is also planning a significant expansion of its Finesse Medical manufacturing facility in the County.  Announcements like these are a great vote of confidence in what the Midlands has to offer for FDI clients.  The IDA actively engages with its existing client base to support them in growing their business to retain jobs and expand their existing footprint in the region.</p>  <p>  The IDA is involved in a number of initiatives to attract additional FDI to Westmeath and Longford, including a focused digital marketing campaign.  This is designed to market the Midlands Region to potential investors by showcasing locations such as Westmeath and Longford.  The Agency also maintains regular engagement with the Chief Executives of Longford, Westmeath, Laois and Offaly County Councils to attract further investment to the region. </p>  <p>  FDI, of course, represents only one part of our wider efforts to generate economic growth in regional locations. Indigenous enterprise also plays a crucial role in creating employment opportunities.  Enterprise Ireland (EI) supports companies in every county of Ireland to start and scale, innovate and remain competitive on international markets. </p>  <p>  I am pleased to say that total employment in EI supported companies in Co. Westmeath now stands at 3,741, an increase of 30% since 2012. Total employment in EI supported companies in Co. Longford now stands at 2,970, an increase of 43.5% since 2012.  These numbers clearly reflect the valuable contribution of EI client companies to our economy, particularly from a regional perspective.</p>  <p>  We have made progress in creating opportunities in Longford and Westmeath but we are determined to achieve more.  We are working hard, across Government, to further unlock the economic potential of the region.  The Enterprise Agencies remain pivotal to this and they continue to engage with their clients, and with one another, to create jobs and source new investment for the Midlands region.</p></reply>

Were a deal to be concluded between the EU and Mercosur, the relevant text would proceed to so-called &ldquo;legal scrubbing&rdquo;, and translation, a process which can take between several months and up to two years to complete.  </p>  <p>  Insofar as ratification is concerned, some EU trade agreements are 'EU-only' meaning that all the policy areas they cover fall under the sole responsibility of the EU institutions.  Other agreements may be presented as 'mixed' where they have areas of shared responsibility between the EU and Member States.  Ratification requirements differ between the two categories.  Only at the conclusion of negotiations and when the Commission presents an Agreement to Council can an agreement be determined definitely as being 'EU-only' or &lsquo;mixed&rsquo;.  The ratification process regarding individual trade agreements must be taken on a case-by-case basis depending on the issues comprehended in the final agreement.  Where appropriate, my Department seeks legal advice on the appropriate ratification process to follow in each case.</p>  <p>  Mixed agreements enter into force only once each individual EU Member State has approved it in line with its own national procedures.  As this process may take several years, the Council can decide to provisionally apply an agreement ('provisional application').  Provisional Application generally applies to those parts of the agreement over which the EU has exclusive competence.  Provisional Application requires the agreement by Council and ratification by the European Parliament. </p>  <p>  For any EU/Mercosur Free Trade Agreement, I am not in a position to be definitive about the ratification process that will apply, nor any timeframes, until any Agreement is finalised and its scope and terms have been examined.</p></reply>

They are agrifood, pharma-chemicals, engineering and machinery, wholesale and retail and air transport.  Around 80% of the employment in these sectors is outside the Dublin region. As noted in the study, Brexit will therefore be felt more in rural parts of the country where these sectors dominate, particularly agrifood. </p>  <p>My Department also funded the InterTradeIreland/ ESR study Implications of Brexit for Trade between Ireland and Northern Ireland.    The report assesses the particular impacts that the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU could have on North-South trade in goods and models how the impact of Brexit could be especially acute in the border region.</p>  <p>Furthermore, my Department jointly with Deloitte, undertook a detailed engagement with 170 regionally-dispersed firms as part of our analysis into &ldquo;Firm-Level Impacts of Brexit on Most Exposed Sectors&rdquo;.     The study found that firms are likely to be affected differently both across different sectors and within individual sectors. Therefore, the report concludes that firm-level responses are likely to be the most effective means of preparing businesses for Brexit. </p>  <p>The Regional Action Plans for Jobs   are central to my Department&rsquo;s targeted approach to boosting regional employment. While progress has been very good, it is clear that we also have new challenges since the Regional Action Plan for Jobs process started, not least Brexit. In this context I have asked the Implementation Committees in each region to lead a process to Refresh and Refocus their Plans to 2020 which will focus on building each region&rsquo;s own competitive advantage, develop areas that are already strong, examine vulnerabilities and take account of the challenges which Brexit presents. </p>  <p>To support the ambition, goals and implementation of the Regional Action Plans for Jobs, the Regional Enterprise Development Fund, worth &euro;60 million, was launched in May 2017.  The objective of the Fund is to support the development and implementation of collaborative and innovative projects to strengthen regional enterprise development potential.</p></reply>

The last three years has seen 30,000 new FDI jobs created outside Dublin. </p>  <p>  The availability of marketable serviced land and buildings in advance of demand is a key element in the IDA's ability to compete for mobile FDI.  Not only does such a supply of properties help the Agency to secure job-rich investment but it also allows projects to begin at an earlier date by diminishing many difficulties associated with land acquisition, planning and construction. It is therefore an important means by which the IDA can encourage and attract new investors to Ireland, particularly to the regions. </p>  <p>  I understand that IDA Ireland owns 30 properties across the country.  Of these, 13 are currently occupied by IDA clients with a further 17 properties available for prospective or existing investors.  </p>  <p>  As regards site visits, they remain an important tool through which investors can be encouraged to invest in regional areas and the IDA always does its utmost to ensure that overseas firms consider all potential locations when visiting Ireland.  This is in line with the priority that has been placed on investment outside of our main cities, with the Agency continuing to target an increase in investment of 30% to 40% in every region of the country by the end of its current strategy in 2019.</p>  <p>  While site visits can help highlight the benefits of the regions to the IDA's client companies, we need to remember that the final decision as to where to invest always rests with the firm concerned.  It is also the case that some companies will only consider investing in urban areas, for a variety of commercial reasons.  It should not be forgotten either that site visit activity does not necessarily reflect investment potential, as at least 70% of all new FDI comes from existing IDA client companies.</p>  <p>  Excluding Dublin, there has been a total of 66 site visits across Ireland in the first three months of 2018.  The IDA will continue to bring new and existing clients to potential investment locations all over the country in the time ahead.</p></reply>

These bodies are independent in the delivery of their quasi-judicial functions, in which I as Minister have no role.  This approach has served Ireland well over the years and in a large number of high profile disputes. </p>  <p>  Under Irish law there is no obligation on employers to recognise trade unions and there are no plans to bring forward legislation to provide for mandatory trade union recognition. </p>  <p>  While Ireland&rsquo;s system of industrial relations is essentially voluntary in nature, it has been the consistent policy of successive Irish Governments to promote collective bargaining through the laws of this country and through the development of an institutional framework supportive of a voluntary system of industrial relations that is premised upon freedom of contract and freedom of association. </p>  <p>  There is an extensive range of statutory provisions designed to back up the voluntary bargaining process.  The freedom of association and the right to organise and bargain collectively are also guaranteed in a number of international instruments which the State has ratified and which it is, therefore, bound to uphold under international law.  </p>  <p>  The most recent legislation to facilitate this is the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2015 which came into effect on 1 August 2015 and was the result of an in-depth consultation with stakeholders, including employer and worker representatives, and a review of the experience of the operation of the existing legislative framework.  </p>  <p>  The 2015 Act makes provision, in instances where employers engage in collective bargaining with an &lsquo;internal excepted body&rsquo; as opposed to a trade union, for a referral to be made to the Labour Court to establish if internal bargaining bodies are genuinely independent of their employer.  If the Court finds that the mechanism is not independent it can then proceed to hear the dispute at issue.</p></reply>

My Department and its agencies are working hard to ensure that all potentially impacted firms are taking the necessary steps to mitigate the risks and take advantage of potential opportunities resulting from Brexit.</p>  <p>  My Department is engaged in helping SMEs prepare to withstand all Brexit scenarios, including a hard Brexit scenario.  Encouraging companies to take action to identify their individual areas of exposure and to take positive steps to address them will build strong resilient businesses that can prosper in the face of difficult economic circumstances. </p>  <p>  A major initiative that my Department is advancing is the &euro;300 million Brexit Loan Scheme, under which accessible finance is made available to businesses at favourable terms.  There has been a steady stream of applications under this scheme.</p>  <p>  Work on the development of a Business Finance Advisory Hub continues, to strengthen financial management and strategic planning of Irish SMEs.  It will assist businesses to make more informed financial decisions, building on existing supports available from bodies such as Enterprise Ireland (EI) and Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs). </p>  <p>  I am confident that the agencies under my remit have the supports available to enable companies to both consolidate market share within the UK, and become more resilient by broadening their exports to other international markets.</p>  <p>  EI has an extensive range of supports to encourage clients to become more competitive, innovative and to diversify export markets, including: </p>  <p>  - Brexit Scorecard: This interactive online platform can be used by all Irish companies to self-assess their exposure to Brexit under six business pillars.  The Scorecard generates an immediate report which contains suggested actions and resources, and information on events for companies to attend, to prepare for Brexit. </p>  <p>  - Be Prepared Grant: This grant offers SME clients a grant of up to &euro;5,000 to assist them in preparing an action plan for economic shocks such as Brexit.  The grant can be used to help cover consultancy, travel and travel expenses associated with researching the direction of their action plan. </p>  <p>  - Brexit Advisory Clinics: Enterprise Ireland held five Brexit Advisory Clinics over the past few months in Portlaoise, Mayo, Cavan, Cork and last month in Dublin&rsquo;s Aviva Stadium.  The purpose of these Clinics is to support companies affected by Brexit to take immediate action to address their exposure.  More Clinics are due to take place throughout the year. </p>  <p>  - Brexit 'Act On' Programme:  This funding is to support the engagement of a consultant to draw up a report with tailored recommendations to help clients address weaknesses and become more resilient.</p>  <p>  - Strategic Consultancy Grant:  This grant helps client companies to hire a strategic consultant for a set period to assist the company to develop and implement significant strategic initiatives. </p>  <p>  In addition, EI is implementing extensive trade mission and event schedules focussed on further developing in-market expertise and networks, new sectorial opportunities and stimulating demand for Irish products and services through international marketing campaigns.  In 2017, EI launched a new Eurozone Strategy to increase exports to Eurozone countries by 50% by 2020.</p>  <p>  The suite of LEO Brexit supports available to micro and small businesses through the 31 LEOs nationwide include: </p>  <p>  - A &lsquo;Technical Assistance for Micro-enterprises&rsquo; grant designed to support qualifying businesses to diversify into new markets, enabling companies to explore and develop new market opportunities; </p>  <p>  - Rollout of &lsquo;Lean for Micro&rsquo; nationwide which will make small businesses more efficient and competitive; </p>  <p>  - Tailored mentoring to address Brexit related business challenges; </p>  <p>  - Targeted training on specific Brexit challenges, including financial aspects and capability building in innovation, competitiveness and opportunity diagnosis; and </p>  <p>  - Continued information, advice and guidance across all 31 LEOs and regionally. </p>  <p>   The additional Brexit supports on offer through the LEOs are focused on capability building, market diversification, driving increased competitiveness, and promoting innovation so that LEO client companies can better cope with the challenges arising on foot of Brexit and to explore any opportunities presented. </p>  <p>  InterTrade Ireland (ITI), has also been very active in assisting businesses address the challenges that Brexit may present for future cross-border commerce.  A series of information and awareness raising events have been underway in towns across both North and South over recent months.  ITI is also rolling out a &lsquo;Start to Plan&rsquo; readiness voucher scheme, which enables companies to purchase specialist advice in areas such as customs, tax, tariff and non-tariff barriers, legal and labour mobility issues. </p>  <p>  I also launched the second call of the Regional Enterprise Development Fund, which is aimed at supporting the development and implementation of collaborative and innovative projects that can sustain and add to employment at a national, regional and county level.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that across a range of supports and initiatives, work of my Department is focused on supporting businesses throughout the country to withstand current challenges and succeed into the future.  I feel, therefore, that all our efforts will put Ireland in a strong position in the event of a hard Brexit scenario.</p></reply>

In Co. Kildare, 9,134 people were employed in Enterprise Ireland supported companies, representing an increase of 5% on 2016. </p><p>Underpinning Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s 2017 employment results are a range of activities and supports to help companies in Kildare to innovate and remain competitive in international markets, now and into the future.  In the period 2015 - 2017 Enterprise Ireland paid &euro;11.7million to client companies in Kildare to support companies to be innovative, improve competitiveness and to diversify their global footprint.  </p><p>Enterprise Ireland is working with established client companies in Kildare through teams of sectorial focused development advisors.  Using a company led diagnostic approach, the agency can tailor a support package to the company&rsquo;s growth potential based on their ambition, capability and need. </p><p>In addition to direct client support, Enterprise Ireland has funded the establishment of a national network of business innovation centres and specialist bio-incubation facilities across the Higher Education Sector including the Innovation Centre located at Maynooth University.  These internationally recognised facilities are important drivers of regional development, with the majority of companies located at these facilities remaining in their region after they have completed their incubation period. </p><p>Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s<b></b>New Frontiers Development Programme, the national entrepreneur development programme for early-stage startups, is run in partnership with 14 Institutes of Technology throughout the country.  New Frontiers Midlands &amp;amp; Mid-East Entrepreneurial Programme is run at Athlone Institute of Technology in partnership with Maynooth University and supported 13 entrepreneurs in 2017.</p><p>In late 2017 , under the Regional Enterprise Development Fund, over &euro;11m was approved for projects in the Eastern and Midlands region including funding to the County Kildare Community Network Company CLG. </p><p>The Technology Centre Programme is a joint initiative between Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland allowing Irish companies and multinationals to work together in these centres including the Innovation Value Institute (IVI) Technology Centre at Maynooth University.  These centres are resourced by highly qualified researchers associated with research institutions who are empowered to undertake market focused strategic R&amp;amp;D for the benefit of industry.</p><p>Enterprise Ireland funding has supported the establishment of Community Enterprise Centres in every county throughout the country, including three in Allenwood, Clane and Athy.  These centres provide space in a supportive environment for budding entrepreneurs and serve to help the development of entrepreneurship locally. </p><p>Brexit presents a significant challenge for Irish companies and Enterprise Ireland is seeking to build resilience within client companies to deal with any kind of Brexit.  The launch and development of a Brexit SME Scorecard, an interactive online platform which can be used by all Irish companies to self-assess their exposure to Brexit under six business pillars.  There have been 2328 engagements on the scorecard to date, with 78 Scorecards engaged with in Kildare.</p><p>The Mid East Regional Action Plan for Jobs is a key policy response for supporting employment growth in the Kildare, Meath and Wicklow. </p><p>Some 22,800 jobs have been created in the Mid East region since the initiative was launched in January 2015 while the unemployment rate in the Mid East region has fallen since then and now stands at 5.4% according to the CSO (Q1 2018).</p><p>Furthermore, Live Register numbers continue to fall in County Kildare, down from 19,368 in July 2012 to 9,427 in May 2018, a decrease of almost 10,000.  There is of course always room for improvement but the latest CSO figures are testament to the Government&rsquo;s efforts to help create jobs and reduce unemployment.</p><p>I am aware that further efforts are needed to ensure that jobs continue to be created in Kildare and in doing so, ensure that employment creation is sustainable.  To this end, the I will ensure that Enterprise Ireland will continue to work with companies in Kildare and across the region to promote job creation.</p></reply>

This commitment has been made in order to assist and provide some certainty for applicants in the planning and preparation of proposals.

This process benefits applicants in that they have a defined process and timelines, feedback on the strengths and weaknesses of their application and an opportunity to reapply in future.  It also gives the assessment panel an opportunity to assess, rank and rate these projects relative to one another and select the best for support.</p>  <p>  Operating a rolling-fund application process open all year round can be useful, where applicants can be funded once they reach a defined milestone(s), but the retention of external panel members to assess this process on a continuous basis is not feasible or practical.  </p>  <p>  This process has been defined to be the best solution to deliver this REDF funding which is transparent and above board.  It also has the advantage of providing feedback to unsuccessful applicants and assistance outside the competition period to submit stronger applications for subsequent calls.</p></reply>

My Department actively supports placing Irish artists in a more beneficial position to ensure that they can gain the most remuneration possible for their music.  New business models are currently emerging to help musicians to license their works to online platforms and ultimately it is a commercial matter for rights holders to negotiate the use of their works on any platform or media.  However, I agree that there should be a regulatory framework to help them not just in Ireland, but at an EU-wide level.</p>  <p>  On 14 September 2016, the EU Commission published a package of copyright reform proposals as part of its Digital Single Market strategy.  This included a Directive on copyright in the Digital Single Market (hereinafter the &ldquo;Copyright Directive&rdquo;).  The intention of the Directive is to craft modern copyright legislation suitable for all European citizens.  Among the Directive&rsquo;s many proposals is a provision aimed at addressing the &ldquo;value gap&rdquo;, whereby rights holders are receiving less remuneration despite the increased usage of their works (Article 13).</p>  <p>  Officials of my Department have been thoroughly engaged in negotiations since publication of this proposal and have been successful in achieving a number of amendments to address the concerns of our stakeholders.  The Copyright Directive has been discussed by EU Ambassadors and the Presidency has gained approval for a mandate to commence negotiations with the European Parliament.</p>  <p>  Negotiations on the Copyright Directive have been exhaustive and, while I appreciate the concerns that have been raised, I fully support the intention of this proposal which is vitally important to both the DSM and the digital economy.  Our focus has always been on achieving the best balance for the competing interests of all stakeholders, including digital economy actors, rights holders, and citizens.  To that end, there has been extensive engagement with stakeholders across the various issues in Ireland, Brussels, and with other EU Member States, including at Ministerial level.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to engage positively with the negotiations on the proposal going forward to ensure that Ireland can benefit from its many merits, particularly with regard to the value gap, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

My Department and its agencies are working hard to ensure that all potentially impacted firms are taking the necessary steps to mitigate the risks and take advantage of potential opportunities resulting from Brexit.</p>  <p>  My Department is engaged in helping SMEs prepare to withstand all Brexit scenarios, including a hard Brexit scenario.  Encouraging companies to take action to identify their individual areas of exposure and to take positive steps to address them will build strong resilient businesses that can prosper in the face of difficult economic circumstances. </p>  <p>  A major initiative that my Department is advancing is the &euro;300 million Brexit Loan Scheme, under which accessible finance is made available to businesses at favourable terms.  There has been a steady stream of applications under this scheme.</p>  <p>  Work on the development of a Business Finance Advisory Hub continues, to strengthen financial management and strategic planning of Irish SMEs.  It will assist businesses to make more informed financial decisions, building on existing supports available from bodies such as Enterprise Ireland (EI) and Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs). </p>  <p>  I am confident that the agencies under my remit have the supports available to enable companies to both consolidate market share within the UK, and become more resilient by broadening their exports to other international markets.</p>  <p>  EI has an extensive range of supports to encourage clients to become more competitive, innovative and to diversify export markets, including: </p>  <p>  - Brexit Scorecard:  This interactive online platform can be used by all Irish companies to self-assess their exposure to Brexit under six business pillars.  The Scorecard generates an immediate report which contains suggested actions and resources, and information on events for companies to attend, to prepare for Brexit. </p>  <p>  - Be Prepared Grant: This grant offers SME clients a grant of up to &euro;5,000 to assist them in preparing an action plan for economic shocks such as Brexit.  The grant can be used to help cover consultancy, travel and travel expenses associated with researching the direction of their action plan. </p>  <p>  - Brexit Advisory Clinics: Enterprise Ireland held five Brexit Advisory Clinics over the past few months in Portlaoise, Mayo, Cavan, Cork and last month in Dublin&rsquo;s Aviva Stadium.  The purpose of these Clinics is to support companies affected by Brexit to take immediate action to address their exposure. More Clinics are due to take place throughout the year. </p>  <p>  - Brexit 'Act On' Programme: This funding is to support the engagement of a consultant to draw up a report with tailored recommendations to help clients address weaknesses and become more resilient. </p>  <p>  - Strategic Consultancy Grant: This grant helps client companies to hire a strategic consultant for a set period to assist the company to develop and implement significant strategic initiatives. </p>  <p>  In addition, EI is implementing extensive trade mission and event schedules focussed on further developing in-market expertise and networks, new sectorial opportunities and stimulating demand for Irish products and services through international marketing campaigns. In 2017, EI launched a new Eurozone Strategy to increase exports to Eurozone countries by 50% by 2020.</p>  <p>  The suite of LEO Brexit supports available to micro and small businesses through the 31 LEOs nationwide include: </p>  <p>  - A &lsquo;Technical Assistance for Micro-enterprises&rsquo; grant designed to support qualifying businesses to diversify into new markets, enabling companies to explore and develop new market opportunities; </p>  <p>  - Rollout of &lsquo;Lean for Micro&rsquo; nationwide which will make small businesses more efficient and competitive; </p>  <p>  - Tailored mentoring to address Brexit related business challenges; </p>  <p>  - Targeted training on specific Brexit challenges, including financial aspects and capability building in innovation, competitiveness and opportunity diagnosis; and </p>  <p>  - Continued information, advice and guidance across all 31 LEOs and regionally. </p>  <p>  The additional Brexit supports on offer through the LEOs are focused on capability building, market diversification, driving increased competitiveness, and promoting innovation so that LEO client companies can better cope with the challenges arising on foot of Brexit and to explore any opportunities presented. </p>  <p>  InterTrade Ireland (ITI), has also been very active in assisting businesses address the challenges that Brexit may present for future cross-border commerce.  A series of information and awareness raising events have been underway in towns across both North and South over recent months.  ITI is also rolling out a &lsquo;Start to Plan&rsquo; readiness voucher scheme, which enables companies to purchase specialist advice in areas such as customs, tax, tariff and non-tariff barriers, legal and labour mobility issues. </p>  <p>  I also launched the second call of the Regional Enterprise Development Fund, which is aimed at supporting the development and implementation of collaborative and innovative projects that can sustain and add to employment at a national, regional and county level.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that across a range of supports and initiatives, work of my Department is focused on supporting businesses throughout the country to withstand current challenges and succeed into the future.  I feel, therefore, that all our efforts will put Ireland in a strong position in the event of a hard Brexit scenario.</p></reply>

This is critical for promoting economic resilience and long-term business growth.</p>  <p>  EI supports Irish companies that export to the Gulf States through its office network in Dubai and Abu Dhabi (UAE), Riyadh (Saudi Arabia) and Doha (Qatar).  In addition, EI employ Pathfinders in other Gulf States where it has no physical presence. EI assist suitable clients to avail of opportunities in Gulf States by working with each client one-on-one; arranging trade missions, company market visits, and in-country networking events; and by providing information and trade mission supports, as well as information and Gulf State related networking events in Ireland. EI also brings corporate buyers from the Gulf States to Ireland annually, to meet Irish producers. </p>  <p>  Over the past 12 months, EI has organised trade missions and networking events with the participation of Irish government ministers in Saudi Arabia, UAE, Oman, Kuwait and Qatar, with further events scheduled in 2018.  In addition to its own export activities, Enterprise Ireland cooperates closely with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade Embassy network, Bord Bia, Tourism Ireland, IDA and the Department of Justice as part of Team Ireland to deepen and widen Irish trade links with the Middle East and the Gulf region. </p>  <p>  EI also ran an international trade event to the annual 'Arab Health' Exhibition in Dubai in January of this year, which was led by the Minister of State for Mental Health and Older People, Jim Daly T.D.  Arab Health is the largest healthcare exhibition and conference in the Middle East and North Africa region. The trade visit focused on maximising business opportunities for the 20 EI clients exhibiting and participating.  The Gulf Food Manufacturing Exhibition in Dubai will take place later this year, where Enterprise Ireland will support exhibiting clients.  </p>  <p>  Currently, EI&rsquo;s Middle East and North Africa office network does not actively support Irish companies seeking to do business directly with Syria, due to the ongoing security situation.  Any future change in EI trade promotion activities on behalf of Irish companies in Syria will be primarily dependent on the security situation in Syria.  However, Enterprise Ireland will keep the situation under continuous review.</p></reply>

The combination of existing research strengths and this targeted funding mechanism will help to deliver jobs, exports and other economic impacts for Ireland.  This will help achieve the National Strategic Outcomes (NSOs) set out in Project Ireland 2040, in particular National Strategic Outcome 5 (A Strong Economy supported by Enterprise, Innovation and Skills).  Ultimately, the projects funded under the Disruptive Technologies Innovation Fund will create the jobs of the future.</p><p>The Fund will have a resource allocation of &euro;500 million over the period 2018-2027 consisting of an initial Exchequer allocation of &euro;180 million to 2022.  It will be competitive and see investment in the research, development and deployment of disruptive technologies and applications on a commercial basis.

The Expressions of Interest phase will run until 17th August 2018. It is envisaged that the first tranche of successful projects will be confirmed by November 2018.</p><p>The type of projects that will receive funding will be: </p><p>- Collaborative enterprise-driven partnerships that will develop, deploy and commercialise disruptive technologies to transform business; </p><p>- Impactful projects seeking at least &euro;1 million in funding over 3 years and involving enterprises and research partners; </p><p>- Projects involving SME participation; </p><p>- Focussed on &ldquo;industrial research&rdquo;.</p><p>An Expressions of Interest form and a Reference Document for applicants are available on my Department's website and I encourage potential applicants to familiarise themselves with the detail to ascertain their eligibility and to apply.

The National Development Plan 2018-2027 commits a total of almost &euro;116 billion to underpin the implementation of the National Strategic Outcomes identified in Project Ireland 2040.</p><p>Aligned with Enterprise 2025 Renewed, our aim in Ireland 2040 is to achieve sustainable full employment, to bring unemployment rates in all regions down to within 1 percentage point of the national average and to progress greater convergence in productivity in the regions.  This requires a competitive, innovative and resilient enterprise base, which is essential to provide the jobs and employment opportunities for people to live and prosper in all regions. </p><p>The priorities I and my Department will be focusing on include: </p><p>- Further expansion of Advanced Manufacturing Supports linking centres and capacity across all regions. </p><p>- The &euro;500m Disruptive Technologies Innovation Fund which I recently launched, that will allow Ireland become a leader in future technologies, through funding projects on a competitive basis. </p><p>- Strengthening Science Foundation Ireland Research Centres and Enterprise Ireland Technology Centres in higher education facilities across all regions. </p><p>- The upgrading of the Tyndall National Institute in Cork. </p><p>- Facilitating Institutes of Technologies in creating new regional &lsquo;Technology and Innovation Poles&rsquo;. </p><p>- A New Space Technologies Programme, to the benefit of firms in the regions </p><p>- New cycles of the Programme for Research in Third Level Institutions, benefitting higher education in all regions. </p><p>- New Regional Sectorial Clusters to scale and internationalise enterprise in all regions. </p><p>- Providing the appropriate types of firm level supports in the context of Brexit to enable business transformation, building firm resilience and strengthening firm competitiveness. </p><p>- Expanding the Enterprise Ireland budget for research and development. </p><p>- Expanding IDA Regional Property Programme to attract investment to regions, with a particular focus on the border region. </p><p>- The creation of a National Design Centre. </p><p>- Seed and Venture Capital Funding to support regional start-ups and growth eHubs for entrepreneurship and start-ups in every county. </p><p>- Participation in the EU High Performance Computing Programme.I </p><p>- increases in the number of researchers trained under my Department&rsquo;s research, development and innovation (RD&amp;amp;I) programmes.</p><p>To further strengthen rural economies and communities, under the Regional Action Plan for Jobs (RAPJ) process, the focus on enterprise development and employment generation in the regions has intensified through a collaborative approach involving both public and private sector stakeholders in the regions.  The RAPJ is also supported through competitive calls for enterprise initiatives under the Regional Enterprise Development Fund, with &euro;30m to be allocated in 2018.  This will continue to be rolled out in the first five years of the Plan delivered through Enterprise Ireland.</p><p>Further, my Department and the enterprise development agencies are engaging  with the three Regional Authorities on the development of their Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies (RSES) which are an important next step in implementing the Ireland 2040 plan.  These will for the first time put regional planning on a statutory basis, and will play an important role in directing investments towards realising the full potential of our regions as dynamic places to live and work.</p></reply>

These bodies are independent in the delivery of their quasi-judicial functions, in which I as Minister have no role.  This approach has served Ireland well over the years and in a large number of high profile disputes.</p>  <p>  I understand it is the company's position that it does not recognize trade unions but has in place an internal mechanism for employee engagement. Under Irish law there is no obligation on employers to recognize trade unions and there are no plans to bring forward legislation to provide for mandatory trade union recognition.  However, it has been the consistent policy of successive Irish Governments to support a voluntarist system of industrial relations with a robust statutory framework supportive of collective bargaining.</p>  <p>  The most recent legislation to facilitate this is the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2015 which came into effect on 1 August 2015 and was the result of an in-depth consultation with stakeholders, including employer and worker representatives, and a review of the experience of the operation of the existing legislative framework.</p>  <p>  The 2015 Act makes provision, in instances where employers engage in collective bargaining with an &lsquo;internal excepted body&rsquo; as opposed to a trade union, for a referral to be made to the Labour Court to establish if internal bargaining bodies are genuinely independent of their employer.  If the Court finds that the mechanism is not independent it can then proceed to hear the dispute at issue.</p>  <p>  I would like to stress the merit of both parties working closely and with the dispute handling mechanisms of the State to make every effort to reach a resolution on the issues in dispute to achieve a positive outcome for the employees, the company and the customers of the company.</p></reply>

This commitment was reiterated in Innovation 2020 in 2015.</p>  <p>  Expenditure on Innovation, Research &amp;amp; Development consists of both public and private expenditure. Gross investment in R&amp;D was &euro;3.2 billion in 2016.  This is an increase of over half a billion euro since 2011.  The estimated expenditure on R&amp;D by Government Departments in 2017 is &euro;768 million.  This represents an increase of almost &euro;40 million over 2016 and is the highest level of public expenditure on R&amp;D since 2012.</p>  <p>  A very significant part of our innovation policy has been to align public investment efforts in a manner that leverages R&amp;D activity in the enterprise sectors.  While private spending on R&amp;D slowed during the financial crisis, it has been increasing steadily since 2011.  Business Expenditure on RandD rose to &euro;2.3 billion in 2016 from &euro;1.7 billion in 2011, an increase of over 35%.</p>  <p>  Despite the fact that overall expenditure in R&amp;D has increased every year since committing to Europe 2020 targets, reaching the 2.5% of GNP intensity rate target presents a very significant challenge.  In 2016 our GNP intensity level stood at 1.43%, down from 1.91% in 2012.  Even when using GNI* as a complementary indicator (GNI* removes globalisation impacts on the Irish economy), the R&amp;D intensity rate is estimated at 1.72% for 2016.</p>  <p>  This is in part due to the strength of our economic performance and subsequent increases in GNP growth rates year on year over the last number of years.  Our challenge is to increase the level of investment in R&amp;D to keep pace with GNP growth rates, in the context of significant demands on the public purse.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the level of the R&amp;D intensity rate, I am pleased to note that Ireland performs well in international comparison tables.  In the European Innovation Scoreboard published by the European Commission in June, Ireland gained one place to be ranked 9th in the EU for innovation performance.</p>  <p>  In aggregate terms, Ireland is one of the best innovation output performers, making it one of the most efficient performers overall in terms of outputs relative to investment.</p>  <p>  However, it is clear that significant investment in RandD is a key characteristic of the top four Innovation Leaders in the EU (Sweden, Denmark, Finland and the Netherlands).  The Government must continue to prioritise investment in R&amp;D in order to realise its ambition of becoming a Global Innovation Leader.</p>  <p>  My Department is commencing an interim review of Innovation 2020 this year and this will give us the opportunity to take stock of what has been achieved under Innovation 2020 since December 2015 and will inform the development of its successor.</p></reply>

The OECD states that further analysis is required in order to achieve an agreed evidence backed solution focused on the alignment of taxing rights with the location of real substantive value creating activity.  Suffice to say that, as it stands, there is no clarity on what approach will be taken.</p>  <p>  It is therefore not possible to determine the impact on employment.  it is likely that any changes to how digital businesses are taxed will impact Ireland&rsquo;s corporation tax receipts as the changes would likely see greater taxing rights in larger countries.  The Summer Economic Statement published sets out that the Government will be prudent in its approach in 'setting aside some of the historically high levels of Corporation Tax for the purpose of creating the Rainy Day Fund'.</p>  <p>  Regardless of the final outcome, it must be borne in mind that Ireland&rsquo;s corporation tax regime will continue to be competitive while also offering long-term certainty to international business.  Crucially, our regime is underpinned by substance.  Enterprise 2025 Renewed reaffirms our focus on export-led growth that is underpinned by innovation, talent and investments in place-making.  We cannot predict the future, but we are taking action to deepen resilience across our enterprise base.  Our policies place an emphasis on strengthening the productivity performance and potential of our Irish owned enterprises.  We will continue as a country to be anticipatory and adaptive to global challenges. </p>  <p>  The continued competitiveness of our corporation tax regime, whilst important, is only one element of Ireland&rsquo;s value proposition for FDI. Business location decisions are informed by a range of factors.  Access to the EU market is, and will remain, a key factor in attracting FDI.  Other key factors involved in attracting and maintaining FDI here include: </p>  <p>  - Talent: we have a talented workforce that is hardworking, flexible and adaptable to change and a first-class education system that helps nurture the future talent required </p>  <p>  - Innovation: we have developed leading edge capabilities in R&amp;D, have a supportive regime for innovation and continuously work with enterprises to gain more investment in high value added research, development and innovation activities.</p>  <p>  - We have a proven track record of delivery for enterprise and it is easy to do business here. </p>  <p>  - We are English speaking yet can service over 140 languages from Ireland which greatly assists ICT and Financial Services companies in particular. </p>  <p>  - Through Project Ireland 2040, the National Planning Framework and National Development Plan, we will focus coordinated investments to ensure that we offer a range of compelling, dynamic and competitive locations for investment throughout Ireland. </p>  <p>  My officials and I, as well as the IDA, remain in regular contact with companies and with colleagues across Government as this area of international taxation evolves.  </p>  <p>  I will remain alert and responsive to any changes with regards to the taxation of the digital economy or indeed the overall global tax environment, working with colleagues across Government to ensure that Ireland can react and adapt when required.</p>  <p>  Background to Digital Tax developments</p>  <p>  In March 2018, the EU Commission published two proposed Directives.  The first one, a Digital Services Tax (DST), proposes a &lsquo;temporary&rsquo; solution of a 3% levy on turnover from certain digital service activities.  The thresholds for application is for a global turnover of &euro;750m and EU turnover of at least &euro;50m.  The second, "comprehensive solution", requires an overhaul of international taxation, establishing the concept of a "digital permanent establishment", allowing countries taxing rights over the digital business carried out by a company in that country, even where the company has no physical presence in the country.</p>  <p>  Prior to the publication of the Commission&rsquo;s proposals, the OECD had released their interim Report on the Digital Economy, which acknowledges the lack of consensus in the area and that further analysis is required in order to achieve an agreed evidence backed solution focussed on the alignment of taxing rights with the location of real substantive value creating activity.</p>  <p>  The Commission proposals are now being debated and it would seem that there is now a widespread acceptance among Member States that the value of these EU discussions is primarily to give impetus to the OECD debate.  This is illustrated by the recently issued joint statement from the Finance Ministers of Sweden, Denmark and Finland calling for the EU to abandon plans for a digital tax based on turnover and to support reform of digital taxation at OECD.</p>  <p>  While a number of Member States remain committed to the interim proposal of a Digital Services Tax on turnover, it should be recalled that the OECD&rsquo;s Task Force on the Digital Economy found that there is no consensus on the merit or need for such short-term measures which it is widely acknowledged can be economically damaging. </p></reply>

The IDA shares this objective and I am pleased that its results for 2017 show that 45% all jobs created last year were for locations outside Dublin.  Every region in Ireland, including the Border Region, posted net gains in jobs last year and there are now over 122,000 people employed across 649 firms in IDA client companies outside of Dublin. </p>  <p>  Employment numbers for 2018 will not be available until my Department's Annual Employment Survey is carried out in November 2018.  In the last year IDA client companies conducted two site visits to County Cavan and one site visit to County Monaghan.  Site visit activity, however, does not necessarily reflect investment potential, as at least 70% of all new FDI comes from existing IDA client companies. </p>  <p>  I want to stress that IDA Ireland is working hard to promote Counties Cavan and Monaghan to potential investors.  The Agency has a dedicated regional manager for the North East/North West Region and has an office in the Cavan Innovation and Technology Centre.  As part of its strategy to encourage investment to the area, it is focusing on sectors including agrifood, manufacturing, tourism, internationally traded services and cleantech.  The IDA also regularly engages with key stakeholders on the ground in Cavan and Monaghan, including with local authorities, public bodies, the education sector and companies from both its own client base but also from the indigenous sector.  IDA Ireland also owns lands in both Cavan and Monaghan that are being actively marketed to its clients.</p>  <p>  It is important to emphasise that foreign direct investment only forms one part of investment in regional locations.  Indigenous enterprise is responsible for a significant portion of employment growth, especially outside Dublin.  My Department and all its agencies, including Enterprise Ireland and the LEOs, work together constantly and collaboratively to ensure that jobs and investment are spread as fairly as possible across this country. </p>  <p>  The success of this Government's strategy for regional job creation is reflected in Combilift's new &euro;50 million Research and Development and Testing Centre in County Monaghan.  This new investment will create 200 jobs and is an example of a home-grown Monaghan success story.  The positive impact that Combilift has on the county, the border region and Ireland cannot be underestimated.  </p>  <p>  I am pleased to say that Enterprise Ireland supported companies employed 10,817 people in Cavan and Monaghan in 2017.  Companies supported by the LEOs in Cavan and Monaghan employ a total of 2304 people, representing a net increase of 239 over the previous year.  I think that these numbers clearly reflect the growing domestic industries which are so important to both counties.  </p>  <p>  We recognise that there is room for improvement in Cavan and Monaghan and we are working hard, across Government, to further unlock the economic potential of the region.  The Enterprise Agencies under my remit will continue to engage with their clients, and with one another, to create jobs and source new investment for the region.</p></reply>

We &ndash; all 28 EU Member States and the EU Commission &ndash; are clear that these tariffs are not justifiable on national security grounds.  We fully subscribe to the EU position that these tariffs are unjustified and in conflict with WTO rules. </p>  <p>  The EU Commission, which leads on Trade Policy for the Member States under the Treaties, and working in full consultation with the Member States, has prepared a measured, proportionate, and WTO-compatible response, which Ireland has fully supported.  These measures include the launching of proceedings by the EU against the US at the WTO, the introduction of rebalancing tariff measures by the EU and the possible imposition of provisional safeguard measures comprising import quotas or tariffs to shield EU producers from a sudden influx of steel or aluminium into the EU market which would ordinarily have been destined for the US market.</p>  <p>  EU leaders have also endorsed a positive agenda for dialogue on trade issues with the US, once the steel and aluminium tariffs against the EU are lifted.  Ireland is of the view that the EU should not negotiate under threat, and that any talks must be preceded by a permanent exemption.  The EU and its Member States are also working with other like-minded countries &ndash; such as Japan, Canada, and Mexico &ndash; to develop an agreed approach to issues of concern.  We continue, of course, to keep open the lines of communication with the US Administration and other key &lsquo;influencers&rsquo;. </p>  <p>  The US has sought to use the threat of tariffs as leverage to obtain trade concessions from the EU.  The EU&rsquo;s united approach that we are willing and able to respond when necessary in the face of such unilateral non-WTO-compliant actions is vital.  We believe the US Administration is resolute on these issues at this time and, therefore, we believe the EU must remain as resolute and stay united.  The alternative is to accept such action in breach of WTO rules as the EU understands them.  Over the past number of months, the EU has engaged with the US at all possible levels, and with other partners, to find a solution to the problem of overcapacity in the steel sector.  Indeed, I met with Secretary Ross in Washington to discuss these and related matters in May.</p>  <p>  At a national level, we continue to monitor potential impacts of the trade measures being taken by the US, as well as those being contemplated.  We remain alive to the fact that while certain actions may have limited impact at macro level, this could possibly mask individual firm level impacts.  To this end, my Department and its agencies are keeping the situation under review.  Indeed, I convened a meeting of my Enterprise Forum on Brexit and Global Challenges last week to discuss our strategy and hear, first hand, from a variety of representative bodies, their issues and concerns.</p></reply>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-07-10a.133" nospeaker="true" ><p>The cost of foreign and domestic travel expenses for me and those who travelled with me on official business since my appointment is as follows: 

June 2017 - December 2017  - &euro;118,245.32

January 2018 &ndash; end June 2018  - &euro;108,894.43

The figures above include, but are not limited to, expenditure on items such as flights, hotel accommodation, rail tickets, bus and taxi fares, ground transport and subsistence payments. The 2018 figures to date are provisional and may be subject to revision once credit notes/refunds are processed in a small number of cases. 

Not all invoices relating to travel undertaken in the first half of 2018 have been received.

I have not made any claims for subsistence allowance while on official travel abroad or within Ireland since my appointment as Taoiseach.

As Taoiseach, I regularly travel to participate in formal and informal meetings of the European Council, in Brussels and elsewhere. Particularly in the context of Brexit, I also place a high importance on engaging actively with fellow Heads of State and Government, both within the EU and more widely, to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s interests and concerns are fully appreciated and understood. 

In keeping with the Government&rsquo;s Global Ireland 2025 strategy, I also use international visits to promote Ireland&rsquo;s trade, culture, investment and enterprise interests, as well as to engage with Irish communities and to hear at first hand their experiences and concerns.

On my visits I am accompanied by a small delegation, comprising senior officials/advisers and members of my private office, according to the particular requirements of the programme. The Minister of State for European Affairs also accompanies me to meetings of the European Council and on other European engagements as appropriate, however her travel expenses are met by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.

Detailed information on foreign travel costs for myself, my Advisers and senior officials, as well as costs related to the Government Chief Whip and Ministers of State are published on a monthly basis on my Department's website, once finalised.</p></speech>

Irish Naval vessels have also been deployed to the Mediterranean since 2015.  For operational &amp;amp; security reasons, it would not be appropriate to disclose precise matters affecting Naval Service patrols. The total number of days on patrol in each of the years 2015 to 2017 and to end May 2018 is set out in the following table.</p><p><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Number of days on patrol</th></tr><tr><td>2018 (up to 31st May)</td><td>725</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>1408</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>1376</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>1204</td></tr></table></p><p>With regard to the number of personnel in the Naval Service, I would note that the current establishment for the Naval Service is 1,094. As of 31 May 2018 the effective strength of the Naval Service is 1,047. The current establishment of the Naval Service Reserve is 200. As of 31 May the effective strength of the Naval Service Reserve is 115. </p><p>The Naval Service Reserve trains its members to supplement and aid the work of the Naval Service in carrying out its wide variety of roles. As part of their training, Naval reservists receive instruction in sail training, navigation, marine communications, weapons training, fire fighting and sea survival. Subject to the availability of seagoing berths, Naval reservists also receive annual training on board Naval Service ships when on patrol, especially during summer months. </p><p>The Naval Service Reserve has carried out 29 training days on-board Naval Service Ships in 2018 to date. I understand that there are currently two Naval Service Reserve personnel on-board one of the Naval ships, with more planned to take part in training in the coming weeks. The presence of Naval Service Reserve personnel contributes positively to the overall operational capability of the ship and this situation benefits both the Naval Service and the Naval Service Reserve. I wish to place on record my great admiration for the members of the Naval Service Reserve who provide valuable support to the Naval Service both at sea and on land.</p></reply>

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade maintains and administers a roster of individuals to participate in election observation missions, organised in the main by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the European Union (EU).  I refer the Deputy to the responses to previous Parliamentary Questions on this matter, Question 167 of 4 July 2018, Questions 167 and 172 of 25 October 2017 Questions 357 and 358 of 13 December 2016, Question 243 of 2 November 2016 and Questions 335, 336 and 337 of 14 June 2016.</p>  <p>  The criteria for selection for observation missions were set out in the Information Note for Applicants accompanying the call for applications to join the Election Observation Roster established in 2013.  This is unchanged, both in selection criteria and methodology. </p>  <p>  For each election observation mission to which Ireland proposes to deploy observers, all roster members are invited to express their interest in the mission with a view to ensuring the widest possible participation.  A short-list is drawn up based on the specific criteria set out by the EU or OSCE, including relevant local and regional experience, language proficiency, gender and length of time since serving on a mission.  In many cases, the EU and OSCE also invite Member States to nominate new observers or observers with limited experience.  However, the final decision rests with the inviting body, usually the OSCE or the European Union.</p>  <p>  The recent call for Election Observers to participate in the upcoming EU EOM to Zimbabwe attracted a high volume of applications with a total of twenty four Short-Term and eight Long-Term Observer applications.  Four Long-Term Observers (LTOs) and four Short-Term Observers (STOs) were nominated from which the EU EOM selected two LTOs, one LTO reserves and two STOs, reflecting the highly competitive nature of selection.</p>  <p>  Roster members are individually notified of the outcome of the selection and in the case of EU Missions, the EU made the actual final selection.  There are important concerns about the release of personal data in terms of legislation and security to third parties. Circulating such information about individual observers would require the consent of observers and doing so without their consent may be in breach of EU General Data Protection Regulation.</p></reply>

An online passport application service was launched in March 2017 and offers the convenience of an online application system 24 hours a day, 7 days a week for Irish citizens anywhere in the world, without the need for application forms, printed photos or witnesses.  At present, the online passport application service accommodates adult passport renewal applications and passport card applications.  It is planned to extend the online application facility to other categories of renewal by the end of 2018. People who cannot or do not wish to apply online have the option of applying through their local post office. The vast majority of applications received by the Passport Service from applicants residing in the island of Ireland are submitted through Passport Express and Northern Ireland Passport Express.  Northern Ireland Passport Express allows applicants living in Northern Ireland to apply for their passport through more than 70 post offices. Applicants residing in Great Britain can post their applications directly to the Cork Passport Office.  Bearing in mind the availability of both the online and postal application channels, very few citizens living in the island of Ireland are required to travel a significant distance in order to apply for their passport. In the relatively small number of cases where citizens need to travel very urgently and do not have a valid passport, the Passport Offices in Dublin and Cork offer an appointment service.</p><p>Given the variety of options available, I am satisfied that the current needs of passport applicants are being met without the need for the establishment of a further passport office. </p><p>Advice and guidance on the above channels and other useful information on passports is available on the Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.dfa.ie/passport</i>.</p></reply>

The area is inhabited by members of the Jahalin tribe, which was expelled from its home in the Negev to the West Bank in the 1950s.  One village in particular, that of Khan Al Ahmar, home to some 181 Palestinian Bedouin, 95% of whom are Palestinian refugees, has been under threat of demolition for many years.</p>  <p>  The communities are located in a particularly sensitive part of Area C in the West Bank, an area which is critical for the viability of a future Palestinian state.  Any attempt to develop the land for illegal settlements is therefore a threat to the Two State solution.  There is no doubt that the removal of the Bedouin community to another site, to which they have not agreed, is illegal under international law.</p>  <p>  These plans have been subject to a number of legal proceedings.  Many in the international community, including Ireland, have raised our concerns on numerous occasions with the Israeli authorities.  As a result of international pressure and legal actions plans for the demolition had been delayed. However, following an Israeli Supreme Court ruling in May 2018, the Israeli authorities were given permission by that court to proceed with the demolition.</p>  <p>  The UN Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process has said that the proposed demolition in Khan Al Ahmar is contrary to international law and has called on Israel to halt the demolitions.</p>  <p>  I have made two public statements in relation to Khan al Ahmar specifically, on 31 May and most recently on 4 July, calling on the Israeli authorities to halt the demolitions of Palestinian property and the removal of Palestinian communities.  I also condemned the demolitions and the forced evictions of the neighbouring Palestinian community of Abu Nuwar.  The Irish Representative in Ramallah has visited Khan al Ahmar on a number of occasions, along with other European Missions, as a show of support for the villagers.  Ireland has also pressed strongly for EU action on this, and the EU has issued statements in Brussels and at local level calling on the Israeli authorities to reverse the decisions.</p>  <p>  Following Palestinian petitions last Thursday, the Israeli High Court has issued a temporary restraining order freezing the demolition of Khan Al Ahmar.  The Court has ordered the Israeli authorities to respond to the Palestinian claims by 11 July before making a decision whether to accept or reject the petition. </p>  <p>  I again call upon the Israeli authorities to halt the demolitions of Palestinian property and the removal of Palestinian communities.  I will continue to raise this issue in my interactions with the Israeli authorities.</p></reply>

Over 13 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance inside Syria, including 1.5 million people trapped in hard-to-reach and besieged areas.  Over 6 million people are displaced internally, and a further 5.6 million have fled to neighbouring countries and the wider region.  The Assad regime and its allies have repeatedly targeted civilians, through deliberate attacks, including chemical attacks, on civilian infrastructure such as homes, hospitals and schools, the use of &quot;starve or surrender&quot; techniques and the denial of humanitarian assistance, and forced displacement in the interest of demographic engineering. </p><p>I am particularly concerned by the recent escalation of violence in the south west, including air strikes by the regime and its allies, which forced over 300,000 civilians from their homes and destroyed critical infrastructure including several health facilities.  I am aware of the report to which Deputy Shortall refers which highlights some of the shocking attacks that have taken place in Daraa province in recent weeks.  I welcome the truce announced on Friday, but I am concerned by reports that it has already been breached.  I take this opportunity to call for an immediate cessation of hostilities, the respect of the de-escalation agreement and full humanitarian access to all Syrians in need.</p><p>I have frequently called on all regional actors, and all those involved in the Syria conflict, to show restraint and avoid any escalation, which could further undermine regional stability, as well as adding to the suffering of civilians.  I have also called on all parties with influence on the Syrian regime to exert that influence to ensure that civilians are protected, and to encourage the Syrian Government to engage fully with the UN-led peace process. </p><p>It is clear that Russia's support for the Assad regime has prolonged the suffering of the Syrian people.  Russia has also repeatedly vetoed UN Security Council resolutions on Syria, which has seriously undermined the protection of Syrian civilians.  Ireland's has communicated its concerns directly to the Russian authorities on numerous occasions.  In October 2017, I met with Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vladimir Titov.  I relayed Ireland&rsquo;s condemnation of the ongoing attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure, and the use of chemical weapons.  I called on Russia to ensure civilians are protected, and to exert its influence on other parties to the conflict to do the same.  These messages have also been relayed to the Russian Ambassador on numerous occasions at Ministerial and official level.</p><p>I am aware of the issue related to property rights to which Deputy Shortall refers.  Ireland recently co-sponsored a resolution at the UN Human Rights Council that &quot;deplores the existence and application of national legislation, in particular 'Syrian Law Number 10/2018', which would have a significant detrimental impact on freedom of movement and the right of Syrians displaced by the conflict to return to their homes in a safe, voluntary and dignified manner when the situation on the ground allows it, and calls for their repeal&quot;.</p><p>Ireland and the EU believe that there can be no military solution to the Syrian conflict.  The human suffering caused by the Syrian conflict can only be brought to an end by reaching a sustainable political solution.  Ireland and the EU fully support UN Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura in his efforts to lead political negotiations to end the conflict based on the 2012 Geneva Communique and UN Security Council resolution 2254.  The EU provides direct assistance to the UN-led Geneva peace talks and has launched, in coordination with the UN, an initiative to develop political dialogue with key actors from the region to identify common ground.</p><p>Ireland and the EU also provide political and financial support to a broad range of measures which aim to ensure full legal accountability for all war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Syria.  This includes the International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism established by the UN General Assembly to assist in the investigation and prosecution of persons responsible for the most serious crimes under international law committed in Syria, the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria established by the UN Human Rights Council, and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) Fact Finding Mission and Joint Investigative Mission with the UN.  Last month, Ireland co-sponsored the decision adopted by the States Parties to the Chemical Weapons Convention introducing an attribution mechanism to identify the perpetrators of chemical weapons attacks in Syria and elsewhere.<i></i>In addition, Ireland has consistently supported EU sanctions targeting the regime and its supporters, and will continue to do so as long as the situation on the ground justifies these measures.</p><p>The EU and its Member States constitute the largest single donor to the humanitarian response to the Syria crisis and have to date mobilised more than &euro;10.6 billion for humanitarian, stabilisation and resilience assistance inside Syria and in neighbouring countries.  The EU hosted two international donors&rsquo; conferences for Syria in April 2017 and April 2018 at which pledges totalling over &euro;9 billion were made.</p><p>Since 2012, Ireland has provided over &euro;110 million in humanitarian assistance to the humanitarian response to the Syria crisis, making this Ireland&rsquo;s largest contribution to a single crisis in recent years.  In 2017 alone, Ireland provided almost &euro;25.5 million to the humanitarian response.  At the 2018 Brussels Donor conference, Ireland pledged to contribute a further &euro;25 million in 2018 and almost &euro;22 million of this has been disbursed so far.  Through its annual contributions to the EU Institutions, Ireland also supports the EU&rsquo;s humanitarian response in Syria.</p></reply>

This information is not circulated to the full Roster as there are important concerns about the release of personal data in terms of legislation and security to third parties.

Conditions are likely to deteriorate over the coming months as the monsoon season progresses.</p>  <p>  This exodus of refugees has been accompanied by credible claims of serious human rights violations by the Myanmar Security Forces.  These include reports of widespread killing of civilians, sexual and gender based violence, arbitrary arrests, and the burning of Rohingya villages.</p>  <p>  Efforts by the international community to address this crisis have focused on responding to the humanitarian crisis, promoting a political solution and pressing for accountability for crimes and other violations of human rights abuses that have occurred.</p>  <p>  While efforts aimed at achieving accountability and a political solution to the crisis are vitally important, there is an immediate need for a coherent humanitarian response to the extremely difficult conditions faced by the huge numbers of displaced members of the Rohingya community now mainly in Bangladesh.  To this end, Ireland has actively supported the international humanitarian response to the refugee crisis and we provided direct funding of &euro;1 million in 2017 with an additional &euro;1 million allocated for 2018. Our support has focused on food, shelter, water and sanitation.  Through the Irish Aid Rapid Response facility, we have provided 37 tonnes of hygiene, sanitation and shelter kits and deployed experts in water and sanitation and humanitarian coordination on the ground.  In addition, as the 6th largest donor to the UN-administered Central Emergency Response Fund, Ireland's estimated contribution through UN pooled funding amounted to a further &euro;1 million to deliver life-saving support.</p>  <p>  In Northern Rakhine, Ireland provided funding to the Red Cross at the end of 2017 to provide cash transfers to 10,000 households and food and non-food items to 20,000 households; first health and assisted childbirth services; access to sanitation for 5,000 households; and reunification of separated families in Rakhine State.</p>  <p>  Elsewhere in Myanmar, over the course of 2017-18, Ireland is providing over &euro;3.5 million to humanitarian and development NGOs, primarily to Tr&oacute;caire for its work on gender equality, resource rights and humanitarian assistance to conflict affected communities.</p>  <p>  Humanitarian access in Northern Rakhine has been extremely limited since the start of this crisis.  Only the Red Cross Movement and to a lesser extent the World Food Programme have access.  As a result it has not been possible to provide adequate lifesaving assistance to the estimated 100,000-150,000 Rohingya that remain in Rakhine, or to other affected persons in that region.</p>  <p>  Ireland has strongly and consistently pressed for humanitarian access to Myanmar and has added its voice to that of the international community in pushing for this crucial first step in addressing the humanitarian crisis.  I repeat that call here and for the full implementation of the recommendations of the Advisory Commission on Rakhine State.  The report of the Commission urges the Government of Myanmar to ensure full and unimpeded humanitarian access &ndash; for both national and international staff &ndash; at all times and to all communities in Rakhine State.</p>  <p>  An intensive political response by the international community continues to be pursued and on 6 June, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) has been agreed between the Myanmar government, the UN High Commission for Refugees and the UN Development Programme, to establish a framework for cooperation between the parties aimed at creating conducive conditions for the voluntary, safe, dignified and sustainable repatriation of these refugees from Bangladesh to their places of origin.  The MoU also aims to help create improved and resilient livelihoods for all communities living in Rakhine State.</p>  <p>  Ireland continues to actively engage with our international partners in supporting these efforts through bilateral contacts in Myanmar and via participation in the EU and UN responses including at the recent 38th Session of the Human Rights Council.</p>  <p>  Ireland has consistently called for an independent and impartial investigation into the serious and credible allegations of human rights violations by the Myanmar security forces.  In that regard, we have strongly supported the extension of the mandates of the UN Fact Finding Mission and UN Special Rapporteur to Myanmar Yanghee Lee, and have asked the Government of Myanmar to cooperate with them and allow them access to the country.  Their work in investigating allegations, recording victim testimony and gathering other evidence, so that it can be preserved for further criminal proceedings, is crucial to ensuring full accountability.</p>  <p>  Ireland has also actively engaged in the formation of the EU&rsquo;s position including in the most recent EU Foreign Affairs Council&rsquo;s Council Conclusions on Myanmar, which were adopted on 26 February last.  These conclusions condemn the human rights violations in Myanmar, support the mandates of the Fact Finding Mission and Special Rapporteur and provide for targeted restrictive measures against senior military officers of the Myanmar armed forces responsible for these acts.  Targeted sanctions have since been put in place.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to liaise closely with EU and other international partners to press for progress in resolving this crisis including through our Embassies in Thailand and in Hanoi who are closely monitoring the situation.</p></reply>

Our candidature was first announced in 2005 and the campaign has been building since then under successive Governments.</p>  <p>  The official launch of Ireland&rsquo;s candidature took place at UN headquarters in New York on 2 July, marking the beginning of an intensive period of lobbying which will continue until the election in June 2020.  I, along with all my Cabinet colleagues, will be intensifying efforts to make Ireland&rsquo;s case. This political engagement is being supported by my Department&rsquo;s diplomatic personnel.</p>  <p>  The campaign is being coordinated at official level by a core team of staff in the UN Policy Unit, within the Political Division of my Department.  This team currently consists of 6 staff members.  While the UN Policy Unit has a number of other areas of responsibility, the UN Security Council candidature is central to its work.  One secondment is currently envisaged to assist with the implementation of the Global Ireland initiative and this will include support to the Security Council campaign among other tasks.</p>  <p>  In addition to Dublin based staff, Ireland&rsquo;s Mission to the UN in New York is also fully engaged on the election effort.  I would also stress that the campaign is a whole of Department, and whole of Government, undertaking.  Thus messaging and activities relevant to Ireland&rsquo;s candidature are being integrated into the work of all sections and offices of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, as well as that of other Government departments.</p>  <p>  Up to this point Ireland&rsquo;s UN Security Council campaign has been managed within existing resources by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  As we move forward there will be a need for additional resources to promote Ireland&rsquo;s candidature as we seek to secure support from UN Member States.</p>  <p>  Over the coming two years until the election in June 2020, Ireland will seek to build awareness of our achievements and experience globally.  This will be realised through the use of Ireland&rsquo;s diplomatic network, engagement on substantive policy issues at the UN, and the organisation of events on a range of themes which will highlight Ireland&rsquo;s track record globally and our principled commitment to the value of multilateralism.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s traditional policy of military neutrality goes hand in hand with our promotion of international peace and security, including our obligations as members of the United Nations.  This aspect of our history and track record as a UN Member State is one which has resonated across the membership of the UN since we joined in 1955 and we continue to highlight it.  The themes of empathy, partnership and independence are intended to capture Ireland&rsquo;s lived experience and outlook, giving primacy to cooperation, agreement and reasonable compromise.</p></reply>

This is a further deterioration of the terrible situation inside Syria, where over 13 million people require humanitarian assistance.  An additional 5.6 million Syrians have fled to neighbouring countries and the wider region. Ireland recognises that countries in the region have more than played their part.  Jordan as an example, is the second-largest refugee hosting country in the world when compared to the size of its population.</p>  <p>  The safety and protection of civilians inside Syria is an utmost priority and I call on all parties to respect their obligations under International Humanitarian Law.  I welcome the truce announced on Friday, but I am concerned by reports that it has already been breached.  I reiterate my call for an immediate cessation of hostilities and respect for the de-escalation agreement.</p>  <p>  Crucially, unimpeded and sustained humanitarian access must be facilitated. UN agencies and partners are providing support to the Syrian Arab Red Crescent to respond to the urgent needs of the displaced.  This includes health, water and sanitation, food, shelter and other core relief items as well as ensuring the protection of civilians. In addition, UN convoys, in cooperation with the Government of Jordan, have in recent days transported assistance for the tens of thousands of Syrians near the Jordanian border.  These efforts must be sustained and increased.</p>  <p>  Ireland has provided over &euro;110 million towards the Syria crisis since 2012.  Our humanitarian assistance responds to those in need inside Syria as well as Syrian refugees and vulnerable host communities in neighbouring countries.  During a recent visit to a refugee camp in Jordan, where I witnessed first-hand the impact of Ireland's humanitarian assistance, I announced a further &euro;1.25 million in funding for the valuable work of UNICEF and UNHCR.</p>  <p>  At the recent meeting of EU Ministers of Foreign Affairs and Development on June 25th I discussed with my EU counterparts the issue of Syrian refugees from south-western Syria and possible solutions.  Last April, the EU hosted the Brussels II Conference for Syria and the Region, which included a focus on sustaining and increasing humanitarian assistance to all those affected by the crisis in Syria, including Syrian refugees and vulnerable communities in neighbouring countries.  The EU and its Member States contributed &euro;4.8 billion out of the total &euro;6.2 billion pledged until 2020, to support both immediate assistance and longer term response.</p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to advocate for sustained European response to this crisis.  Ultimately, only a political solution to the conflict will end the suffering of the Syrian people.</p></reply>

Prior to 1 July 2013, collection of the original &euro;100 HHC was the responsibility of the Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) on behalf of the Local Authorities.  </p>  <p>  With regards to the Local Property Tax, the Government decided that a liability to the LPT should apply to all owners of residential properties with a limited number of exemptions.  As a matter of Government policy, and in order to keep the rate of the tax low, the Government agreed that reliefs should be targeted at owner occupiers where there is inability to pay the tax.  </p>  <p>  Accordingly, the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012, as amended, provides for the possibility of deferring the charge to LPT in certain circumstances to assist individuals who may have difficulty paying the tax.  To qualify for a deferral, the residential property must be occupied as a sole or main residence.  The gross income thresholds for a full deferral are &euro;15,000 for a single person and &euro;25,000 for a couple, whether married persons, civil partners or qualifying cohabitants.  A person may claim a deferral if their gross income will not, "as can reasonably be foreseen at the liability date" exceed these thresholds in that year.  </p>  <p>  A deferral of up to 50% of the LPT liability will be possible where the gross income of the liable person does not exceed &euro;25,000 for a single person or &euro;35,000 for married persons/civil partners/cohabitants.  The full and partial deferral thresholds may be increased in the case of properties occupied as a sole or main residence and subject to a mortgage.  In such cases, the gross income thresholds may be increased by 80% of the mortgage interest payments.  </p>  <p>  Where a liable person does not qualify for, or does not wish to avail of, a deferral, phased payment of LPT can be used to assist with budgeting.  The Government is aware of the difficulties facing many individuals and families, and for this reason a wide variety of methods for payment of the LPT are available from which liable persons can choose the method most suited to their individual circumstances.  The LPT can be paid by way of phased payments rather than in a single payment; it can also be paid by direct debit; or through payment service providers such as An Post TaxPay, Payzone and Omnivend.  </p>  <p>  I have initiated a review of the LPT which is looking in particular at the impact on LPT liabilities of property price developments.  It includes an examination of the outstanding recommendations of the 2015 Thornhill review of the Local Property Tax.  It is expected that the review will be completed at the end of August and that the review report will provide a number of policy choices for consideration.  The review will be informed by the desirability of achieving relative stability, both over the short and longer terms, in LPT payments of liable persons.  It also included a consultation process to enable all interested parties and individuals to submit their views on the future of the LPT.</p></reply>

This model has been successfully used in the past in establishing other entities such as the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI).  </p>  <p>  In order to ensure that the entity is established in the most efficient manner possible it is envisaged that the NTMA shall first draw upon any relevant resources, services and experience that are already available within NAMA when appointing staff to HBFI. NAMA has amassed considerable expertise in this area through the implementation of its existing residential funding programme and this will be a key asset for HBFI.  </p>  <p>  Ultimately, it will be a matter for the Board of HBFI to determine the precise staffing levels required which will be commensurate with the level of demand for lending from developers.  As a result it is not possible to estimate the number of NAMA staff that may ultimately transfer to HBFI at this time.  The transfer of any NAMA staff will depend on HBFI's requirements and the availability of appropriate resources in NAMA at that point in time.</p></reply>

The Agency announced in October 2017 that it had redeemed all of its &euro;30.2bn in Senior Debt which was guaranteed by the State and since April 2018 it has commenced the redemption of its &euro;1.6bn in subordinated debt.  However, notwithstanding the successful achievement of repaying the State&rsquo;s contingent liability, three years ahead of schedule, there is still a significant body of work yet to be completed by NAMA.  </p>  <p>  Subject to current market conditions prevailing NAMA projects a surplus in the region of &euro;3.5bn to be returned to the State once it completes it work.  The realisation of this surplus depends on the redemption of NAMA&rsquo;s remaining subordinated debt by March 2020 and completion of its Dublin Docklands SDZ and residential funding programmes.  </p>  <p>  As per section 60(2) of the NAMA Act 2009, NAMA may use surplus funds to redeem and cancel its senior and subordinated debt.  Surplus funds may only be returned to the Central Fund once NAMA's debt has been redeemed in full in 2020.  </p>  <p>  Any NAMA surplus paid, while Exchequer positive, will not impact the general government balance, in line with EUROSTAT rules.  It will be a decision for the Government as to how any surplus returned by NAMA will be utilised within the framework of the fiscal rules. However, the intention has always been to use such receipts from the resolution of the financial sector crisis to pay down our national debt and reduce our debt servicing costs.</p></reply>

The Commission was set up as an independent body with its own vote and Accounting Officer and is a body under the aegis of the Department of Finance.  </p>  <p>  Significant additional resources have been applied to the TAC since its inception with the staffing levels more than doubling over its first two years of operation.  Where additional resources have been sought to date, my Department have engaged with each request received.  Indeed the budget for the TAC has almost quadrupled between 2014 and 2018 despite the fact that in 2016 and 2017 the TAC did not spend its full budget allocation.  </p>  <p>  The following information relates to staffing requests received from the TAC.  </p>  <p>  In June 2016 the TAC proposed the re-engagement of two former Commissioners on a temporary basis.  This was followed in July 2016 by a request to recruit two additional temporary clerical staff.  The re-engagement of the former Commissioners was not considered to be in keeping with the mandate of openness and transparency, so in July 2016 sanction was instead given for the appointment of 5 temporary Appeal Commissioners, to be appointed by a competitive process, and 2 full-time clerical staff.  </p>  <p>  An amended request was received from the TAC in August 2016 for 4 clerical staff (to include the 2 clerical staff sanctioned in July), and this was sanctioned in August 2016.  </p>  <p>   In February 2017, following the return to D/Finance of an experienced Principal Officer on secondment to assist with the set-up of the TAC, the TAC requested the secondment of another experienced Principal Officer from my Department.  The position was filled by the appointment of a Principal Officer on secondment from the Department of Finance in May 2017.  </p>  <p>   In August 2017 a request was made by the TAC for 2 additional tax qualified staff at Assistant Principal level to act as case managers and this request was sanctioned.  In parallel to commencing the recruitment process via the Public Appointments Service (PAS) the TAC requested that my Department consider filling some of these positions by sending further staff to the TAC on secondment.  This was not possible as my Department has a limited number of staff with the requisite qualifications/skills and experience and is also dealing with staffing challenges caused by an annual turnover rate of over 23% (including resignations, retirements and staff that have moved to other Departments through promotions etc.).  My officials offered assistance with the process of recruitment via PAS, including the provision of interview board members if required.  The assistance of my Department's HR manager to provide advice and guidance has also been offered to the TAC, but the TAC to date have not availed of this offer.  </p>  <p>  The TAC's 2018 Estimates were submitted to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER) in September 2017, noting that the required additional staffing from January 2018 would be 2 Assistant Principal case managers (the 2 case managers requested in August for which recruitment had commenced), 1 Assistant Principal, 1 Higher Executive Officer and 1 temporary Clerical Officer.  </p>  <p>   This request was sanctioned, and my Department facilitated the transfer of an experienced Higher Executive Officer on secondment to the TAC in October 2017.  I understand that the 2 Assistant Principal case managers were appointed in January 2018.</p>  <p>  In February 2018, the Accounting Officer of the Commission submitted a request to my Department for significant additional resources to meet the increased caseload of the Commission, including an additional 10 administrative staff.  The addition of these resources would involve an effective doubling of the Commission&rsquo;s budget for 2018 from &euro;1.626 million to an estimated &euro;3.226 million which includes extra resources for ICT and new office space.  </p>  <p>   Due to the substantial increase in public resources now being sought by the TAC, my officials requested further information to support the resource request to ensure that the proposed balance of administrative staff and the existing Commissioners would be effective in addressing that workload.  The TAC informed my Department in early March of this year that it had commenced commissioning a review of its resources and operations.  I am awaiting receipt of this report and, in the meantime, I have commissioned an independent reviewer with significant experience of civil service bodies and operations to assess the current position and advise how best to address the TAC's resource needs.  This review has been expedited in order that resourcing decisions, based on a sound business case for the resolution of the current backlog, can be made as soon as possible.</p></reply>

This project is ongoing across all regions and to date site visits have been carried out by Revenue officials to 285 separate premises.  A range of follow-up actions are being pursued with respect to the tax and licensing issues identified, including seizure of unlicensed gaming machines where necessary.</p>  <p>  I am also advised that legislative proposals are being developed at present for the gambling sector  by my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality.  To support this process, the Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality has recently chaired a Gambling Regulation Working Group which has met on 5 occasions since January 2018, with the final meeting taking place last month.  All relevant Government Departments, an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Revenue Commissioners have taken part in the Working Group.  I understand that a report for Government is now being prepared by the Minister of State on foot of the group&rsquo;s discussions.</p></reply>

Ireland&rsquo;s tax regime is designed to encourage the location of real, substantive and high-value adding investment in this country.  We have a competitive tax regime that is fully in line with international standards for fair tax competition as agreed at the EU and the OECD.</p>  <p>  The best way for Ireland to address any reputational issues on tax is to continue to support international tax reform efforts and to continue to implement the various recommendations that we have agreed at EU and OECD level. </p>  <p>  I recognise the importance of ensuring effective taxation of multinational companies and the need for internationally agreed solutions to counter aggressive tax planning, base erosion and profit shifting.  Ireland has fully engaged with international efforts to counter aggressive tax planning to date, through both the OECD&rsquo;s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting and the subsequent coordinated action at EU level leading to the agreement of the two Anti-Tax Avoidance Directives.</p>  <p>  We continue to play our part in this ongoing work.  It is widely acknowledged that difficulties in the international tax system mainly arise from asymmetries between the taxation systems of different countries.  Only by acting together can we ensure that companies are taxed appropriately.</p>  <p>  I should also add that my officials are currently finalising a roadmap setting out a clear programme of action in relation to Ireland&rsquo;s Corporation Tax regime for the coming years having regard to developments at EU, OECD and the wider international level.  This Roadmap follows on from the independent review of Ireland&rsquo;s Corporation Tax Code conducted by Mr. Seamus Coffey, and will set out a comprehensive schedule of actions under way to action the Coffey recommendations, implement the remaining OECD BEPS recommendations and transpose the EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directives. This Roadmap will be published in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

These proposals are being considered by the relevant agencies with a view to their earliest possible implementation.</p>  <p>  In addition a potential permanent coastal protection option has been identified but further assessment of this is required.

This Study enables Local Authorities to meet their responsibility to develop appropriate plans and strategies for the sustainable management of the coastline in their counties.</p>  <p>  The Local Authorities may carry out coastal erosion works using their own resources. Where coastal erosion could give rise to a coastal flood risk, the OPW operates the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme, under which applications for funding from Local Authorities are considered for measures costing up to &euro;750,000 in each instance. In that context, funding for coastal erosion risk management studies may also be applied for under this scheme. Funding of up to 90% of the cost is available for projects which meet the eligibility criteria including a requirement that the proposed measures are cost beneficial.</p>  <p>  The OPW guidelines for coastal erosion risk management measures and funding applications under the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme, are available on the OPW website www.opw.ie</p></reply>

As home based tuition takes place outside the usual school structure it is important that the educational programme provided generally reflects that which would be provided in a school environment.</p>  <p>  It is appropriate therefore that the qualification standard for home based tuition generally reflects that required in a school environment. Accordingly, it is a condition of the scheme that parents/guardians must recruit a tutor who is qualified in the relevant sector, and is registered with the Teaching Council, similar to the requirement for teachers in schools.  </p>  <p>  Where all efforts have failed to secure the services of a teacher qualified to teach in the sector concerned, the Department may consider the engagement of a person who is registered with the Teaching Council and has a primary degree (minimum Level 7 on the National Framework of Qualifications) in a relevant area.</p>  <p>  It is also a requirement of the scheme that all tutors must be vetted prior to commencing the delivery of tuition. Parents are required to satisfy themselves that tutors have been vetted by the Teaching Council of Ireland 2016 via the Teaching Council&rsquo;s online vetting process. </p>  <p>  The terms and conditions of the July Provision Grant Scheme 2018 is set out in the Department's Information Note on the scheme which was published with the application forms on 11 April 2018 and is available on my Departments website at www.education.ie. </p>  <p>  Parents engage tutors for the provision of home based tuition in a private arrangement. It is the responsibility of the parent to source a tutor at the earliest possible opportunity to allow for applications for registration/vetting to be made by the tutor to the Teaching Council, if necessary.  </p>  <p>  The application for the July Provision Grant referred to by the Deputy cannot be approved until the Parent sources a tutor that is registered and vetted by the Teaching Council of Ireland.</p></reply>

A target of 200 students that are blind or visually impaired participating in higher education has been set for 2019 in the NAP.</p>  <p>  While a progress review of the NAP is currently underway which will assess progress towards targets, evidence from the data on the FSD already suggests that this target has been achieved.  In 2016-17 there were over 174 students who are blind or visually impaired supported by the FSD and provisional data indicates that over 200 students have been supported by the Fund in the academic year 2017-18.</p>  <p>  It is expected that the measures that have been implemented through the Plan, including the Programme for Access to Higher Education (PATH) and work to advance the recommendations of the Review of the Fund for Students with Disabilities (FSD) have assisted in the realisation of this target.</p>  <p>  There are other steps taken to improve participation in higher education by students that are blind or that have a visual impairment.  The Disability Access Route to Education (DARE) is a third level alternative admissions scheme for school leavers whose disabilities have had a negative impact on their second-level education.  DARE offers reduced points places to school leavers with a disability under the age of 23.  Students with sensory disabilities, including students that are blind or visually impaired, are prioritised for reduced point&rsquo;s places.</p>  <p>  Each higher education institution offers a range of post-entry supports to students with disabilities.  Supports include a dedicated disability officer, assistive technology, examination accommodations and tailored induction programmes.</p></reply>

This can be due to significant difficulties in areas such as behaviour or sensory needs which have not been ameliorated, even with appropriate intervention, in mainstream.</p><p>In order to access a special class a student must have a report from a relevant professional stating that:</p><p>- S/he has a disability in line with the designation of the special class in question and</p><p>- S/he has complex learning needs that require the support of a special class setting and the reasons why this is the case.</p><p>The NCSE is aware of emerging need in Dublin, from year to year, and where special provision is required it is planned and established to meet that need.</p><p>There are 37 special schools and 218 special classes attached to mainstream schools in Dublin. Of these, 18 are ASD early intervention classes, 124 are primary ASD classes and 36 are post primary ASD classes. The number of ASD special classes in Co. Dublin have increased from 66 in 2011/2012 to 178 in 2017/2018.</p><p>The NCSE has informed my Department that to date they have sanctioned 17 new Special Classes in Co. Dublin for 2018/19 school year.  This process is ongoing.  The NCSE is continuing to work with schools, parents, NEPS, health professionals and other staff who are involved in the provision of services for children with special educational needs in Dublin, to ensure that each child has a school placement appropriate to their needs for the 2018/19 school year and beyond.</p><p>My Department continues to work with the NCSE to ensure that there is appropriate planning in place to ensure that all children who require special class placements can access such placements in schools within their communities.</p><p>My Department has acknowledged that in recent years the establishment of special class provision in some schools and communities has been challenging.</p><p>As part of the process of planning for future provision, a number of measures have been included in the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2016 to provide certain powers to the NCSE to designate a school placement for a child in circumstances where a child is experiencing difficulties in securing enrolment.</p><p>The Bill also proposes powers for the Minister, in certain circumstances, to require a school to open a special class for children with special educational needs.  This amendment will give the Minister the power to compel a school to open a special class or classes where the National Council for Special Education has identified a need for such provision within an area.</p><p>These proposed measures would further enhance the ability of my Department and the NCSE to plan for special class provision and to address issues in provision that may arise from time in time at local levels.</p><p>Guidelines for Boards of Management and Principals of Primary and Post Primary schools contain information on setting up and organising special classes, including information on resources which may be provided to schools to establish special classes are available to download from <i>www.ncse.ie</i>.</p></reply>

In general, children are eligible for school transport if they meet the distance criteria and are attending their nearest school.</p>  <p>  Children who are not eligible for school transport may apply for transport on a concessionary basis only which is subject to a number of conditions including the availability of spare seats on an existing service and payment of the annual charge.</p>  <p>  The annual charge for school transport services is &euro;100 per annum for primary children and &euro;350 for post primary children with a maximum family charge of &euro;220 for primary children only or &euro;650 overall.</p>  <p>  Only children who are eligible for school transport and who hold valid medical cards (GMS Scheme) are exempt from paying the annual charge.</p>  <p>  Arising from commitments in the Programme for Government, a review of the Concessionary Charges and Rules element of the School Transport Scheme was undertaken.  The review was published in December 2016 and made recommendations on both the charges and the rules element of concessionary school transport.</p>  <p>  With regard to the charges for concessionary school transport the recommended course of action was to continue with the current position whereby charges remain in place for those in receipt of concessionary places.  I agreed with this recommendation on the basis that those applying for concessionary transport are making a conscious decision to do so, understand that they are not eligible for school transport and understand the implications of this choice at the time of application.</p>  <p>  Based on current estimates, it is estimated that the cost of extending the medical card waiver to all children who are currently availing of school transport on a concessionary basis would cost in excess of an additional &euro;2m annually.</p>  <p>  The terms of the School Transport Schemes are applied equitably on a national basis.</p></reply>

A new 16 classroom school with special needs unit was constructed in 2016 for Glasnevin Educate Together National School.  In addition, the construction of a new 16 classroom school with special needs unit for Gracepark Educate Together National School is included in my Department&rsquo;s 6 Year Construction Programme.  This project is currently at planning permission stage and when planning is received, it will proceed to tender.  In the meantime, the school is located in temporary accommodation pending the construction of the new permanent school building.</p>  <p>  In relation to school admissions, parents can choose which school to apply to and where the school has places available the pupil should be admitted.  However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available, a selection process may be necessary.  This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.  However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</p></reply>

Under these arrangements my Department pays for a substitute teacher to be employed by a school to facilitate administrative functions to be undertaken by the teaching principal.</p>  <p>  Building on measures in previous budgets to enhance school leadership, Budget 2018 made &euro;0.4 million available to fund almost 4600 additional release days for teaching principals in primary schools.  This additional funding will see an increase in the number of release days available to teaching principals in the 2018/19 school year to 17, 23 or 29 days depending on the size of the school.</p>  <p>  Budget 2017 allowed for the commencement of restoration of middle management posts as part of an agreed distributed leadership model and meant lifting the rigidity of the longstanding moratorium on these posts at primary and post-primary levels.  This recognises the key role school leadership has in promoting a school environment which is welcoming, inclusive and accountable.</p>  <p>  &euro;2.75m was allocated in Budget 2017 to restore middle management positions i.e. the equivalent of approximately 1,300 middle management posts (Assistant Principal I and Assistant Principal II) at both Primary and Post-Primary. (2,600 in total).</p>  <p>  Circular 63/2017 was issued by my Department in September 2017 which sets out a leadership and management framework for posts in recognised primary schools.  Flexibility in identifying and prioritising the evolving leadership and management needs of the school, and in assigning and re-assigning post holders to specific roles and responsibilities to meet the evolving needs of a school, is an essential feature of this school leadership model.</p>  <p>  While the Principal is ultimately responsible to the Board of Management for the management and leadership of the school, the Deputy Principal also occupies a position of vital importance within the senior leadership team in each school.  The Deputy Principal co-operates with the Principal in the fulfilment of the Principal's role and acts or deputises as the Principal in the Principal's absence.</p>  <p>  In relation to the duties assigned to Assistant Principal posts, the Principal following consultation with staff, agree the schedule of duties as best meet the needs of the school.  These duties are designed to reduce the workload of the Principal.</p>  <p>  The selection and recruitment process is well under way in most of our primary schools and the majority of these new middle management posts will be filled in the current school year, including schools where the Principal is a "Teaching Principal".</p>  <p>  I recently announced an extension to the arrangements for schools with teaching principals to cluster their release days into full-time posts, with one teacher covering the release days of all the schools in the cluster.  Up to 50 principal release cluster posts will be put in place for the 2018/19 school year.  This measure will assist teaching principals to more effectively plan their release days for the benefit of the school.</p>  <p>  The Teacher Allocation section of my Department are currently processing these applications and schools are being notified as the cluster posts are approved.</p>  <p>  Any additional increase in the number of release days will be considered as part of the next annual budgetary process alongside the many other demands from the education sector.</p></reply>

The distribution of the population necessitates a relatively large number of small primary schools.  In the case of Principals in smaller schools, while management and administrations duties may be smaller in scale than those of larger schools, they must be undertaken in addition to their full-time teaching duties.</p><p>The enrolment required for administrative principal in ordinary schools, gaelscoileanna and schools in the Gaeltacht is 176 pupils, or 113 if operating a specialist autism unit.</p><p>Schools that have less than this enrolment have teaching principals.  Recently published Circular 40/2018 is available on the Department&rsquo;s website, which outlines the number of days that teaching principals may take as release time in a school year in order to assist them fulfilling their principal duties.  Under these arrangements my Department pays for a substitute teacher to be employed by a school to facilitate administrative functions to be undertaken by the teaching principal.</p><p>Building on measures in previous budgets to enhance school leadership, Budget 2018 made &euro;0.4 million available to fund almost 4600 additional release days for teaching principals in primary schools.  This additional funding will see an increase in the number of release days available to teaching principals in the 2018/19 school year to 17, 23 or 29 days depending on the size of the school.</p><p>Budget 2017 allowed for the commencement of restoration of middle management posts as part of an agreed distributed leadership model and meant lifting the rigidity of the longstanding moratorium on these posts at primary and post-primary levels.  This recognises the key role school leadership has in promoting a school environment which is welcoming, inclusive and accountable.</p><p>&euro;2.75m was allocated in Budget 2017 to restore middle management positions i.e. the equivalent of approximately 1,300 middle management posts (Assistant Principal I and Assistant Principal II) at both Primary and Post-Primary. (2,600 in total).</p><p>The selection and recruitment process is well under way in most of our primary schools and the majority of these new middle management posts will be filled in the current school year, including schools where the Principal is a &quot;Teaching Principal&quot;.</p><p>Circular 63/2017 was issued by the Department in September 2017 which deals and sets out a leadership and management framework for posts in recognised primary schools.</p><p>While the Principal is ultimately responsible to the Board of Management for the management and leadership of the school, the Deputy Principal occupies a position of vital importance within the senior leadership team in each school.  The Deputy Principal co-operates with the Principal in the fulfilment of the Principal's role and acts or deputises as the Principal in the Principal's absence.</p><p>In relation to the duties assigned to Assistant Principal posts, the Principal following consultation with staff, agree the schedule of duties as best meet the needs of the school.  These duties are designed to reduce the workload of the Principal.</p><p>I recently announced an extension to the arrangements for schools with teaching principals to cluster their release days into full-time posts, with one teacher covering the release days of all the schools in the cluster.  Up to 50 principal release cluster posts will be put in place for the 2018/19 school year.  This measure will assist teaching principals to more effectively plan their release days for the benefit of the school.</p><p>Any additional increase in the number of release days will be considered as part of the next annual budgetary process alongside the many other demands from the education sector.</p><p>Attached is the breakdown of the number of teaching principals in primary schools in Kildare, Laois and Offaly, as requested.</p><p><b>Number of schools with teaching principals</b><table><tr><th>County</th><th>Number of teaching principals in 2017/18 school year</th></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td>39</td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td>42</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>31</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Where the introduction of digital devices is planned, consultation with members of the school community including parents is advised. The cost and other implications must be fully considered by the Boards of Managements before a decision is made. I believe it is important for schools, in conjunction with parents, to retain local autonomy for decisions on the use of tablet devices and how best to manage their integration into classroom practice.  In making this decision each school should consider all the available information. </p>  <p>  The Professional Development Service for Teachers Technology in Education (PDST-TIE) offers advice to schools and have developed an advice sheet, on the adoption of tablets in schools, on its website which covers areas such as what tablets can offer a school, educational and purchasing considerations, and software.</p>  <p>  I am keenly aware of the challenges faced by educators and parents, in relation to costs of digital devices including eBooks, and my Department continues to work to help support schools and families meet these costs. In 2017 a circular letter issued to schools with measures to be adopted to reduce the cost of school uniforms and other costs. This circular also instructed schools to consult with parents and their school community on the issue of ensuring costs are reasonable for parents, and how to avoid costs acting as a barrier. This circular specified that wherever possible, generic rather than branded items should be specified (e.g. uniform, clothing, IT tablets, sports equipment etc.). The issue of costs to parents will also be included in the Guidelines that will issue with the Education (Parent and Student Charter) Bill 2018.</p>  <p>  Direct assistance is provided through the School Books Grant Scheme for books including eBooks for children in all recognised primary and post-primary schools. All schools are encouraged to operate such a scheme, under which some &euro;7 million in funding to primary schools in 2017.  </p>  <p>  In addition, the Digital Strategy for Schools 2015-2020, sets out a plan to embed the use of digital technology in teaching, learning and assessment. The Strategy recognises that schools require investment in their ICT infrastructure.  Funding of &euro;210m has been committed to support the implementation of this strategy with &euro;60m issued to schools over the 2016/17 and 2017/18 school years. This will increase to &euro;50m a year over the lifetime of the strategy.</p></reply>

This announcement follows nationwide, demographic exercises carried out by my Department into the future need for primary and post-primary schools across the country and the 4-year horizon will enable increased lead-in times for planning and delivery of the necessary infrastructure. </p><p>A patronage process is run after it has been decided, based on demographic analysis, that a new school is required.  This patronage process is open to all patron bodies and prospective patrons.  Parental preferences for each patron, from parents of children who reside in the school planning areas concerned, together with the extent of diversity currently available in these areas, are key to decisions in relation to the outcome of this process.  </p><p>An Online Patronage Process System (OPPS) has been developed by my Department to provide objective information to all parents which will allow them to make an informed choice about their preferred model of patronage for their child&rsquo;s education. Parental preferences were previously collected based on direct engagement with patron bodies. The Online Patronage Process System (OPPS) website is currently live for the post-primary schools to be established in 2019.</p><p>All new schools established since 2011 to meet demographic demand are required to prioritise enrolments from the designated school planning area(s) which the school was established to serve.  Therefore, only parents of eligible children residing in the relevant school planning area(s) can express a preference with regard to the patronage of the new school. This does not preclude schools from enrolling pupils from outside of the designated school planning area, rather it reflects the need to accommodate in the first instance the demographic for which the school was established. </p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, there are currently 27 primary schools located in the Drogheda school planning area, including 2 primary schools in Duleek. Parents of children, including children attending a primary school in Duleek, who are due to start post-primary education in the 5 year period 2019 to 2023 and who are resident in the Drogheda school planning area may be eligible to express a preference with regard to the patronage of the new post-primary school. Parents can visit the OPPS website at <i>https://patronage.education.gov.ie</i>to check their eligibility and to view the relevant school planning area map.</p></reply>

The current school planning areas take account not only of local groupings of schools, but also of natural boundaries, Census Small Areas and other local conditions. These school planning areas are used in the demographic exercise as a basis for the assessment of areas of growth and to inform recommendations on the establishment of any new schools required in that school planning area. </p><p>As the school planning areas were aligned with the Census Small Areas and a townland or electoral division can fall into more than one school planning area, the information is not readily available in the format requested by the Deputy. </p><p>A patronage process is currently under way in respect of four post-primary schools announced to be established in 2019 for the following school planning areas:</p><p>- Laytown and Drogheda (Regional Solution),</p><p>- Galway City and Oranmore (Regional Solution),</p><p>- Donaghmede_Howth_D13; and</p><p>- Wicklow. </p><p>A list of the Census Small Areas which are located within each of the above school planning areas are outlined in the following link for the Deputy's information.</p></reply>

In employing an individual, it is up to the school to determine what terms and conditions the individual is employed under.  My Department has no plans to develop an alternative scheme for schools to employ secretaries separate to the current system of capitation grant assistance.</p><p>Notwithstanding that, in 2015 my Department agreed to engage with the union side in relation to the pay of school secretaries (and caretakers) who are employed using grant funding and to enter an arbitration process.  The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for school secretaries (and caretakers) comprehended by the terms of the arbitration process and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 for such staff be phased in over the period 2016 to 2019.  Grant funding used by schools to fund the salaries of ancillary staff is also being improved on a phased basis between 2016 and 2019 following the arbitration process.  These increases are in order to enable schools implement the arbitration outcome for grant funded secretaries (and caretakers).</p><p>In December 2017, my Department published circular letter 0078/2017 for primary schools and circular letter 0079/2017 for voluntary secondary schools, setting out the application of the third phase increases of the Arbitrator&rsquo;s recommendations.  The circulars are available at:</p><p>Circular 0078/2017:  <i></i><i><i>https://www.education.ie/en/Circulars-and-Forms/Active-Circulars/cl0078_2017.pdf</i></i></p><p>Circular 0079/2017:  <i><i>http://www.education.ie/en/Circulars-and-Forms/Active-Circulars/cl0079_2017.pdf</i></i></p><p>The increases recommended by the Arbitrator are binding and must be applied by all schools who employ staff to whom the Arbitrator's recommendation applies.</p></reply>

However, I must be prudent in the context of ongoing budgetary pressures and prioritise where it is not possible to do everything that I would like to do in the education sector in any one year.  In the last two budgets, I made provision for 6,000 extra teachers and 3,000 extra SNAs and over 3,000 new middle management posts.  These resources were allocated to improve the learning experience right across the sector, with a particular focus on children with special needs.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that Budget 2018 marked the second year of major reinvestment in the education sector, as we continue to implement the Action Plan for Education, which has the central aim to make the Irish Education and Training service the best in Europe within a decade.  In 2018, the budget for the Department of Education increased by &euro;554 million to over &euro;10 billion.  Through budget 2017 and Budget 2018, we are now investing &euro;1 billion more in education.</p>  <p>  Improvements have been made for the restoration of grant funding that is used by schools to fund the salaries of ancillary staff.  The ancillary grant was increased by &euro;6 in 2016, &euro;5 in 2017 and &euro;5 in 2018, in order to enable primary schools to implement the arbitration salary increase for grant funded school secretaries and caretakers and to also implement the restoration of salary for cleaners arising from the unwinding of FEMPI legislation.  </p>  <p>  The level of funding provided to all schools and the drivers of costs at school level are kept under review by my Department.</p></reply>

Capitation related grants are issued to the majority of primary and post-primary schools to employ such staff.  Within the capitation grant schemes, it is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs.</p><p>Where a school uses the capitation grant funding to employ a secretary, such staff are employees of individual schools.  My Department has no plans to develop an alternative scheme for schools to employ school secretaries separate to the current system of capitation grant assistance.</p><p>Notwithstanding that, in 2015 my Department agreed to engage with the union side in relation to the pay of school secretaries who are employed using grant funding, and to enter an arbitration process.  The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for school secretaries (and caretakers and cleaners) comprehended by the terms of the arbitration process and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 for such staff be phased in over the period 2016 to 2019.  Grant funding used by schools to fund the salaries of ancillary staff is also being improved on a phased basis between 2016 and 2019 following the arbitration process.  These increases are in order to enable schools  implement the arbitration outcome for grant funded secretaries (and caretakers and cleaners).</p><p>In December 2017, my Department published circular letter 0078/2017 for primary schools and circular letter 0079/2017 for voluntary secondary schools, setting out the application of the third phase increases of the Arbitrator&rsquo;s recommendations.  The circulars are available at:</p><p>Circular 0078/2017: <i>https://www.education.ie/en/Circulars-and-Forms/Active-Circulars/cl0078_2017.pdf</i></p><p>Circular 0079/2017: <i></i></p><p>The increases recommended by the Arbitrator are binding and must be applied by all schools who employ staff to whom the Arbitrator's recommendation applies. </p></reply>

This pilot project was funded by Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII).</p>  <p>  According to TII, an analysis of driver behaviour carried out in October 2015 confirmed that 58% of drivers using the Dublin Port Tunnel exceeded the 80 km/h speed limit, and 20% exceeded this limit by more than 10 km/h. </p>  <p>  Following the introduction of the average speed camera system at the Dublin Port Tunnel, the percentage of drivers exceeding the limit by more than 10 km/h has fallen to 0.15%. This suggests that the system has had a significant effect on driver behaviour. TII also emphasises that this reduction in excessive speed is particularly notable, occurring, as it does, against the backdrop of increasing weekday traffic volumes, with Monday-Friday traffic volumes rising by 40% over the past five years.</p>  <p>  Prior to the introduction of this system, speed checks at the Dublin Port Tunnel were conducted using handheld laser-based technology, and required a Garda presence to identify and intercept speeding vehicles. For safety reasons, these checks could only be conducted outside the tunnel and, therefore, could not influence driver behaviour inside the tunnel itself. </p>  <p>  The average speed camera system allows the enforcement of the speed limit within the tunnel itself, with automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) used to identify vehicles that have exceeded the speed limit and the relevant fixed charge notices (FCNs) are issued by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na without the vehicle being intercepted.</p>  <p>  I understand that TII has recommended the extension of the average speed camera project for an additional four years and has committed to continuing its funding and operation of the system during the extension period.</p>  <p>  In terms of speed enforcement on other roads, I would remind the Deputy that this is accomplished by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na through the use of both intercept and non-intercept methods, with safety cameras being used in specific locations, known as speed enforcement zones, around the country in order to provide non-intercept detection of speeding vehicles. </p>  <p>  The overall impact of the safety cameras can be seen in the impact on the fatal collisions in the designated speed enforcement zones. The designation of specific sections of road as speed enforcement zones is based on an analysis of collision data by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. In the years 2004 to 2009 (the 6 years before the introduction of the safety camera network began), approximately 3 out of 10 (30%) fatal collisions occurred in these zones. In 2015, this figure had reduced to 16% (or 24 road deaths) in safety camera zones.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that the deployment of Garda resources is, of course, a matter for the Garda Commissioner, and I, Minister for Justice and Equality, have no role in such operational matters.</p></reply>

In determining whether to make a deportation order, in addition to the factors set out in Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, I must also consider all relevant constitutional and international human rights arising including those enshrined in the Refugee Convention, the UN Convention Against Torture and the European Charter of Human Rights. The question of not returning a person to a place where certain fundamental rights would be breached (or non refoulement as it is referred to) is fully considered in every case when deciding whether or not to make a deportation order. This involves consideration of whether returning the person would result in the life or freedom of that person being threatened on account of his or her race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, or whether the person would be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.</p><p>A deportation order requires the person concerned to remove themselves from the State and it is only where they fail to do so that the State is forced to remove them and enforce the rule of law. A deportation order is of no definite duration but it is open to the subject of such an Order to make an application to have it revoked where there is a change of circumstances since the Order was made. </p><p>It is to be noted that the enforcement of deportation orders is an operational matter for the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB). </p><p>I should<b></b>remind the Deputy that queries in relation to the status of individual Immigration cases may be made direct to INIS by Email using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.  The service enables up-to-date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek this information through the more administratively expensive Parliamentary Questions process.</p></reply>

As the Deputy will appreciate, in some cases it is necessary for the Garda authorities to conduct further enquiries in respect of the requirements of the Acts, for example to verify identity or establish the outcome of an investigation. In such cases processing times may be longer than the general average.</p>  <p>   Once the processing of a vetting application has been completed by the National Vetting Bureau the result is returned to the relevant registered organisation.  It is a matter for that organisation to complete whatever processes are in place with the individual applicants.</p></reply>

That is reflected by its inclusion on the Government&rsquo;s list of priority legislation for publication during this Oireachtas session. </p>  <p>  My officials have been working very intensively on this important Bill, together with the Office of Parliamentary Counsel, and the drafting is now well advanced.  I expect to bring the Bill to Government very shortly for agreement to publish.  </p>  <p>  I agree that it has taken considerably longer than I had wished or intended, to finalise the Bill for publication.  The reasons for this are genuine.  It is a complex Bill, both in drafting terms and on the substance.  The Deputy will be aware that this Bill will, among other matters, make provision regarding coronial investigation of maternal deaths, in response to the Private Member's Bill tabled by Deputy Clare Daly in that regard. Both Deputy Daly's Bill, and much of the work done by my Department on the reform of coronial law, refer to the text of the Coroners Bill 2007, which provided for a comprehensive reform of coronial law and of the administrative structure of the coroner service in Ireland.  That administrative reform requires significant updating and is not yet ready to proceed.  That means that we have had to translate the key reforms of coronial law that we are now seeking to make, from the structure and language of the 2007 Bill, into the existing legislation, which dates from 1962.  I am satisfied that the Bill I intend to bring forward will fully meet these rather demanding technical drafting requirements, but they have slowed down the drafting process and rendered it more complex. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Deputy will be aware there is a huge amount of overall legislative activity &ndash; and even of priority legislation - at present in relation both to Private Members&rsquo; Bills, and to the Government&rsquo;s legislative programme, across a large number of fronts.  The volume of legislative work means that the resource of the specialists who are available to do it is often spread very thinly. </p>  <p>  My officials are currently finalising the Bill together with the Office of Parliamentary Counsel, and I expect to seek Government agreement to publish before the end of this month.  </p>  <p>  I intend to move the Bill as early as possible after publication, so that, with the cooperation of all sides, we can facilitate its swift passage through the Houses.</p></reply>

The examination includes the concerns raised by the Law Reform Commission in 2013 such as those relating to how representative juries are of their communities, the wide group of people who can at present be excused as of right from jury service; juries serving in lengthy or complex criminal trials; the reasonable accommodation of persons with disabilities to serve as jurors; the implications of on-line internet activity and wireless technology for the work and conduct of juries and issues of remuneration arising from jury service.  The Working Group will consider some additional areas relevant to the reform of policy in this area including, for example, its constitutional aspects and the overall fit of the existing legislative architecture provided by the Juries Act of 1976 as amended which sets out relevant law in this jurisdiction particularly in terms of qualification and selection for service as a juror. </p>  <p>  The membership of the Working Group, which is chaired by my Department, is drawn from senior officials of the relevant Divisions of the Department of Justice and Equality, the Courts Service, Forensic Science Ireland, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Its inaugural meeting took place on 30 April 2018 when it had an initial opportunity to discuss its proposed Terms of Reference and gave its first consideration to the Draft Juries Bill and the other aspects of the Law Reform Commission Report of 2013.  The current focus of the Working Group is on engaging in a work programme based on that approach.  The conclusions of the work of the Group will form the basis of a report and a draft General Scheme of a Juries Service Bill building on the initial draft for such a scheme proposed by the Law Reform Commission in its 2013 Report.  This represents a substantial body of work given that the Commission's Report made 56 recommendations of which 32 are expected to require legislative intervention.</p>  <p>  While the time-frame of actions to be taken on foot of the Working Group&rsquo;s deliberations will be dependent on its specific findings and recommendations the aim would be to have the anticipated General Scheme of a new Juries Bill, subject of course to receiving the necessary Cabinet approval, early in 2019.</p></reply>

However, I do have plans to introduce legislation to strengthen the existing law on coronial investigation of maternal deaths. </p>  <p>  The Coroners (Amendment) Bill, already approved for drafting by the Government in May 2017, is a very important Bill, which I expect to bring to Government shortly for agreement to publish.</p>  <p>  This Bill will, among other key reforms of coronial law, introduce mandatory reporting, post-mortem examination and inquest, in cases of direct or indirect maternal death.  It will also extend the legal aid provisions, introduced for certain inquests in the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013, to a family member of the deceased at an inquest into a maternal death. </p>  <p>  This will ensure clarity for responsible persons, including hospital authorities, and will support the development of transparent and accountable oversight for checking and investigating certain types of death.  Most importantly, it will provide clarity and transparency for bereaved families.  I take this opportunity to acknowledge the contribution made by Deputy Clare Daly to the Bill, through her earlier Private Member's Bill. </p>  <p>   It will be an offence for a responsible person not to report a mandatory reportable death to the coroner.  There will also be improved provisions on the reporting of certain peri-natal and infant deaths, to support prompt and transparent provision of information by health and other authorities to bereaved families.  More broadly, the Bill will also update and strengthen the legal powers available to coroners regarding reporting, post-mortem and inquest of unnatural deaths; and including more robust powers to compel attendance by witnesses and the production of documents at inquest.  The Bill will also allow a wider scope for inquests, from investigating the immediate cause of death to establishing the circumstances in which the death occurred.   </p>  <p>  The public importance of effective and transparent independent investigation in such cases is obvious.  In addition, these measures will strengthen our compliance with the European Convention on Human Rights.</p></reply>

To support this a concerted effort is being made to encourage women and minority communities to consider a career in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Recent recruitment campaigns have made a significant effort through on-line videos and other media to attract candidates from minority communities and diverse social groups. In the most recent recruitment campaign a series of videos and text were produced in multiple languages including English, Irish, French, Spanish, Italian and Arabic. They were published on the Garda Facebook page which has more than 180,000 followers.</p>  <p>  In relation to the proportion of women members in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na I am informed that the total number as of the 31 May 2018, the latest date for which figures are readily available, is approximately 3,600 or close to 27% of the total strength. This compares favourably with the number on 31 December 2008 which was approximately 3,100 or 22% of the total strength. This is broadly in line with other police services in England and Wales.</p>  <p>  The Commissioner&rsquo;s  Policing Plan 2018 commits to the development of a positive action plan to attract and recruit applicants from minority and diverse groups and to review barriers or disincentives to entry to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and to examine ways in which applications from diverse minority communities for entry into An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can be increased. In that regard, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are in the process of developing a strategy to further embed the principles of equality, diversity and inclusion within the organisation.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be aware that the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland established by the Government is, as part of its terms of reference examining the composition, recruitment and training of personnel to ensure that the personnel in the organisation reflect the diversity of Irish society. The Commission is due to report in September 2018.</p></reply>

The outcome of this pilot study will inform any future decisions in relation to the Garda fleet.</p>  <p>  More generally, I am informed that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have been involved in the Public Sector Energy reporting programme since 2011 and have achieved a 25.7% improvement in energy efficiency up to 2017, against the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP) 33% energy efficiency target by 2020.

In this regard, the European Council called on the Council and the Commission to explore the concept of regional disembarkation platforms, in cooperation with third countries as well as UNHCR and the International Organisation for Migration (IOM).  Furthermore, the European Council agreed to set up 'controlled centres' in willing Member States to allow for rapid processing to distinguish between irregular migrants and those in need of international protection.  </p>  <p>  These measures are at the very early stages of development. I and my officials will play an active role in any discussions on their development and the Council itself confirmed in its Conclusions that any centres established must operate in full compliance with international law.    </p>  <p>  The European Council also called on Member States to contribute further to the EU Trust Fund for Africa.

An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continue to monitor all new and emerging crime trends in our communities, particularly in the summer months and deploy Garda resources accordingly to address any problems that arise.</p>  <p>  Working with communities to tackle public disorder and reduce anti-social behaviour remains a key priority for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. This approach includes a strong focus on quality of life issues and collaboration with local authorities to help address the causes of anti-social behaviour. I might add that there is a range of strong legislative provisions available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to combat anti-social behaviour, including provisions under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Acts, the Criminal Damage Act and the Intoxicating Liquor Acts. There are also the incremental provisions contained in the Criminal Justice Act 2006 which provide, in Part 11, for warnings and civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by adults and, in Part 13 of the Act, for warnings, good behaviour contracts and civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by children.</p>  <p>  Anti-social behaviour has no place in a civilised society. For its part, the Government remains committed to ensuring that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have all the necessary resources to tackle all forms of criminality in our communities. In this context, the Deputy will be aware that a very substantial budget of &euro;1.65 billion has been allocated to the Garda Vote for 2018 and &euro;98.5m has been provided for Garda overtime for 2018, which inter alia supports Garda activity to tackle these types of problems.</p>  <p>  While An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to tackle these problems head-on, they cannot eradicate the problem of anti-social behaviour alone. Specifically in relation to young offenders, it is also up to us as adults, particularly the parents and guardians of our young, to ensure that children are raised to be respectful and law-abiding. These lessons begin in the home, are further reinforced in our schools and then by wider society in general. We must all work together to ensure that such behaviour is never normalised and is tackled immediately. </p>  <p>  Clearly, Garda visibility is very important and this Government remains committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime. To this end, the House will be aware that 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during 2018, some 200 of whom attested in March, with a further 200 attesting recently. The new recruits are visible proof of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 including 15,000 Garda members. </p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. </p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that the overall Garda strength on 31 May 2018, the latest date for which information is readily available, was 13,604. There are also 558 Garda Reserves and more than 2,300 civilians attached to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.  </p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime. To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal. </p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, almost 2,000 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide. Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 &ndash; a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016. </p><p>I am pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College. In total, 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year, 400 of whom have attested to date. Further, Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, are on track to reach 14,000 by the end of 2018.</p><p>In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties. There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018. </p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Division to increase Garda visibility in our communities and to support all Garda activity including Community Policing. </p><p>For the Deputy's information, I have set out in the attached tables the number of Garda&iacute;, Community Garda&iacute;, Garda Reserve in each Division and Civilian Staff in each Garda Station, as of the 31 May 2018, the latest date for which figures are available.</p><p><b>Civilian by

Restricting applicants from employing any other person or carrying on a business in partnership with another person, including another applicant, recognises the applicant's temporary permission to access the labour market. This protects potential employees or partners from a situation where an applicant's labour market permission expires, is otherwise withdrawn or partners who ends up with different outcomes of the protection process.  </p></reply>

They are also matters on which I can assure the Deputy both my Department and the Authority are in ongoing discussion with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>  <p>  As had been reflected in my Written Reply to Question No. 404 of 13 July 2017, the Authority has been supported in this endeavour by an advance of &euro;1 million during each of the years 2016 and 2017 from my Department's Vote and a similar allocation of &euro;1 million has been made for the current year. These advances are being made, as provided under section 32 of the 2015 Act, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform for the purposes of expenditure by the Authority in the performance of its functions. As also reflected in that Written Reply and since set out in more detail in the Authority's published Annual Report for 2017, the Authority spent its first year completing a series of statutory and time-bound reports and public consultations while also establishing a start-up office and recruiting its first full-time Chief Executive who was appointed in November 2017.</p>  <p>  As part of the roll-out of the 2015 Act, a number of legal and technical issues have arisen in relation to the practical application of the funding framework that the Act provides. These provisions were intended, from a policy perspective, to provide the means whereby the Authority, having been funded for an initial and short start-up period on a recoupable basis, could then become self-funding in the longer term. This would be achieved by means of a levy based on actual expenditure by the Authority in the immediately preceding financial year and raised from those legal practitioners being regulated in the terms currently set out in Part 7 of the 2015 Act. The fact that the effective roll-out of the Authority's remaining functions will require substantially more time than initially considered and that the levy also needs time to generate actual income have revealed a potential gap in the original model of recoupability that now needs to be reconsidered and resolved. This is made more complex because the levy is also intrinsically linked, in its application, to a number of other measures including the current work of the Authority in setting-up the Roll of Practising Barristers in support of which I recently commenced the necessary provisions of Part 9 of the 2015 Act. </p>  <p>  My Department has, therefore, acknowledged the Authority's position, which it has reflected in its risk register, that the levy provisions as drafted in the 2015 Act may not, in their practical implementation and in the transpiring circumstances of the start-up, provide an adequate source of funding to the Authority and may not similarly provide for the recoupability of advances as may originally have been foreseen. My Department has also been informed by the Authority that it has engaged a financial consultant to examine the current levy provisions and to provide an expert economic/financial opinion on them. This is expected to be provided soon and will be given early and detailed consideration by my Department and the Authority in conjunction with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform who are, as I have said, aware of the issues concerned. Both my Department and the Authority are committed, on that basis, to the prompt and robust analysis and examination of the funding provisions within the 2015 Act to ensure that there is a sustainable levy-based framework under which the Authority is sufficiently funded going forward to fulfil its broad remit as a new regulatory body. We also wish to ensure that there is no setback to the progress it has made to date and to the important programme of reform it has undertaken under its Strategic Plan for 2018-2020. Along with the relevant officials of my Department I will, therefore, be giving detailed consideration to any necessary measures proposed including legislative amendments or refinements, if any, that may be considered appropriate.</p></reply>

There is no specific determination process for recognition of stateless persons in Ireland; claims of statelessness can arise at any point in the immigration and protection processes and the numbers involved are very low.  These cases are frequently disposed of without recourse to a determination of statelessness through procedures (e.g. permission to remain) set out under the Immigration Acts or International Protection Acts.  Such cases are not centralised in a single process or section of the immigration service and, as such, statistics on stateless persons are not available in the way sought by the Deputy. </p></reply>

This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process. The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from the INIS is, in the Deputy&rsquo;s view, inadequate or too long awaited.</p></reply>

The LEOs can also offer advice and guidance in areas such as Local Authority rates, Public Procurement and other regulations affecting business.</p>  <p>  The LEOs can offer direct grant aid to microenterprises (10 employees or fewer) in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sectors which, over time, have the potential to develop into strong export entities. Subject to certain eligibility criteria, the LEOs can provide financial assistance within three main categories: Feasibility Grants (investigating the potential of a business idea); Priming Grants (to part-fund a start-up); and Business Development Grants for existing businesses that want to expand. (It should be noted that the LEOs do not provide direct grant-aid to areas such as retail, personal services, local professional services, construction/local building services, as it may give rise to the displacement of existing businesses). In addition, there is a Technical Assistance Grant available for eligible micro-exporter applicants who are seeking to explore alternative markets for their product or service.</p>  <p>  For anyone interested in starting or growing a business, the LEOs may be able to offer &lsquo;soft&rsquo; support in the form of training (e.g. a Start Your Own Business course); a mentor to work with the business proposer; or targeted programmes such as Lean for Micro (to help boost business productivity and competitiveness).</p>  <p>  Micro-enterprises may also avail of the Trading Online Voucher Scheme (TOVS) from the LEOs. The Scheme offers the opportunity for businesses to develop their website or digital marketing strategy by availing of vouchers of up to &euro;2,500 or 50% of eligible expenditure.</p>  <p>  Anyone with a viable business proposal can also use the LEO to make an application to MicroFinance Ireland, which offers support in the form of loans of up to &euro;25,000 to start-ups with viable business propositions that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by the banks. Successful applicants can avail of a more favourable interest rate from MFI if they make their application through the LEO.</p>  <p>  The LEO Capital budget was increased by four million in 2017 and was retained this year, bringing the total Capital funding to &euro;22.5m. </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland supports companies in regional and rural areas to start, innovate and remain competitive in international markets, now and into the future. Enterprise Ireland provide a range of financial and non-financial supports for home-grown business start-ups to scale and succeed in international markets, these supports are tailored to a company&rsquo;s stage of growth and level of ambition.   </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s focus for 2018 is to help clients, including homegrown business start-ups to build on the strength of their 2017 performance by supporting them to innovate, be competitive and to diversify their global footprint -  key attributes required to be resilient to economic shocks:</p>  <p>  - launched a new Market Discovery Fund to incentivise companies to research viable and sustainable market entry strategies in new geographic markets; and</p>  <p>  - launched a new fast-track Agile Innovation Fund which gives companies rapid access to innovation funding to enhance processes and adapt products for new markets.</p>  <p>  - Providing supports such as The Be Prepared Grant and the Act On consultancy grant to assist companies, such as homegrown business start-ups. </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland will continue to work with homegrown business start-ups to assist them scale and succeed in international markets.</p>  <p>  I should also draw your attention to the &lsquo;Supporting SMEs&rsquo; Online Tool, which is a cross-governmental initiative to help start-ups navigate the range of Government business supports for which they could be eligible. The tool is available at www.supportingsmes.ie By answering the eight questions in the Online Tool, a small business will, in one location, be able to:</p>  <p>  - find out which of the over 170 Government business supports from 27 different Government Departments, Agencies and Initiatives are available to them;</p>  <p>  - obtain information on the range of Government supports for accessing credit;</p>  <p>  - identify their nearest Local Enterprise Office where they can discuss the outcomes of the guide further;</p>  <p>  - download all these filtered results into a document for their further use.</p></reply>

Its follow up work involves engagement with the Department of Education and Skills, Higher Education Authority, SOLAS and other relevant bodies to produce an agreed action plan to address the skills needs identified. </p>  <p>  Recently completed and ongoing work being undertaken by the EGFSN includes analyses of skills needs or skills implications relevant to the food and drink sector, design, high level ICT, trade related skill sets in the context of Brexit and digitalisation.</p>  <p>  As part of the new national skills architecture, the EGFSN presents its findings to the National Skills Council, chaired by the Minister for Education and Skills, which, together with additional skills and labour market intelligence provided by the Regional Skills Fora, Skills and Labour Market Research Unit (SLMRU) in SOLAS, and information on employment permit trends, provides a mechanism for mediating demands on resources in a manner that facilitates the prioritisation of investment in identified skills needs, and enhancing the responses by education and training providers to provision and delivery of those needs.</p>  <p>  The research of the EGFSN and the SLMRU also informs my Department&rsquo;s Economic Migration Policy Unit. This Unit has the responsibility for the employment permits system which is managed by the operation of the Highly Skilled Eligible Occupations List and the Ineligible Categories List. The employment permits regime is designed to facilitate the entry of appropriately skilled non-EEA migrants to fill skills shortages. The objective is balanced by the need to ensure that there are no suitably qualified Irish/EEA nationals available to undertake the work and the shortage is a genuine one. The rationale underpinning the inclusion or omission from the occupation lists is informed by EGFSN, the SLMRU and is augmented by a consultation process that includes calls for submissions. This process is regularly reviewed to ensure that it is operating efficiently. </p>  <p>  The analysis of the Expert Group on Future Skills has been reflected in the overarching strategies for the education and training system published in recent years. These include Ireland&rsquo;s National Skills Strategy 2025, and the Action Plan for Education 2016-2019, including its associated annual implementation plans, both of which have been developed by the Department of Education and Skills. </p>  <p>  This analysis has also informed the development of my own Department&rsquo;s framework policy for enterprise policy, Enterprise 2025- Ireland&rsquo;s National Enterprise Policy 2015-2025, its recent refresh, Enterprise 2025 Renewed, and the instrument for the annual implementation of the objectives set out in Enterprise 2025,   the Action Plan for Jobs, which seeks to create the optimum conditions for job creation within the economy, including through ready availability of relevant skills and talent.</p></reply>

These bodies are independent in the delivery of their quasi-judicial functions, in which I as Minister have no role.  This approach has served Ireland well over the years and in a large number of high profile disputes.  </p>  <p>  I understand that the case in question relates to a redundancy payment situation that was heard by the Labour Court on 23 March 2018 and that the Court recommended a payment in excess of the statutory redundancy payment amount.</p>  <p>  The Labour Court engages with parties in industrial relations disputes in which resolution of issues at local level has not proved possible. In such instances, the dispute can be referred to the Court for an opinion in the form of a recommendation of the Court.</p>  <p>  However, in line with the voluntary nature of industrial relations in Ireland, it is the case that recommendations of the Labour Court are not binding on the parties although of course it is expected that Labour Court recommendation are given serious consideration by the parties involved.</p></reply>

The Government&rsquo;s immediate concern is for those workers and their families that are directly affected by this announcement. Every relevant State support will, of course, be made available to these employees. </p>  <p>  The IDA will also be working with the company to complete a skills audit on the current employee base which will be shared with local enterprise in the region. The Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection is aware of the situation as well and we will be collectively, across Government, doing our utmost to help these workers transition and find new employment opportunities. </p>  <p>  While this news in respect of Fullwood Packo is deeply regrettable, it is important to emphasise that the overall trend in terms of job creation in Ireland is very positive. 2017, for example, was another record year for the State in terms of FDI-driven employment and investment, and strong employment growth is expected to continue in 2018. </p>  <p>  The Government is committed to supporting job creation in the regions and my Department and its agencies are working towards ambitious targets to ensure that employment and investment are distributed as evenly as possible across the country. The employment situation on the South West, which covers Cork and Kerry, has been steadily improving in recent years. IDA Ireland client companies in Cork alone now employ over 35,000, representing an increase of 48% since 2010.</p></reply>

Research commissioned by my Department estimates significant exposure to Brexit in our Agri Food, Pharmaceutical, Electrical Machinery, Wholesale and Retail and Air Transport Sectors.  </p>  <p>  There are, of course, other challenges too, such as the imposition by the US of tariffs on imports of steel and aluminium to the US, including from the EU.</p>  <p>  In the context of these challenges, I believe that we have the right policies to build resilience where possible and firmly strengthen our competitiveness and innovative capacity, thus ensuring the economy is properly positioned to meet any external challenges.  "Enterprise 2025 Renewed" and "Building Stronger Business; Responding to Brexit by Competing Innovating and Trading" are part of that policy mix. </p>  <p>  Last month the Government formally launched the &ldquo;Global Ireland &ndash; Ireland&rsquo;s Global Footprint to 2025&rdquo; initiative which will double the scope and impact of Ireland&rsquo;s global footprint in the period to 2025.  Global Ireland 2025 will support Ireland&rsquo;s efforts to grow and diversify export markets, inward investment and tourism. It will ensure that Ireland is better positioned to build the alliances necessary to advance its interests and defend its positions in a post-Brexit EU, while also helping to secure our deep and positive relationship with the UK and its constituent parts into the future. Global Footprint 2025 envisages further increases in our enterprise agency global footprint and Embassy network. </p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s Trade Strategy, &lsquo;Ireland Connected: Trading and Investing in a Dynamic World&rsquo;, supports an extensive programme of Ministerial-led trade missions, as part of a major drive towards market diversification.  This includes markets that are growing and have scale as well as markets where we are already well established but with potential for further growth.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s Enterprise 2025 Renewed strategy published in March 2018 sets out targets for export growth and diversification within the indigenous exporting base, with ambitions to increase exports as a percentage of total sales of Irish owned companies from 52 percent to between 55 and 60 percent by 2020 and increase Enterprise Ireland client exports beyond UK markets from &euro;14.1 billion to &euro;17.4 billion by 2020.  The strategy also targets a 50 percent increase in the number of FDI investments from non-US markets by 2020. </p>  <p>  In 2017, Enterprise Ireland launched its Eurozone Strategy as a key element of its supports to help companies diversify their export markets. In particular, it aims to increase exports to the Eurozone by &euro;2bn per annum by 2020, equivalent to 50 percent increase. This would represent one of the most significant shifts in Enterprise Ireland supported client exports into the Eurozone and is particularly important in the context of Brexit. </p>  <p>  As well as the global efforts supported by our Enterprise Agencies, key to our success has been our commitment to trade liberalisation in order to open new markets for our indigenous sectors.  The EU suite of Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with third countries help to open new markets, break down barriers and provide new opportunities for Irish based firms.  Brexit has reinforced the importance of accelerating the delivery of EU trade deals with leading economies and regional blocs.  We continue to support the EU&rsquo;s ambitious programme of negotiating new Free Trade Agreements giving Irish based firms expanded market access and a predictable trading environment in third countries, including SMEs.  To this end, my Department has commissioned a major examination of the economic opportunities and impacts for Ireland arising from EU Free Trade Agreements which will be available later this year.  The objective is to deepen our understanding of how Ireland can best take advantage of these opportunities, and ensure that our businesses are prepared to access new markets.</p></reply>

Improving competitiveness performance is a core focus for Government, and as part of this work my Department, its agencies and the National Competitiveness Council are continually engaged with relevant stakeholders on the particular policy needs required to strengthen our international competitiveness. </p>  <p>  In its 2017 Competitiveness Challenge Report, the Council has identified a range of threats to Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness, including the potential impact of Brexit, the concentration of our export markets and the range of products and services exported.</p>  <p>  At firm level, Enterprise Ireland (EI) actively supports firms to develop new products and services for new and existing markets. EI&rsquo;s Strategy 2017-20 &ldquo;Build Scale-Expand Reach&rdquo; looks to increase the reach of its client company exports, with two-thirds of exports going beyond the UK.  To broaden the export footprint across the globe, the EI Strategy focuses on training and supports to enhance management capability, leadership and productivity, marketing/sales skills, innovation and R&amp;D, access to funding to help companies to build market share and create new market opportunities.</p>  <p>  Sustaining and growing jobs and diversifying the export base is a challenge when aligned with the key objective of reducing the overall dependence on the UK market as a percentage of overall exports. Therefore, my Department has allocated additional funding in both 2017 and 2018 to enable EI achieve its objectives.</p>  <p>  Extra staff has been placed in EI&rsquo;s overseas offices with sectorial knowledge and expertise such as in engineering, food, life sciences and construction. This will drive export growth to international markets where there are known opportunities and reduce reliance on the UK. </p>  <p>  There is now a major focus on directing resources and expertise to the Eurozone markets where EI sees opportunities, targeting a 50% increase in exports by 2020. A new &lsquo;Irish Advantage&rsquo; communications campaign is targeting Eurozone buyers to buy Irish innovation in key Brexit impacted sectors.</p>  <p>  There are also significant opportunities in various other international markets for quality Irish goods and services. The future relative importance and forecasted growth rates of China, India, the South-East Asian countries, the Gulf States, Latin America and Africa combined with the scale of these markets means we will support Irish companies to continue to work to build exports in these markets. In January of this year, EI launched its new Market Discovery Fund to help more Irish companies accelerate their market diversification efforts. </p>  <p>  EI is undertaking 200 international and domestic trade events in 2018 to accelerate the number of EI clients diversifying into new markets, beyond the UK and into the Eurozone and global markets. The number of trade events being undertaken represents a 50% increase on 2017, reflecting the serious challenge that Brexit poses for Irish businesses.</p>  <p>  A more diverse export base can reduce exposure to external demand shocks, exchange rate fluctuations and instability in export earnings and enhance growth and jobs.  I will continue to work with my Department and EI to ensure Irish-based exporters, particularly in exposed sectors such as traditional manufacturing and agrifood, will continue to be supported to scale and diversify sustainably and strategically. </p>  <p>  Innovation remains at the forefront of any business to ensure that they grow and expand to ensure they are at a level to compete on the EU and global markets effectively.  Innovation involves helping companies improve competitiveness by developing new processes, products or services or by modernising and adapting current processes, products or services to bring them to a standard that will allow the company to enter new and existing markets internationally.  Innovation is an essential component in a company&rsquo;s ability to maintain a competitive edge in overseas markets.  EI has a suite of supports available to assist client companies innovate and develop their enterprise.  These supports help new and existing companies to develop new and improved products and services which serve as the basis for sustainable export growth.</p></reply>

Supporting research and innovation will therefore continue to remain an integral part of Ireland&rsquo;s campaign to maximise impact in EU and global markets. Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s support for research, development and innovation involves helping companies improve their competitiveness through the development of new processes, products or services or by modernising and adapting current processes, products or services to bring them to a standard that will allow the company to enter new and existing markets internationally.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland's core objective is to help companies start, grow, innovate and win export sales in global markets and there are financial and non-financial supports available at every stage of that journey to the point where companies are in a position to export to new markets. Enterprise Ireland supported clients have grown and achieved total exports of over &euro;21bn per annum and achieved the benefits of same such as increased profits and company growth. Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s strategic aim is to increase this figure to &euro;26bn per annum by 2020. </p>  <p>  In terms of innovation, more specifically, Enterprise Ireland supports and de-risks RDI by supporting companies to do RDI in-house, by supporting collaboration with Higher Education Institutions (HEIs); or by sourcing/licensing new technologies from HEIs which can provide a step change in their innovative capabilities.  At the same time Enterprise Ireland has supports in place to help companies maximise the funding they can receive from the European Union through programmes such as Horizon 2020.  These supports all help new and existing companies to develop new and improved products and services which serve as the basis for sustainable economic growth.</p>  <p>  Brexit is forcing Irish companies employ RDI in a bid to protect their current exports in the UK and to explore different markets and innovation will continue to play a central role in this regard.  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s annual business results survey shows that companies that invest in innovation are higher performing in terms of employment, export sales and are more sustainable through recessionary and other economic shocks such as Brexit.  It is essential that Irish companies produce products and services that are more novel than their competitors, better performing, more efficiently delivered, and cost effective for their customers.   </p>  <p>  There are a wide range of Enterprise Ireland RD&amp;I Programmes available to companies and they all contribute hugely to company development, growth and expansion, some of which are outlined below: </p>  <p>  In Company RD&amp;I</p>  <p>  In Company RD&amp;I supports the development of new or substantially improved products, services or processes which will have a competitive advantage in their target market. The Agile Innovation Fund launched in Quarter 4 2017 now facilitates fast track approval of such awards. </p>  <p>  Commercialisation Fund </p>  <p>  The Commercialisation Fund is aimed at improving the competitiveness of Irish industry through both the creation of technology-based companies and through the development of licenses.  It is available for projects that address a gap or need in the market by developing innovations that will ideally be ready for licensing to Irish industry or may form the basis of a new start-within 5 years.</p>  <p>  Innovation Vouchers </p>  <p>  The Innovation Voucher initiative provides vouchers worth &euro;5,000 to small businesses to introduce them to research, development and innovation, linking them with a network of knowledge providers, North and South of the border.  </p>  <p>  Innovation Partnerships </p>  <p>  The Innovation Partnership programme helps industry to engage in collaborative research projects with Irish universities and Institutes of Technology to develop new products and services.</p>  <p>  Technology Gateways </p>  <p>  The Technology Gateway Programme provides Business Development resources to the Institutes of Technology to help them interact with industry on a local, regional and national basis.</p>  <p>  Technology Centres</p>  <p>  Technology Centres are organised to respond rapidly to industry defined needs and conduct market-relevant R&amp;D in partnership with collaborating groups of companies.</p>  <p>  Campus Incubators </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland funding has supported the development of a national network of business innovation centres and specialist bio-incubation facilities. Incubators now exist on every university and Institute of Technology Campus in the country. Such facilities are internationally recognised as an important element of public assistance for technology intensive start-ups. They are also an important driver of regional development with the majority of companies remaining in their region after they have completed their incubation period.  </p>  <p>  EU Funding</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland continues to lead the Horizon 2020 National Support Network in order to secure as much Irish engagement with this funding programme as possible.  This assistance available from the European Union for new enterprises, is the instrument which supports collaborative R&amp;D in Europe and provides an important source of non-exchequer funding for companies. Irish companies that compete successfully for funding from Horizon 2020 will boost their innovative capability and competitiveness which in turn will deliver strong national economic impacts, including job creation, exports and sales.</p>  <p>The Horizon 2020 SME Instrument   is available and is specifically for single or groups of highly innovative SMEs with international ambitions, determined to turn strong, innovative business ideas into winners on the market.  The instrument provides full-cycle business innovation support from the stage of business idea conception and planning over business plan execution and demonstration to commercialisation. </p>  <p>The research and innovation supports provided by Enterprise Ireland and other agencies of my Department will be complemented by the Government&rsquo;s new &euro;500 million Disruptive Technologies Innovation Fund  .  This new Fund is specifically targeted at game-changing innovations that will have a significant impact on the ability of companies in Ireland to compete in global markets. Expressions of Interest are now invited from consortia wishing to apply for funding under this new Fund. The type of projects that will receive funding will be:</p>  <p>  - Collaborative enterprise-driven partnerships that will develop, deploy and commercialise disruptive technologies to transform business;</p>  <p>  - Impactful projects focused on &ldquo;industrial research&rdquo; and seeking at least &euro;1 million in funding over 3 years and involving enterprises and research partners;</p>  <p>  - Projects with at least one SME partner &ndash; this is an essential requirement in every consortium.</p></reply>

Research undertaken by EI in 2012 found that there were a number of key inhibitors to female entrepreneurship rates and developed an integrated strategy to address these issues and increase the number of female-founded start-ups in Ireland.</p>  <p>  One of the key ways in which EI supports female entrepreneurship is through its dedicated Competitive Start Funds.  The first Competitive Start Fund for Female Entrepreneurs was launched in 2012.  Since then there have been 8 dedicated female competitive start funds.</p>  <p>  The purpose of these targeted Funds is to accelerate the growth of female founded start-up companies that have the potential to employ more than 10 people and achieve &euro;1 million in export sales within three years.  This is achieved by putting a &euro;50,000 equity investment in the company.  The Funds are designed to enable companies to reach key commercial and technical milestones, which will ensure the delivery of their product or service to an international audience. </p>  <p>  The most recent Competitive Start Fund for female entrepreneurs, which I launched earlier this year, made a total of &euro;1m funding available for up to 20 female-led companies.  EI received over 100 funding applications for this Fund and the final selection for funding is currently taking place.</p>  <p>  In 2017, 46 per cent of all companies who received CSF investment from Enterprise Ireland were female founded.</p>  <p>  Another key Enterprise Ireland initiative is the Going for Growth programme.  Currently in its 10th cycle, the initiative supports female entrepreneurs who have been trading for at least two years and are strongly focussed on growth.  For zero fee, participants are offered a unique learning environment with a peer-led approach based on the shared experiences of both the Lead Entrepreneur and the other participants facing similar challenges.  Feedback shows that participants&rsquo; businesses experienced a growth in sales over the 9th cycle of over &euro;20million and employment rose by 17.5%.</p>  <p>  Every year EI holds a Fuelling Ambition Roadshow, which aims to encourage, support and drive the ambition of female entrepreneurs (existing and new) nationally by showcasing thriving Irish female entrepreneurs.  A total of 7 roadshow events were held in 2018, attended by c600 female entrepreneurs, across the country during March, April and May in Waterford, Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Killarney, Monaghan and Roscommon.  </p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) are also actively engaged in encouraging and inspiring an increase in female-led businesses through initiatives such as the annual National Women&rsquo;s Enterprise Day and the Women in Business Networks.  Last year we saw the National Women&rsquo;s Enterprise Day rolled out on a regional basis.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s Best Young Entrepreneur (IBYE) Programme, run by the LEOS, has also been strongly supportive of female entrepreneurs.  Since it began in 2014 over 1430 applicants (over 37% of total applicants) have been female.</p>  <p>  We are making progress.  The number of female founded start-ups supported by EI has increased from 12 in 2011 to 67 in 2017.  This includes a significant increase in the proportion of female founded High Potential Start-ups supported by EI which accounted for 28% of EI HPSUs in 2017 compared to 7% in 2011.  In addition, 61% of participants attending LEO training programmes in 2017 were female while 46% of the LEO mentoring participants were female. </p>  <p>  I feel confident that with continued support we will continue to see increases in female led businesses in Ireland.</p></reply>

This is the EU programme which supports research and innovation throughout the 28 EU Member States.  Funding is secured for the final work programme for Horizon 2020 which will run until the end of 2020.  Brexit is therefore not expected to have a significant impact upon the activity or the funding for Horizon 2020.</p>  <p>  In terms of European research and innovation activities, the UK is one of a number of important collaborators for Ireland under Horizon 2020.  In addition to the UK, Ireland has a diversified range of collaborative links with Member States, particularly Germany, Spain and France.  An analysis of Ireland's collaborations under Horizon 2020 indicates that collaborations occur in multi partner projects and that Ireland is not overly dependent on the UK for scientific collaboration in successful EU programmes. </p>  <p>  The European Commission has recently published its proposals for the next Framework Programme, named Horizon Europe.  The new proposal contains an increase in overall funding for the support of research and innovation in the remaining 27 member states, and is currently under discussion between the Commission and the Member States.  </p>  <p>  The UK has indicated that it would like the option to fully associate with the EU's research and innovation programmes.</p></reply>

Nevertheless, multinational companies continue to invest and re-invest here with leading global firms from many sectors - including life sciences, ICT, engineering and digital media - all based in Ireland.  The contribution that these investments make to our wider economy is undoubtedly significant and the Government is working hard to ensure that the country remains a destination of choice for overseas firms. </p>  <p>  Ireland's strengths when it comes to attracting FDI are well-documented.  These include our competitiveness, talented and productive workforce, favourable demographics and membership of the European Union.  Our pro-enterprise business environment, and track record as a home to FDI, are also key factors.  Reinforcing and sustaining these strengths is important to ensuring Ireland's continuing FDI competitiveness. </p>  <p>  The IDA's 2017 Annual Results provides evidence of our continuing capacity to attract FDI to Ireland.  Total employment by overseas companies in Ireland has now surpassed 210,000 people - a record level - with the numbers of investments also increasing.  We are also attracting more investment to the regions.</p></reply>

The KDB provides an effective 6.25% rate of corporation tax which is internationally competitive.  The KDB complements the existing suite of initiatives available to companies that undertake R&amp;D activities in Ireland across the life cycle of research and development &ndash; providing a competitive proposition for continued business investment. </p>  <p>  The continuing imperative to establish Ireland as the best place in which to succeed in business is reinforced in our national Enterprise and Innovation strategies - strategies based on export-led growth, underpinned by innovation and talent - strategies that aim to embed resilience, to deliver sustainable employment opportunities and a higher standard of living for all. </p>  <p>  As a key part of Ireland's competitive offering as a location of choice from which to do business, the KDB has helped secure investment since its introduction in 2016.  It will continue to form part of Ireland's proposition and stimulate further investment in R&amp;D activities by both Irish and foreign owned enterprises - ultimately delivering jobs and economic substance in Ireland.</p></reply>

The annual cost of the Mobility Allowance scheme at the time that it closed was &euro;9.3 million.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Motorised Transport Grant, this scheme operated as a means-tested grant to assist person with severe disabilities with the purchase or adaptation of a car, where that car was essential to retain employment.  The maximum Motorised Transport Grant, which was payable once in any three year period, was &euro;5,020.  Following the closure of the scheme in February 2013, no further Motorised Transport Grants have been payable.  The annual cost of the Motorised Transport Grant scheme at the time that it closed was &euro;1.3 million.</p>  <p>  The Government decided that the detailed preparatory work required for a new Transport Support Scheme and associated statutory provisions should be progressed by the Minister for Health.  The Programme for a Partnership Government acknowledges the ongoing drafting of primary legislation for a new Transport Support Scheme, to assist those with a disability to meet their mobility costs.  The Health (Transport Support) Bill is on the list of priority legislation for publication in the Spring/Summer session 2018.  </p>  <p>  My colleague, the Minister for Health and I recently brought a Memorandum to Government for proposals for a new Transport Support Payment Scheme.  Following consideration of the matter, it was decided to withdraw the Memorandum from the Cabinet agenda on 8 May last.  I intend to revert to Government with revised proposals to reflect the discussion at Cabinet, in due course.</p>  <p>  While I cannot comment on the specific proposals under consideration, I can confirm that the proposals seek to ensure that:</p>  <p>  - There is a firm statutory basis to the Scheme's operation;</p>  <p>  - There is transparency and equity in the eligibility criteria attaching to the Scheme;</p>  <p>  - Resources are targeted at those with the greatest needs; and</p>  <p>  - The Scheme is capable of being costed and is affordable on its introduction and on an ongoing basis.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers scheme, operated by the Revenue Commissioners, remains in place.  This scheme provides VRT and VAT relief, an exemption from road tax and a fuel grant to drivers and passengers with a disability, who qualify under the relevant criteria set out in governing regulations made by the Minister for Finance.  Specifically adapted vehicles driven by persons with a disability are also exempt from payment of tolls on national roads and toll bridges.

There is no provision under the GMS GP contract for persons who hold a medical card or GP visit card to be charged for routine phlebotomy services provided by their GP which are required to either assist in the diagnosis of illness or the treatment of a condition.</p>  <p>  The HSE has advised GPs that where a blood test forms part of the investigation or necessary treatment of a patient&rsquo;s symptoms or conditions, this should be free of charge for patients who hold a medical card or GP visit card.  Notwithstanding this, I am aware that some GPs have begun to charge GMS patients for phlebotomy services in some circumstances.  </p>  <p>  This is a matter of concern for me as it has long been the position, under successive Governments, that no user charges should apply to GP services provided to GMS and GP visit card patients.  If a patient who holds a medical card or GP visit card believes he or she has been incorrectly charged for routine phlebotomy services by his or her GP, then that patient may take the matter up with their HSE Local Health Office, who will investigate the complaint.</p>  <p>  If the local office determines that the charge was inappropriate, it will inform the HSE Primary Care Reimbursement Service who will arrange to refund the cost of the blood test to the patient and recoup this amount from the GP.  The local office will inform the GP of the decision to deduct the payment.</p></reply>

In addition to population needs, international trends and the findings of a public consultation process, the development of the Strategy was informed by previous reports and experiences of our maternity services, both positive and negative. Indeed, the development of the Strategy delivered on a recommendation from the report, Investigation into the safety, quality and standards of services provided by the Health Service Executive to patients, including pregnant women, at risk of clinical deterioration, including those provided in University Hospital Galway, and as reflected in the care and treatment provided to Savita Halappanavar.  Consequently, many recommendations made in past reports are addressed in the Strategy.</p>  <p>  The Strategy aims to ensure that appropriate care pathways - Supported, Assisted and Specialised - are in place in order that mothers, babies and families get the right care, at the right time, by the right team and in the right place.  It recognises that, while all pregnant women need a certain level of support, some will require more specialised care.  Accordingly, it proposes an integrated model that delivers care at the lowest level of complexity and encompasses all the necessary safety nets in line with patient safety principles.  </p>  <p>  The phased implementation of the Strategy is being led by the National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme, which has been established in the HSE to lead the management, organisation and delivery of maternity, gynaecology and neonatal services across primary, community and acute care.  One of the Programme's objectives is to ensure, where relevant, that learning from individual sites is disseminated to all maternity hospitals/units nationwide.</p>  <p>  Additional development funding of &euro;4.15 million is being allocated to maternity services this year.  The Programme has prioritised improving quality and safety, establishing community midwifery teams and increasing access to anomaly scans.  Such initiatives represent essential building blocks to provide a consistently safe and high quality maternity service and will continue to deliver tangible benefits for the 80,000 families who access maternity care each year.</p></reply>

Majority of those with the disease are seen in the two centres of expertise - Our Lady's Children Hospital in Crumlin and St. James's Hospital. To ensure an early diagnosis and prevent early deaths, the team at Crumlin, over many years, organised a neo-natal screening in the majority of maternity hospitals.</p>  <p>  Sickle cell disease, among many other rare diseases, is addressed as part of the generic policy framework in the National Rare disease plan which was published in 2014.  The scope of the plan is broad given that there are 8,000 rare diseases approximately affecting millions of EU citizens; and consequently, there can be a dearth of expertise and knowledge about some rare diseases, simply because they are so rare.</p>  <p>  One of the achievements of the Rare Disease Plan was to encourage designated centres of expertise to participate in European Reference Networks (ERNs) for Rare Diseases. ERNs are European networks connecting health care providers and centres of expertise so that international expertise on specific rare diseases may be pooled together for the benefit of patients. Any centre applying for membership of an ERN must have strategies in place to ensure that care is patient-centred; that patient' rights and preferences are respected; and must show a research component to their work.</p>  <p>  The recommendations in the national plan related to empowering and protecting patients and carers, and research on rare diseases will be fulfilled in part through this process. It is expected that ERNs will have a major structuring effect by linking thematic expert centres across the EU. </p>  <p>  With the encouragement of the National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases and the Department of Health, five centres of expertise were designated in June 2016 during the first round of calls from the European Commission for participation in European Reference Networks. Three of these designated centres applied for membership of ERNs and two were approved.</p>  <p>  The issue of rare diseases and of the creation of an all-island patient register has been raised in the context of on-going discussions at North-South meetings. It is also anticipated that the Model of Care for Rare Diseases will set out recommendations for rare disease registries. This model of care is in development by the National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases. At the EU level, the Joint Research Centre is developing a joint European Platform on Rare Disease Registration which will promote EU level standards for data collection and contribute to the development of rare disease registries across the EU. </p>  <p>  As Minister I consider meeting any organisation that requests to do so.  However due to busy parliamentary and other business it is not always possible to meet all representative groups that contact my office.  </p>  <p>  In respect of the other issues raised, I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Task Force consisted of a Strategy Group and an Advisory &amp;amp; Consultative Group.  It included officials from the relevant Government Departments and agencies, HSE, academic and policy experts, stakeholder organisations and a wide range of people with lived experience of disability and disability services (both intellectual and physical).  </p>  <p>  Its remit was to consider people whose primary disability was physical or sensory, intellectual, autism, neurological or any combination of these and to make recommendations on personalised budgets models which will give people with disabilities more control in accessing health funded personal social services, giving them greater independence and choice in accessing services which best meet their individual needs. The Report, which I intend to publish in the near future, will outline the next steps for the development of personalised budgets in Ireland.</p></reply>

The HSE has prioritised the transition of 170 people from congregated settings in 2018 under its Service Plan.  The HSE has established a subgroup, under the Value for Money Steering Group, which is developing an implementation plan for moving people from institutions that will be rolled out at a regional and local level, in full consultation with residents and their families. </p>  <p>  To ensure that the needs of people transitioning from congregated settings are fully taken into account during the process, the model of care for individuals will be based on a person-centred plan (PCP).

The Task Force consisted of a Strategy Group and an Advisory &amp;amp; Consultative Group.  It included officials from the relevant Government Departments and agencies, HSE, academic and policy experts, stakeholder organisations and a wide range of people with lived experience of disability and disability services (both intellectual and physical).  </p>  <p>  Its remit was to consider people whose primary disability was physical or sensory, intellectual, autism, neurological or any combination of these and to make recommendations on personalised budgets models which will give people with disabilities more control in accessing health funded personal social services, giving them greater independence and choice in accessing services which best meet their individual needs. I have considered the findings of the Task Force Report and intend to publish it in the near future.</p></reply>

The cost of all inpatient and daycase activity is calculated as part of the Activity Based Funding (ABF) system for acute hospitals. However, the resulting ABF price only applies to public patients because certain costs which would be relevant to private patients are funded through the block grant to these hospitals. A new methodology and detailed costing study would therefore be required in order to accurately calculate the full economic cost of private activity. This matter will be considered as part of the further roll-out of the ABF funding model. </p></reply>

For example, the reference basket of countries, used to set drug prices in Ireland, has been expanded from 9 to 14 countries, including lower cost countries. Also, the Agreement now provides for an annual price realignment, so that Irish medicine prices can be reduced in line with price reductions across the reference countries.  This will ensure the State achieves better value for money on medicines as prices in other basket countries are adjusted downwards over time. In addition, the Agreement provides for a 30% reduction in the price of biologic medicines when a biosimilar medicine enters the market.</p><p>A key focus of this agreement is to achieve lower prices in the face of both demographic pressures on expenditure and the continued development of new medicines, many of which pose affordability challenges to the Irish health service and internationally.</p><p>The estimated saving for 2018 from the Agreement is &euro;185 m.</p></reply>

It will therefore be an important step in ensuring that the system operates in a consistent and fair manner and will help to improve access to home-care services on an affordable and sustainable basis. The introduction of a system of regulation for home-care will help to ensure public confidence in the services provided. The new scheme will also be designed to support family/unpaid carers and will complement and integrate effectively with other health and social-care services such as long-term residential care (including the Nursing Homes Support Scheme), primary and community services and hospital services. </p>  <p>  As an initial step in the development of the new scheme, the Department of Health commissioned the Health Research Board to undertake a review of the home-care systems in place in four European countries. The review, which was published last April, will help to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s new home-care scheme and system of regulation is informed by international experience. In addition a public consultation on the financing and regulation of home-care was undertaken last year. The purpose of this consultation, to which approximately 2,600 submissions were received, was to enable the Department to find out about the views of service-users, their families and healthcare workers on current and future home-care provision. A report on the findings of the consultation was published on 26   June and will inform the development of the new scheme. Further consultation with service-users will take place later this year, in addition to which the Department is actively engaging with the key NGOs and representative groups. </p>  <p>  The development of a statutory scheme and system of regulation for home-care services is a complex undertaking. While the publication of the HRB review and of the report on the findings of the public consultation represent important milestones in the process of developing the new scheme, a significant amount of additional work remains to be carried out before final decisions are taken on the form of the home-care scheme and system of regulation. This is required if the reforms are to be successful, affordable and sustainable. The Department will continue to prioritise its work in developing the new scheme and every effort will be made to progress this matter as quickly as possible. However a realistic timeframe for the establishment of the new scheme on a statutory basis is 2&ndash;3 years.</p>  <p>  While the new home-care scheme is under development, the Department of Health and Health Service Executive are continuing efforts to improve existing home-care services. In 2018 the HSE brought the funding for home help and Home Care Packages together into a single home support service for older people. As well as simplifying the application-process for home-care, the new service will be more responsive to service-users' changing needs. More broadly the HSE will continue to encourage local integration of services and to build appropriate care-pathways, in particular for people with complex needs. A consumer-directed approach to home-support provision will be introduced, giving service-users greater choice in relation to when they receive services and their selection of a service-provider. This enhancement of current service-provision is being supported by increased investment in home-care services. In line with the commitment in A Programme for a Partnership Government (2016) to increase funding for home-care annually, funding for Older Persons&rsquo; Services rose from &euro;763m in 2017 to &euro;811m in 2018, including approximately &euro;417m for the provision of home-support services. </p></reply>

In addition, Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 precludes me from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual. It would be inappropriate to comment on the cases of individual patients.</p><p>In Ireland the majority of patients&rsquo; access medicines through the publicly funded Community Drug Schemes.</p><p>In line with the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, if a company would like a medicine to be reimbursed by the HSE and available through the community drugs schemes, the company must first submit an application to the HSE to have the new medicine added to the reimbursement list.</p><p>The HSE strives to reach a decision in as timely a manner as possible. However, because of the significant monies involved, it must ensure that the best price is achieved, as these commitments are often multi-million euro investments on an on-going basis. This can lead to a protracted deliberation process.</p><p>Pembrolizumab is currently reimbursed for the following indications:</p><p>- Pembrolizumab (Keytruda) as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma in adults.</p><p>- Pembrolizumab (Keytruda) as monotherapy is indicated for the first-line treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) in adults whose tumours express PD-L1 with a ≥ 50% tumour proportion score (TPS) with no EGFR or ALK positive tumour mutations.</p><p>I have been informed by the HSE that they are currently deliberating on the following indications for reimbursement:</p><p>- Pembrolizumab (Keytruda) as a monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma who have failed autologous stem cell transplant and brentuximab vedotin (BV), or who are transplant-ineligible and have failed BV.</p><p>- Pembrolizumab (Keytruda) as a monotherapy for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC in adults whose tumours express PD-L1 with a ≥ 1% TPS and who have received at least one prior chemotherapy regimen. Patients with EGFR or ALK positive tumour mutations should also have received targeted therapy before receiving Keytruda.</p><p>The National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE) completed a health technology assessment on 28 May 2018 for the latter indication. They recommended that pembrolizumab (Keytruda) be considered for reimbursement if cost-effectiveness can be improved relative to existing treatments.  The HSE will now evaluate this application for reimbursement in line with criteria laid out within the 2013 Act before making a final reimbursement decision.</p><p>In addition to this, the HSE have commissioned HTAs on the following indications:</p><p>- Pembrolizumab (Keytruda) for the first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who are not eligible for cisplatin-containing chemotherapy.</p><p>- Pembrolizumab (Keytruda) as monotherapy for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma in adults who have received prior platinum-containing chemotherapy.</p><p>There are no other indications for Pembrolizumab approved in the European Union at this time. Clinical trials are ongoing globally in relation to a range of other possible indications which may receive marketing authorisation in the EU over the next number of years. Each of those indications will be considered for reimbursement as market authorisations are received.</p><p>Nivolumab is currently reimbursed for the following indications:</p><p>- Nivolumab (Opdivo) for monotherapy treatment for patients diagnosed with unresectable metastatic melanoma.</p><p>- Nivolumab (Opdivo) for the treatment of relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma after autologous stem cell transplant and treatment with brentuximab vedotin.</p><p>- Nivolumab (Opdivo) for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma after prior therapy in adults.</p><p>- Nivolumab (Opdivo) for the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) in adults progressing on or after platinum-based therapy.</p><p>- Nivolumab (Opdivo) plus ipilimumab (Yervoy) for the treatment of advanced melanoma.</p><p>The Department has been informed by the HSE that the following indications are currently in process for reimbursement:</p><p>- 2nd line use in locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in adult</p><p>- 2nd line use in locally advanced unresectable or metastatic urothelial carcinoma</p><p>- Adjuvant melanoma indication</p><p>These applications for reimbursement will be processed in line with the 2013 Act.</p><p>In relation to the issue of VAT exemption for self-funding patients, as you will appreciate that is a matter for my colleague Mr Paschal Donohoe TD, Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform for his attention.</p></reply>

This work will include identifying the appropriate specialist clinical expertise and facilities required at hospital group level and nationally to provide comprehensive aftercare services, including the role of specialist diagnostic services such as translabial scanning. Pending the completion of this work, there may be a need to look at sourcing services from abroad to address any immediate shortfalls identified, either through utilisation of the treatment abroad scheme or by commissioning services from abroad.</p><p>  A Learning Notice concerning mesh devices in uro-gynaecological procedures was circulated by the NWIHP on 26th June 2018 to all maternity hospitals and acute hospitals with gynaecological services to highlight the importance of appropriate patient selection, adequate information and consent and also to inform the service providers that a Response Group has been convened to propose remedies for and address the provision of aftercare for complications. This learning notice has been posted on the NWIHP website which can be found at this https://www.hse.ie/eng/about/who/acute-hospitals-division/woman-infants/quality-and-safety/learning-notice-0518-transvaginal-mesh.pdf.</p></reply>

The specific purpose of this Amendment Bill is to correct a typographical and technical error in the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015, which will facilitate the subsequent commencement of Parts 2 and 3 of that Act and makes no change to the policy intention of the Act of 2015.</p>  <p>  The Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 was enacted to modernise family law in a way that is inclusive of and sensitive to the reality of contemporary family life in Ireland and to meet the needs of children living in diverse family types.  Parts 2 and 3 of the Act, for which I am responsible, are key elements of the Act and are concerned with the rights of children conceived through the use of donor embryos or gametes. </p>  <p>  The Children and Family Relationships Act specifically relates to procedures where the intending mother is also the birth mother.  As such this Act does not encompass surrogacy. </p>  <p>  Provisions relating to the regulation of surrogacy are included in Part 6 of the General Scheme of the Assisted Human Reproduction Bill 2017.

I have received advice from the HSE and there is some further work required on the detail.  I have asked my Department to proceed without delay to engage with the HSE on the next steps in providing a modular lab.  This will include consideration of the specific details he requests regarding tendering, project design, planning processes, construction and commissioning work.</p>  <p>  The timeframe for the development of modular builds as outlined by the HSE must include tendering, project design work, planning, construction and commissioning so it will take until next year to deliver the modular cath lab.  I have committed that this will be funded in the 2019 Estimate.</p></reply>

This draft legislation sets out procedural safeguards to ensure that people in residential settings who lack capacity are not unlawfully deprived of their liberty.  The approach taken in the draft legislation makes use of the decision-making procedures, supports and safeguards that already exist under the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 and also includes some additional safeguards specific to deprivation of liberty.  The proposals build on the machinery of the Decision Support Service, which is provided for under this Act.  The 51 submissions that were received are currently being analysed.</p>  <p>  An Advisory Group comprised of key stakeholders has been formed to consider the findings of the public consultation, advise on appropriate amendments to the draft Heads of Bill and ensure that the approach taken integrates effectively with existing legislation.</p>  <p>  Every effort is being made to progress the legislation as quickly as possible and the implications of the recent Court of Appeal judgment will be considered as part of this process.

The programme includes a number of facilities in Donegal. Significant work was undertaken to determine the most optimum scheduling of projects within the phased provision of funding to achieve compliance and registration with the Health Information and Quality Authority.  Furthermore, the National Development Plan, published earlier this year as part of the Ireland 2040 policy initiative, acknowledges the need for additional capacity requirements and it is expected that 4,500 additional short-term and long-term beds will be required across the public system in Community Nursing Units and other step-down facilities, as identified by the Health Capacity Review.</p>  <p>  Under the NDP, health capital projects and programmes currently underway will continue -  including the Capital Investment Programme for Community Nursing Units.  These major priority projects and programmes will require the bulk of the notified capital allocation over the initial period of the Plan, 2018-2022.  It is important to recognise that the NDP is a long-term plan, which will roll out over ten years and includes provision for a large number of developments across the country.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Mental Health and Older People Jim Daly TD is aware of local concerns that have been raised relating to the future of long-stay residential care provision in the East Donegal area.  There is a process in place for the agreement and prioritisation of capital projects.  Since his visit to Donegal earlier this year officials from the Department have engaged with the HSE to ensure that investment in facilities in the area will meet the needs of the community.  The Minister is pleased to note that additional dementia beds are now available  within St Joseph's Hospital.</p></reply>

As Minister for Health, I do not have any statutory power or function in relation to the reimbursement of medicines.  The Act specifies the criteria for decisions on the reimbursement of medicines.  </p>  <p>  In line with the 2013 Act, if a company would like a medicine to be reimbursed by the HSE pursuant to the Community Drugs scheme, the company must first submit an application to the HSE to have the new medicine added to the Reimbursement List.  </p>  <p>  As outlined in the IPHA agreement, and in line with the 2013 Act, the HSE will decide, within 180 days of receiving the application (or a longer period if further information is sought from the company), to either add the medicine to the reimbursement list or agree to reimburse it as a hospital medicine, or refuse to reimburse the medicine.  </p>  <p>  HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE).  </p>  <p>  The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) for the HSE and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions.  The NCPE uses a decision framework to systematically assess whether a drug is cost-effective as a health intervention.  </p>  <p>  The HSE strives to reach a decision in as timely a manner as possible.  However, because of the significant monies involved, it must ensure that the best price is achieved, as these commitments are often multi-million euro investments on an on-going basis.  This can lead to a protracted deliberation process.  </p>  <p>  I have been informed that Ocrelizumab for the treatment of adult patients with early primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) and for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS) is currently undergoing a full pharmacoeconomic assessment by the NCPE.</p></reply>

This provides clear guidelines and procedures for staff to follow both in cases of suspected abuse and of neglect of vulnerable adults (including older people).  This safeguarding policy was the first such HSE policy to encompass both elder abuse and neglect as well as concerns of abuse and neglect relating to people availing of disability services.  </p>  <p>  The HSE has established a number of structures to implement its national safeguarding policy.  This includes a National Safeguarding Office, an advisory National Safeguarding Committee, Specialist Safeguarding and Protection Teams in each of the 9 CHO Areas, more than 1,500 designated safeguarding officers, and over 41,000 attendances at safeguarding policy and procedures training.  </p>  <p>  In December 2017 the Government approved the development of a national adult safeguarding policy for the health sector.  The policy will apply across the wide spectrum of the health sector, i.e. in the public, private and voluntary sectors, and will be supported by any necessary legislation.  </p>  <p>  A detailed review of the operation of the HSE&rsquo;s operational safeguarding policy is at an advanced stage and is expected to be completed soon.  The findings of the HSE&rsquo;s safeguarding review will assist the Department of Health&rsquo;s development of appropriate policy approaches for the wider health sector.  </p>  <p>  HIQA and the Mental Health Commission are currently in the process of jointly developing National Standards for Adult Safeguarding, with advisory input from the Department of Health among others.  </p>  <p>  Together these initiatives should greatly improve the safeguarding of adults at risk of abuse and neglect in the health sector.</p></reply>

Following detailed financial analysis the Minister decided to extend this Scheme to all persons in receipt of Carer's Benefit.  The legislation to provide this service, the Health (General Practitioner Service) Bill 2018 has been passed by the Seanad on 05 June 2018. </p>  <p>  The provision of medical cards to this particular cohort is not intended under this Bill.</p>  <p>  A detailed costing of the actual additional cost of providing a medical card to persons in receipt of either Carer's Allowance or Carer's Benefit, whom do not already hold a medical card, is not available as it would require an examination of the HSE and Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection datasets.</p>  <p>  However, the estimated total cost of providing a medical card to all recipients of Carer's Benefit and Carer's Allowance could be in the region of &euro;80 million.  This figure is based on the figures current in December 2017 for the number of recipients of Carer's Benefit and Carer's Allowance and the 2018 average cost of a medical card.  It should be noted that a significant majority of persons in receipt of Carer's Allowance will already hold a Medical Card.</p></reply>

Any individuals employed by these organisations are not HSE employees.  Consequently, it is a matter for the care companies concerned to ensure that the care workers possess the necessary qualifications, skills and attributes required to fully and effectively carry out the functions of the role.</p></reply>

This is known as the three year cap.  This cap does not apply to productive assets such as farms and businesses, except in cases of sudden illness or disability where specific conditions are met.</p>  <p>  It is proposed to amend the scheme to treat farm and business assets in the same manner as the principal private residence where a family successor commits to working the farm or business, i.e. to cap contributions at three years.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health has been examining the potential for changes to the treatment of business and farm assets under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme.</p>  <p>  A Memorandum for Government setting out the details of the proposed policy change and seeking Government approval to draft the General Scheme of a bill to amend the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009 was circulated to other Government Departments for observations in the last few weeks and is expected to be submitted to Government shortly.</p></reply>

As Minister for Health, I do not have any statutory power or function in relation to the reimbursement of medicines.  The Act specifies the criteria for decisions on the reimbursement of medicines.</p>  <p>  In line with the 2013 Act, if a company would like a medicine to be reimbursed by the HSE pursuant to the Community Drugs scheme, the company must first submit an application to the HSE to have the new medicine added to the Reimbursement List.</p>  <p>  As outlined in the IPHA agreement, and in line with the 2013 Act, the HSE will decide, within 180 days of receiving the application (or a longer period if further information is sought from the company), to either add the medicine to the reimbursement list or agree to reimburse it as a hospital medicine, or refuse to reimburse the medicine.</p>  <p>  HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE).</p>  <p>  The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) for the HSE, and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions.  The NCPE uses a decision framework to systematically assess whether a drug is cost-effective as a health intervention.</p>  <p>  The HSE strives to reach a decision in as timely a manner as possible.  However, because of the significant monies involved, it must ensure that the best price is achieved, as these commitments are often multi-million euro investments on an on-going basis.  This can lead to a protracted deliberation process.</p>  <p>  I am keen to engage with Industry and to explore ways in which new medicines might be more easily introduced in Ireland.  However, any innovative approaches that may be tabled must be compatible with the statutory provisions which are in place and must also recognise the fundamental pricing/funding issues in the context of finite Exchequer resources.</p>  <p>  I have indicated willingness to meet with MS Ireland and my office is in contact with the organisation to arrange a mutually convenient date.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost.  The scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.</p><p>The Report of the NHSS Review published in 2015 identified a number of issues for more detailed consideration, including a review of the pricing mechanism used by the NTPF, with a view to:</p><p>- Ensuring value for money and economy, with the lowest possible administrative costs for clients and the State and administrative burden  for providers;</p><p>- Increasing the transparency of the pricing mechanism so that existing and potential investors can make as informed decisions as  possible; and</p><p>- Ensuring that there is adequate residential capacity for those residents with more complex needs.</p><p>The terms of reference for the review of the pricing mechanism also includes consideration of the appeals mechanism available to nursing homes.</p><p>A steering group was established to oversee this review, chaired by the NTPF and including representatives from my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The NTPF are close to completing the review and will bring a draft of report to the steering group shortly.</p></reply>

The report of the review group is due shortly.  Following on from this Report, it is expected that a review of the ineligible and eligible list of occupations for employment permits will be conducted in the second half of this year.</p>  <p>  To remove a skill from the ineligible list, it must be demonstrated that recruitment difficulties are due to shortages and not to factors such as pay and/or working conditions.  It is important therefore that a detailed business case, which sets out the necessary data and evidence to justify the need for the nursing home sector to go outside the EEA to find workers, is provided.</p>  <p>  I have indicated my willingness to work with the Nursing Home industry on this matter so that the Department of Health, as the lead Department for the sector, can in turn make the case to the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department have also agreed to meet with Nursing Homes Ireland, along with officials from the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation.

On this basis, where venesection is classed as a day case procedure and is not carried out in an out- patient setting, the public in-patient charge applies.</p><p>There are a number of exemptions to the in-patient charge (including that provided on a day-case basis), as listed in the Health (Amendment) Act 2013:</p><p>- A person with full eligibility;</p><p>- A woman receiving services in respect of motherhood;</p><p>- A child who is no more than six weeks of age;</p><p>- A child receiving services in respect of a defect identified as a health examination held pursuant to the service provided under  section 66;</p><p>- A person receiving services for the diagnosis or treatment of infectious diseases prescribed under Part IV of the Health Act 1947;</p><p>- A person receiving services in respect of which service the person is deemed pursuant to section 45(7) to be a person with full eligibility;</p><p>- A person who pursuant to section 2 of the Health (Amendment) Act 1996, in the opinion of the Health Service Executive, has contracted Hepatitis C directly or indirectly from the use of Human Immunoglobin Ant-D or the receipt within the State of another blood product or a blood transfusion.</p><p>My Department met with the HSE recently to discuss the provision of venesection services for hereditary haemochromatosis patients.

Imports of such products can be divided into three categories; products of animal origin, products of plant origin and composite products (may contain materials of both animal and plant origin). Imports of food products coming from countries outside the European Union are subject to checks to verify compliance with European legislation.</p>  <p>  In Ireland these checks are required to be carried out at ports or airports approved or designated for this purpose. The decision to seek approval or designation for this purpose is a commercial decision to be made by port and airport authorities, balancing the income to be derived from such imports against the costs of providing the necessary facilities required by the legislation. </p>  <p>  My Department is always available for discussions with any port or airport authority interested in having such a facility.

Ideally, such places should be part of the neighbourhood, and it is for these (and other) reasons that my Department operates the NeighbourWood Scheme.  </p>  <p>  The NeighbourWood Scheme, which is funded by the Government under the Forestry Programme 2014-2020, offers financial support for community groups working with local authorities, to develop attractive woodland amenities close to where people live. Funding is available towards the establishment of new neighbourwoods on open &lsquo;greenfield&rsquo; sites, the silvicultural enhancement of existing woodland already used as neighbourwoods (or proposed for development as neighbourwoods), and the installation and upgrade of appropriate recreational facilities within certain areas. </p>  <p>  These neighbourwoods vary greatly in size and location, from forests in the countryside and on the outskirts of villages, towns and cities, to woodlands located in more built-up areas. The resulting benefits are numerous and far-reaching. Neighbourwoods provide accessible opportunities for recreation and regular exercise, and offer people &lsquo;time-out&rsquo; and contact with the natural world and the changing seasons. They also deliver a wide range of environmental benefits, providing vital habitats for wildlife, removing atmospheric carbon, promoting air quality and improving the visual landscape, to mention just a few. </p>  <p>  The new neighbourwood amenity at Vartry, Roundwood, Co Wicklow, which was officially opened last month by the Taoiseach and my colleague, Minister of State Andrew Doyle, highlights the opportunities available to local communities to avail of financial support under the NeighbourWood Scheme. Further details on the Neighbourwood scheme can be found on my Department's website.</p></reply>

The programme was developed in accordance with a number of EU and National policy and regulatory requirements:</p>  <p>  1. European Union Guidelines on State Aid for agriculture and forestry and in rural areas 2014 to 2020 addressing in particular the Common Assessment Principles;</p>  <p>  2. Regulation (EU) no 1305/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council on support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD); </p>  <p>  3. European Commission's Guidelines for Strategic Programming for the period 2014-2020;</p>  <p>  4. Foodwise 2025;</p>  <p>  5. COFORD&rsquo;s Forests, products and people &ndash; Ireland&rsquo;s forest policy &ndash; a renewed vision; </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s forestry schemes were co-financed by the EU until 2006 under the CAP Rural Development Programme, but since then have been 100% funded by the Exchequer.  The 2007 to 2013 RDP only allowed a reduced establishment grant rate (max 80% of costs) which represented a significant shift in policy and in payment levels from what was historically available.</p>  <p>  Ireland has the second lowest level of forestry cover in the EU at 11% where the average cover is 38%.  Given this low level of forest cover in Ireland, our need to expand our forest estate and the need to make available incentives that would convince farmers to plant their land it was decided that the type of scheme implementable through RDP 2007-2013 would not be capable of delivering an effective afforestation programme in Ireland.  Accordingly it was decided to seek State Aid approval to deliver an exchequer-funded forestry programme in Ireland from 2007.</p>  <p>  The Rural Development Programme 2014-2020 limited forestry premiums paid for planting to 12 years compared to the 20-year premiums paid in the preceding programme.  This would have had a significant impact on forestry planting levels in Ireland.  Accordingly the State Aid approval route was used again for the 2014-2020 Programme in order to provide sufficient incentives for landowners to plant trees on their land.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-07-10a.1811.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018071000102#WRPP03600"><p>I made the announcement on 2 May 2108 on the extension of electronic identification to all sheep.</p>  <p>  The rationale for the introduction of new rules on sheep identification is very solid as it clearly allows for a more robust sheep traceability system that will further support the development and sustainability of the sheep industry.  It will ultimately simplify the sheep tagging system and will significantly reduce the record keeping requirements for farmers and producers alike.  The extension of EID to all sheep has the capacity to allow for greater market access to third countries, including the USA, as well as considering the potential of sheepmeat access to Japan and other markets.  </p>  <p>  The current national sheep identification system (NSIS) was introduced in 2010 in an effort to address specific concerns across different sectors.  It is widely acknowledged as being very complex, with an over-reliance on the transcription of individual numbers through all stages of production. The system is not functioning optimally and must be improved.</p>  <p>  Acknowledging that the new sheep identification rules will impose an additional cost on farmers, I have announced a tag subsidy scheme, whereby keepers will be eligible for a payment of up to &euro;50 on the first electronic tag order processed after a date to be specified.  In addition, while not required for the implementation of the new rules, I have included sheep tag readers and associated software as eligible investments under the TAMS Scheme.  This will greatly assist keepers in their on-going flock management and improvement.  TAMS is a scheme that farmers are familiar with and which also offers other sheep-related investment opportunities.</p>  <p>  In operational terms, when the new system comes into force, marts and factories will operate as Central Points of Recording (CPRs), approved by my Department.  As provided for under Council Regulation 21/2004, CPRs will provide the presenting keeper with a printed list of tag numbers scanned in association with a particular batch of sheep presented at a mart or factory, thereby removing the requirement for the keeper to separately list the individual tag number of each animal in that batch.  The printed list will then be associated with the related dispatch document for the keeper's records.  In the case of mart movements, the CPR will provide a similar printout to the purchasing keeper, for association with his/her records.</p>  <p>  Only movements to premises that are not operating as approved CPRs (e.g. farm-to-farm, farm-show etc.) will require the listing of full animal identification numbers on the associated dispatch document.</p>  <p>  The operation of marts and factories as CPRs means that no farmer will be required to purchase tag reading equipment, although this is an option for those who wish to record and monitor animal data with a view to improving flock management and optimising yield.</p>  <p>  I have led a number of trade missions in the last number of years, where every effort is being made by organisations throughout the country to secure additional markets for Irish sheep meat.  Increasingly, these new markets require the electronic identification of sheep as a pre-requisite to discussions.  While it is the case that New Zealand has access to Asian markets in the absence of electronic identification, as alluded to in the supplied detail, these are historic markets, where access was granted many years ago when technology had not advanced to the standards of today.  New, higher standards are now required for entry into these markets and Ireland has no choice but to reach the standards set out if we are to expand our market base into these countries.   </p>  <p>  Since the announcement of the introduction of EID in sheep, either myself or my officials have met with the stakeholders in the sheep industry and engaged in consultation on the implementation of EID. </p>  <p>  A number of submissions have also been made on the matter of implementation of EID and I will consider the views of all stakeholders and expect to respond soon on the matter.</p></reply>

This includes in the run-up to the launch of the National Development Plan and National Planning Framework on 16 February 2018 and the subsequent preparations for the Cabinet discussion and adoption of the four Project Ireland 2040 funds on 29 May 2018.  On this latter occasion, I discussed details of the Funds as they relate to the work of my Department.  My most recent engagement with Department officials on this issue was on 20 June to discuss preparations for this Friday's event in Westport to mark Project Ireland 2040's contribution to the development of rural Ireland which I am co-hosting with Minister Ring. </p>  <p>  Under Project Ireland 2040, the Government is committed to a  &euro;116 billion plan to invest in our public infrastructure, take the entire country forward, balance rural and urban investment, and prepare us for future economic challenges and opportunities.  I fully support the plan which will bring a renewed focus to the strengthening of rural communities and rural economies.</p></reply>

Indeed, this is all the more relevant after the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU, which presents significant new challenges for the agrifood sector in particular. </p>  <p>  Food Wise 2025 outlines the huge potential for growth in agrifood exports to new and emerging markets, particularly in Asia, Africa and the Gulf region. </p>  <p>  In keeping with the priorities outlined in Food Wise 2025, I led a very successful Trade Mission to Japan and South Korea in November 2017.   This was a very opportune time to bring a delegation of Ireland&rsquo;s food leaders to this part of the world, given that the EU has concluded a Free Trade Agreement with South Korea as well as concluding an Economic Partnership Agreement with Japan in December 2017.  Japan and South Korea are markets of high potential for beef, pigmeat and sheepmeat exports, and so it is important that we raise the profile of Irish agrifood enterprises that already have access to these markets, and make progress in negotiating access for others.</p>  <p>  Following a further Trade Mission to the US and Canada last February, I led a Trade Mission to China in May.  This was an extremely successful mission in the development of our ever-growing partnership with China. For example, being present at one of the World&rsquo;s largest food trade exhibitions in Shanghai allowed me to reinforce the positive messages about the quality and sustainability of Irish agrifood exports to Asian buyers.  I also met with three senior Chinese Ministers and three Vice-Ministers over the course of the week. The value of our agrifood exports to China in 2017 reached just under &euro;800 million. There is a clear ambition on both sides to further build co-operation between Ireland and China on many levels, including trade, and I will continue to do all I can to maximise this potential. </p>  <p>  These and the other missions that my Department are planning for the latter half of 2018 will serve to enhance and improve our existing levels of market access in these destinations.  They will also help to promote Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as a producer of high quality, safe and sustainably produced meat and dairy products. </p>  <p>  The destinations are also in keeping with the market prioritisation exercise that was completed by Bord Bia in December 2017, at my request. This exercise identified opportunities in new and more mature markets, and will provide valuable market intelligence both for industry operators and policy makers as we continue to navigate the very uncertain environment created by Brexit.</p>  <p>  The Indian market is traditionally seen as a difficult market for Irish food and drinks exports to penetrate, due to restrictions in quotas, high tariffs and non-tariff barriers.  However, I am pleased to note that Irish exports have increased in recent years. In 2013 total Irish agrifood exports amounted to just over &euro;1m, while in 2017 this has increased to &euro;5.2m.  I also note that the Kerry Group opened a facility in India in 2012 producing consumer food ingredients for the Indian market. The potential revival of the EU-India FTA could also see opportunities increasing for Irish product with the removal of tariffs. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to monitor this and of course seek out and identify new markets, and I am also ready to respond as appropriate to other opportunities that may arise.</p></reply>

The beneficiaries concerned indicated a completion date of September 2009 in their 'Acceptance of conditions of Grant to Beneficiary' letter.  Time extensions to the company were granted during the economic downturn. </p>  <p>  Following this extension, on 10th July 2013, my Department issued written confirmation for the beneficiaries to proceed with the original project regarding the purchase of equipment, provided that the project was completed and claimed for by 31st October 2013 and that the accompanying 'Declaration of Undertaking' was signed and returned to my Department. No signed undertaking was received.</p>  <p>  Subsequently, my Department wrote again to the beneficiaries on 12th November 2013, advising that the Department would presume that no additional claim for grant would be made by the beneficiaries as no undertaking had been received.  At the request of the beneficiaries, officials from my Department, met with them to discuss the possibility of modifying the remaining element of the original plan.  At that meeting, the beneficiaries gave an undertaking to revert to my Department with clarification on whether they ultimately planned to complete their investment.  No such clarification was received and on 20 February 2016 officials from my Department issued a revocation letter to the beneficiaries, indicating that monies already paid, amounting  to &euro;172,477.50 would not be recovered but that the remaining unclaimed grant aid would be revoked. </p>  <p>  In March 2017, the beneficiaries wrote to my Department, stating that they were not appealing the decision as indicated in the letter of 20 February 2016 but seeking a review of the decision to revoke the remainder of the grant aid award. </p>  <p>  In April 2017, officials from my Department carried out an inspection of the beneficiaries premises, where the inspecting officer confirmed that the remaining elements of the original project were not completed and therefore not eligible for payment. </p>  <p>  In May 2017, officials from my Department wrote to the beneficiaries, indicating that the remaining elements of the original project had not been completed and advised them of their right to appeal this decision to the Office of the Ombudsman.

Enforcement action against illegal waste activity is a matter for the local authorities and the Office of Environmental Enforcement of the EPA as appropriate.   Each local authority is responsible for the supervision and the enforcement of the relevant provisions of the Waste Management Act 1996 in relation to the holding, recovery and disposal of waste within its functional area. Local authorities have specific powers under the Act to require measures to be taken, or to take measures directly, to prevent or limit environmental pollution caused or likely to be caused by the holding, recovery or disposal of waste, and to mitigate or remedy the effects on the environment of such activity. Part 19 of the Local Government Act 2001 sets out the powers conferred on Local Authorities to make bye-laws. In addition, section 35 of the Waste Management Act 1996 states that a Local Authority may make a bye-law for the purpose of the proper management of waste or the prevention or control of environmental pollution should it be considered necessary to do so.</p>  <p>  Underpinning waste enforcement is state funding for waste enforcement officers. I have made &euro;9 million available from the Environment Fund this year to support the Waste Enforcement Regional Lead Authorities and the recruitment and continued employment of a network of local authority waste enforcement officers. This investment is critical in providing an enhanced response on the ground to other infractions of the waste code.</p>  <p>  In terms of monitoring how households manage their waste, certain local authorities have already introduced bye-laws which require householders to sign up to a household waste collection service. </p>  <p>  The Regional Waste Management Planning Offices have prepared a template to help standardise bye-laws on the presentation of waste. The draft template bye-laws place the onus of proof on the householder to prove that they are managing their waste correctly by signing up to a waste collection service or providing receipts for the deposit of waste in authorised facilities.  </p>  <p>In addition, the Regional Waste Management Plans contain further measures to identify areas of low collection and to work with communities and collectors to address this issue.</p></reply>

Accordingly, I specifically included in the Programme for Government a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce. The Taskforce worked with key stakeholders to produce a report in December 2016, available on my Department&rsquo;s website, which contained 40 actions to alleviate some of the deficits. The Implementation Group which I co-chair with Minister Kyne is overseeing implementation of the actions and comprises all key stakeholders responsible for delivery. This includes ComReg, which attends as both an action owner, and in an observer capacity in its role as the independent Regulator.</p>  <p>  Minister Kyne and I published the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce Implementation Review 2017 on 21 February 2018, which comprehensively outlines the progress made in 2017 on the actions identified by the Taskforce. Of the 40 actions, 29 have been completed, with work on the remaining 11 carrying into the 2018 Work Programme. Following close engagement with stakeholders at the National Stakeholder Forum, an additional 23 new measures have been identified for delivery in 2018, that will lead to improvements for consumers across Ireland.</p>  <p>  The sixth meeting of the Taskforce Implementation Group was held on 4 July 2018, and the Quarter 2 2018 Progress Report has since been published on my Department&rsquo;s website. This report offers progress updates on all Q2 actions.</p>  <p>  In terms of addressing mobile coverage black-spots, various initiatives are under way:</p>  <p>  - My Department and the Department of Rural and Community Development have worked to achieve a greater consensus around site selection for deployment of telecoms infrastructure and therefore improve mobile phone coverage.</p>  <p>  - Both Departments also worked with a pilot group of local authorities to identify the issues associated with mapping local black-spots. This pilot exercise has been completed, with all local authorities having been asked to map local black-spots and identify infrastructure that could potentially be used to provide additional coverage on an economic basis. This exercise is on-going under the 2018 Taskforce Work Programme. It is planned to have dedicated Geographic Information System (GIS) resources in place to support this.</p>  <p>  - A review was conducted to identify recommendations to address black-spots. A focus group is continuing this work in 2018, to inform future policy development and initiatives. The work of this focus group, will provide guidance on location categories where high quality mobile phone coverage should be made available as a priority, taking account of customer expectations.</p>  <p>  - ComReg recently introduced a new scheme allowing the use of accredited mobile phone repeaters to help address the issue of indoor coverage, particularly in rural areas.</p>  <p>  - ComReg is also developing a composite national coverage map, which will, in tandem with its work on handset testing and awareness raising activities, allow people across Ireland to optimise the services available to them.</p>  <p>  In tandem with the work of the Taskforce, the release by ComReg of the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band, which has been identified at EU level as a primary band suitable for 5G rollout, will also contribute to addressing increasing mobile data demands and improve mobile coverage.

The public sector has a critical leadership role to play, with a more ambitious 33% energy efficiency target in the same period.  Very significant efficiency gains have already been made with a 20% improvement in energy efficiency achieved in the public sector by the end of 2016.  This equates to &euro;133m of energy spend savings and a 520,000 tonne CO2 equivalent savings mitigated by the public sector in 2016 alone. This is set out in the <i>Annual Report on Public Sector Energy Efficiency Performance </i>compiled by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), and available on their website.</p><p>Nevertheless, a significant scaling up of effort is now required if the 33% is to be met. This is why I published the first Public Sector Energy Efficiency Strategy, with the approval of Government, in January 2017.  It introduced new governance structures and enhanced support measures, and provided clarity on the retention of financial savings achieved by public sector bodies from the energy efficiency measures they implement.  </p><p>To realise the potential for energy efficiency in the public sector, there must be senior leadership and accountability for energy performance in Government Departments and public sector bodies.  All Government Departments have now appointed Energy Performance Officers (EPO) at a senior level to provide the necessary strategic leadership to their departments and bodies in their sectors on energy management. </p><p>Since the publication of the Strategy, my Department, along with the SEAI and OPW, have continued to engage with the EPO network and their energy management teams through workshops and individual advisory sessions. This engagement process is then supported on an on-going basis by the specialist energy advisors assigned to each Department by SEAI. The next step is for my Department, again working with SEAI and OPW, to support EPO's to work with the bodies in their sector to identify and develop energy efficiency projects, and avail of the financial and advisory supports, funded by my Department and available from SEAI.  </p><p>In 2017, I secured &euro;5m for two pilot partnership programmes between the SEAI and the OPW, and SEAI and Department of Education and Skills.  &euro;3 million was allocated to the SEAI/OPW pilot to deliver energy upgrades in central government buildings and &euro;2 million was allocated for a SEAI/DES pilot for medium to deep retrofit upgrades to 10 primary and secondary schools.  The purpose of these pilot programmes was to develop a scalable model for energy retrofit investment in our central government building stock and school. I have secured a further &euro;9m this year to extend those pilot initiatives and to further invest in energy efficiency projects and initiatives in the wider public sector.  The progress gained and learnings from last year are currently informing the development of standard retrofit approaches that will be effectively and efficiently deployed throughout the entire public sector building stock.  </p><p>A project pipeline is currently being developed to identify projects of significant scale that can close the remaining gap to target.  Along with the pilot schemes, the SEAI is working with the higher education, State laboratory  and healthcare sectors to develop significant projects and continues, along with my Department, to support the City &amp;amp; County Management Association in its development of its National Public Lighting upgrade programme, which will halve local authority electricity use.</p><p>Furthermore, the Strategy is now providing the basis for realising the commitment in the National Development Plan, to upgrade the public sector built environment under a comprehensive &euro;750 million retrofit programme.  This will place the public sector built environment on a sound trajectory for 2050 and lead the way in developing Ireland&rsquo;s sustainable energy supply chain.</p></reply>

The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector. Today, 7 out of 10 of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland have access to high speed broadband. By 2020, 9 out of 10 premises will have access to a high speed broadband connection. This is being achieved via a combination of commercial investment and a State led intervention.</p><p>In April 2017 I published an updated High Speed Broadband Map which is available at <i>www.broadband.gov.ie</i>. This Map shows the areas targeted by commercial operators to provide high speed broadband services and the areas that will be included in the State Intervention Area under the NBP. The Map is colour coded and searchable by address and eircode.</p><p>- The AMBER areas represent the target areas for the proposed State led Intervention under the NBP and are the subject of an ongoing procurement process.</p><p>- The BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have plans to deliver high speed broadband services.</p><p>- The LIGHT BLUE areas represent eir's commercial rural deployment plans to rollout high speed broadband to 300,000 premises as part of a Commitment Agreement signed with me in April 2017 and available on my Department&rsquo;s website <i>www.dccae.gov.ie</i>.</p><p>My Department is in a formal procurement process to select a company who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network in the State intervention area.  This process is now in its final stages. </p><p>For those premises currently awaiting access to high speed broadband, practical initiatives will continue to be addressed through the work of the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce to address obstacles and improve connectivity in respect of existing and future mobile phone and broadband services. </p><p>Under this Taskforce, engagement between telecommunications operators and local authorities through the Broadband Officers is continuing to strengthen.  These Broadband Officers are acting as single points of contact in local authorities for their communities.  The appointment of these officers is already reaping rewards in terms of ensuring a much greater degree of consistency in engagements with operators and clearing obstacles to developing infrastructure. The Department of Rural and Community Development maintain a list of Broadband Officers, a link to which is available on my Department's website at this https://www.dccae.gov.ie/en-ie/communications/topics/Broadband/national-broadband-plan/Pages/NBP-Information-Leaflets.aspx.</p></reply>

Therefore, the National Energy Forum will be a part of the National Dialogue.</p><p>The primary objective of the National Dialogue will be to ensure an inclusive process of engagement and consensus building across society towards enabling the transformation to a low carbon and climate-resilient future. To do this, the Dialogue will seek to create awareness, engagement and motivation to act (locally, regionally and nationally) in relation to the challenges presented by climate change and to establish, on a long term basis, appropriate networks for people to meet periodically to consider evidence-based inputs on the economic, social, behavioural, environmental and public aspects of climate and energy policy. This is also in line with the objectives for the National Energy Forum envisaged in the Energy White Paper.</p><p>National Dialogue initiatives already being implemented include the Green Schools National Climate Change Action and Awareness Programme, incorporating Climate Action Week, the Green Schools Climate Expo, and the Climate Ambassador Programme; the EPA Climate Lecture Series; the Tidy Towns Climate Award; and the Regional Gatherings.</p><p>I hosted the first Regional Gathering in Athlone on 23 June last, and this event was targeted at community organisations and individuals from the counties of Offaly, Westmeath, Meath, Louth, Monaghan, Cavan, Longford, Roscommon, and Leitrim.

It is a certificate based scheme with two certificates awarded per litre of sustainable biofuel if that biofuel is produced from wastes or residues and one certificate per litre for all other sustainable biofuels. The Biofuels Obligation Scheme is administered by the National Oil Reserves Agency, which is a body established under the 2007 National Oil Reserves Agency Act.</p>  <p>  For each calendar year, a fuel supplier must hold sufficient biofuel obligation certificates to demonstrate compliance.  The number of certificates required is determined by the biofuel obligation rate, which is currently set at 8%.  This means that at the end of 2018, a fuel supplier must hold 8 biofuel certificates for every 92 litres of fossil fuel they place on the road transport fuel market this year.  If a fuel supplier does not have sufficient certificates, it can purchase certificates from other obligated parties who hold surpluses and/or pay a &lsquo;buy out charge&rsquo; of 45 cent per certificate for the shortfall. The level of compliance with the obligation is high and there has been very limited necessity for the buy-out charge to be levied since the scheme was introduced.</p>  <p>  In 2017 the Biofuels Obligation Scheme resulted in over 225 million litres of biofuel being placed on the market in Ireland leading to over 7% renewable energy use in the transport sector compared to the 10% target for 2020 under the Renewable Energy Directive.</p>  <p>  In December 2017, my Department held a consultation seeking views in relation to implementing a phased increase to the biofuel obligation rate and on how the scheme could be developed in the future. A key theme to emerge from responses to the consultation was the need to provide certainty to industry and stakeholders to facilitate longer term planning for future blending obligations. </p>  <p>  In April 2018, I published a Biofuel Obligation Scheme Policy Statement which set out six key actions that will be undertaken in the development of the scheme. This included an increase in the biofuel obligation rate to 10% by volume from 1 January 2019 and 11% by volume from 1 January 2020. The first of these changes has been enacted by S.I. No. 169 of 2018.</p>  <p>Further changes to the Biofuels Obligation Scheme are likely for the period post-2020 to conform to the recently agreed changes to the Renewable Energy Directive. In this regard, it is my intention that a further public consultation be held next year.</p></reply>

Ireland's position is that while we are consistently able to meet the 1st April deadline, we recognise that it does pose difficulties for other member states in terms of their administration. For this reason we support this amendment</p>  <p>  - To change the rules under which an allowance is made for naphtha yield when calculating the stock holding obligation of member states. Naphtha is a by-product of the refining process which may be used as a feedstock for further refining or in the petrochemical industry. The current methodology for taking into account naphtha yield is leading to large fluctuations in some member states stockholding obligations from one year to the next.  Ireland's annual naphtha yield of approximately 3% does not subject the State to such fluctuations in its obligations. Given that the proposed technical changes in the methodology will have no impact on Ireland&rsquo;s stock holding obligation and in recognition of the difficulties experienced by some member states, Ireland supports the Commission&rsquo;s proposal in this area.</p></reply>

Today, 7 out of 10 of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland have access to high speed broadband. By 2020, 9 out of 10 premises will have access to a high speed broadband connection. This is being achieved via a combination of commercial investment and a State led intervention.  </p><p>In April 2017 I published an updated High Speed Broadband Map which is available at <i>www.broadband.gov.ie</i>. This map shows the areas targeted by commercial operators to provide high speed broadband services and the areas that will be included in the State Intervention Area under the National Broadband Plan. The Map is colour coded and searchable by address/Eircode:</p><p>- The AMBER areas represent the target areas for the proposed State led Intervention under the NBP and are the subject of an ongoing procurement process.</p><p>- The BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have plans to deliver high speed broadband services.</p><p>- The LIGHT BLUE areas represent eir's commercial rural deployment plans to rollout high speed broadband to 300,000 premises as part of a Commitment Agreement signed with me in April 2017. </p><p>All 96 premises in the townland of <font color="#444444">Ballynacarrigy</font>are LIGHT BLUE and fall to be served by eir's planned rural deployment.</p><p>There are 136 premises in the townland of <font color="#444444">Ballymore. 134 of these</font>are LIGHT BLUE and fall to be served by eir's planned rural deployment. 2 are AMBER and will be served under the State led Intervention.</p><p>My Department is in a formal procurement process to select a company who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network in the State intervention area. That procurement process is now in its final stages.</p><p>In April 2017, I signed a Commitment Agreement with eir in relation to its plans to provide high speed broadband to 300,000 premises in rural areas on a commercial basis. Information on eir's planned rural deployment is available at <i></i>.  A copy of the Commitment Agreement is available on my Department&rsquo;s website <i>www.dccae.gov.ie.</i></p><p>Data for Q1 2018 submitted by eir to my Department indicated that the company has passed some 145,000 premises nationwide as part of its ongoing deployment. eir has signalled that there would be some knock-on effects to the 2018 milestone targets due to the severe weather impacts of both storms Ophelia and Emma. </p><p>I have met with the senior management in eir and expressed to them the importance of implementing measures to catch up with milestone targets as a priority.</p><p>For those premises currently awaiting access to high speed broadband, practical initiatives will continue to be addressed through the work of the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce to address obstacles and improve connectivity in respect of existing and future mobile phone and broadband services. </p><p>Under this Taskforce, engagement between telecommunications operators and local authorities through the Broadband Officers is continuing to strengthen.  These Broadband Officers are acting as single points of contact in local authorities for their communities.  The appointment of these officers is already reaping rewards in terms of ensuring a much greater degree of consistency in engagements with operators and clearing obstacles to developing infrastructure. The Department of Rural and Community Development maintain a list of Broadband Officers, a link to which is available on my Department's website at this https://www.dccae.gov.ie/en-ie/communications/topics/Broadband/national-broadband-plan/Pages/NBP-Information-Leaflets.aspx. </p></reply>

This event, which was also attended by An Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar TD, and other members of the Cabinet, had the theme of Empowering Communities for Climate Action.  </p><p>Recognising the key role of communities as enablers and drivers of the low carbon transition in society, this event also included two panel discussions exploring how to engage society with climate change and how, once engaged with the challenge, citizens can be empowered to act, focusing especially on the role of Government expenditure policy, taxation measures and regulation in underpinning climate action. These panel discussions will, in turn,  further inform the development of initiatives under the National Dialogue on Climate Action. A recording of the 20 June event is available to view on my Department's website at <i>www.dccae.gov.ie </i></p><p>Building on the National Mitigation Plan, the publication in February of the National Development Plan will lead to a significant step change in funding available for climate action in the next decade. Reflecting the strong commitment of the Government on this issue, almost &euro;22 billion will be directed, between Exchequer and non-Exchequer resources, to addressing the transition to a low-carbon and climate resilient society. In addition, the National Development Plan allocated a further &euro;8.6 billion for investments in sustainable mobility. This means that well over &euro;1 in every &euro;5 spent under the National Development Plan will be on climate mitigation and this capital investment will enable us to deliver a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in the period to 2030. </p><p>The key investment priorities in the National Development Plan that my Department will take forward include: </p><p>- ​energy efficiency upgrades of 45,000 homes per annum from 2021 and providing support for a major roll-out of heat pump technologies; </p><p>- delivering energy upgrades to BER 'B' level in all public buildings and a minimum of one third of commercial buildings; </p><p>- implementing the new renewable electricity support scheme to deliver an additional 3,000-4,500 MW of renewable energy, with the initial focus on shovel ready projects which could contribute to meeting our 2020 renewable energy targets; </p><p>- the roll-out of the support scheme for renewable heat and national smart metering programme; </p><p>- transitioning the Moneypoint plant away from coal by the middle of the next decade; </p><p>- having at least 500,000 electric vehicles on the road by 2030 with additional charging infrastructure to cater for planned growth; and </p><p>- a &euro;500 million Climate Action Fund to leverage investment by public and private bodies  in climate action measures, which I launched for applications on 9 July.</p><p>Both the National Mitigation Plan and the National Development Plan explicitly recognise that the reliance solely on Exchequer expenditure schemes is neither affordable nor adequate to meet the scale of the challenge to be addressed, and that climate mitigation action will require a targeted balance between Exchequer-supported expenditure, taxation measures, regulation and behavioural change. </p><p>In certain cases, taxation policy may have a stronger role to play in changing individual or business behaviour and investment decisions, including harnessing non-Exchequer finance. Carbon tax, in particular, has a critical role in climate mitigation policy and the national mitigation plan commits the Department of Finance to completing a review in 2018, with a view to setting a long-term trajectory for the evolution of this tax. Clear long-term signalling by the Government on the future evolution of the tax is vital, as well as an examination of what other changes to the taxation regime could be considered that would assist with the achievement of climate targets. The low emission vehicle task force is bringing forward proposals in this regard.</p><p>As regards significant regulatory change, the National Development Plan commits the Government to no new non-zero emission cars to be sold in Ireland post-2030, with no NCT certificates to be issued for non-zero emission cars post-2045. There is also to be a transition to a low emission urban bus fleet, including electric buses, with no diesel only buses purchased from 1 July 2019.</p><p>Given the significant role for my Department in the development and implementation of policies and programmes envisaged in the National Development Plan to advance our transition to a low-carbon, climate-resilient society, as well as other programmes for which I am responsible, I am in constant contact with my officials regarding the implementation of various elements of the Project Ireland 2040 commitments and I also meet with the Management Board of the Department each month to review progress on the full suite of business priorities for which the Department is responsible.  </p></reply>

It is being brought to the D&aacute;il by Department of Finance.</p>  <p>  The Government and I are committed to reducing Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions. Our 2015 Energy White Paper on Ireland's Transition to a Low Carbon Energy Future   sets out a vision of a low-carbon energy system where emissions from the energy sector will be reduced by between 80% and 95% by 2050, compared to 1990 levels. The reduction will require a significant increase in the share of renewables in primary energy supply. The government has made a definitive decision to take coal out of power generation by 2025 and peat out before 2030.  Ireland will be one of the first countries in Europe to do so.  We will be one of the first countries in the world to ban smoky coal later this year.</p>  <p>  This time last year I published Ireland&rsquo;s first statutory National Mitigation Plan, an initial step to set Ireland on a pathway to achieve the deep decarbonisation required by 2050.</p>  <p>  The National Mitigation Plan covers greenhouse gas emissions in the Electricity Generation, Built Environment, Transport, and Agriculture, Forest and Land Use sectors. For each sector, the Plan sets out the sectorial policy context, the greenhouse gas emissions trends for each sector, the opportunities and challenges, mitigation measures currently in place and under development, and specific actions to take forward work within each sector. The National Development Plan specifies that &euro;1 in every &euro;5 spent over the next decade in public funding is to be spent on climate &ndash;related activity.  </p>  <p>  Work is also being carried out to examine the potential economic impact of various carbon tax scenarios. A report is due to  be published on this in advance of the forthcoming budget.  The National Development Plan sets out the Government&rsquo;s ambition that no new non-zero emission cars would be sold in Ireland post 2030.  In addition, Budget 2018 introduced a range of measures to drive uptake in electric vehicle ownership including continuation of Electric Vehicle Purchase Grant and VRT reliefs, grants for home chargers and a 0% rate of benefit in kind for battery electric vehicles. My colleague, the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Sport has introduced grant incentives for the uptake of electric vehicles in the Small Public Service Vehicle sector and discounted tolling charges for electric vehicles. Government continues to increase support to extended energy efficiency programmes managed by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), resulting in less reliance on imported fossil fuels.  </p></reply>

Detailed data on the price offerings for the months of December to June is available on <i>www.dccae.gov.ie </i></p><p>The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) is also currently conducting a separate study on the operation of the household waste collection market which it will complete in 2018.  </p><p>The results from the PMG in conjunction with the study being undertaken by the CCPC will provide an evidence base for future policy decisions in relation to the household waste market.</p></reply>

Specific Regulations regarding the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to asbestos fibres while at work have been in place since 1989. The current Regulations are the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Exposure to Asbestos) Regulations 2006, which are enforced by the Health and Safety Authority, which comes under the remit of the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation.</p><p>The primary responsibility for the management of any waste, including costs for removal or disposal, lies with the holder of the waste, i.e. the natural or legal person in possession of the waste, or the producer of the waste. The Waste Management Act 1996 imposes a general duty of care on holders of waste. A person may not hold, transport, recover or dispose of waste in a manner that causes or is likely to cause environmental pollution. In addition, in the case of hazardous waste, a holder of waste is required, without delay, to inform both the local authority concerned and the Environmental Protection Agency of any loss, spillage, accident or other development concerning that waste which causes or is likely to cause environmental pollution.</p><p>It is recommended that expert advice should be sought in dealing with asbestos materials and if removal is necessary it should only be done by a competent contractor with the required training and appropriate authorisations. Advice on the proper disposal of asbestos is available from the website of the Environmental Protection Agency at this .</p></reply>

The role of my Department is to provide a comprehensive legislative and waste policy framework through which the enforcement authorities operate.</p>  <p>  Under section 60(3) of the Waste Management Act 1996, as Minister, I am precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to the performance by the Agency or a local authority, in particular circumstances, of a statutory function vested in it. </p>  <p>  The primary objective of local authorities in terms of waste enforcement is to achieve regulatory compliance in relation to waste activities in the local authority&rsquo;s functional area. This covers a wide range of roles, including regulatory enforcement, undertaking inspections and taking appropriate measures to bring relevant parties into compliance, addressing unauthorised waste activities and responding to environmental complaints.</p>  <p>  It is a matter for each individual local authority in the first instance to deal with any instances of illegal disposal of waste in their area and to take the appropriate enforcement action. Local authorities have significant powers available to them under the Waste Management Act, to enable them to tackle illegal waste activity. This includes the power to investigate complaints, prosecute offences, apply to the Courts for the imposition of fines, enter onto and inspect premises where there are reasonable grounds for believing that there is a risk of environmental pollution, direct a holder of waste to dispose of it in a certain way within a specific timeframe and monitor and inspect waste holding, recovery and disposal facilities.</p>  <p>  Local authorities are assisted by three Waste Enforcement Regional Lead Authorities (WERLAs), covering the Southern, Eastern and Midlands, and Connacht/Ulster Regions, which were established in 2015. The WERLA offices have responsibility for coordinating waste enforcement actions within regions, setting priorities and common objectives for waste enforcement, ensuring consistent enforcement of waste legislation while still leaving local authority personnel as first responders on the ground. The work of the WERLAs is overseen by a National Steering Committee which includes representatives from a wide range of regulatory and law enforcement authorities. </p>  <p>  The Environmental Protection Agency carries out its waste enforcement functions through the Office of Environmental Enforcement (OEE), and the Office of Climate, Licensing, Resource and Research (OCLRR). The OEE has a mandate to deliver enhanced environmental compliance through enforcement of EPA licences issued to waste, industrial and other activities.  It also exercises a supervisory role in respect of the environmental protection activities of local authorities.  In this regard, the OEE acts as a resource to members of the public who have exhausted all other avenues of complaint. Further enforcement responsibility is assigned to the OCLRR, including producer responsibility enforcement related to WEEE, batteries and tyres.</p>  <p>  The National Transfrontier Waste Shipment (TFS) Office was established in 2007 as part of Ireland&rsquo;s transposition of Regulation (EC) No. 1013/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council (the waste shipment regulation). All transfrontier shipments of waste originating in any local authority area in the State that are subject to prior written notification procedures must be notified to and through the National TFS Office who have a dedicated enforcement team in place to tackle the illegal shipment of waste abroad.</p>  <p>  The National Waste Collection Permit Office processes waste collection permit applications and review applications for all local authorities. It maintains the Waste Collection Permit register, revokes Waste Collection Permits as appropriate, and provides data reports to relevant stakeholders- including enforcement authorities  where required.</p>  <p>  My commitment to supporting waste enforcement activities is demonstrated through continued investment in the network of local authority waste enforcement officers, increased resources for the EPA and the development of the WERLA Offices. My Department is at an advanced stage of reviewing the &euro;7.4 million annual waste enforcement grant provided to local authorities in order to ensure that resources are placed where they are needed most. A further &euro;1 million is being invested in the WERLA offices on an annual basis while my Department has also provided &euro;3.3 million to support the national anti-dumping initiative in the past two years. Notwithstanding this support it is a matter for local authorities to ensure that the statutory functions that they are charged with delivering are adequately resourced, that they engage proactively with the other supports which are available to them through the EPA&rsquo;s NIECE Enforcement network and that staff avail of the training and development opportunities available to them as professional waste enforcement practitioners.     </p></reply>

Today, 7 out of 10 of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland have access to high speed broadband. By 2020, 9 out of 10 premises will have access to a high speed broadband connection. This is being achieved via a combination of commercial investment and a State led intervention.</p><p>In April 2017 I published an updated High Speed Broadband Map, available at <i>www.broadband.gov.ie</i>, which shows those areas that will be served by commercial operators and those that will be included in the State Intervention Area under the NBP.  This includes approximately 300,000 premises to be passed as part of eir's rural deployment of high speed broadband as part of a Commitment Agreement signed in April 2017.</p><p>The premises referred to by the Deputy is in an AMBER area on my Department&rsquo;s High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at <i>www.broadband.gov.ie</i>. It is therefore included in the State Intervention Area under the National Broadband Plan (NBP). </p><p>My Department is in a formal procurement process to select a company who will rollout a new high speed broadband network in the State intervention area. That procurement process is now in its final stages.</p><p>The rollout of broadband infrastructure close to this premises is a commercial undertaking by eir.  Decisions made by private telecommunication operators relating to the rollout and siting of high speed broadband infrastructure are made on a commercial basis by competing service providers operating in a liberalised market. I have no statutory role or function to intervene in the commercial decisions of private operators, and therefore cannot direct operators regarding infrastructure installation or delivery of services. </p><p>For those premises currently awaiting access to high speed broadband, practical initiatives will continue to be addressed through the work of the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce to address obstacles and improve connectivity in respect of existing and future mobile phone and broadband services. </p><p>Under this Taskforce, engagement between telecommunications operators and local authorities through the Broadband Officers is continuing to strengthen.  These Broadband Officers are acting as single points of contact in local authorities for their communities.  The appointment of these officers is already reaping rewards in terms of ensuring a much greater degree of consistency in engagements with operators and clearing obstacles to developing infrastructure. The Department of Rural and Community Development maintain a list of Broadband Officers, a link to which is available on my Department's website at this https://www.dccae.gov.ie/en-ie/communications/topics/Broadband/national-broadband-plan/Pages/NBP-Information-Leaflets.aspx..</p></reply>

Planning authorities normally decide planning application within 8 weeks. Where an appeal is lodged with the Board in relation to a planning decision by a local authority, the Board has a statutory objective to determine the matter within 18 weeks.  For Strategic Infrastructure Development generally, the Board has an objective to make a decision on applications within a period of 18 weeks.</p>  <p>  Renewable electricity projects that are eligible for financial support under the Renewable Energy Feed-in Tariff that is administered by my Department must adhere to applicable timelines in relation to the furnishing of relevant permissions and consents, as well as deadlines for connecting to the electricity grid. </p>  <p>  The processing of applications to the electricity grid is a matter for the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU). The CRU, ESB Networks and EirGrid are working to develop a programme for issuing new connection offers under the revised Enduring Connection Policy (ECP-1) rules. This programme includes the scheduling of individual and grouped grid connections. </p>  <p>  The scheduling of grid delivery for specific projects is dependent on parameters such as geographical location, network capacity, operational conditions and the requirement for network reinforcements, which is assessed on a case by case basis. I understand that, insofar as possible, ESB Networks co-ordinates its connection works with developer project timelines, to align generator delivery schedules with proposed energisation dates. The timelines for works associated with an individual generator's connection to the grid depends on the connection method and associated works required for that connection.</p>  <p>  Finally, timescales for the funding of renewable energy projects are a commercial matter for project developers.</p></reply>

Advances in battery technology, increasing competition in the market and falling vehicle costs would suggest that electrification will be the predominant low emission choice for private car, taxis and commercial vans in the short to medium term. Biofuels will also continue to play a key role in decarbonisation while natural gas, along with some electrification, will provide an interim alternative solution for larger vehicles such as trucks and buses.</p>  <p>  Transition to a hydrogen-based transport system is not expected over the short term as, for that fuel type, the costs of the refuelling infrastructure and associated vehicles are likely to remain prohibitive until the middle of the next decade;  investing in costly infrastructure too far ahead of the market could lead to early infrastructure becoming obsolete as the technology advances.  Nonetheless, fuel and vehicle technologies generally are evolving rapidly, so the feasibility and potential for supporting hydrogen infrastructure and incentivising fuel cell vehicles will be kept under review.</p>  <p>  In this regard, the Deputy may recall that, in 2016 a dedicated LEV Taskforce was established to consider the range of measures and options available to Government to accelerate the uptake of low emitting alternatives.  Having initially focussed on electric vehicles, the Taskforce is now moving to broaden its scope for the second phase of its work, which will consider measures to promote fuels such as natural gas, liquid petroleum gas and hydrogen.</p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from the Council's own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the Council.</p>  <p>  Prior to the financial crisis, applications for funding for projects such as Dale Road would have been considered as part of the Specific Improvement Grant Scheme for regional and local roads.  However, the extent of the cutbacks in grant funding during the crisis meant this grant scheme had to be curtailed after 2013 because expenditure on maintenance/renewal was falling well short of what was required to adequately maintain the regional and local road network. </p>  <p>  The NDP does provide for the gradual build up in funding for the road network but it will take some years yet to reach the level required for the adequate maintenance and renewal of the network.  For this reason there is limited scope at present for funding projects under the Specific Grant Programme.  </p>  <p>  Any projects proposed by local authorities for consideration under the Specific Grant Programme are assessed by the Department on a case-by-case basis.  All projects put forward by local authorities for consideration must comply with the requirements of the Public Spending Code and my Department's Capital Appraisal Framework and it is important for local authorities to prioritise projects within their overall area of responsibility with these requirements in mind.  In this context Kerry County Council has been informed that it should submit a Preliminary Appraisal in relation to the upgrade of the road.

And, as recommended by the Low Emissions Vehicle Taskforce, a suite of tax and expenditure measures was announced to clearly indicate the Government&rsquo;s commitment to a low-carbon electric vehicle future. In addition, &euro;5.5 million was assigned in Budget 2018 under the Carbon Reduction Programme.</p><p>In 2018 it is envisaged that the Carbon Reduction Programme will be mainly employed to: support alternatively fuelled urban bus trials to help inform purchasing decisions for new buses over the coming years; support the transition of the national car fleet towards electrification through a reduced EV toll regime (launched 1 July) and an EV SPSV Grant Scheme (launched in February); and begin to support research projects in areas such as modal shift and reducing emissions in the Heavy Duty Vehicle sector.</p></reply>

From within this allocation, funding is sourced for the Green Public Transport Fund which was established to support the uptake of low carbon, energy efficient technologies within the public transport sector.  The Fund is intended to support piloting and uptake of energy efficient and alternatively fuelled technologies for PSO operators within the bus fleet and small public service vehicle (SPSV) sector, as well as bridging the price differential between such technologies and conventionally fuelled vehicles. </p>  <p>   In 2017, no funding was drawn down; later this year an up-to-date and comprehensive set of vehicle trials is being planned to commence to help inform purchasing decisions for new buses over the coming years.   It is envisaged that in 2018 the NTA will employ the Fund to support these urban bus fleet trials. In addition, the Fund is also supporting the transition of the national SPSV fleet to alternative technologies through the establishment of a new Electric Vehicle SPSV Grant Scheme.  By the end of May 2018, &euro;45,221 had been drawn down from the Fund to pay grants under this scheme.</p></reply>

The plan provides an outline provision of &euro;2.4 billion for the entire programme, &euro;2 billion for BusConnects in Dublin and &euro;0.4 billion  for BusConnects programmes in our regional cities. The costs of the various elements of the overall BusConnects programme will be confirmed as part of the appropriate appraisal and procurement processes required under the Public Spending Code.</p><p>The National Transport Authority (NTA) has responsibility for the planning and implementation of public transport projects and programmes in the Greater Dublin Area (GDA), including the BusConnects programme. </p><p>The NTA recently published a discussion document focussed on the 16 core bus routes, pathways and cycle tracks/lanes that are emerging as the likely core bus corridors in and out of Dublin city. A second document &ldquo;Dublin Area Bus Network Redesign Public Consultation Report&rdquo; was published by NTA last week. </p><p>This report notes that the existing bus network in Dublin is very complex and is designed primarily around overlapping and long radial routes taking people into the city centre, but with very few orbital routes. Recent improvements to the rail and tram networks require changes to the bus services to exploit the full potential of these investments. Finally the city is growing and changing as are the bus journeys people are taking. </p><p>The report identifies 4 key strategies to address the issues with the current network: standardise service categories; simplify radial services; build frequent orbitals and grow suburban feeder networks. While there will be concerns with any change, these strategies will deliver the following benefits<b></b>for the customer; much simpler city services; much simpler fare structure; provide more frequent all day services through new and frequent strong orbital services interchanging with local services and high frequency radial spines. </p><p>Full public consultation on the network redesign proposals, involving Dublin Bus, using local brochures, local face to face events, digital imaging of the network, on-line surveys and consultation with user groups will commence from the 16<sup>th</sup>July. NTA will launch a full public consultation process on the proposed core bus corridors later this year. </p><p>More information on estimated costs will be available as the various strands of the programme are progressed.</p><p>The Network Direct programme  to which the Deputy refers, launched by Dublin Bus in 2010 and completed in 2013, delivered an increase in the number of high frequency routes; greater use of Quality Bus Corridors (QBC); less route variations making the network easier to understand; a new network of more direct orbital services; an increase in cross city routes to minimise customer interchange; and improved connections with Rail and Luas transport modes. Network Direct resulted in cost savings to the Exchequer as a result of the introduction of major efficiencies. </p><p>In light of the NTA's responsibility in this area, I have referred the Deputy's question to the Authority for a more detailed reply.  Please advise my private office if you do not receive a reply within 10 working days.</p></reply>

MetroLink will provide Dublin with a high capacity, high frequency cross-city rail corridor, serving critical destinations such as Swords, Dublin Airport, Dublin City University, Ballymun, the Mater Hospital, City Centre and existing destinations along the Luas Green Line to Sandyford.  It will provide faster reliable journey times to and from these key destinations while offering interchange with other rail, DART Expansion, light rail and bus services.  MetroLink will comprise of a total of 25 stations (including 15 new stations), 3,000 additional Park and Ride spaces, and a journey time of approximately 50 minutes from Swords to Sandyford.</p>  <p>  The National Transport Authority (NTA), in conjunction with Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) recently launched a public consultation process on the Emerging Preferred Route (EPR) for the MetroLink.  </p>  <p>  Currently TII and NTA are assessing the submissions received (c. 8,000). Once the assessment process is completed, TII and NTA plan to publish a consultation report and a preferred route option in the coming weeks. This preferred route option will be subject to a further stage of public consultation over the period mid-to-end August &amp;amp; September with a view to finalising the details of the MetroLink route by year-end.</p>  <p>  Building on the success of Government&rsquo;s continued investment in building capacity and expanding the Luas network, the NDP will also provide funding to undertake appraisal, planning and design of Luas network expansion to Finglas, Bray, Lucan and Poolbeg. This is to ensure that we will be ready to expand Luas to where and when it is needed in line with sustained development in these areas.</p>  <p>  The NTA has worked in partnership with a number of local authorities in Ireland&rsquo;s cities to prepare transport-related strategies or implement transport related projects. An example of this is the Galway Transport Strategy which was developed in 2016 by Galway City Council and Galway County Council in partnership with the NTA. The strategy concluded that bus-based public transport represents the most appropriate system for Galway.</p>  <p>  A Cork Transport Strategy is also being finalised by the relevant Local Authorities in partnership with the NTA which includes proposals for a revised bus system for Cork and enhancements to the commuter rail service in Cork including additional stations and rail fleet. This transport strategy will also evaluate the potential of a Bus Rapid Transit or Light Rail corridor to serve the increased population growth as envisaged by the National Planning Framework.</p></reply>

Through its Educational Welfare Service, the Agency responds to instances where children, including children from the Traveller community, are not attending school regularly, leading to concerns for their educational welfare. </p>  <p>  I am advised that the Department of Education policy in relation to Traveller Education is informed by the Report and Recommendations for a Traveller Education Strategy which was launched in 2006 following wide ranging consultation with Traveller representative groups and other relevant stakeholders. The principle of inclusion is at the core of the Strategy. The focus of both current and future provision is on the development of an inclusive school environment through the whole school planning process, teaching practice, admissions policies, codes of behaviour and whole school evaluation. In keeping with this principle, additional resources provided in the education system for children are allocated on the basis of identified individual educational need. This includes Traveller children who require additional resources based on need and not on their identity as Travellers. Segregated Traveller specific programmes such as the Visiting Teacher for Travellers were phased out in line with the principle of inclusion.</p>  <p>  School attendance is one of the critical building blocks of positive educational outcomes.  While educational outcomes for Traveller children continue to improve, in most areas attendance still falls well behind the national average and we are aware that there are still areas where attendance and participation among Traveller children is not improving consistently. Following the launch of the 2017 National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy, my Department is committed to working with the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Justice and Equality, Tusla Educational Welfare Services and Traveller and Roma representative groups to examine ways in which Traveller children&rsquo;s attendance and participation may be further enhanced especially in areas where attendance is of greatest concern.</p></reply>

The implication of this is of course, that the information in the files is over 50 years old. Some of the information was deliberately falsified. People have changed addresses. Some have emigrated. Many are no longer alive. </p>  <p>  Each file is being examined. Information is being checked and updated where possible. Some files will be more difficult to update than others but strenuous efforts are being made on every file. </p>  <p>  The process of offering contact and support to those affected will be handled very carefully.  It will take account of each individual&rsquo;s requirements. Some people may not wish to have any contact.  I expect that there are others who will accept contact and support at the earliest opportunity.</p>  <p>  Offers of contact and support will begin at the end of the month in cases where there is sufficient information available to establish contact.</p>  <p>  My focus in the first instance is the provision of information and support. People have a right to their identity. They have a right to honest answers and we have a duty to provide this if possible.</p>  <p>  The Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill 2016 has passed Second Stage in the Seanad.  As I am sure you are aware, the Bill seeks to respect the rights to identity and privacy, which sometimes conflict with one another. </p>  <p>  Given the constitutional context, striking the balance between these rights is proving challenging. It is an important piece of legislation for many people. Attempts to introduce a Bill, as far back as 2001, have failed. </p>  <p>  It is essential that the Bill progresses as quickly as possible, as it places the information and tracing service on a statutory footing for the first time. </p>  <p>  It will also protect relevant records by bringing them into the custody of the Adoption Authority of Ireland, It will create offences for the concealment, destruction, mutilation or falsification of such records. </p>  <p>  The Bill impacts on people who are the subject of illegal registrations, as well as adopted people. Officials are currently reviewing its provisions, in the light of the recent evidence emerging on illegal birth registrations, to ensure that it is robust in addressing this issue. If additional amendments to the Bill are required to ensure this, this can be addressed as the Bill goes through the Houses.</p>  <p>  My intention is that the Bill will be enacted by the end of the year.  Last month I met with advocacy groups, which was informative and helpful. I have also met my Oireachtas colleagues at a briefing session with a view to progressing the Bill to Committee Stage in the Seanad as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  I look forward to working with members of this House and of the Seanad so that all of us who wish to see this bill implemented as soon as possible can work together to achieve this.</p></reply>

Pending this information, I can only acknowledge the commitment and hard work that foster carers demonstrate by playing their critical role in our child care services. To assist them in this role, they receive the Foster Care Allowance, which is currently &euro;325 per week per child under 12 years of age and &euro;352 per week per child aged 12 and over. It is an allowance in respect of the child and is provided in order to allow foster carers to meet all of the child's daily living needs including food, clothing, basic travel, education costs and hobbies and sporting activities. The allowance is not considered as means for Social Welfare purposes nor is it taxable. </p>  <p>  In addition, Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, provides funding to the Irish Foster Care Association, which offers a range of supports to carers, including advocacy, mediation, training and a phone advice service.</p></reply>

This measure refines the development previously introduced, whereby three intake dates were adopted (September, January and April), and will increase the duration of each registered child on ECCE from a current average of 61 weeks, to a potential duration of 76 weeks (two programme years).  This further enhancement delivers on a commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government that is good for children, families and Early Years providers. </p>  <p>  The provision of a second year of ECCE required either an increase in the upper age limit for ECCE, or a reduction in the lower age limit.  The latter was chosen and is consistent with the law in this country with regard to school start age and the associated policy of the Department of Education and Skills.</p>  <p>  This minimum age was chosen based on national experience and a review of international practice.  It also had regard to the regulatory environment for early years care and education in this country and issues such as child development readiness and adult-child ratios.  The upper age limit will remain the same (i.e. a child is not eligible if they will be 5 years and 6 months before the end of the programme year).</p>  <p>  This new measure will address the previous situation with regard to three entry points whereby there was a broad fluctuation in the number of free preschool weeks a child could avail of &ndash;(between 61 and 88 weeks depending on the date of birth of the child) &ndash; and will ensure a programme that is equitable for all children.  As with any large scheme at national level, clear rules are required to ensure transparency and objectivity in administration.  It is a feature however of such schemes that where cut off points relate to age, some applicants benefit more than others. </p>  <p>  The number of entry points will revert to one at the beginning of September 2018.  One enrolment period at the start of the pre-school year will help streamline the administration process and will make it easier for childcare providers to operate and budget for the programme year.  This will also make it easier for parents to secure places on the ECCE programme for their children.</p>  <p>  A child will not be able to commence their ECCE in September 2018 if they will not have reached the age of 2 years and 8 months on or before 31st August 2018.  Their ECCE eligibility commences in 2019, and will continue for a further year from September 2020 until June 2021.  </p>  <p>  It must be noted that parents have the discretion to decide how much of ECCE to avail of for their child.  A decision may be made to utilise only one year of the programme for various reasons.  For example, some parents of children born in the first quarter of the year, as outlined by the Deputy, may prefer for their child to start school at 4 years of age rather than 5.  These parents may therefore opt for 1 year of ECCE only. </p>  <p>  The entry and exit points for ECCE for children with disabilities is currently being reviewed.  The National Disability Authority has conducted some research on the matter and has led a national consultation process with parents and providers.  It is due to report shortly.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Department of Education and Skills continue to work together to ensure that early years and school age education policies are consistent and meet the best interest of children.</p>  <p>  In terms of childcare costs, it should be noted that parents of children aged from 6 months to the age of eligibility for ECCE can avail of the new universal subsidy of up to &euro;1040 per year, introduced in 2017.</p></reply>

The BTEA is designed primarily to support second chance education.  </p>  <p>  Budget 2017 introduced a new &euro;500 annual cost of education allowance for parents, including lone parents, encouraging them into education by helping to reduce their childcare costs.  The cost of education allowance was made available to BTEA participants with children from the 2017/18 academic year. </p>  <p>  Based on the number of students in receipt of BTEA for the academic year 2017/18 the estimated cost of extending the cost of education allowance to all recipients would be some &euro;5.4 million. The number of participants on BTEA for this academic year was 10,840 (October 2017).  Any such changes would have to be considered in a budgetary context and within the scope of the overall resources available for welfare improvements. </p>  <p>  The BTEA is not intended to be an alternative form of funding for people entering or re-entering the third level education system. The Student Universal Support Ireland (SUSI) grant payable by the Department of Education and Skills represents the primary support for persons pursuing education.

The payment continues to be paid in respect of children up to their 18th birthday who are in full-time education, or who have a disability.  Child Benefit is currently paid to more than 631,000 families in respect of over 1.2 million children, with an estimated expenditure of more than &euro;2 billion in 2018. </p>  <p>  Based on Department of Education and Skills figures on the numbers of 18 and 19 year olds in full-time secondary education in 2017, the estimated annual cost of extending the upper age limit to include 18 and 19 year olds in full-time secondary education alone is in the region of &euro;65 million.  The estimated cost of providing a 25 percent and 50 percent payment of child benefit based on the cost above is &euro;16.25m and &euro;32.5m respectively.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy&rsquo;s question indicates no upper age limit and would therefore also include young people of 20 years and above, thus giving rise to costs in excess of this figure.</p>  <p>  Given the universal nature of Child Benefit, making it payable in respect of young people over 18 years of age for the duration of their enrolment in second-level education would not be a targeted approach.  Any adjustment to the payment can result in benefits being spread very thinly, rather than making a difference where there is most need.  </p>  <p>  Under EU regulations Child Benefit is defined as a family benefit and is exportable in cases where the claimant is working in Ireland but where the children are living abroad.  We have no way of predicting with any degree of accuracy the potential in-flow in this category for young people who turn 18 and remain in second level education in other Member States.</p></reply>

In any year about 85% of all claims are awarded and just 1% are appealed.Nevertheless, the Department is concerned that these cases are dealt with as quickly as possible.</p><p>The time taken to process an appeal reflects all aspects of the appeal process including time spent in the Department preparing the appeal submission.  The quasi-judicial nature of the appeals system means that there are inevitable time-lags involved.  The time taken is proportionate to the complexity of many of the issues under appeal which require a high level of judgement, and the need to ensure due process and natural justice.  The system is designed to be flexible and fair and allows for review and submission of further information at all stages which is to the benefit of the appellant. </p><p>Appeal processing times are kept under constant scrutiny by the Chief Appeals Officer.  Significant effort and resources have been devoted in recent years to reducing the length of the time taken to finalise an appeal.  As a result, appeal processing times improved between 2011 and 2017 from 52.5 weeks for an oral hearing in 2011 to 26.4 weeks in 2017 and from 25.1 weeks for a summary decision in 2011 to 19.8 weeks in 2017.

Firstly, a reversal of the amendments made to the OFP scheme could result in a cohort of lone parents that are currently not in receipt of a social welfare payment becoming eligible and therefore moving onto a social welfare payment.  As members of this cohort are not currently in receipt of a social welfare payment it would be difficult to for my Department to estimate the numbers involved. </p>  <p>  Secondly, some customers could seek to move from alternative payments such as Jobseekers Allowance (JA), the Jobseeker&rsquo;s Transitional Payment (JST) and the Back to Work Family Dividend (BTWFD) back to the OFP.  Again, it would be difficult for my Department to estimate the magnitude of this flow between schemes with any degree of accuracy. </p>  <p>  Finally, reversing the changes to the OFP would also increase the incidence of dual payments of OFP and the Working Family Payment (WFP).  It would not be possible to estimate the extent to which Working Family Payments might change, without having detailed knowledge of individuals&rsquo; working patterns and level of earnings.  </p>  <p>  These unknown factors are critical to providing a reliable costing.

The payment continues to be paid in respect of children up to their 18th birthday who are in full-time education, or who have a disability.  Child Benefit is currently paid to more than 631,000 families in respect of over 1.2 million children, with an estimated expenditure of more than &euro;2 billion in 2018. </p><p>It is not possible to give the full-year estimated cost of extending child benefit to all those in full-time education who are over 18 years of age because of the open ended nature of the question.  Based on Department of Education and Skills figures on the numbers of 18 and 19 year olds in full-time secondary education in 2017, the estimated annual cost of extending the upper age limit to include 18 and 19 year olds in full-time secondary education alone is in the region of &euro;65 million.  The Deputy&rsquo;s question, which seems to include people over 18 in third-level education, and indicates no upper limit as to age, would therefore give rise to costs substantially in excess of, and multiples of, this figure.</p><p>The student grant scheme, SUSI, is the main financial support for students in third-level education.  There is detailed information on the range of grants and funds for students in further and higher education on the website<i></i><i></i>including the Student Assistance Fund.  </p><p>Given the universal nature of Child Benefit, making it payable to persons in respect of children who are 18 years of age, or older people in full-time education, would not be a targeted approach.  Any adjustment to the payment can result in benefits being spread very thinly, rather than making a difference where there is most need.  </p><p>Under EU regulations Child Benefit is defined as a family benefit and is exportable in cases where the claimant is working in Ireland but where the children are living abroad.  We have no way of predicting with any degree of accuracy the potential in-flow in this category for children who turn 18 and remain in education in other Member States.</p></reply>

This began in January 2014 with the abolition of the State pension (transition) which was available to people aged 65 who satisfied the qualifying conditions.   This measure standardised the State pension age for all at 66 years.  This will increase to 67 in 2021 and to 68 in 2028.</p>  <p>  The purpose of these changes is to make the pension system more sustainable in the context of increasing life expectancy. This has significant implications for the future costs of State pension provision which are currently increasing by roughly &euro;1 billion every 5 years.  </p>  <p>  There is no statutory retirement age in the State, and the age at which employees retire is a matter for the contract of employment between them and their employers.  While such a contract may have been entered into with a retirement date of 65, in the context of the previous State pension arrangements, there is no legal impediment to the employer and employee agreeing to increase the duration of employment for one or more years, if both parties wish to do so.</p>  <p>  Where a person exits the workforce before reaching State pension age they may apply for either the jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit or jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance schemes.  Jobseeker&rsquo;s payments are paid to eligible jobseekers aged 18 to 66 years subject to the rules of the scheme. A decision to change the jobseekers schemes in the context of the increased pension age would be a matter for Government to consider in a budgetary context.</p>  <p>  Illness benefit is a payment made to insured people who; are unable to work due to illness; satisfy certain PRSI contribution conditions and are under pensionable age.  The legislative provision governing the qualifying age is covered under s.40(1)(a) of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 and a person is entitled to illness benefit where &ldquo;the person is under pensionable age on the day for which the benefit is claimed&rdquo;. There are no proposals to amend the wording in respect of the age requirement so a person would be entitled to illness benefit, subject to satisfying the other conditions in respect of illness and contributions conditions, until their entitlement to illness benefit exhausts or they reach pension age, whichever is earliest.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Self-employed persons, who earn &euro;5,000 or more in a contribution year, are liable for PRSI at the Class S rate of 4%, subject to a minimum annual payment of &euro;500.  The payment of Class S contributions entitles self-employed workers to a range of benefits including State pension (contributory).</p><p>The regulations governing the award of Class S social insurance prescribe that where a self-employed person is assessed as being liable for a compulsory insurance charge, the person is granted a full annual complement of 52 &lsquo;Class-S&rsquo; contributions for that tax year once the liability is discharged (irrespective of whether their self-employment was pursued throughout the year, or if it was just for a portion of the year).  Therefore, in a self-employed person&rsquo;s initial year of assessment of having an insurance liability, on payment of the due amount, the person will be recorded as having paid 52 weekly contributions for that year.</p><p>Where the self-employed discharge their combined Income Tax, USC and PRSI liability through Revenue&rsquo;s self-assessed system of collection, a single payment is made in respect of their combined liability for all complete tax years up to and including the year in which the self-employed worker reaches their 65th year. </p><p>As Revenue does not have the facility to collect a part of a year&rsquo;s PRSI liability in respect of the individual&rsquo;s 66th year, payment can be facilitated by the Department&rsquo;s Client Eligibility Services, Department of Employment Affairs &amp;amp; Social Protection, Government Buildings, Cork Road, Waterford. </p><p>Such additional (66th year) S Class contributions may be used, where necessary, to satisfy the &lsquo;minimum 520 paid contributions&rsquo; condition for State pension (contributory) eligibility, but cannot be used in the yearly-averaging assessment of pension rate entitlement, for which the cut-off point in totalling contributions is the end date of the immediately preceding (full) tax year.  This is exactly the same &lsquo;66th year&rsquo; approach that is facilitated in the case of standard employees (rather than self-employed) who may require some additional contributions to satisfy the &ldquo;520 contribution&rdquo; condition<b>.</b></p></reply>

They are not employees of my Department or public servants, and as such were not subject to pay reductions under the provisions of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (FEMPI) which only applied to public servants. </p>  <p>  While the motion called for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to meet with unions with a view to addressing the issue of CE supervisors&rsquo; pension provision, the issue is currently being examined by a Community Sector High Level Forum, chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. A number of Departments including my own Department are represented on this group, as are the unions and Pobal. </p>  <p>  A detailed scoping exercise was carried out with input from the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service (IGEES) on the potential costs of providing Exchequer support for the establishment of such a pension scheme for employees across the Community and Voluntary sector in Ireland. The exercise clearly illustrated that this matter presents very significant issues for the Exchequer, with a potential cost to the State of &euro;188 million per annum in respect of funding to enable an employer pension contribution in State funded </p>  <p>  Community and Voluntary organisations, excluding any provision for immediate ex-gratia lump sum payment of pension as sought, which could, depending on the size of the sector, entail a further Exchequer cost of up to &euro;318 million. </p>  <p>  I am very conscious that while the issue relates to Community Employment supervisors and assistant supervisors, such individuals comprise of just one small group within the wider Community and Voluntary sector. </p>  <p>  The Deputy should note that any provision of State funding for such a scheme in respect of those employees could potentially give rise to claims for similar schemes on the part of those in the broader sector, thus crystallising the potential level of liability.

Firstly there is the contributory principle.  Under this principle there is a direct link between the PRSI contributions that a person has paid and entitlement to a varying range of benefits and pensions.  Where a person has sufficient PRSI contributions, then benefits and pensions may be paid as of right, where a particular contingency arises and without a means test.</p>  <p>  Secondly there is the solidarity principle. Under this principle the benefits and pensions that are paid are not directly related to the amount of PRSI contributions paid by insured persons.  PRSI contribution income is instead redistributed to support contributors who are more vulnerable.</p>  <p>  In addition, there is a general principle of one person, one payment, which applies across the social welfare system.  Given the contingency-based nature of this system, it can happen that a person may experience more than one contingency at the same time and  he or she can receive only one of those payments.  This principle is common to social security systems across the world.</p>  <p>  There were a limited number of exceptions in the social insurance system to the general principle of one person, one payment.  These exceptions usually applied in the context of short-term benefits.  For instance, recipients of One-Parent Family Payment, Widows and Widowers Pensioners could, until recent years, also receive short-term social insurance benefits, such as Illness Benefit and Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit at half-rate at the same time.  These overlapping payment arrangements were introduced in the early 1950s when the social insurance system was first established, at a time when there were only 10 individual social welfare payments and when rates were significantly lower in real terms than they are now.  However, the social welfare system has been significantly developed over the intervening period, with the result that the number of possible combinations of concurrent contingencies has increased greatly.</p>  <p>  The concurrent payment of half-rate Illness Benefit and Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit in addition to One-Parent Family Payment, and Widows and Widowers Pensions was discontinued from January 2012, in the context of the Government&rsquo;s commitments to maintain existing core rates of primary payments for social welfare recipients. There are exceptions to this as in a case where a reduced Widows Pension is in payment and paid at a rate lower than the Illness Benefit Rate.

This proposal also allows for the option to claim for up to 20 years of a new HomeCaring credit.  This approach is expected to benefit many people, particularly women, whose work histories include extended period of time outside the paid workplace, while raising families or in a caring role.  It will make it easier for pensioners assessed under the yearly average model to qualify for a higher rate of state pension (contributory) by basing the pension decision on the totality of a person&rsquo;s social insurance contributions as opposed to the timing of those contributions during their working life. </p>  <p>  My Department will invite pensioners, who reached pension aged on or after 1 September 2012, to have their pensions reviewed and re-calculated under the alternative method to determine if they qualify for a higher rate of entitlement.  Currently work is underway to put the necessary legislative provisions in place to implement these arrangements, as well as the administrative processes and IT systems necessary to undertake these reviews of affected pensioners. Once these elements are in place, the Department will contact pensioners and invite them to participate in the review, with invitations proposed to issue from the end of 2018.</p>  <p>  Review applicants will be notified of the outcome of their review and any applicable higher rate of entitlement will be paid to them.  Where eligible, payments are expected to commence from early 2019.  Where an increase is awarded, it will be backdated to 30 March 2018.  It is not possible to anticipate outcomes in advance of a review in individual cases.   </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The report found that the changes made to the one-parent family payment scheme in 2012 increased employment and reduced welfare dependency.  It also found that the changes increased the probability of employment and higher employment income for lone parents.  The report also concluded that assisting lone parents to enhance skills needs to be seen as a key objective, as low paid employment will not, on its own, ensure a reduction in the risk of poverty.</p>  <p>  The review additionally highlighted a number of areas of concern: many of those who lost OFP remain unemployed, or are in low paid or part-time employment.  The balance of evidence indicates that there is an increased probability of being at risk of poverty as a result of the changes.  Further supports, aimed at assisting lone parents to obtain full-time employment or increased hours of work, need to be put in place.</p>  <p>  Continued economic recovery, together with Budget measures over recent years introduced as the economy began to work its way out of recession, are likely to have impacted positively on poverty rates since 2016 (the most recent available data) and since the period examined in the Indecon report.  This improvement is expected to continue over the coming years.  My Department&rsquo;s social impact assessments of Budgets 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 are an indicator of this improvement.  These show a cumulative increase of &euro;36.75 in the average weekly household income of employed lone parents (and &euro;33.60 for unemployed lone parents).  This compares favourably with a weekly increase of &euro;34.45 for the average household (given the impact of two-adult families on the average household figure).</p>  <p>  Budget 2018 measures that took effect from 29th March this year (specifically the increases to the income disregard, the primary rate and the increase for a qualified child) will assist a lone parent in receipt of the one-parent family payment or jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment, working 15 hours a week on the National Minimum Wage, to be better off by almost &euro;1,000 per year.</p>  <p>  We know that social transfers are very effective in reducing poverty and that Eurostat data shows that Ireland performs well in this regard.  But we also know that reducing poverty for lone parents is not just about income support.  The latest CSO Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC) for 2016 shows that being at work reduces the consistent poverty rate for lone parents by nearly two-thirds, highlighting that the best way to tackle poverty among lone parents is to assist them into employment.</p>  <p>  Our focus therefore, through the activation service provided by my Department, is on supporting lone parents to make the transition into employment and, at a cross-governmental level on assisting these families through the provision of quality services in areas including education, training and employment supports, and childcare.</p></reply>

This grant is not assessed as means by my Department.  Alternatively, they can opt to receive Back To Education Allowance (BTEA), which is paid at the same rate as their former payment. There are some differences between the options with regards to secondary benefits, so the individual can select the option that best suits their needs and circumstances.</p><p>Working Family Payment (WFP) is a tax-free weekly payment available to employees with children. It gives extra financial support to people on low pay. You must be an employee working 19 hours per week or more to qualify.</p><p>The scheme aims to help families to move from social welfare into employment. It gives financial support to people with qualified children who are in, or take up, employment or self-employment and as a result stop claiming a jobseeker's payment or a one-parent family payment.  Qualifying applicants receive a weekly payment for up to 2 years, equivalent to the increase for a qualified child that was being paid on their jobseeker or one-parent family payment (up to a maximum of 4 children) for the first year in employment.  Half that amount is paid weekly for the second year.</p><p>My Department&rsquo;s employment services also currently provide a case-managed approach to assist lone parents to make a personal plan to assist them to return to work or education.  For lone parents on JST, the engagement is a pro-active tailored support that can be available for up to seven years while JST is in payment.</p></reply>

WFP is designed to prevent in-work poverty for low paid workers with child dependants and to offer a financial incentive to take-up employment.</p><p>My Department regularly reviews its schemes to ensure that they continue to meet their policy objectives.  There have been a number of changes to the WFP Scheme since its introduction in 1984, which are summarised in the following table: these have included changes to the hours-worked eligibility criteria, increases in the income thresholds and a reduction in the WFP multiplier.</p><p>Specific reviews are as follows:</p><p>- A policy and value for money Review of Child Income Support and associated spending programmes, including WFP, was published in 2010.</p><p>- The Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare was established in June 2011, harnessing expert opinion and experience to examine a number of specific issues relating to the tax and welfare systems.  The Group produced a number of reports over the 2011-2013 period, and made proposals for improving employment incentives and achieving better poverty outcomes, particularly child poverty outcomes.</p><p>- In 2017 as part of the initial process of developing the Working Family Payment (WFP), the Department carried out an extensive analysis of the range of supports it provides, including the Working Family Payment, to assist individuals to take up and remain in employment.  This analysis showed that existing in-work supports are very effective and work well in assisting individuals to make the transition from unemployment into employment.</p><p>- Finally, the Social Welfare Act 2017 provides for a review of the operation of the Working Family Payment, including the requirement to work at least 19 hours per week, or 38 hours per fortnight, to be submitted to the Social Protection Committee.</p><p>WFP Developments 1984 &ndash; to date</p><p><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Development</th></tr><tr><td>1984</td><td>Scheme introduced to provide income support for employees on low earnings with children.</td></tr><tr><td>1986</td><td>Reduction in the minimum number of hours worked per week from 30 to 24.</td></tr><tr><td>1989</td><td>An increase in the multiplier from 50% to 60% of the gap between actual income and ceiling.

Scheme extended to co-habiting couples with children.</td></tr><tr><td>1996</td><td>A reduction in the minimum hours required to work from 20 a week to 38 a fortnight. Qualifying employment period reduced from 6 to 3 months.</td></tr><tr><td>1997</td><td>Method of calculating amount of WFP changed from gross income to net of PRSI contributions and health and employment levies.</td></tr><tr><td>1998</td><td>Method of calculating amount of WFP changed to net income pay after tax, levies and  superannuation.</td></tr><tr><td>2006</td><td>Refocusing of income thresholds to include additional gains for larger families.  Prior to 2006, weekly income thresholds were increased by a fixed amount regardless of family size.  This led to a bias in favour of smaller families.  Budget 2006 and subsequent budgets concentrated additional resources on larger families. </td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>Budget 2012 provided for the inclusion of income from weekly carers payments for the purposes of calculating entitlement to WFP in line with other welfare payments (introduced over a three year period).  Budget 2012 also provided for the inclusion of income from employment as a home help in the WFP income assessment.</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>Social Welfare legislation generally precludes changing the WFP rate within the 52 week payment period, except in the case of an increase for an additional child.  However in light of the changes to the One-parent Family Payment (OFP) regulations were introduced in July 2013 as an exceptional measure, to enable entitlement to WFP to be reviewed so that former OFP recipients in receipt of FIS will have their WFP payment increased in light of the termination of their OFP due to the age of the youngest child.  The WFP payment will be adjusted solely to take account of the loss of OFP income and other changes in income will not affect the rate of WFP within the original 52 week award period. </td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>Budget 2016 increased the Working Family Payment income thresholds by &euro;5 for families with one child and &euro;10 for families with two or more children.</td></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>Budget 2018 increased the Working Family Payment earnings thresholds by &euro;10 per week for families with up to three children.  The name of the Family Income Supplement was also changed to the Working Family Payment to better reflect the nature of the payment</td></tr></table></p></reply>

In arriving at this yearly average, disregards for home-making periods were applied and the person concerned qualified for a reduced rate state pension (contributory).  The person was notified in writing of this decision on 11 June 2018.</p>  <p>  Earlier this year the Government announced a proposal that will give pensioners affected by the 2012 changes in state pension (contributory) rate bands the option to have their pension entitlement reviewed and entitlement re-examined under an alternative Total Contributions Approach.  This proposal also allows for the option to claim for up to 20 years of a new HomeCaring credit.  This approach is expected to benefit many people, particularly women, whose work histories include extended period of time outside the paid workplace, while raising families or in a caring role.  It will make it easier for pensioners assessed under the yearly average model to qualify for a higher rate of state pension (contributory) by basing the pension decision on the totality of a person&rsquo;s social insurance contributions as opposed to the timing of those contributions during their working life. </p>  <p>  My Department will invite pensioners, who reached pension aged on or after 1 September 2012, to have their pensions reviewed and re-calculated under the alternative method to determine if they qualify for a higher rate of entitlement.  Currently work is underway to put the necessary legislative provisions in place to implement these arrangements, as well as the administrative processes and IT systems necessary to undertake these reviews of affected pensioners. Once these elements are in place, the Department will contact pensioners and invite them to participate in the review, with invitations proposed to issue from the end of 2018.</p>  <p>  Review applicants will be notified of the outcome of their review and any applicable higher rate of entitlement will be paid to them.  Payments are expected to commence from early 2019.  Where an increase is awarded, it will be backdated to 30 March 2018.  </p>  <p>  The person concerned may wish to make an application for a means tested state pension (non-contributory) as depending on the person&rsquo;s circumstances, they may qualify for a higher rate of entitlement. An application form has issued to the person concerned and their entitlement will be assessed on return of the completed form.

They are not employees of my Department or public servants, and as such were not subject to pay reductions under the provisions of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (FEMPI) which only applied to public servants. </p>  <p>  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DEPER) is the lead Department in addressing the entitlement of CE supervisors to occupational pensions.  It is currently being examined by a Community Sector High Level Forum, chaired by DPER.  A number of Departments including my own Department are represented on this group, as are the Unions and Pobal.</p>  <p>  A detailed scoping exercise was carried out with input from the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service (IGEES) on the potential costs of providing Exchequer support for the establishment of such a pension scheme for employees across the Community and Voluntary sector in Ireland.  The exercise clearly illustrated that this matter presents very significant issues for the Exchequer, with a potential cost to the State of &euro;188 million per annum in respect of funding to enable an employer pension contribution in State funded Community and Voluntary organisations, excluding any provision for immediate ex-gratia lump sum payment of pension as sought, which could, depending on the size of the sector, entail a further Exchequer cost of up to &euro;318 million.</p>  <p>  I am very conscious that while the issue relates to Community Employment supervisors and assistant supervisors, such individuals comprise of just one small group within the wider Community and Voluntary sector. Any provision of State funding for such a scheme in respect of those employees could potentially give rise to claims for similar schemes on the part of those in the broader sector, thus crystallising the potential level of liability.  Any solution to this issue will require careful consideration, in particular the implications for scarce Exchequer resources. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

The system provides for the filling of certain posts (at Grade IV to VII level) by competition confined to employees of Local Authorities, the Health Service Executive, Education and Training Boards, Institutes of Technology and certain other health and local government agencies. Issues in relation to the common recruitment pool were addressed in the Social Partnership Agreement &ldquo;Sustaining Progress&rdquo; when the social partners agreed to conduct a cross-sectoral review of recruitment issues pertinent to the grades concerned including the issue of greater accessibility and the introduction of a graduate entry level.</p>  <p>  The recommendations of the Review Group established to review the issues were reflected in the discussions and agreement reached on the successor social partnership agreement &ldquo;Towards 2016&rdquo; concluded by the social partners. The &ldquo;Towards 2016&rdquo; Agreement provided for the implementation of arrangements whereby 20% of the posts at Grades V to VII and 50% of posts at Grade IV would be filled by open competition.  Specialist posts would continue to be filled by open competition only. Posts above Grade VII are also filled by open competition. Under the &ldquo;Towards 2016&rdquo; Agreement the implementation of the provisions regarding the common recruitment pool (CRP) is a matter for each relevant sector where the pool operates.</p>  <p>  Recently, the Health and Education members of the CRP withdrew their membership of the pool.  On foot of a request from my Department, the Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) is currently reviewing the CRP with a view to engaging with Public Sector Unions on a revised arrangement.

Against that background, it is proposed to establish a National Regeneration and Development Agency to assist in ensuring a more effective approach to strategic land management, particularly in terms of publicly owned land.</p>  <p>  The Agency will act as a national centre of expertise, working with and supporting local authorities, public bodies and other interests, to harness public lands as catalysts to stimulate regeneration and wider investment and to achieve compact, sustainable growth, with a particular emphasis on complex regeneration projects and the provision of affordable housing.</p>  <p>  Detailed arrangements in relation to the functions, powers and mechanisms and legislative arrangements for the establishment of the Agency are currently being developed by my Department, in conjunction with the Department of An Taoiseach and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, with a view to their early finalisation.

Harnessing the off-balance sheet potential of private investment in social housing is an important objective of the Government and the social housing targets set out in Rebuilding Ireland over the period to 2021 reflect the ambition in that regard. </p><p>Of the 50,000 social housing homes to be delivered under Rebuilding Ireland, 10,000 are targeted to be leased by local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) under leasing arrangements from a range of different sources, including 3,500 homes targeted using the Repair and Lease Scheme (RLS), and 6,500 homes using a combination of the existing social housing leasing arrangements, and the new Enhanced Lease Scheme.  All homes delivered under leasing arrangements, including a new Enhanced Leasing Scheme, will be funded under the Department&rsquo;s Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP).  </p><p>It is intended that up to 2,000 units will be leased by Local Authorities in 2018 through a combination of the existing Long Term Leasing arrangements, the Repair and Leasing Scheme and the new Enhanced Leasing Scheme.</p><p>The new Enhanced Leasing Scheme has been developed by my Department, together with the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA), the Housing Agency and local authorities, in order to harness the potential of private sector interest in social housing delivery in a new set of long-term leasing arrangements, in a manner designed to leverage off-balance sheet funding opportunities in accordance with Rebuilding Ireland objectives.  The new Scheme is targeted at new build or new to the market properties to be delivered at scale and will complement the existing long-term leasing arrangements, which will continue to be available.  There are, however, a number of key differences between the existing long term lease and the enhanced lease, the purpose of which is to facilitate larger levels of private investment in social housing while ensuring that the capital investment is off balance sheet in respect of Government expenditure. </p><p>The scheme will be governed by my Department and operated by local authorities.  The Housing Agency will manage and administer the scheme on behalf of my Department and will act as a national co-ordinator. </p><p>A call for proposals was launched on 31 January 2018 and the Housing Agency accepted submissions from interested parties until 12 April 2018. All proposals are subject to a range of criteria as set out in the &ldquo;Calls for Proposals for Enhanced Long Term Social Housing Leasing Scheme&rdquo; and the proposals will be assessed and marked in accordance with the terms set out therein. The Call for Proposals is available on the Housing Agency website at the following .</p><p>A total of 33 submissions were received from interested parties which represents strong interest from the market. The Housing Agency is currently reviewing the proposals. Of those assessed, 14 proposals were returned on the grounds that they did not meet certain minimum qualifying criteria, 4 proposals did not pass suitability or appropriateness tests and 1 proposal has been withdrawn by the proposer.  Following detailed requests for additional information from the proposer, I understand that 9 proposals were deemed incomplete by the Housing Agency and will not be proceeding.  The remaining 5 Proposals are in the assessment process which I am hopeful will be complete shortly. </p><p>Detailed information with respect to the numbers and locations of the units proposed for leasing under the Scheme will only be available once the individual proposals have been assessed, marked and accepted in accordance with the terms and methodology set out in the Calls for Proposals document and the respective Local Authorities have signed any Agreements for Lease arising.</p></reply>

Working with the broader Housing and Planning Divisions in my Department, other key agencies, local authorities and the construction sector, the HDO supports the roll-out of complex projects, including identifying and resolving barriers to delivery, and monitors progress across key sites as they progress. </p>  <p>  At the time of its establishment, the HDO comprised a team of 4 people with extensive expertise in project management, finance, planning and local government, including staff seconded from the local government sector and the National Development Finance Agency. Having carried out a range of initial initiatives, and taking account of the fact that some assignments to the office were time-limited, the HDO was refocused in September 2017 to work more closely on supporting local housing delivery and land management. In that context, the current team of 3, with service ranging from 3 to 22 months, works closely with the extensive range of highly experienced officers within the wider housing and planning areas of my Department and local authorities, across key disciplines such as architecture, planning, engineering and building control, project and construction management, quantity surveying, capital programme delivery and administration. As with all critical areas of activity in my Department, the resources available to the HDO are kept under regular review in the context of ongoing evolution of the Office's role and, in that context, I expect additional resources to be assigned to the Office in the coming months.</p></reply>

The making or amending of such schemes is not a reserved function and does not require the approval of the elected members; however, it is subject to the influence of the elected members through the annual estimates process.  The Chief Executive of the authority makes the (non-statutory) rent scheme subject to broad principles laid down by my Department in Circular letter HRT 3/2002 dated March 6th 2002.  </p>  <p>  I assume the Deputy is referring to Section 31 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 which is not yet commenced. Section 31(7) of the Act provides that the making and revocation of a rent scheme are reserved functions. Section 31(8) provides that the charging of rents or other charges in accordance with a rent scheme are executive functions. </p>  <p>  Considerable work has been carried out by my Department in developing a draft national differential rents framework under section 31 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009. Such a framework had as its main aim the facilitation of a significant harmonisation in local authority rents, including a set of standardised income disregards, whilst retaining the general principle of rents related to household income.</p>  <p>  The introduction of a rent framework could mean that the amount of rent payable by some households may be subject to change. This work is now being examined further in the light of the broader commitment given in the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, to review the disparate systems of differential rent for social housing in place across local authorities. The overall objective is to ensure that housing supports are fair and sustainable, prioritise those on lowest incomes and avoid creating social welfare traps that may prevent people from either returning to work or to the private housing market.</p>  <p>  I expect that the review will be completed in the near future.</p></reply>

The manner in which the allocation process is managed including allowing prospective tenants to view properties being offered is a matter for the relevant local authority concerned. My understanding is that currently the approach varies across the country.</p>  <p>  As part of the broader social reform policy framework the Social Housing Allocation (Amendment) Regulations 2016 were made on 30th September 2016, and required all local authorities, if they had not already done so, to provide for Choice Based Letting (CBL) as a method of allocation in their allocation schemes by 31 December 2016. Where a local authority, having included a provision on CBL in its allocation scheme, decides to operate a CBL scheme, it must implement it in accordance with Regulations 6 &ndash; 11 of the 2011 Regulations.  Decisions on which properties are to be included under a CBL scheme is a matter for individual authorities.</p>  <p>  CBL is a method, whereby available social housing is let by being openly advertised, allowing qualified applicants to 'bid' for or 'register an interest' in available homes.  Applicants have to act on their own initiative to respond to adverts and bid for dwellings that they would like to live in, rather than waiting for an authority to offer a dwelling. </p>  <p>  This approach offers more choice and involvement for applicant households in selecting a new home, thereby reducing the likelihood of a refusal, and helping to build sustainable tenancies and stable communities. In order to improve responses to CBL, authorities have been asked to consider putting in place a process to allow bidders to view the property. </p>  <p>  My Department is committed to monitoring the roll-out of CBL across all Local Authorities and will continue to liaise with them over the course of the second half of the year, with a view to ensuring that CBL is implemented, as widely as possible, across the country.</p></reply>

The publication of the NTICI report will be of value to local authorities and other stakeholders in applying the lessons from the pilot authorities, in a more general roll-out of a streamlined approach to taking-in-charge. I expect that the initiative will contribute to further streamlining of the taking-in-charge process, through, for example, securing coordination with capital works by Irish Water. </p>  <p>  In addition, the recently published National Development Plan includes provision of &euro;31 million for the period 2018-2021 for DPI.  This is clear evidence of the Government's commitment to transition from the pilot phase under NTICI to a programme phase, commencing with an estimates provision of &euro;3m in 2018 on which further details will be announced in due course.</p></reply>

The full conditions for eligibility under the scheme are set out in the scheme which is available on the Board&rsquo;s website, www.pyriteboard.ie. </p><p>The scheme is applicable to dwellings, which are subject to significant damage attributable to pyritic heave established, in accordance with I.S. 398-1:2017 - Reactive pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material &ndash; Part 1: Testing and categorisation protocol.  In this regard, it is a condition of eligibility under the scheme that an application to the Board must be accompanied by a Building Condition Assessment with a Damage Condition Rating of 2.  Dwellings which do not have a Damage Condition Rating of 2 are not eligible to apply under the scheme.  This ensures that, having regard to the available resources, the focus of the scheme is on dwellings which are most severely damaged by pyritic heave.  I have no proposals to amend this eligibility criterion.</p><p>Where a dwelling, otherwise not eligible for inclusion in the scheme, adjoins a dwelling already included in the scheme, such a dwelling may be considered in accordance with the exceptional circumstance provisions set out in section 17 of the Act. Section 17 provides that exceptional circumstances may apply where -</p><p>- failure to include a dwelling in the scheme may result in damage to that dwelling or damage to the dwelling being remediated under the scheme, or</p><p>- pyrite remediation work is causing or may cause damage to a dwelling.</p><p>The Housing Agency will consider if exceptional circumstances apply when the Remedial Works Plan is being drawn up and the Board will be informed of any recommendation for a decision in the matter.  To date, no dwellings have been included in the pyrite remediation scheme under the exceptional circumstances provisions of the Act. </p><p>My Department is in regular contact with the Board and the Housing Agency in relation to the implementation of the scheme and is satisfied with the arrangements that are currently in place, including in relation to appeals.</p><p>The latest figures available indicate that a total of 2,107 applications have been received under the pyrite remediation scheme.  Of the 2,107 applications received so far, 1,656 dwellings have been included in the scheme and the applicants notified accordingly.</p><p>A further 87 applications have been validated and referred to the Housing Agency for the Assessment and Verification Process, while another 233 applications are at the initial Application and Validation Process. 131 applications under the scheme were not successful.</p><p>Of the 1,656 dwellings that have been included in the pyrite remediation scheme:</p><p>- 217 are at remedial works planning stage, </p><p>- 43 are at tender / tender analysis,</p><p>- 269 are under remediation, and  </p><p>- 1,127 are complete. </p><p>A sum of &euro;30 million was announced under Budget 2018 to fund the operation of the pyrite remediation scheme this year. This allocation will facilitate the remediation of some 430 additional dwellings and is a clear signal of the continuing importance attached by Government to addressing the issue of significant pyritic damage in private dwellings. </p><p>Ultimately, the Pyrite Resolution Board, together with the Housing Agency, will arrange for all eligible dwellings to be remediated to a high standard and at no additional cost to the affected homeowners. Remediation works will continue to be carried out at the earliest possible opportunity having regard to the existing demands of the scheme and the optimum use of available resources.</p></reply>

The funding is designed to leverage a greater proportion of residential and commercial development, supported by infrastructure, services and amenities, within the existing built-up areas of our larger urban settlements.  </p>  <p>  My Department has responsibility for implementing the URDF, which has an allocation of &euro;2 billion over the 10-year period of the National Development Plan (NDP) to 2027, with &euro;100 million available for expenditure in 2019 and an overall allocation of &euro;550 million earmarked for the Fund up to the end of 2022.</p>  <p>  On 3rd July, I announced the first call for proposals under the URDF.  The application process will run until end-September 2018.  The Fund will operate on a competitive, bid-based Exchequer grant basis, with proposals being required to demonstrate that they will be: </p>  <p>  -  Innovative and transformational urban regeneration projects;</p>  <p>  -  Public-sector led and with the option of community and/or private sector partners; </p>  <p>  -  Matched by at least 25% direct funding from other public and/or private sources;</p>  <p>  -  A minimum bid of &euro;2m;</p>  <p>  -  A catalyst for development that would not otherwise occur; and</p>  <p>  -  Likely to leverage significant further public and private sector investment.</p>  <p>  This Fund has enormous potential to deliver more affordable homes as part of the redevelopment and revitalisation of urban core areas,  and my Department would welcome proposals addressing measures to improve housing affordability, in addition to a range of proposal types in the context of urban regeneration and development. I would urge eligible public sector organisations to avail of the opportunity through collaboration and making best use of the skills and talent available to design creative and innovative proposals.  </p>  <p>  The information seminar which my Department organised yesterday, 9 July 2018, and which I attended, was aimed at providing some policy context and more detailed guidance  on the Fund for potential lead partners from Local Authorities, Regional Assemblies and Government Departments and to provide clarity on any queries arising, to ensure that we can maximise the potential of the available funding to help meet the National Strategic Objectives set down in the NPF, both in 2019 and over subsequent years.  I am greatly encouraged by the level of engagement and interest of all who attended and I look forward to seeing funding applications for proposals that are innovative, ambitious and collaborative and that are capable to delivering on the key objectives.</p>  <p>  My Department will monitor the process in relation to the Fund and will consider the issue of further guidance in light of the level of queries that may emerge throughout the application period.  My Department will also consider facilitating further information-sharing events with local authorities and other stakeholders over the summer months, as appropriate.</p>  <p>  Detailed information on the URDF and the application process can be viewed at the following links: www.gov.ie/urdf and www.npf.ie.</p></reply>

In this regard, I have recently commenced the relevant provisions of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, the effect of which is to place the new scheme for affordable purchase on a statutory footing. My Department, in consultation with the Housing Agency and the local government sector, is currently finalising the associated regulations and guidance. It is envisaged that the delivery and allocation of affordable homes, funded under the SSF, will be administered under the provisions of the 2009 Act.</p>  <p>  The ambition of local authorities should not be limited to affordable purchase, however. Recognising that it is often those households renting in the main urban areas that face the greatest affordability challenge, the development of a viable cost rental sector is a key Government objective. A cost rental model is being developed by my Department, the Housing Agency, relevant local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies in the context of a number of pilot cost rental projects, and the findings and outcomes of this model will provide the template to develop further projects at scale.</p></reply>

Recognising that people want a choice of affordable purchase and rental, depending on their stage of life and circumstances, a range of initiatives are being progressed, targeting the delivery of more affordable homes to households generally with maximum income of &euro;50,000 for single applicants and &euro;75,000 for joint applicants.</p>  <p>  In order to underpin progress in this area, I have now commenced the relevant provisions of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, the effect of which is to place the new scheme for affordable purchase on a statutory footing. The associated detailed regulations and guidance are close to finalisation in consultation with the Housing Agency and local authorities. </p>  <p>  An allocation scheme (of priority) will be developed in local authorities, agreed by the elected members, in accordance with principles and qualifying parameters set out in the Regulations.</p>  <p>  I am also determined that cost rental homes become a major part of our rental landscape in the future. It is clear that there is a gap between social housing and the rental market that needs to be filled, making a sustainable impact on housing affordability, national competitiveness, and the attractiveness of our main urban centres as places to live and work.</p>  <p>  The Housing Agency, Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council and a number of Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) have been working to get our first cost rental pilot, at Enniskerry Road, ready for tenders to issue shortly. In parallel, Dublin City Council, my Department and the National Development Finance Agency are undertaking detailed modelling and financial appraisal on a major site, at St. Michael&rsquo;s Estate in Inchicore, to assess its suitability for a significant cost rental development. The work of that multi-disciplinary team is progressing well and should be concluded shortly. </p></reply>

The Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2017 prescribe the minimum standards for rental accommodation for all rental accommodation, with very limited exemptions.  Matters prescribed under these Regulations include structural repair, fire safety, sanitary facilities, ventilation and safety of gas, oil and electricity supply.</p>  <p>  All landlords are legally obliged to comply with these Regulations.  Enforcement of the Regulations is a matter for individual housing authorities, whose extensive powers range from inspections in order to ensure compliance with minimum requirements to the application of sanctions, up to and including prosecution in the District Court.  Any person who believes a landlord is in breach of the Regulations can report the matter to the relevant local authority. </p>  <p>  As regards the long-standing statutory provision to the effect that planning permission is not required for development of land commenced before 1 October 1964, I have no proposals to change this provision in respect of any particular class of development.</p></reply>

Ireland&rsquo;s most recent report in 2013 included a comprehensive assessment of the range, population status, habitat and threats for the Irish hare. The report can be downloaded at www.npws.ie/article-17-reports-0/article-17-reports-2013. The next report is due in 2019. </p>  <p>  The 2013 report stated that the Hare is found throughout the country from coastal habitats to upland heath and bog. The Hare is widespread and common in Ireland with a broad habitat niche. None of the identified threats are considered likely to impact on its conservation status in the foreseeable future and the Overall Conservation Status was assessed as Favourable. My Department is not aware of any expert reports which indicate a national decline in the population of hares. </p>  <p>  In addition to the reporting requirements of the EU Habitats Directive, data on the distribution of the hare is being collected continuously by the National Biodiversity Data Centre and the recent Atlas of Mammals in Ireland 2010-2015 provided a summary of the species&rsquo; range, demonstrating that it remains widespread across the country. </p>  <p>  My Department recently commissioned a new assessment of the status of hare&rsquo;s population in Ireland. The survey work to inform this population assessment has already begun with the main survey work to occur over the 2018/19 winter period. The final report is due in mid-2019.</p>  <p>  In relation to hare coursing meetings, the recent 2017/18 hare coursing season finished at the end of February last.  All reports in relation to the season will be considered in the context of licenses for the 2018/19 coursing season.</p></reply>

ANIAR Ecology were appointed by my Department to undertake the review following a public tendering process.  My Department has received a draft of the final report from the consultants and following consideration of the draft report by my Department the final report will be concluded.</p>  <p>  An interim report was received from the consultants in April, which included recommendations in respect of the derogation process, including in relation to the 2018/19 declarations. The consultants indicate in their interim report that the inclusion of gulls in the derogation is challenging in terms of compliance with the Birds Directive on the basis of their view that an analysis of other possible solutions needs to be set out and reviewed, the status of the herring gull is unfavourable and the effects of mitigation actions taken on the gull species concerned are not measurable.  While the inclusion of gulls in the derogation was limited to the Balbriggan area only for a limited trial period and does not involve the actual culling of gulls, I will take full account of the consultants' views in the context of future derogations and following consideration of the consultants final report, a draft of which has been sent to my Department.</p>  <p>  My Department has received representations from the local community group referred to in relation to the interim report. This report has already been published on the website of the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department.</p>  <p>  Following consideration of the consultants' final report, my Department will engage with relevant stakeholders.  </p>  <p>  The ultimate statutory authority on the derogations resides with me.</p></reply>
