I reintroduced the LIS in September 2017 and since then have allocated  &euro;48 million to the Scheme.</p><p>I have also provided &euro;1.4 million under the CL&Aacute;R Programme for Supports for Mobility and Cancer Care Transport.</p><p>My Department also continues to provide funding for projects such as trails and blueways that may help connect rural towns and villages across the country under the Outdoor Recreation Infrastructure Scheme.</p><p>The &euro;1 billion Rural Regeneration and Development Fund is currently open for applications and will consider applications for funding for the development of community or public facilities infrastructure including improvements to roads, bridges and car parking facilities but only in the context of wider rural regeneration projects.</p><p>Additionally, my Department is the coordinating Department in respect of the Action Plan for Rural Development. This all of Government Plan for rural Ireland contains a number of actions relating to improvements in transport services, the majority of which are delivered by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and agencies under their aegis.</p><p>We are now looking towards the next phase of rural development policy.

It was inspiring at these events to hear from people who have used Government supports to improve the quality of life in their communities. Government funding is being used to create jobs, develop community facilities and tourism offerings and generally improve quality of life for those in rural communities.  </p>  <p>  The response to these events has been overwhelmingly positive to date and my hope is that individuals and communities will be encouraged to take their own ideas or projects forward.  </p>  <p>  I want to do all I can to help communities access the funding that is available. I therefore asked my Department to review the applications process for a number of funding programmes to ensure it is understandable and fit for purpose.</p>  <p>  I also know that there are some groups or community organisations that may not have considered seeking funding because they don&rsquo;t have the experience of submitting funding applications or lack understanding of the criteria in place. </p>  <p>  To help these groups, I am currently running a series of 'Helping Hands' events nationwide to make groups more aware of funding programmes, and to provide practical guidance on making applications. The fifth event was in Tullamore yesterday evening and the final event takes place in Darndale, in Dublin, tomorrow.</p>  <p>  These events provide hints and tips on how to make a better funding application and how to identify local supports that community groups can draw upon.</p>  <p>  My hope is that these events and other ongoing measures will ensure that our funding has the broadest possible reach and that all eligible groups have the opportunity to access available supports.</p></reply>

The programme helps community groups to improve facilities in their area. It supports a range of investment in all areas of communities, such as childcare facilities, playgrounds, recreational facilities, sports grounds, landscaping projects, and supports for the elderly. </p><p>in 2018, there was a huge level of interest in the programme right across the country following its launch.  So I was delighted to be in a position to allocate additional once-off funding to the programme later in the year and the final amount allocated was &euro;13 million.  This included &euro;0.5 million that was ring-fenced for Men's Sheds.</p><p>Over 3,000 projects across the country were funded, all of them targeted at enhancing facilities in disadvantaged communities. </p><p>In March of this year, I launched the 2019 programme with funding of &euro;4.5m, the same amount that was initially provided in 2018.  The 2019 funding has been allocated and the allocations to each local authority can be found on my Department's website.</p><p>If savings elsewhere in the Department are identified as the year progresses, I will consider additional funding for the Community Enhancement Programme.</p></reply>

This changed the capital allocation in 2019 from &euro;55 million to &euro;52 million under the Fund.</p>  <p>  The RRDF supports ambitious and strategic multi-annual projects which contribute to sustainable rural regeneration and development. There will not be any adverse impact on the delivery of projects supported by the Fund and it remains the case that &euro;315 million will be invested through the Fund over the period 2019 to 2021. </p>  <p>  The decision by Government to approve the appointment of a preferred bidder for the National Broadband Plan has not impacted on any programmes or projects being funded by my Department.</p></reply>

At the end of April 2019, 1,867 projects were approved for funding of over &euro;64.3 million. This represents a three-fold increase in project approvals since December 2017.</p>  <p>  A further 403 LEADER projects with a value of &euro;25.4 million were at earlier stages of the approvals process.

The Government has committed &euro;1 billion over 10 years to the Fund and &euro;315 million is allocated to the Fund for the period 2019-2022.  My Department has allocated &euro;52 million from the Fund to support the RRDF projects in 2019.</p>  <p>  The first call for applications for the Fund closed at the end of September.  There were 280 applications submitted to the first call.  126 applications related to Category 1, "shovel ready" projects.  154 related to Category 2 projects, those which needed development funding to become potential Category 1 applications in future calls for applications.</p>  <p>  In November 2018, I announced the first set of 18 successful Category 1 projects.  These 18 projects will receive &euro;24.4m in funding and have an overall value of &euro;34.6m.  In February 2019, I announced another 20 successful Category 1 projects and 46 Category 2 projects.  These 66 projects will receive &euro;62m in funding and have a total project value of &euro;83m.  Overall, the first call from the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund will provide &euro;86m in support for projects worth &euro;117m.   </p>  <p>  To ensure the prompt delivery of projects, my Department has drawn up contractual obligations for successful applicants with funding based on the achievement of key milestones in the projects.  In that regard, while there has been no drawdown from the Fund to date though I am pleased that a number of the projects are approaching the completion of their first key milestone.  </p>  <p>  I launched the second call for applications to the Fund in April 2019.  This current call is open to Category 1, shovel-ready, applications only and the closing date is 12 noon on Tuesday, 6th August 2019.  A further call for Category 2 applications will follow in October.  Information on the requirements of the second call are on the gov.ie website and information sessions to assist potential applicants will be held by my Department.</p></reply>

Cappoquin, Co Waterford</p><p>Funding of up to &euro;100,000 is being made available to each of these towns to develop proposals to encourage town centre living.  This funding will be used by the Local Authorities to engage with communities and local businesses, and identify practical solutions to increase the number of people living in their town centres.  It is envisaged that the solutions identified could lead to the development of more substantive proposals for funding from the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund in due course. </p><p>I expect to receive a report from each of the relevant Local Authorities in the next month on the progress which they have made so far.  The lessons learnt through this pilot initiative can help to inform our approach to supporting and investing in rural towns and villages in the future.</p></reply>

A new roster was put in place in January 2019 following a Call for Volunteers which issued in July 2018.</p>  <p>  To date in 2019 members of that roster have participated in election observation missions in El Salvador, Nigeria, North Macedonia, Malawi, Moldova, Senegal and Ukraine. Roster members are also being nominated to participate in the forthcoming OSCE Election Observation Missions in Albania and Kazakhstan.</p>  <p>  39 observers have participated in these missions. This comprises 2 Long Term Observers and 37 Short Term Observers. The total cost to the Department to date is &euro;110,704.09. This cost represents the flight costs for OSCE missions, OSCE mission costs shared per observer contributing States which cover in-country costs such as drivers, fuel, interpreters, meals and accommodation, and the pre-departure expenses of &euro;600 which are paid to every observer who participates in a mission once in a 12 month period. This payment covers the cost of pre-departure medical visits, vaccinations, transport costs to the airport of departure, where relevant pre-departure hotel accommodation costs and other miscellaneous expenses.</p>  <p>  While serving members of staff of the Department are not excluded from applying to be members of the roster, they are not considered to be eligible for nomination to an overseas election observer mission while in the employ of the Department. One non-established member of staff was mustered to the current roster, but will not be considered eligible for nomination to a mission until a short-term contract of employment with the Department expires. </p>  <p>  Separately, the Director of a regional or thematic unit in the Department can nominate a desk officer from that unit to participate in a mission where it is directly relevant to their area of work. This would be an additional nomination to the roster nominations and these officials do not receive pre-departure expenses, which are only paid to roster members. For example, the First Secretary responsible for bilateral relations with Ukraine participated in the recent OSCE-ODIHR Election Observation in Ukraine. No other member of the Department's staff has participated in a mission to date in 2019.</p>  <p>  It remains my intention that the names of the members of the new roster, and the names of those who participated in missions to date in 2019, will be released once security vetting is complete. Under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the Department cannot disclose the personal data of any member of the election observation roster without their specific, informed, unambigious and freely-given consent. There is of course a public interest in disclosing the names of roster members. For this reason, as roster members are being trained, the Department is seeking the consent of individual roster members to allow publication of the names of those on the current roster once security vetting is complete. This process is ongoing.</p>  <p>  Where a roster member with a disability requests that a reasonable accommodation be made to enable their participation in a mission, the Department&rsquo;s Elections Desk would liaise with the EU or OSCE-ODIHR, as appropriate, to see whether the arrangement could be facilitated, while also taking into account logistical, accommodation and security challenges on the ground.  No reasonable accommodation has been requested by any of those nominated thus far from the current roster.</p></reply>

My Department continually analyses short and medium-term macroeconomic trends in the European and international economy. This includes informing me of the latest forecasts of the global economy, and of our key trading partners from the international institutions.</p><p>The OECD Economic Outlook Report, published on 21 May 2019, shows a marked deterioration in the external environment. Global GDP growth slowed sharply in late 2018 and early 2019, and is stabilising at a lower level. The OECD is forecasting global growth to be 3.2 per cent this year before increasing slightly to 3.4 per cent in 2020. </p><p>Within the EU, the principal concerns at the present juncture relate to the timing and nature of Brexit, and the continued moderation of growth, which the OECD expects to remain subdued at 1.2 per cent in 2019 and 1.4 per cent in 2020.</p><p>The OECD project Ireland's economy to continue to grow strongly at 3.9 per cent this year, and 3.3 per cent in 2020. On this basis, although the pace of growth is easing, Ireland&rsquo;s growth is set to remain above the Euro Area average. These forecasts are in line with my Department&rsquo;s latest macroeconomic outlook, published in the <i>Stability Programme Update 2019</i>last month. </p><p>Escalating trade conflicts are negatively affecting the growth outlook in all countries. The key issue for Europe and the world economy is to safeguard the open, rules-based, global trading system which has been associated with raising living standards throughout the world. </p><p>Ireland, as a highly open, export focused, economy is particularly sensitive to a slowdown in world trade and overall economic growth. The slowing world growth momentum and the implications for Ireland&rsquo;s economy, underline the importance of improving the resilience of the economy by building fiscal buffers and focussing on productivity and competitiveness. </p><p>The OECD Economic Outlook notes that the Government should remain committed to improving the public finances, but that it should stand ready to mitigate disruptive consequences if significant risks materialise, such as a disorderly conclusion of the Brexit negotiations. Government policy is consistent with this objective. The forthcoming Summer Economic Statement will set out the broad parameters for macroeconomic growth, the fiscal outlook and constraints over the medium term in advance of this Autumn&rsquo;s Budget.</p></reply>

Limerick, was one of 300 areas that were believed to be at significant flood risk, and hence assessed as part of the Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme, the largest ever flood risk study carried out in the State.  The CFRAM Programme culminated with the launch of 29 Flood Risk Management Plans on 3 May 2018, and proposed 118 new outline flood relief projects on top of the 42 major projects already completed and the 33 major schemes within the existing capital works programme of the Office of Public Works (OPW). </p><p>All of these projects are to be funded under the Government's 10 year flood risk investment programme of almost &euro;1 billion under the <i>National Development Plan 2018 &ndash; 2027</i>.  </p><p>As it is not possible to progress all 118 proposed new schemes at once, funding of &euro;257 million was also announced for an initial phase of 50 flood relief projects throughout the country, to be progressed to detailed design and construction; including the five largest schemes identified in the Plans and 31 small, or minor projects (with an estimated preliminary project budget of under &euro;1 million) which will be progressed directly by local authorities.  The proposed flood relief scheme in Athea is included in the 31 small projects under &euro;1 million, and is being progressed directly by Limerick City and County Council with full funding from the OPW.  </p><p>Potentially viable flood relief works for Athea (to be implemented subject to project-level assessment) are likely to include construction of 160m of flood defence walls and construction of 150m of flood defence embankments. The exact location in Athea at which the defences will be built will be determined through detailed design and project level assessment.  Accordingly Limerick City and County Council is currently running a tendering process for Engineering and Environmental Consultants for this project.</p></reply>

It also includes the preparation of complex and detailed tender documents. </p>  <p>  Over the past year, some school building projects have undergone a longer than normal Stage 2b process. This can be due to a complicated or detailed planning application, appeals to An Bord Pleanala, complications around decant arrangements or issues relating to the site. Furthermore, in completing Stage 2(b), Design Teams are now required to upgrade design details to ensure that new school buildings are Near Zero Energy Buildings (NZEB) in compliance with the 2017 amendment to Part L of the current Building Regulations. In many cases this has involved a second planning application to allow for the installation of photovoltaic panels on the roof following receipt of the initial planning permission.</p>  <p>  In addition, since November 2018, a number of competitions to pre-qualify suitable and competent building contractors have been challenged in the High Court leading to the need to completely redraft the procedures and processes involved in pre-qualification. This has impacted over the past few months on projects which were not themselves subject to a direct challenge. </p>  <p>   In terms of current projects at Stage 2b, 7 such projects have been progressing through the stage for 1 year, 19 projects have been progressing for 2 years, 19 further projects have been progressing for 3 years and 9 projects have been progressing through the stage for 5 years. This is in the context of currently over 70 major school building projects in advanced architectural planning and a continuous throughput of projects moving into Stage 2b and onwards towards Tender Stage and Construction.</p>  <p>  In the small number of cases where projects have been in Stage 2b for 5 years, these projects have generaly experienced planning difficulties and/or unavoidable changes to the brief or scope of the project in addition to the other general impediments to progress mentioned previously.</p></reply>

We have significantly increased the availability of special placements for children with special educational needs as well as bringing more and more children into mainstream education.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has a statutory function to plan and co-ordinate the provision of education and support services to children with special educational needs, in consultation with the relevant education partners and the Health Service Executive (HSE). </p><p>This includes the establishment of special class and special school placements in various geographical areas where there is an identified need. </p><p>In deciding where to establish a special class in an area, the NCSE take account of the current and projected demand and the available school accommodation both current and planned.</p><p>The Council ensures that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special class placements.</p><p>When the NCSE sanction a special class in a school, the school can apply to my Department for capital funding to re-configure existing spaces within the school building to accommodate the class and/or to construct additional accommodation.  </p><p>Similarly, where special schools wish to expand provision, the school can apply to my Department for capital funding to accommodate additional placements.</p><p>In the case of all new schools, it is general practice to include a Special Education Needs Base (SEN Base) in the accommodation brief for new school buildings, unless local circumstances indicate that it will not be required. Typically, a two classroom SEN Base is provided in new primary schools and a two or four classroom SEN Base is provided in new post primary schools.</p><p>There are 37 special schools and 237 special classes attached to mainstream schools in Co. Dublin.  </p><p>The number of ASD special classes in Co. Dublin have increased from 66 in 2011/2012 to 197 in 2018/2019. Of these, 17 are ASD Early Intervention Classes, 139 are ASD Primary Classes and 41 are ASD Post Primary Classes. Each ASD Special class provides 6 placements.</p><p>Details of all special classes for children with special educational needs are available on <i>www.ncse.ie</i>. </p><p>The NCSE has informed my Department that they intend to establish over 170 new special classes nationally for 2019/20 school year of which approximately 165 will be new ASD special classes.</p><p>Notwithstanding the extent of this investment issues remain. There are some parts of the country where increases in population and other issues have led to shortages in capacity in the school system.  </p><p>The NCSE formally advised me that there is insufficient special school and special class capacity in Dublin 15. </p><p>This letter is the formal activation of section 37A of the Education Act 1998 (as inserted by section 8 of the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018). This contains a procedure through which the capacity of schools in an area can be tested and through which ultimately a Ministerial direction can be made requiring a school to make additional special education provision available.</p><p>The NCSE and my Department are actively engaging with education service providers in order to encourage them to address the shortage of places.  </p><p>I am encouraged that to date these efforts have resulted in progress in Dublin 15.</p><p>Engagement with schools, patrons bodies, parents and others is continuing in Dublin 15 to bring the required additional special class and special school placements on stream.</p><p>The NCSE will keep in regular contact with the Parents of the children concerned to advise them of progress and identify placements as they become available.</p><p>The new power to compel schools to make additional special education provision available has yet to be invoked.  </p><p>While the NCSE and the Department continue to encourage stakeholders to open special classes, the process under the admissions legislation will continue and may lead to interaction with education providers entering a more formal process. </p><p>In short, ensuring that every child has a suitable placement available to them from September is a key priority for this Government.</p></reply>

SNAs who are employed in a regular part-time capacity are paid a pro-rata amount dependent upon their level of hours of employment. Part-time SNAs are paid on the agreed divisor rate for pay purposes for part-time SNAs which is 32 hours.</p><p>The current salary scales for Special Needs Assistants  are set out Department of Education and Skills circular  0071/2018 &lsquo;REVISION OF SALARIES FOR SPECIAL NEEDS ASSISTANTS (SNAs) WITH EFFECT FROM 1 JANUARY 2019&rsquo;.</p><p>The position on working hours for SNAs is that there are no nationally set working hours for full-time SNAs. In this regard, the contractual position in respect of the working hours of SNAs is as outlined in their contracts of employment which were agreed with the school management authorities and the relevant Trade Unions representing SNAs (F&Oacute;RSA and SIPTU) prior to their introduction in 2005. The working week for SNAs is defined in paragraph 2.5 of their contract as follows: &quot;You will be required to work normal classroom hours including class break periods and in addition to attend before and after school in order to help with the preparation and tidying up of classrooms, reception and dispersal of children etc. The hours of work will normally be from [xxxx] to [xxxx] daily during term time.&quot;</p><p>  This standard contract has been designed to be flexible to cater for the different spectrum of working hours across all the various schools including primary, post-primary and special schools. No set hours were agreed but instead, full-time SNAs are expected to work for the normal school hours in the school that they are working in, and in addition to be available for a period of time before and after school in order to help with reception and dispersal of children and preparation and tidying up of classrooms etc. These times are set locally by the school management and will vary from school to school depending on the requirements of the school. </p><p>  In addition, all SNAs were required to be available for a number of days at the start and finish of each school term not exceeding 12 in total. Under the Croke Park Agreement it was agreed to introduce greater flexibility to the use of these 12 days. These 12 days now equate to 72 hours (pro-rata for part-time SNAs) to be used by schools as an additional bank of hours to be utilised and delivered outside of normal school opening hours and/or the normal school year.</p><p>Furthermore, the contract for Special Needs Assistants in the post primary sector (link below) specifically requires that SNAs are required to work the month of June on examinations and work appropriate to the grade including training. This was agreed with the Unions representing SNAs (F&Oacute;RSA and SIPTU) when the contract was devised in 2005. This condition of service places a clear onus and obligation on the SNA to attend at their place of work and be available for work during the month of June.</p><p>  It is a matter for school management as their employer to determine the precise work that is to be completed by SNAs during the month of June. The utilisation of this period is not specifically for examinations or training purposes only, although these are two of the purposes for which the period of work can be utilised. </p><p>  Link to the SNA Contract of Employment for the Post Primary sector: Department of Education and Skills Circular SNA 12/05 (Post-Primary) <i></i></p><p>  This contract of employment is augmented by all of the relevant Departmental Circulars governing Special Needs Assistants which detail the standardised terms and conditions of employment for SNAs. These Circulars are amended and new Circulars are issued by the Minister for Education and Skills from time to time.</p></reply>

Its recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation.  NIAC made a recommendation that the HPV vaccine should be given to boys.  </p>  <p>  On foot of NIAC&rsquo;s recommendation, my Department asked the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to undertake a health technology assessment (HTA) in relation to extending the national immunisation schedule to include human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination of boys.  HIQA completed the HTA in Q4 2018 and published its report on its website on 7 December 2018. </p>  <p>  The HTA recommended that the HPV immunisation programme be extended to include boys with the introduction of a 9-valent HPV vaccine.  Inclusion of a catch-up programme for males in sixth year in school as part of a gender neutral programme was not considered a cost-effective option and therefore not recommended.  A policy decision was made to extend the HPV immunisation programme to include boys and introduce a 9-valent HPV vaccine starting in September 2019.</p>  <p>  The HSE National Immunisation Office is developing information materials and a communication strategy for a gender neutral HPV programme which will be available for parents and healthcare professionals in advance of the start of the gender neutral programme.</p></reply>

Over the past four years we have seen a considerable increase of nearly &euro;140 million in the budget which has grown from &euro;306 million in 2015 to almost &euro;446 million in 2019. Over 53,000 people will receive more than 18 million home support hours this year, including intensive home care packages to 235 people.  </p>  <p>  Despite this significant level of service provision, the demand for home support continues to grow. The allocation of funding for home supports across the system, though significant, is finite and services must be delivered within the funding available. </p>  <p>  Arrangements for home supports have developed over the years with a significant local focus although it is acknowledged that there may be a considerable variation in access to services in different parts of the country. There is also a considerable demand for home support services over and above existing service levels. </p>  <p>  The HSE has assured the Department that those people who are on a waiting list are reviewed, as funding becomes available, to ensure that individual cases continue to be dealt with on a priority basis within the available resources and as determined by the local front line staff who know and understand the clients&rsquo; needs, and who undertake regular reviews of those care needs to ensure that the services being provided remain appropriate. </p>  <p>  We are aiming to improve home support services so that people can remain living with confidence, dignity and security in their own homes. While the existing service is delivering crucial support across the country, it is recognised that home support services need to be augmented to better meet the changing needs of our older population. The Department is currently engaged in a detailed process to develop a new stand-alone, statutory scheme for the financing and regulation of home support services. </p>  <p>  The allocated Home support budget for Community Healthcare Organisation Area 7 is approximately &euro;54.5m which is an increase of almost &euro;6m on last year&rsquo;s allocated budget and the HSE target is to deliver 2.1m hours to 6,192 people.  As the allocation of home supports is is a service matter I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings. </p>  <p>  The Department of Health agree a set level of funding for the NHSS with the HSE each year having regard for the demand for the Scheme and the overall fiscal position. The 2019 budget for NHSS is &euro;985.8m. In order to manage the demand for the Scheme over a 12 month period, the HSE has a target of maintaining the wait time for funding approval at no more than 4 weeks. This target has consistently been achieved since April 2015 and it is a significant reduction from the October 2014 wait time of 15 weeks. The target of 4 weeks for approval of funding remains a commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government.  State support can only be paid once a financial assessment has been completed and authorised.</p>  <p>  The National Guidelines for the Standardised Implementation of the NHSS provide that State Support and the Nursing Home Loan should be paid in respect of qualified applicants from either the date that the application is approved, or date of admission to the nursing home whichever is the later. Therefore in the case where an applicant is already residing in a nursing home when they apply for State support through NHSS this support will be paid from the date that the application is approved and cannot be backdated to the admission date.</p>  <p>  This provision enables the HSE to manage the budget and commitments under the Scheme over a 12 month period, ensuring that long-term residential care remains accessible and affordable for those that require it.</p></reply>

The AMBER areas represent the target areas for the proposed State led Intervention under the NBP.</p>  <p>  This intervention is the subject of the procurement process to engage a company to build, operate and maintain the NBP State intervention network. I recently brought a recommendation to Government to confer Preferred Bidder status on Granahan McCourt, the remaining bidder in the NBP procurement process and Government agreed to this. </p>  <p>  The Government Decision of 7 May 2019 means that it is intended to award the State Intervention contract to the Bidder. This award is subject to the completion of the final stage of the procurement process, including finalisation of financial and legal documents. Deployment of the NBP State Intervention network will commence shortly after contract signature. The Bidder has indicated that the NBP State intervention will take an estimated 7 years from the beginning of deployment.</p>  <p>  In the first year of roll out, the Bidder will deploy approximately 300 Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) across all counties. It is anticipated that between 7 and 23 BCPs will be deployed in each county. BCPs will provide a community based high speed broadband service, enhancing online participation and allowing for the establishment of digital work hubs in these locations. </p>  <p>  A deployment plan will be made available by the Bidder once the contract is signed. The Bidder is aiming to pass 133,000 premises at the end of the second year, with 70-100,000 passed each year thereafter until roll out is completed.</p></reply>

Newer systems such as LUAS are fully accessible.</p>  <p>  The National Development Plan (NDP) for the period 2018-2027, sets out the national vision and ambition for the delivery of key critical infrastructure over the 10 year period of the Plan, including in relation to public transport infrastructure. Investment in public transport will be accelerated under the NDP to support the development of an integrated and sustainable national public transport system. A number of key new major public transport programmes are due to be delivered under the NDP over the period to 2027. As with all new recently developed public transport projects, these programmes will be fully accessible as part of the normal design.</p>  <p>  However, work remains to be done in terms of the retro-fitting of older infrastructure to make it accessible for people with a disability. In particular, gaps remain in relation to railway infrastructure and facilities as most of the rail network was originally developed during the Victorian era, as well as in bus stop infrastructure outside of the cities.</p>  <p>  To address infrastructural legacy issues, my Department funds a programme of accessibility improvement grants to upgrade existing and older infrastructure and facilities, such as the installation of accessible bus stops, upgrading train stations to make them accessible to wheelchair users, and providing grant support for the introduction of more wheelchair accessible vehicles into the taxi fleet. In this regard, I secured a trebling of the funding provided for the Accessibility Retro-fit Programme to &euro;28 million for the period 2018 to 2021, as part of the 4-year capital envelope for public transport announced in Budget 2018.  &euro;7 million of that funding has been allocated for 2019, up from &euro;4 million in 2018. The NTA manages the Retro-fit Programme.</p>  <p>  In light of the NTA's responsibilities in this matter, I have forwarded your questions to the NTA for further response to you.  Please advise my private office if you do not receive a response within ten working days.</p></reply>

These regulations enable us to begin the long sought after quality assurance of school-age childcare services which is required to best serve children and families</p><p>In setting regulatory requirements, the primary consideration must be children&rsquo;s health, safety and well-being, and these were the primary factors considered when setting a minimum 1:12 adult-to-child ratio in the new Regulations for school-age childcare. The 1:12 ratio was selected following consultation with an expert group on school-age childcare standards, which included a range of sector representatives among its members. The working group report that was submitted to my Department in 2018 recommended a 1 adult to 11 children ratio. A 1:8 ratio was recommended in a 2005 working-group report. My Department ultimately decided on a 1:12 ratio.</p><p>I do not expect to see an overall reduction in the number of school-age childcare places as a result of the School-Age Childcare Regulations. In setting the ratio requirement, current practice was considered; while some providers have until now operated higher ratios than 1:12, many have operated lower ratios. The 1:12 ratio requirement is close to the working group recommendation, and while some individual services may have to recruit additional staff or reduce places (if they choose to keep their staffing level constant), this will not be true for all school-age childcare services. </p><p>  Nevertheless, following discussions with sector representatives, to give service providers time to adjust to the new requirement I made a decision earlier this year to delay the date on which the 1:12 ratio comes into force by 6 months, from 18th February to 18th August 2019. This decision recognised the difficulty for providers of adjusting their staffing ratio in the middle of the school year. If, in spite of the adjustment period for service providers, any parent finds it difficult securing a school-age childcare place for September, they should contact their local City / County Childcare Committee, which is available to support parents to locate childcare within their locality. Local contact details for City / County Childcare Committees can be found at www.myccc.ie.  </p><p>  The introduction of Regulations for school-age childcare is a new and important development. While the Regulations introduced this year are limited in scope, I intend to introduce comprehensive Regulations that build on the initial Regulations as well as on the recommendations made by the standards working group. </p><p>Public consultation is built into the process of developing these comprehensive Regulations for school-age childcare. On May 21st my Department launched the public consultation process. The consultation comprises an open call for submissions and an online public survey which are open until 5th July, as well as a focus group session with School Age Childcare Providers and an Open Policy Debate, both of which will take place in June.

Funding is being made available under each of these schemes in 2019. </p><p>I would encourage community groups and local bodies to submit applications where eligible and I look forward to providing further supports to rural and urban communities in the county moving forward: </p><p>- The Rural Regeneration and Development Fund, which I launched in 2018 as part of Project Ireland 2040, supports ambitious and strategic projects which have the potential to transform rural economies and communities. Three projects located in County Kildare were awarded funding of &euro;2,865,500 from the first call to the Fund. The second call for applications to the Fund was launched in April 2019, and will close on 6 August 2019.</p><p>- The Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme is our country&rsquo;s primary social inclusion intervention. This is a five-year, &euro;190m national programme that is delivered locally, to help those in the greatest need. The funding allocation to Kildare for 2019 is &euro;1,061,036.00. </p><p>- The Community Enhancement Programme, which I launched in 2018, has provided funding of &euro;468,671 to projects in Kildare, including more than &euro;26,000 to Men's Sheds groups, which provide a safe space where men can gather and  participate in their communities, develop social networks and potentially gain new skills and access information.  The funding allocation to Kildare for 2019 is &euro;148,013.00.  </p><p>- The LEADER Local Action Group (LAG) in Kildare has been allocated &euro;5,261,600 to invest in the economic and social development of County Kildare over the period of the programme to 2020. In 2019, &euro;238,716 has so far been approved for three LEADER projects in Kildare.  </p><p>- 224 projects were approved for &euro;21.3 million of funding under the 2018 Town and Village Renewal Scheme. This included eight projects totaling &euro;520,000 for Kildare. The closing date for receipt of applications for 2019 is 28 June, and the main focus this year will be on public-realm type activities and the enhancement of town centre amenities. Building on the pilot scheme launched by Minister Ring in October 2018, measures to encourage town centre living will also be welcome. </p><p>- The Seniors Alert Scheme facilitates valuable community-based support for vulnerable older people. A total of 1,432 installations have been approved for elderly persons in Kildare since September 2015. </p><p>- The Local Improvement Scheme delivers improvement works on small private or non-public roads in rural areas. The scheme is funded by my Department and is administered through the Local Authorities.  The funding allocated to Kildare is &euro;250,000 for 2019. </p><p>- &euro;85,684 was announced in January 2019 for the Outdoor Recreation Infrastructure scheme in Kildare and further funding will be available under the scheme later this year.  </p><p>- Kildare also received funding of &euro;8,000 which assisted two agricultural shows for 2019. </p><p>- A total of 35 Tidy Towns committees in Kildare received &euro;63,000 in funding in 2018. I will consider, later this year, whether I will be in a position to allocate funding to TidyTowns Committees through this particular funding stream in 2019.  </p><p>- The Community Services Programme (CSP) supports community organisations to provide local services through a social enterprise model. The funding is provided as a contribution to the cost of a manager and an agreed number of full-time equivalent positions.

The application periods for these programmes vary and full details of all relevant dates and deadlines can be found on the Government of Ireland website, gov.ie. Funding announcements are made following the processing and evaluation of applications in accordance with the criteria set out in respect of each programme.</p><p>The <i>LEADER Programme</i>is a multi-annual funding programme from 2014-2020. Decisions to approve a project, or otherwise, are a matter for the Local Action Groups (LAGs) which administer the programme in each LEADER area<b>.  </b>Interested applicants should, in the first instance, contact the relevant LAG through its Implementing Partners to discuss the funding that may be available. Funding can be provided under a broad range of defined themes, which include enterprise development and social inclusion.  Contact details for all LAGs are available on the gov.ie website at </p><p>The <i>Community Enhancement Programme</i>(CEP) deadline for receipt of applications for 2019 in most Local Authority areas is 30 May. The CEP is managed by Local Community Development Committees in each Local Authority area. Applications should check with their LCDC for details regarding the CEP, including the closing date, in their area.</p><p>Some &euro;46m is available under the <i>Community Services Programme (CSP)</i>in 2019. The CSP supports around 400 community organisations, with funding provided as a fixed annual contribution to the cost of a manager and an agreed number of full-time equivalent (FTE) positions. Expressions of Interest are accepted on an ongoing basis throughout the  year, with funding for new organisations considered, in light of available budgets, during the year and subject to their suitability with the programme criteria.  <b></b></p><p>The <i>Outdoor Recreation Infrastructure Scheme</i><b></b>provides funding for the development of new outdoor recreational infrastructure or the necessary maintenance, enhancement or promotion of existing outdoor recreational infrastructure in Ireland. I launched the 2019 Outdoor Recreation Infrastructure Scheme on Friday 29 March. The closing date is 31 May.</p><p><i>The Walks Scheme</i><b></b>covers 39 trails, with payments to approximately 1,900 private land-holders to maintain those trails. In line with the Programme for a Partnership Government commitment to increase the number of walks covered by the scheme, funding for the scheme was doubled in Budget 2019 - from &euro;2 million to &euro;4 million. Expression of Interest Forms are available on the gov.ie website.</p><p>I have allocated &euro;86 million in support for 84 projects worth &euro;117m under the first call applications for the &euro;1 billion <i>Rural Regeneration and Development Fund</i>. The Second Call for applications under the Fund opened on 12 April 2019 and closes on 6 August 2019. As with the 1st call funding announcements will be made in each case when applications have been processed and evaluated.  </p><p>Almost &euro;53 million has been approved under the <i>Town and Village Renewal Scheme</i>for more than 670 projects since 2016. For 2019, the main focus of the Town and Village Renewal Scheme will be on public-realm type activities and the enhancement of town centre amenities. Building on the pilot scheme I launched in October 2018, measures to encourage town centre living will also be welcome. Details of the 2019 Town and Village Renewal Scheme which was launched on 16 April 2019 are on gov.ie and closing date for receipt of applications is 28 June 2019.</p><p>The <i>CL&Aacute;R programme</i>provides funding for small infrastructural projects in specific designated rural areas that have experienced significant levels of depopulation. I launched the 2019 programme on 28 February and the application period closed on 25 April 2019.</p><p>Calls for proposals under the 2019 CL&Aacute;R programme were invited under the following measures:</p><p>Measure 1: Support for Schools/Community Safety Measures Measure 2: Play Areas (including MUGAs) Measure 3: Community Wellbeing Supports, comprising of: 3(a) First Response Support; 3(b) Mobility and Cancer Care Transport; and 3(c) Sensory Gardens</p><p>My officials are currently assessing all applications received and I hope to be in a position to announce the successful 2019 CL&Aacute;R projects in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

My Department will spend approximately &euro;248 million this year on HHB for over 446,000 customers. The fuel allowance is a payment of &euro;22.50 per week for 28 weeks (a total of &euro;630 each year) from October to April, to over 375,000 low income households, at an estimated cost of &euro;240 million in 2019. </p>  <p>  Since 1 April 2012, new applicants in receipt of Carers Allowance who are not living with the person for whom they provide care do not have an automatic entitlement to the household benefits package. Carers who live with the person they are caring for still have an entitlement of their own to the household benefits package and do not have to satisfy the household composition criteria.  Carers Allowance is not a qualifying payment for fuel allowance and there were no recent Budget changes that would have caused people in receipt of carers allowance to lose entitlement to fuel allowance.  </p>  <p>  The Government values the role of carers very much and it is for this reason that they receive significant income supports from the Department.  In addition to carer&rsquo;s allowance carers receive additional support in the form of free travel and household benefits (for those who live with the person for whom they care) and the annual carers support grant (&euro;1,700) in respect of each person for whom they care.  Where a person is in receipt of certain qualifying social welfare payments, and also providing full time care and attention to another person, they can keep their primary social welfare payment and also get the half-rate carer's allowance.  </p>  <p>  It should also be noted that since October 2013 the payment of half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance does not preclude a person from qualifying for fuel allowance.  If a person is in receipt of a non-contributory social welfare payment and a half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance, then they are deemed to have satisfied the means test and fuel allowance is payable subject to all remaining criteria being satisfied.  If a person is in receipt of a contributory social welfare payment and a half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance then they will have to undergo a means test for fuel allowance.</p>  <p>  The maximum rates of Carer's Allowance, at &euro;219 for where one person is being cared for, and &euro;328.50 where there are two or more carees, is significantly higher than that for Jobseekers Allowance, which is &euro;203 for those aged 26, and lower for younger claimants.  In addition to this higher rate, the means test for Carer's Allowance is very significantly more generous than that which applies to Jobseekers Allowance, which widens further the gap in payments between Carers and Jobseekers.  </p>  <p>  Any decision to change the qualifying criteria for HHB or fuel allowance would have budgetary consequences and would have to be considered in the context of budget negotiations. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

These are chaired by Directors of Housing in each authority and include HSE and disability representative organisations.  </p>  <p>  Each HDSG has prepared a local Strategic Plan for its own City/County area to develop specific local strategies to meet identified and emerging need, over all of the categories of disability, over the next five years. These Plans, the majority of which are now available on the relevant local authority websites, along with the annual Summary of Social Housing Assessments (SSHA), will allow local authorities to plan more strategically for the housing needs of people with a disability and will support the delivery of accommodation using all appropriate housing supply mechanisms. This is a more targeted and responsive way to meet actual need identified rather than designating a specific percentage or number of new social housing builds that are fully wheelchair accessible.</p></reply>

The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once off in nature.</p>  <p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced at that time also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.</p>  <p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support.  The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources. </p>  <p>  However, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is underway.  The review will also have regard to current initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and cost rental and will be completed when the impacts of these parallel initiatives have been considered.</p></reply>

Under the Plan, my Department is providing capital funding to local authorities to ensure that there is sufficient emergency accommodation in place to provide shelter for all who require it.  In 2019, the operational budget available to local authorities to support households experiencing homelessness, including the provision of emergency accommodation, has been increased by over 25% to &euro;146m. </p>  <p>  Under Rebuilding Ireland, over 200 permanent emergency beds have been introduced in the Dublin region in each of the years from 2016 to 2018.

Many of the individuals accessing emergency accommodation require significant health supports, particularly in the area of addiction and mental health. I am working closely with the Minister for Health, who is responsible for funding the provision of health supports, to ensure that the necessary arrangements and funding are in place.   At the local level, statutory management groups are in place, including representatives of the local authorities and the HSE, to coordinate the delivery of housing and health supports as appropriate.</p></reply>

Electoral law provides that every notice, bill, poster or similar document having reference to a D&aacute;il, Presidential or European election or to a referendum shall bear upon its face the name and address of the printer and publisher thereof.  Failure to comply with this provision is an offence.  </p>  <p>  The Electoral Acts do not regulate the content of electoral material, including election posters, either during or outside of electoral campaigns.  However, the Public Order Act 1994 provides that is an offence for any person in a public place to distribute or display any writing, sign or visible representation, which is threatening, abusive, insulting or obscene with intent to provoke a breach of peace.</p>  <p>  The Litter Pollution Act (section 19(7)) provides that election or referendum posters may be erected/exhibited for a specified time period prior to and after a polling date.  Failure to comply with this provision is also an offence.  By way of background, section 19(7) of the Litter Pollution Act 1997 was amended by the Electoral (Amendment) (No.2) Act 2009 to introduce a 30-day time limit prior to an election taking place, during which election posters can be displayed.  Prior to this amendment, the relevant legislation had required that election posters be taken down within 7 days of an election but provided no time limit for the period prior to an election within which posters could be displayed.  This legislation now ensures that posters are only displayed for a finite and reasonable period.</p>  <p>  There is no requirement in law that posters at an election or referendum must be erected.  It is open to political parties, candidates or other groups to decide whether or not to do so.  </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that, overall, the existing arrangements are operating quite well and while electoral law is subject to ongoing review, I have no plans in the short term to revise the legislation related to the erection of election posters or to revise legislation on election expenses in that regard.</p></reply>

To provide for such an extended franchise at D&aacute;il and at presidential elections as well as at referendums would require Constitutional amendment.  </p>  <p>  In this context and in response to the evolving needs of Irish society and its relationship with the wider Irish diaspora, the Government agreed in March 2017 to accept in principle the main recommendation in the Fifth Report of the Convention on the Constitution that Irish citizens resident outside the State, including citizens resident in Northern Ireland, should have the right to vote at presidential elections and that a referendum would be held to seek to amend the Constitution to give effect to this.  The extension of voting rights at other elections to Irish citizens resident outside the State is not under consideration at this point in time.</p>  <p>  In order to inform public discourse on this significant policy change, an Options Paper was published on 22 March 2017 by my Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  The Options Paper sets out a broad range of options for the extension of voting rights, international comparisons, the estimated costs involved and related resource issues as well as many of the legal, policy, administrative and logistical challenges associated with extending voting rights to Irish citizens resident outside the State.  These options provided a basis for the discussion on voting rights which took place at the Global Irish Civic Forum in Dublin on 5 May 2017.</p>  <p>  More recently, the Government agreed on 5 February 2019 that, subject to the timely passage of a Constitution Amendment Bill by each House of the Oireachtas, the proposed referendum on extending the franchise at presidential elections would be held in October 2019.  The Government also agreed that the preferred option to be put to the people in a referendum is for an extension of the franchise to all citizens resident outside the State, including citizens resident in Northern Ireland.  This will inform the development of a Constitution Amendment Bill in good time for the holding of a referendum in October 2019.</p></reply>

To be eligible, tenants must meet certain criteria, including having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum and having been in receipt of social housing support for at least one year.</p>  <p>  The provisions of Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, are designed to enable the development of mixed tenure sustainable communities. Part V homes are excluded from the Tenant (Incremental) Purchase Scheme 2016 to ensure that homes delivered under this mechanism will remain available for people in need of social housing support and that the original policy goals of the legislation are not eroded over time. The continued development of mixed tenure communities remains very important in promoting social integration. </p>  <p>  Local authorities may also, within the provisions of the Regulations, exclude certain houses which, in the opinion of the authority, should not be sold for reasons such as proper stock or estate management.  It is a matter for each individual local authority to administer the Scheme in its operational area in line with the over-arching provisions of the governing legislation for the scheme, and in a manner appropriate to its housing requirements.</p>  <p>  In line with the commitment given in the Government's Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan on Housing and Homelessness, a review of the operation of the first 12 months of the Tenant Purchase (Incremental) Scheme has been completed and a full report has been prepared setting out findings and recommendations.  </p>  <p>  Following consideration of a number of implementation issues arising, I expect to be in a position to publish the Review very shortly.

An offer is deemed to be reasonable where the dwelling concerned would, in the opinion of the authority, meet the housing needs of the household and, except in an emergency, is located in an area of choice specified by the household. </p>  <p>  From engagement with the local authority sector, it has become apparent that the current 12-month sanction is not operating in a manner that sufficiently addresses the potential for households on the waiting list to turn down reasonable housing offers. The refusal of offers can have a serious impact on the efforts by local authorities to manage their social housing letting process effectively and efficiently, lengthening the period ultimately required to complete lettings or re-lettings and resulting in a loss of essential differential rent revenue for extended periods.</p>  <p>  For these reasons, I plan to amend the regulations to provide that a household that refuses two reasonable offers in any twelve-month period, other than an offer made under the Choice Based Letting procedure, will not receive any further offers from any local authority for a period of five years. The latter period will not be reckonable subsequently for the purposes of determining the household&rsquo;s relative priority for another social housing tenancy. </p>  <p>  Having regard to the overall level of demand for social housing, I am satisfied that the change proposed is a measured step. It  is ultimately fair to all households on local authority social housing waiting lists and will be supportive of the work of local authorities, as they seek to improve the efficient use of their social housing stock. I intend to bring this change forward as part of a comprehensive social housing reform package of measures that I expect to be in a position to bring to Government in the near future. </p></reply>

However, I and my Department play a strongly supportive role, recognising the significant part that the built environment, planning and local government generally play in contributing to the achievement of Ireland&rsquo;s climate targets.  </p>  <p>  Through our building regulations, we are ensuring that homes in Ireland are built to the highest energy efficiency standards.  In relation to social housing specifically, funding of approximately &euro;128 million has been provided from 2013 to the end of 2018 to improve energy efficiency in almost 68,000 local authority homes. In addition, energy efficiency measures have been incorporated into over 9,000 vacant social housing units that have been returned to productive use since 2014. This effectively means that approximately 50% of our social housing stock have had improvements to their energy efficiency.</p>  <p>  To support the effort needed by the public sector to reach its target of a 33% improvement in energy efficiency by 2020, a Public Sector Energy Efficiency Strategy has been approved by Government and published by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment. This Strategy contains a governance structure based around the designation of a senior manager as Energy Performance Officer (EPO) in each public sector body whose purpose is to provide oversight and strategic leadership on structured energy management within the organisation and to report to Government. My Department recently hosted a workshop with bodies and agencies under the aegis of the Department to provide an opportunity for each body and the group collectively to organise for performance and delivery of improved energy efficiency outcomes.</p>  <p>  My Department is also playing a significant role in delivering on the Government&rsquo;s climate ambitions through the National Planning Framework (NPF), which was published in early 2018 as part of Project Ireland 2040.  The NPF sets out long-term policy for the future spatial pattern of development and urban structure in Ireland.  The national objective to transition to a low carbon and climate resilient society by 2050 is a key aspect of the NPF, particularly reflected in the &ldquo;compact growth&rdquo; objective of targeting a greater proportion of development to take place in settlements of all sizes, through urban infill and the re-use of brownfield lands.  The NPF operates horizontally across Government and will cascade vertically down through three Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies (RSESs), to directly influence the operation of the planning system through the thirty-one local authority Development Plans.</p></reply>
