There were no special or exceptional arrangements applying in this regard.</p>  <p>  While I have responsibility for answering questions on administrative matters connected with the Office of the Attorney General, I have no function in respect of the detail of the Attorney General&rsquo;s professional engagements outside of his role as Attorney General.</p>  <p>  Prior to his appointment, the Attorney General informed me and I informed the other leaders of the parties in Government that he had a small number of existing litigation commitments that he considered he had a professional obligation to discharge.  It was agreed that he would do so.</p>  <p>  The Attorney General&rsquo;s involvement in these matters dates back to 2011 in one case and 2017 in two others.  The first matter related to the State recapitalisation of Irish Permanent.  The Attorney General was involved in one hearing in that matter in November 2020 and his involvement ceased at that time.  The second matter related to a commercial dispute and the Attorney General's involvement ceased in February 2021.  The final matter related to the Inspectors investigation into certain matters relating to INM and involved a hearing on two Saturdays, 18 and 25 September 2021.  The Attorney General's involvement in that matter ceased on 25 September.  He has no continuing private professional obligations.  I would note also that the Attorney General is bound by a duty of confidentiality to his clients.</p></reply>

As part of the Government&rsquo;s Shared Island initiative, I launched the Shared Island Dialogue series in October 2021, to foster inclusive, constructive civic dialogue on key issues for a shared future on the island, underpinned by the Good Friday Agreement.</p>  <p>  There have been seven Shared Island Dialogue events and two roundtable discussions to date. I participated in the first Dialogue event last November, hearing from young people on their perspectives for the future of the island. Subsequent Dialogues have focused on Climate and Environment; Civil Society; Equality; Economic recovery; Health cooperation; and Education, with participation by Government Ministers.  </p>  <p>  The Dialogue series is engaging with people who are directly involved and active on the different sectors and issues that are being considered. A key objective of these discussions is to include as broad a range of perspective and experience - including from often under-represented voices - on how we can better share this island in the years ahead. </p>  <p>  More than 1,000 civic representatives have participated in the Dialogue series this year from across all regions, communities and traditions on the island.</p>  <p>  The Dialogue series has proved really worthwhile and valuable from the Government&rsquo;s perspective and from feedback received from participants. Exciting projects are also emerging from these discussions such as the All-Island Women&rsquo;s Forum that has been established by the National Women&rsquo;s Council.</p>  <p>  The Dialogue series will continue next year, with early discussions to focus on Tourism and Sport. The Shared Island unit in my Department is also considering how a next phase of dialogue is undertaken, including on hopefully being in a position to convene more in-person discussions next year.</p></reply>

Statutory redundancy is based on the employee's length of reckonable service and their normal weekly remuneration subject to a ceiling of &euro;600 per week.</p>  <p>  The Act does not stipulate the normal weekly remuneration to be used when an employer places an employee on short-time work or reduced hours or salary. However, the general guidance has been that if an employer has placed an employee on short-time work or reduced hours for certain periods of time, the full-time salary should be used for the calculation of statutory redundancy.</p>  <p>  During the Covid-19 pandemic, some employees will have been placed on short-time work or reduced hours, or were paid through the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) and the previous Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS). These schemes were introduced as exceptional measures to assist businesses and employees during the emergency Covid-19 situation.</p>  <p>  In the event of any dispute regarding the amount of the statutory redundancy lump sum, an employee can refer a complaint to the Workplace Relations Commission.</p></reply>

The study is examining a range of options including for sustainable bioenergy including bioliquids. </p>  <p>  This study is underway, and you can find further details on the SEAI website at www.seai.ie/data-and-insights/national-heat-study/</p>  <p>  In addition, my Department carried out a consultation on the potential introduction of a renewable energy obligation in the heat sector. Such an obligation, if introduced, would require the suppliers of fossil fuels for use in the heat sector to also supply renewable energy. The level of renewable energy that would have to be supplied would be based on a proportion of the fossil fuels supplied. There are a range of renewable energies that could be used to meet the obligation including bioliquids. The consultation is now closed and my Department is considering the responses received.</p></reply>

It will also facilitate the achievement of the goal to generate up to 80% of our electricity from renewable sources by 2030. A resilient and well-connected energy infrastructure is vital for Ireland's economic well-being and the ability to respond to the future needs of energy consumers.   The Government does not have a role to play in the delivery of electricity infrastructure on the ground; this is an operational matter for the system operators. No estimates for the CO2 emissions of construction of the North-South interconnector are available, however the completion of the project will allow  a significant increase in the amount of renewable energy on the system. This could in turn power hundreds of thousands more homes through green energy, lowering the overall carbon footprint of the electricity system. </p></reply>

The AMBER area represents the area to be served by the network to be deployed under the NBP State led intervention.    I appreciate people's frustration when they are living so close to a fibre network but cannot get a connection to that network, particularly given the heightened importance of connectivity during the Covid-19 pandemic. The NBP will ensure that in all such cases a future proofed high speed broadband network will be built to serve these premises and work to deliver on this is underway.  </p>  <p>  I am advised by National Broadband Ireland (NBI) that, as of 5 November, almost 274,000 premises across all counties have been surveyed or have surveys underway and over 125,000 premises have build currently underway. NBI has also advised that the first premises are connected in Cavan, Cork, Galway, Limerick and Monaghan and over 30,000 premises are available to order and pre-order across 12 counties. Surveying is complete in County Monaghan in the Deployment Areas of Emyvale, Clones and Carrickmacross and main works are underway in the Deployment Area of Monaghan. There are currently over 3,600 premises in Monaghan who can order a connection today and over 770 premises who can place a pre-order today. The areas covered include Monaghan, Clontibret, Ballybay, Scotstown, Tehallan, and Tullycorbet.</p>  <p>  Further details are available on specific areas within County Monaghan through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the Intervention Area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. NBI has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries. NBI has recently published details of its full deployment schedule on its website which enables all premises within the intervention area to have an anticipated service activation date range. Given the scale and complexity of delivery of the new high speed broadband network under the NBP, I am advised that any dates provided by NBI on its website are based on the best available information at the time and may be subject to change. </p>  <p>  In addition to the challenges to the delivery of the NBP due to the Covid-19 pandemic, NBI has faced a range of other challenges due to the sheer scale and complexity of rolling out fibre to the home in a rural environment. These include significant tree trimming to ensure cable can be placed on overhead poles, remediation of ducting that has been in place for many decades, the co-ordination of hundreds of contracting crews and addressing the many issues arising week on week which could not have been foreseen until the build crews commenced work on the ground. My Department has worked closely with NBI to put in place a remedial plan under the Contract. This plan addresses delays experienced by NBI, primarily arising as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, and re-baselines milestones for 2021. Work is underway to re-baseline milestones for 2022 and beyond. This has resulted in some changes to timeframes for connection for end users. </p>  <p>  Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 5 November, 388 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for school BCPs. BCP&rsquo;s are installed at Corduff Community Centre (5.3km from the premises referred to), Mullyash Community Centre, St. Patrick&rsquo;s Accommodation Centre, Monaghan GAA Centre of Excellence, Latton Resource Centre, Corcaghan Community Centre, Tannagh Outdoor Education Centre, Geraldines GAA Club, Tullycorbet Parish Hall, Carn Resource Centre, Saint Alphonsus Community Hall, Ceremartin Community Hall, Ballybay Wetlands, and Latton O'Rahilly Gaelic Football Club. Further details can be found at nbi.ie/bcp-locations/. </p>  <p>  Drumcorrin National School, Drumacrutten National School, Saint Mary's School, Saint Brigid&rsquo;s National School, Annalitten National School, Connons National School, Saint Michael's National School, Latnamard National School and Drumgossatt National School have been installed by NBI for educational access. My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband, within the Intervention Area, for connection over the term of the NBP. In this regard, an acceleration of this aspect of the National Broadband Plan was announced in December which will see some 679 primary schools connected to high speed broadband by 2022, well ahead of the original target delivery timeframe of 2026.  Further details are available on the NBI website at nbi.ie/primary-schools-list/.</p></reply>

BLUE areas are not included in the State intervention area covered by the National Broadband Plan as commercial operators are already providing high speed broadband or have indicated future plans to do so. My Department defines high speed broadband as a connection with minimum speeds of 30Mbps download and 6Mbps upload. The activities of commercial operators delivering high speed broadband within BLUE areas are not planned or funded by the State and my Department has no statutory authority to intervene in that regard.</p>  <p>  Complaints about service provision are a matter to be dealt with between the consumer and the service provider in the first instance. If this avenue has been exhausted without a satisfactory resolution, the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) may be able to assist further. ComReg is the independent body that issues licences to broadband service providers and investigates complaints to make sure that companies are delivering services in line with their licence obligations.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, my Department has undertaken an initial investigation into the matter and has established that the premises should be served with high speed broadband from Fibre To The Cabinet in the area with access to download speeds of 40Mbps.</p></reply>

A national charging infrastucture strategy is due for publication early next year which will set out a pathway to stay ahead of demand over the critical period out to 2030.</p>  <p>  I am also aware that a report was published by the CCMA on the provision of guidance to local authorities on the provision of charging infrastructure. The document is available for viewing online at www.lgma.ie/en/publications/general-publications/local-authority-electrification-of-fleet-and-ev-charging-guidance.pdf</p>  <p>  Preparations are underway to establish an Office of Low Emission Vehicles. This Office will play an important role in our transition to zero emission vehicles. It will co-ordinate measures to support the uptake of EVs and the rollout of charge point  infrastructure.   </p>  <p>  In terms of existing supports for public charging, the Public Charge Point Scheme continues to be available during 2021 to provide local authorities with a grant of up to &euro;5,000 to support the development of on-street public chargers. The primary focus of the scheme is to provide support for the installation of infrastructure which will facilitate owners of electric vehicles, who do not have access to a private parking space, but instead rely on parking their vehicles in public places near their homes to charge their EVs. My Department is reviewing the Scheme at present to ensure that it is as effective as possible in driving the decarbonisation effort. I would be very happy to consider any applications from Mayo County Council under this scheme.</p>  <p>  Having an effective and reliable recharging network is essential to enabling drivers to choose electric. Charging at home is the most convenient and cheapest way to recharge. Targeting the installation of smart home chargers is a priority as we look to moving towards more energy efficient and sustainable ways to charge. A grant is available from the SEAI for those individuals seeking to install a home charger. Work is currently being progressed to expand the EV home charger grant to include shared parking in apartment blocks and similar developments. My Department is working closely with the SEAI and expects a scheme for apartments to open in the near future.</p>  <p>  There is also a need for a seamless public charging network that will provide for situations or instances where home charging is not possible such as on-street and residential charging, destination charging, and workplace charging. </p>  <p>  &euro;10 million was committed from the Climate Action Fund to support ESB investment in the charging network and this has leveraged a further &euro;10 million investment from ESB, with the infrastructure to be in place by the end of 2022. This intervention alone will result in:</p>  <p>  - 90 additional high power chargers, each capable of charging two vehicles</p>  <p>  - 52 additional fast chargers, which may replace existing standard chargers</p>  <p>  - 264 replacement standard chargers with more modern technology and with each consisting of two charge points</p>  <p>  Further details on the progression of this project can be found at esb.ie/ecars/our-network/network-upgrades.</p>  <p>  My Department is also developing a new scheme which will support the installation of destination charge points in locations such as hotels, visitor centres and parks. This new initiative will help provide another critical link in the overall network for public charging.</p></reply>

This is underpinned by the provisions of the Non-Use of Motor Vehicles Act 2013.  The primary purpose of the Act is to replace the system whereby a vehicle was declared off the road retrospectively with a system under which the vehicle must be declared off the road in advance.</p>  <p>  The current procedures, only allowing for a future declaration of non-use, have been fully in force since 1st October 2013.  Under the revised procedures, an owner can indicate that a vehicle is going to be off the road by making a declaration of non-use at any time in the last month of an existing motor tax disc or previously made declaration of non-use.   The declaration can be made online or through the vehicle owner's local motor tax office.</p>  <p>  Where a declaration is not made in advance, motor tax must be paid for a minimum of 3 months, along with any arrears of motor tax, where applicable.</p>  <p>  In this instance, I understand that tax on the vehicle in question expired at the end of December 2018.  In order to declare the vehicle off the road, the Declaration should have been made at any time during that month.   There is no record of a Declaration of Non-Use having been made in respect of the vehicle during December 2018, or during 2019, at which point the deadline for making the Declaration would already have passed.</p>  <p>  Renewal notices, either electronically or in paper form, are issued to the registered owner of a vehicle in the last month of an extant tax disc.   This is an administrative facility to enable ease of taxing and is not a necessary requirement for either taxing the vehicle or declaring it off the road.</p>  <p>  Motor tax legislation does not provide for exemptions from the requirement to make a Declaration of Non-Use in individual cases, or for the waiving of arrears.  You will appreciate the difficulties in providing for such exemptions or waivers in particular cases, given that other people have had to pay arrears in motor tax where the Declaration of Non-Use of a Motor Vehicle was not made on time, and the necessity generally of maintaining a consistent approach in the application of the legislation.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to 7% average annual emissions reduction to 2030; ultimately, the goal is for a zero-emission mobility system by 2050. Electrification will be key to achieving this objective in the transport sector. </p><p>Electric vehicles (EVs) are the most prominent transport mitigation measure in the 2019 <i>Climate Action Plan</i>, and Ireland has set an ambitious target of 936,000 EVs on our roads by 2030. This target is challenging but indicates the scale of the transformation that is needed across all sectors if Ireland is to achieve its climate targets in the coming years. The Climate Action Plan 2021 retains this commitment to transforming the national vehicle fleet to a zero emissions fleet, and contains a range of measures to support the public and business in transitioning to electric vehicles.</p><p>Considerable progress has already been made, as a result of the work of the <i>Low Emission Vehicle Taskforce</i>, to ensure that conditions and policies are in place to support citizens in making greener vehicle choices. As the Deputy will be aware, a comprehensive suite of measures is available to EV drivers, including purchase grants for private car owners and taxi drivers, VRT relief, reduced tolls, home charger grants, favourable motor and BIK tax rates, as well as a comprehensive charging network. These measures have collectively contributed to increased take up of EVs in Ireland in recent years, albeit from a low base, to over 46,500 now. </p><p>In addition, my Department convened the <i>Electric Vehicle Policy Pathway (EVPP) Working Group</i>to produce a roadmap to achieving the 2030 EV target. The <i>EVPP Working Group </i>comprises senior officials and has considered regulatory, financial, and taxation policies to help drive a significant ramp-up in passenger EVs and electric van sales.  </p><p>The recommendations of the EVPP Working Group were approved by Government and the full report is now available online. </p><p>In order to support the transition to EVs, the Group recommended that: </p><p>- The generous suite of EV supports already in place in Ireland should be retained until at least end-2022. Additional measures to further incentivise EVs and/or disincentivise fossil fuelled vehicles will also be necessary. Cost-effective, targeted policy supports should continue to be developed and strengthened over the coming years; and </p><p>- An <i>Office for Low Emission Vehicles</i>should be established, as a matter of priority, to co-ordinate the implementation of existing and future EV measures and infrastructure. The new <i>Office</i>should also take charge of developing and launching an extensive communication and engagement campaign, whole of Government in coverage, to drive the availability and understanding of key information regarding EVs, tailored to household, business and public sector consumers. </p><p>Overall, the Department is acutely aware that the cost of electric vehicles remains an issue for many consumers. To this end, electric vehicle policy is kept under continuous review to endeavour to make low emission vehicles affordable. </p></reply>

There are currently over 46,000 EVs registered on Irish roads the pace of uptake must increase over the coming years to achieve our fleet electrification targets.</p><p>D/Transport has developed a trajectory for EV share of the fleet on a year-on-year basis to 2030, to support policy monitoring and evaluation.  This is an estimated trend of EV uptake based on modelling and analysis, and suggests a scenario for EV uptake in the national fleet. The target in the CAP is for 2030  - there are not year on year targets for EV uptake and the rate of uptake may vary and not follow the modelled analysis exactly. The trajectory is a useful tool for us to understand how uptake is progressing, and whether different policy measures may need to be introduced to incentivise uptake, or indeed, whether policy measures are over-delivering. </p><p>Notwithstanding this, an increase of approximately 25,000 new registrations was estimated in 2021 with an estimated 42,540 registered EVs on Irish roads at the end of this year. This estimate has already been surpassed with currently over 45,000 EVs registered on Irish roads. </p><p>The number of <i>new</i>electric vehicles registered to end September 2021 is 15,855 (including BEVs and PHEVs) with EVs now representing 15.17% of total new car registrations. This is a year on year increase of 215%, and over double of the percentage share of new registrations in 2020 (7.27%) and almost four times the share of that in 2019 (3.9%). </p><p>The following table illustrates the modelled uptake of EVs in the national fleet for the CAP analysis. I should note that due to a global semiconductor shortage, the actual uptake of EVs in 2022 may be less than was orginally estimated.  <table>    <tr>       <th></th>       <th>2022</th>       <th>2023</th>       <th>2024</th>       <th>2025</th>       <th>2026</th>       <th>2027</th>       <th>2028</th>       <th>2029</th>       <th>2030</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Annual % increase</td>       <td>50.8</td>       <td>46.6</td>       <td>44.3</td>       <td>43.1</td>       <td>42.2</td>       <td>39.8</td>       <td>38.2</td>       <td>37.1</td>       <td>28.4</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Notwithstanding this shortage, which the market advises should resolve by end 2022, EV sales should further accelerate over the coming years due to a wider range of models coming onto the Irish market, a greater charging network as well as the generous incentives available. </p><p>Over time these sales will help develop the second-hand market, and we can expect that the second-hand market for EVs will develop significantly over coming years.</p><p>An Office for Low Emission Vehicles will be established, to co-ordinate the implementation of existing and future EV measures and infrastructure. The new Office will also take charge of developing and launching an extensive communication and engagement campaign, whole of Government in coverage, to drive the availability and understanding of key information regarding EVs, tailored to household, business and public sector consumers.</p><p>In support of EV adoption, a National EV Charging Infrastructure Strategy is in development which will seek to prioritise the delivery of fast and rapid charge point infrastructure over the next 5 years.Having an effective and reliable recharging network is essential to enabling drivers to choose electric. Charging at home is the most convenient and cheapest way to recharge. Targeting the installation of smart home chargers is a priority as we look to moving towards more energy efficient and sustainable ways to charge. </p><p>There is also a need for a seamless public charging network that will provide for situations or instances where home charging is not possible such as on-street and residential charging, destination charging, and workplace charging.  </p><p>Overall, the expedition of electric vehicles take up is a key priority. To this end, electric vehicle policy and expenditure is kept under continuous review. </p></reply>

Accordingly, electric vehicles (EVs) are a prominent mitigation measure in the <i>Climate Action Plan</i>and Ireland has set an ambitious target of nearly one million EVs on our roads by 2030. With approximately 46,600 EVs currently in Ireland, this target is very challenging but indicative of the scale of the transformation that is needed across all sectors if Ireland is to reduce national emissions and reach its legally binding emission ceiling in future years.</p><p>A national ambition has been firmly established that by 2030 all new cars and vans sold in Ireland will be zero-emission capable. </p><p>The European Commission have indicated that a complete ban of the marketing, import or registration of new ICE vehicles in a single Member State is not compatible with EU law, and an EU-wide approach is therefore required. Ireland was signatory to a non-paper to the Commission earlier this year requesting a phase-out date for the sale of new petrol and diesel cars and vans in the EU in line with the objective of climate neutrality by 2050 as well as the introduction of a legal framework that allows Member States to move ahead by taking action at national level to incentivise early phase-out of new petrol and diesel cars and vans. The paper can be viewed at www.permanentrepresentations.nl/permanent-representations/pr-eu-brussels/documents/publications/2021/03/10/non-paper---transition-to-zero-emission-light-duty-vehicles</p><p>In addition, on Transport Day at COP26,  I signed a sponsored declaration to accelerate the transition to 100% zero emission cars and vans. The declaration is an important signal of ambition at a global level. In line with our Programme for Government commitments, Ireland has even greater ambitions, targeting a switch over of one million electric vehicles by 2030 to bring us on a trajectory to achieving electrification of all new car sales well ahead of 2035 </p><p>These declarations are consistent with Ireland&rsquo;s ambitions to tackle transport emissions. They follow the recent publication of the Climate Action Plan (CAP) &rsquo;21 which outlines a pathway to a radical and equitable transformation in Ireland&rsquo;s transport sector over the next nine years as it moves towards decarbonisation. Car manufacturers are responding to these initiatives by introducing a wide range of electric vehicles to the market, and over the coming decade, I envisage a progressive transition to EVs in our car fleet as electric vehicle technology becomes mainstream .  </p></reply>

It faces two imminent and important milestones in the coming months - Government approval of the Preliminary Business Case and the submission of a Railway Order application to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p><p>Secondly we have the statutory review of the <i>Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area</i>. The Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008 stipulates that the Strategy must be reviewed every six years and this review provides an opportunity to re-examine and re-consider proposals for inclusion in the revised <i>Strategy</i>. The National Transport Authority (NTA), as part of its review, considered whether additional metro routes, above and beyond MetroLink, should be included in any revised <i>Strategy</i>. </p><p>As you are probably aware, the NTA have published the draft <i>Strategy</i>for public consultation and there is a six- week consultation process with the full draft <i>Strategy</i>document and a number of background reports (including analysis in relation to future metro options) available on the NTA&rsquo;s website www.nationaltransport.ie/gda. The deadline for receipt of submissions is Friday 17th December.  </p><p>Following the conclusion of the consultation process, the NTA will review and assess all of the submissions and once finalized, the <i>Strategy </i>will be submitted to for Ministerial approval in accordance with the legislative requirements.</p><p>Inclusion in any revised <i>Strategy</i>is the first step in what is a very detailed and often lengthy process to enable projects move from the strategic support, enabled by inclusion in a <i>Transport Strategy,</i>to being a project with a Preliminary Business Case seeking approval to enter the statutory planning process.</p></reply>

Statutory redundancy is based on the employee's length of reckonable service and their normal weekly remuneration subject to a ceiling of &euro;600 per week.</p>  <p>  The Act does not stipulate the normal weekly remuneration to be used when an employer places an employee on short-time work or reduced hours or salary. However, the general guidance has been that if an employer has placed an employee on short-time work or reduced hours for certain periods of time, the full-time salary should be used for the calculation of statutory redundancy.</p>  <p>  During the Covid-19 pandemic, some employees will have been placed on short-time work or reduced hours, or were paid through the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) and the previous Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS). These schemes were introduced as exceptional measures to assist businesses and employees during the emergency Covid-19 situation.</p>  <p>  In the event of any dispute regarding the amount of the statutory redundancy lump sum, an employee can refer a complaint to the Workplace Relations Commission.</p></reply>

In other words, the basis for calculation would be changed from what it costs the disponer to make the loan to what it would cost the beneficiary to borrow this money on the open market.</p>  <p>  In response to the Deputy&rsquo;s question, I do not believe that if section 62 remained in the Finance Bill it would have a negative impact on the housing crisis and this is not the reason that it is being withdrawn. It is important to note that the reason that I am withdrawing this section is that I believe greater consideration needs to be given to the proposal. It has been pointed out to me that the current drafting has the potential to create inconsistencies as to how it will be applied, with the potential for variation in rates being used. For instance, determining the value of an interest-free loan to buy a house could prove challenging in the context of the variety of competing financial products that are available in the market, and the different conditions that could impact on the appropriate borrowing rate to be used, depending on the particular circumstances of a case.</p>  <p>  In summary, this issue is complex. Therefore I believe more time needs to be given to determining whether this change is warranted in the first place, and if it is, to decide on how this issue can be appropriately addressed in legislation in such a way that it gives people certainty as to the rates to be applied. </p></reply>

The incentive gives a refund of Income Tax and Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) paid in Ireland over the previous four years, subject to limits outlined in the legislation. Section 477C Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997 outlines the definitions and conditions that apply to the HTB scheme.  </p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue as follows:</p>  <p>  A claimant under the scheme must make an application confirming he or she meets various conditions specified in the section, including that he or she is a first-time purchaser, that he or she has completed a tax return form and is tax compliant for each of the tax years for which a claim is being made.  Also, the new property must be occupied as the sole or main residence of a first-time purchaser.  First-time purchasers who intend to purchase a new property should also ensure their contractor is a Revenue approved qualifying contractor for the purposes of Help to Buy.</p>  <p>  S. 477C of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides that the property must be a new building which was not, at any time, used or suitable for use as a dwelling. In order to determine if the property satisfies the definition of a "qualifying residence", full details of the property would need to be provided. The Revenue Tax and Duty Manual Part 15-01-46 outlines further guidance on what would be considered a "new" house. </p>  <p>  As part of the HTB process, "qualifying contractors" are involved in the claim stage of the process where the applicant has purchased a house or apartment. They are required to verify information provided by the applicant in the HTB process. Where the conditions of the HTB are satisfied and a HTB refund is available, the HTB refund is paid to the qualifying contractor to be offset against the purchase price of the property.</p>  <p>  For a contractor to become part of the HTB process, they must first apply to Revenue to register as a "qualifying contractor". In order to become a "qualifying contractor" there are certain requirements that need to be satisfied as outlined in section 477C(2) TCA e.g. the contractor must be tax compliant and either a "zero rated" or "20% rated" contractor for the purposes of Relevant Contract Tax ("RCT"). Please see Part 15-01-46 of the Help to Buy Manual for further details. </p>  <p>  The HTB scheme has been widely publicised since its announcement in 2016, particularly by financial institutions providing mortgages. However, if there are unique circumstances which has prevented an individual from claiming the HTB scheme, the taxpayer should contact Revenue with the relevant circumstances and each case will be considered on a case by case basis. </p>  <p>  However, based on the information provided, it would appear that the builder was not a "qualifying contractor" at the time of purchase.   As such, the couple in question will not qualify for the HTB incentive as all the conditions of the scheme have not been met.</p></reply>

Neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland can intervene in the provision or pricing of insurance products, or have the power to direct insurance companies to provide cover in such circumstances.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive). </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, I cannot comment on or get involved in individual cases such as that referred to in his question.  However, my officials reached out to Insurance Ireland for information regarding the issue of the validity of driving licences which have been extended due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Insurance Ireland stated that it had received a query about the matter via its Insurance Information Service.  I understand that an administrative error may have happened in this particular case and that the issue is being resolved.  I believe this case underscores the usefulness of the Insurance Information Service, which is a free service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to obtaining insurance cover. It can be accessed at feedback@insuranceireland.eu. </p>  <p>  Insurance Ireland further noted that a number of its members put measures in place last year (which were recommitted to in January this year) to avoid such a situation given the backlog in licensing services due to COVID-19 lockdown restrictions, where people could not renew their licences through no fault of their own.</p>  <p>  Finally, it is worth reiterating that where a consumer feels that they are being treated unfairly, they have the option of making a complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO). The FSPO is a statutory official who acts as an independent arbiter of disputes that consumers may have with their insurance company or other financial service provider. The FSPO can be contacted either by email at info@fspo.ie or by telephone at 01-567-7000.</p></reply>

Tax returns do not detail the individual properties disposed of, or the gains on these disposals. However, the numbers of claimants by sector and by asset type are detailed in the statistics published by Revenue.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that Finance Act 2012 introduced section 604A of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 which provides for relief from CGT on the disposal of certain land and buildings. The rationale for the introduction of the measure was to stimulate activity in the property market at that period in time, when there were few transactions taking place.</p>  <p>  This relief was amended in Finance Act 2017 for disposals made on or after 1 January 2018, to provide that gains on land and buildings acquired between 7 December 2011 and 31 December 2014 are not chargeable gains where the land or buildings are held for at least 4 years and up to 7 years from the date they were acquired. This change was aimed at reducing any impact the original provision could possibly have on limiting the supply of development land available for sale by incentivising delayed sales to maximise relief. </p>  <p>  In response to the Deputy's question in Dail Question No. 75 (Ref: 56471/21), I don't think there is any indication that this capital gains tax relief is acting as a tax incentive and contributing towards the sale of rental properties.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s current focus is on the comprehensive 'Housing for All' plan. In relation to property-based reliefs more generally, taxation is only one of the policy levers available to the Government through which to boost overall housing supply. In line with my Department's Tax Expenditure Guidelines, consideration of whether a tax measure is the most appropriate policy tool for a given purpose is required. The presumption should be that non-tax measures should be considered before the use of a tax&ndash;based measure. </p>  <p>  Housing for All is intended to deliver more homes of all types for people with different housing needs, including those who wish to rent at an affordable price. The Government has committed to, amongst other things, an average of 2,000 new &lsquo;cost rental&rsquo; homes every year, with targets of rents being at least 25 per cent below market level, as well as a rent value freeze to 2024 by linking any increases in Rent Pressure Zones to inflation.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-11-17a.133.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021111700072#WRE04200"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 77 and 78 together.</p>  <p>  In relation to the request that the current panel in place from the 2019 Executive Officer with Irish fluency competition be further extended beyond 31 December 2021, I would refer the Deputy to PQ 54814/21 of 10 November.  Candidates for this competition were advised that vacancies many not arise in all regional locations while the panel is active.  A new Irish Executive Officer competition will be undertaken by PAS in the coming months from which future assignments will be made from 2022.  In relation to the sequential filling of posts, this is grade specific as opposed to competition specific and civil service employers have delegated sanction to fill posts in line with these arrangements.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that officials from my Department appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Irish Language, Gaeltacht and the Irish-speaking Community in July.  The recruitment of Irish speakers was discussed in detail with the Committee in the context of the ambitious 2030 recruitment targets set out in the Official Languages (Amendment) Bill that is presently before the Houses of the Oireachtas and alongside the July 2019 audit findings of An Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga that highlighted that only c. 0.4% of total positions were presently designated by civil service employers as positions having an Irish language proficiency requirement.</p>  <p>  The achievement of a 20% recruitment target of proficient Irish speakers by 2030 will require a cross-Government approach.  On enactment of the Bill presently before the Oireachtas, the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media will establish an Advisory Committee on Irish languages services.  The functions of this Advisory Committee are set out in the Bill and include the publication of a national plan to increase the provision of services through the medium of Ireland that will likely require the consideration of approaches to the future recruitment of Irish speakers in the coming years.  My Department and the Public Appointments Service will be represented as members on this Committee.</p>  <p>  The Mobility scheme (list-based) for Clerical Officers and Executive Officers which went live for offers on 10th September 2018 was reviewed by officials in my department and key stakeholders (Local HR representatives and F&oacute;rsa) following twelve months of operation. The reported data at this time indicated that only 25% of moves took place following the initial offer.</p>  <p>  Following consultation it was agreed by with all stakeholders that in order to focus a more targeted approach at application stage that the number of zone choices would be reduced from three to two with the number of organisation choices per zone reduced from all organisations to five, for all new applicants. This change took effect from 19th June 2020.</p>  <p>  A future review will be carried out following the development and roll out of organisational blended working policies under the planned Blended Working Policy Framework for the Civil Service in order to determine the effects that this has on the Mobility Scheme.  Currently it is too early to report on the effects of the change versus the impact of the pandemic.</p>  <p>  As you will be aware some of the location zones include the larger civil service organisations (e.g Revenue, Department of Social Protection) which experience higher rates of staff turnover than the smaller organisations due to retirements, promotions etc. and this reflects on the movement of staff through the Mobility lists.</p></reply>

Addressing vacancy and maximising the use of existing housing stock is a primary concern of this Government and the new Housing for All Strategy outlines a multi-faceted approach to addressing this matter, including:</p><p>- A new local authority-led programme to help Local Authorities buy or compulsory purchase 2,500 vacant homes in their areas which can then be sold on the open market will ensure homes don&rsquo;t lie vacant.</p><p>- Reform of the Fair Deal Scheme to remove disincentives to selling or renting unused homes.</p><p>- The Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe (Towns) Fund will be delivered by local authorities for the provision of serviced sites for housing, to attract people to build their own homes and to support the refurbishment of vacant properties, enabling people to live in small towns and villages, in a sustainable way.</p><p>- A new Town Centre First policy, which will include approaches to utilising existing stock and new financial incentive mechanisms. </p><p>These measures are in addition to the vacant property tax and vacant site tax being pursued by the Department of Finance. </p><p>The Derelict Sites Act 1990 (revised March 2020) is a key tool utilised to tackle dereliction. My Department continues to liaise with local authorities on the implementation of the Derelict Sites Act with a view to improving its effectiveness, and continues to keep the relevant provisions under review.</p><p>An important action under Housing for All is ensuring that the Vacant Homes Officers based in local authorities are all full-time posts, and this will include providing clarity in relation to their role in the light of the actions under Housing for All.</p></reply>

The PPP schemes developed to date were designed/tendered in 2017/2018 using the renewable technologies available at that time. Battery storage was not typically provided for in the design of housing schemes at that time. Energy is not wasted as any PV generated electricity not used within the home is exported to the national electricity grid<i>.</i></p></reply>

In line with the continued scaling up of Passport Services, the Passport Express service resumed on 19 July 2021. </p><p>The current turnaround times for Passport Online is 10 working days for Simple Adult renewals, 15 working days for Complex renewals and 40 working days for First Time Applications. The current turnaround time for Passport Express applications which have been completed correctly is 40 working days.  Prior to the pandemic the turnaround time for Passport Express was 6-8 weeks for all application types.  The most complex online applications at that time had a turnaround time of 4 weeks. </p><p>Below is a table outlining the number of passports issued through the Passport Express service since 2019. Demand for the Passport Express service has fallen significantly since 2019 as more applicants choose the Passport Online service to benefit from the faster turnaround times available through this efficient online service.  Over 90% of passport applicants choose the Passport Online service and it offers several efficiencies to both the customer and the Passport Service. The processing of an online application is consistently up to four times faster than the processing time of a paper application. </p><p>Adequate staffing of the Passport Service to respond to demand remains a priority for my Department and is an issue that is kept under constant review. My Department is actively working with the Public Appointments Service to recruit and assign additional staff to meet the current and forecasted high demand for passports. Additional permanent and temporary officers will be assigned between now and the end of January 2022, bringing total staff numbers to 920 and effectively doubling the number of staff at the Passport Service since June of this year. The assignment of additional staff currently underway will help to improve customer experience and application processing times, including applications received through the Passport Express Service. </p><p>In the context of the National Development Plan, my Department is making a major investment in the future of the Passport Service.  Over the next couple of years, we will replace the core technology underpinning the service, which will deliver efficiencies and a more resilient passport system.  Budget 2022 also included an investment of an additional &euro;10m in passport services in response to the increasing demand for passports both at home and abroad.</p><p>The Emergency Passport service remains available in cases of medical emergency or death of a family member abroad. In addition, the Passport Offices in Mount St, Dublin 2 and in Cork are now offering an Urgent Appointment Service for the renewal of passports. To avail of the Urgent Appointment Service for Passport Renewal, applicants can book an appointment through the Department of Foreign Affairs website (www.dfa.ie/passports). Over 800 urgent appointments have been facilitated since the Passport Service launched this service on 27th September 2021. </p><p>Passport Online can be accessed by all first time applicants, irrespective of age  both children and adults, in Ireland, Northern Ireland, Great Britain, Europe, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the USA. All Irish citizens, including children, can use the online system to renew their passports from anywhere in the world. <table>    <tr>       <th>Year </th>       <th>Passports issued through Passport Express  </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019 </td>       <td>198,163 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020 </td>       <td>42,275 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Since 19 July 2021 to date </td>       <td>6,480 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021 Total to date </td>       <td>6,498 </td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

The projected passport issue date provided to applicants on the online Passport Tracker provides an indication only of the estimated issue date based on current averages and is not an intended guarantee of service.</p>  <p>  Applications can take longer than the average turnaround time if applicants have not provided all of the required documentation to correctly complete their application. There are currently 110,000 passport applications on hand at the Passport Service. Of the online applications on hand, 34,000 or 35% of applications are incomplete and require the applicant to submit additional documents. The Passport Service engages with all applicants who have not submitted the required documentation to ensure that their application is completed correctly and can proceed through the processing system. Of the online applications that are currently with the Passport Service for processing, approximately 8% are past the estimated issue-by date. These applications are being prioritised by the Passport Service who are working very hard to eliminate these delays. </p>  <p>  The Passport Service is currently experiencing a high demand for first time passports. Of the 110,000 passport applications currently on hand, 70,000 (63%) are first time applications. These first time applications are necessarily complex to process, since they are essentially applications for Irish citizenship. It is the statutory responsibility of the Passport Service to protect the integrity of the Irish passport. Accordingly, a rigorous analysis process is in place to verify the identity and  citizenship status of applicants. In the case of first time passport applications for children, the consent of guardians must also be thoroughly validated. Due to the intensive analysis underpinning first time online passport application processing it takes 40 working days.</p>  <p>  The Passport Service of my Department is a unified service composed of three constituent offices located in Lower Mount Street and Balbriggan in Dublin and South Mall in Cork. It operates three passport printing machines, two of which are located in the main production facility in Balbriggan and the third in the Passport Office in Lower Mount Street, Dublin.</p>  <p>  Passport applications from citizens residing in Ireland or elsewhere in the world are distributed for processing across the three Passport Offices. All passport applications are processed through the centralised automated passport service system. All production facilities can print a passport, irrespective of the channel through which the application is processed. The printing system allows for flexibility between printing machines if any one machine has reached capacity. Each passport printer has a printing capacity of 250 passports per hour.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the printing capacity of production equipment currently employed by the Passport Service is sufficient to meet demand.  </p></reply>

I have clearly and repeatedly conveyed our concerns on this issue directly to the Israeli authorities, at EU level and at the UN Security Council.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s Representative Office in Ramallah regularly visits Sheikh Jarrah and Silwan along with EU and other diplomatic representatives and continue to monitor the situation closely, including attending legal proceedings on eviction cases.</p>  <p>  I have engaged on these matters repeatedly with my EU counterparts, including at the Foreign Affairs Council. At the FAC meeting of 12 July, during which we held an exchange of views with Israeli Foreign Minister, Yair Lapid, I called on the Israeli authorities to halt illegal settlement activity, including forced evictions, as well as settlement expansion and demolitions and seizures of Palestinian property. </p>  <p>  During my recent visit to Israel and the oPt, I raised my grave concerns with Israeli interlocutors at the impact of settler activity and the recent announcements on settlements on Palestinians in Jerusalem and the West Bank and urged for an end to these actions.</p>  <p>  Ireland continues to be active on these issues at the UN Security Council. I addressed the Security Council on 16 May, stressing the need to move past the current recurring cycles of violence and stating that a return to business as usual, including forced evictions, is no longer an option. </p>  <p>  Ireland supported a request for the most recent announcement on settlements to be discussed at the Security Council. This discussion took place on 8 November. The UN Deputy Special Coordinator in Jerusalem, Lynn Hastings, briefed the Council. Ireland&rsquo;s Permanent Representative underlined our concerns at the impact of this development on the viability of a future Palestinian State. Ireland along with EU members of the Council as well as Norway and incoming member, Albania, made a joint press statement after the Council meeting highlighting the illegality of such settlements.</p>  <p>  Ireland provides humanitarian assistance, legal and other supports to specific development projects to improve the situation of Palestinians. We fund a number of civil society partners that are active on human rights issues, which impact specifically on Palestinians in East Jerusalem, including in relation to evictions. During my visit to the region, I announced a further &euro;100,000 of Irish funding to support the work of the West Bank Protection Consortium. </p></reply>

The Steering Group is leading on the identification of issues, the development of a programme of actions on teacher supply and overseeing its implementation. It is supported by an Implementation Group and a number of working groups which are considering specific areas of policy.</p><p>The Teacher Supply Action Plan, published in November 2018, includes a range of actions under four policy headings: data/research to support teacher supply planning; higher education; policies and arrangements impacting on teacher supply; and communications / promotion of the teaching profession.</p><p>A number of measures have been put in place to increase the supply of teachers at post-primary level, particularly in subjects where difficulties in recruitment have been reported.</p><p>Following engagement with the Higher Education Authority (HEA), higher education institutions (HEIs) put in place new post-primary initial teacher education (ITE) undergraduate programmes in 2019 and 2020 in priority subject areas, including mathematics, modern foreign languages, computer science and Irish.</p><p>In addition the HEA, on behalf of my Department, issued a call to ITE providers for proposals for programmes to upskill registered teachers in targeted post-primary subjects (Spanish, mathematics and physics).  The programmes, which commenced in January 2021, are provided over two years on a part-time, flexible basis.  There is no fee charge for participating teachers.</p><p>Earlier this year I, along with my colleague Minister Harris, announced an additional programme to upskill teachers in Irish, to begin in 2022. My Department is currently engaging with the HEA in regard to a call to ITE providers for the provision of this programme.</p><p>My Department also introduced the &lsquo;Scheme to Share Teachers between Recognised Post-Primary Schools&rsquo; to facilitate an arrangement whereby two schools can share a teacher to teach subjects in both schools. The objectives of the Scheme are to assist schools in filling vacancies in high priority subjects and to enhance teaching hours for teachers in employment on less than full hours.  </p><p>A number of measures have been taken by education partners which are aimed at matching teachers with teaching vacancies. <i>Turasabhaile</i>, a service developed by the post-primary school management bodies and the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals, matches registered teachers, resident abroad with post-primary vacancies in schools here at home. The Irish Primary Principals&rsquo; Network is also developing a new central portal for the recruitment of teachers to long-term positions in both primary and post-primary schools. It is anticipated that this portal will be available to schools and teachers in the coming months.</p><p>In November 2019, my Department published a technical report<b></b>&ldquo;Developing a Teacher Demand and Supply Model for Ireland 2020-2036&rdquo;.  The report was updated in May 2021 with projections of teacher demand and supply to 2038.  Ultimately, the intention is to establish a robust data based model for the effective projection of future teacher demand and supply across the school system. The report projects that, at post-primary level, the demand for teachers, on a no policy change basis, will follow a largely downward trend to 2032. It is important to note that the report&rsquo;s projections are based on high level demographics and to demonstrate trends in demand and supply. Work is ongoing in my Department to produce projections of post primary teacher demand and supply on a subject level basis to inform future teacher supply planning.</p><p>The various measures to support teacher supply are underpinned by the <i>Teaching Transforms</i>campaign, which promotes the teaching profession and encourages students to follow a career in teaching. The campaign uses digital, radio and video media, and is supported by a dedicated webpage, www.gov.ie/teachingtransforms.</p><p>My Department will continue, with the cooperation of the education partners, to develop and implement measures to support the supply of teachers to our schools.</p></reply>

The majority of children with special needs attend mainstream education with additional supports</p><p>Next year, my Department will spend in excess of &euro;2 Billion, or over 25% of the Department&rsquo;s budget on providing additional teaching and care supports for children with special educational needs. </p><p>Only where it has been assessed that the child is unable to be supported in mainstream education, are special class placements or special school placements recommended and provided for.</p><p>It is therefore not the case that special educational placements are required to support all children with special educational needs, nor is it intended that this should be the case.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide. It has well established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents.  NCSE seeks to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special education placements.  </p><p>In respect of the case in question I understand the NCSE has met with and are continuing to engage with the child&rsquo;s parents to discuss the options available until a Special School Placement is found.  The NCSE has allocated 1 additional Special Needs Assistant to the school to support this child and this remains in place. </p><p>My Department is concerned to ensure that an appropriate solution is put in place for this child and my officials are liaising with the NCSE in that regard.  In the meantime, the local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) continues to be available to assist and advise both schools and the parents of children with special educational needs.

A review of the supply panels has taken place and approximately 100 additional teachers are being added to existing/new areas where significant challenges have been demonstrated in sourcing substitution.  Posts have been allocated to the base schools to allow arrangements for the recruitment of additional staff immediately.</p><p>The Supply Panels work alongside the existing methods of sourcing substitute teachers, such as the national substitution portal service <i>Sub Seeker</i>, operated by the Irish Primary Principals' Network and developed in accordance with my Department's Teacher Supply Action Plan. Schools can also make local arrangements to have their own regular substitutes to call on if needed.  </p><p>In addition to the expansion of the supply panels, schools have been asked to combine their allocation of principal release days into clusters so as to form a full-time fixed-term post to cover each school's principal release days</p><p>For the current school year, changes have been made to the career break scheme to permit teachers on career break to carry out unlimited substitute work. Changes have also been made to the job sharing scheme to permit job sharing teachers carry out substitute work on the days they are rostered off in their own or in other schools. </p><p>The Teaching Council have undertaken a communications campaign to contact the 111,700 teachers on its register to raise awareness to the current teacher substitute challenges and to ask those teachers where possible to make themselves available for substitution in schools and to register on SubSeeker.ie so that schools are aware of their availability when seeking to fill substitute vacancies.</p><p>The Council and my Department have also engaged with higher education institutions, who have been requested to be flexible in programme delivery to enhance the availability of PME student teachers to undertake substitution work. PME students have also been advised to register with the Teaching Council and to register with <i>Sub Seeker</i>.</p><p>My Department will continue to engage with the education stakeholders on the issues raised about the current difficulty in accessing substitutes for teacher absences.</p></reply>

The Department&rsquo;s Wellbeing Policy Statement and Framework for Practice sets out the ambition and vision of the Department that the promotion of wellbeing will be at the core of the ethos of every school and centre for education in Ireland and that all schools will provide evidence-informed approaches and support, appropriate to need, to promote the wellbeing of their students.</p><p>There are currently extensive training and curricular supports, including through the Social Personal Health Education (SPHE) curriculum, the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) and the Webwise Programme, to assist schools in the development of policies and practices on the safe use of the internet and on the prevention of bullying including cyber-bullying. The Report on the Review of Relationships and Sexuality Education in primary and post-primary schools places a strong focus on issues such as safe use of the internet, social media and its effects on relationships and self-esteem.</p><p>The PDST and its Webwise team have developed dedicated resources for teachers, parents, children and young people which gives practical information and advice on the safe, ethical and responsible use of the internet and addresses key issues such as cyberbullying, sexting, image sharing, respectful communication, social media, popular apps and more. The Webwise resources are available at www.webwise.ie.</p><p>The Digital Strategy for Schools 2015-2020 also promotes the development of digital literacy in our young people and the importance of respectful online communications. A new digital strategy is under development with planned publication early next year. Online safety will be an important feature of the new strategy.</p><p>My Department&rsquo;s Inspectorate is prioritising monitoring and gathering information about the implementation of anti-bullying measures in schools. As part of this work, the Inspectorate will also identify and report on examples of effective practice in relation to preventing and tacking bullying in schools. This will help provide evidence of the type of bullying that is occurring in our schools and examples of approaches that can be successful in dealing with it. An important part of the Inspectorate&rsquo;s work will be a focus on the priority actions of schools in relation to promoting a positive school culture and climate.</p><p>My Department also provides funding to the National Anti-Bullying Research and Resource Centre (ABC) in DCU towards its research and training programmes, an annual grant to the National Parents Council (Primary) for anti-bullying training and information for parents and funding to BeLonG To Youth Services to support delivery of the annual Stand Up campaign in post primary schools.  An annual grant is also provided by my Department  to  ABC to meet the  running  and development costs  of the national anti-bullying website, www.tacklebullying.ie providing a single point of information on the types and methods of bullying  as well as supports and information on how to deal with it  for young people, parents and teachers.</p><p>This year, on  Safer Internet Day,  the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Act 2020 (Coco&rsquo;s Law) was enacted. On that day, the Minister for Justice also  announced that an agreement had been reached between her  Department, ABC and  my Department,  to establish a &lsquo;<i>Research Observatory on Cyberbullying</i>&rsquo; focused on providing up-to-date research, advice and resources related to cyberbullying, cyberhate, and online harassment, and the implementation of Coco&rsquo;s Law.  </p><p>The Observatory team has put together an outline of an online research repository of resources on cyberbullying, cyberhate and online harassment which will be made available in early 2022 for researchers and the general public. It plans to host an online webinar before year-end where national and International experts share their knowledge on cyberbullying and online abuse with researchers and with the broader general public, including teachers, parents, and young people. It is also designing an interview study to collect data on teenagers&rsquo; experiences of cyberbullying, cyberhate and online harassment, within an Irish context. </p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, I recently announced that my Department will commence a review of my Department&rsquo;s 2013 Action Plan on Bullying and the 2013 Anti-bullying Procedures for Primary and Post-primary Schools. This review will take account of developments and relevant research since the action plan and procedures were published in 2013 and will specifically consider areas such as cyber bullying and gender identity bullying. The review will also give detailed consideration to the recommendations contained in the Oireachtas Joint Committee Report on School Bullying and the Impact on Mental Health.</p></reply>

Teachers, students and parents in a representative cross-section of 41 schools nationwide took part in a review of existing senior cycle purposes, pathways and programmes.

If, at any stage since starting work, a person has no PRSI contributions paid or credited for 2 full tax years in a row, they cannot be awarded credits again until they return to work and pay PRSI contributions for at least 26 weeks.  Contributions paid at Classes J, K, M or S cannot be used to satisfy this condition. </p>  <p>  As per the Departments records, the person concerned paid 6 A contributions in 2016,  2 A contributions in 2020 and has a break in her record from 2007 until 2016 and again until 2020.  As the person concerned has had a break in her record for 2 full tax years and hasn't paid 26 A contributions since returning to employment she does not have an entitlement to sign for credits.  </p>  <p>  The legislative provisions governing the award of credits are contained in Chapter 6 (section 33) of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005.

Overall policy is coordinated by the Department of Justice. Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, has statutory responsibility for the care and protection of victims of DSGBV under the Child and Family Agency Act 2013. Capital funding for approved housing bodies, including services that provide refuge accommodation for victims of DSGBV, is provided by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.</p>  <p>  I am informed by Tusla that support for victims of Domestic, Sexual, and Gender-Based Violence (DSGBV) in County Cavan is available through the services of Tearmann, which is based in Monaghan and funded by Tusla. Tearmann also provides outreach services in County Cavan. While there is no purpose-built refuge facility in this county at present, women can avail of emergency domestic violence accommodation in Counties Louth and Meath, where there are three refuges supported by Tusla. I am advised by Tusla that it has had some engagement with various local stakeholders about potential future refuge developments in this county.</p>  <p>  Tusla&rsquo;s &lsquo;Review of the Provision of Accommodation for Victims of Domestic Violence&rsquo; assesses the current and requisite distribution of safe emergency accommodation and has examined the current level of refuge provision, evidence of demand for services and unmet need, and analysis of proximity to refuge by local communities. The Review has been completed and is undergoing the final edit for publication. It is intended to publish the Review this month. Therefore, at present, I am not in a position to confirm if funding for refuges for victims of DSGBV will be established in County Cavan. However, in Budget 2022, Tusla has been allocated an additional &euro;41 million over the 2021 allocation. I have directed Tusla to use part of these additional resources to maintain supports for DSGBV services and address the recommendations arising from Tusla&rsquo;s Accommodation Review of refuge provision.</p>  <p>  My Department will be guided by the recommendations of the Review. I expect that the implementation process for the Review will identify priority areas where there is greatest urgency in achieving safe accommodation for victims of DSGBV. This process will also be guided by the Review in the consideration for refuge spaces over the longer term. The Review represents my commitment to prioritising and supporting victims of DSGBV. Implementation will require collaboration from a range of statutory and other bodies.

Tearmann also provides outreach services in several locations in both counties. While there is no purpose-built refuge facility in these counties at present, women can avail of emergency domestic violence accommodation in Counties Louth and Meath, where there are three refuges supported by Tusla. I am advised by Tusla that it has had some engagement with various local stakeholders about potential future refuge developments in these counties.</p>  <p>  I prioritised resources for Tusla in the Budget for 2021, so that it is meeting the needs of victims of DSGBV. This is particularly important in the context of COVID-19. Tusla designated services for victims of DSGBV as one of the Agency's top three priority service areas during the pandemic.</p>  <p>  My Department is providing Tusla with core funding of &euro;30 million this year to fund DSGBV services. This includes a &euro;2.7 million increase in core services, bringing core service provision to &euro;28 million, with an additional &euro;2 million of one-off contingency funding being made available to help services cope with the ongoing effects of COVID-19. In Budget 2022, Tusla has been allocated an additional &euro;41 million over the 2021 allocation. I have directed Tusla to use part of these additional resources to maintain supports for DSGBV services and address the recommendations arising from Tusla&rsquo;s Accommodation Review of refuge provision.</p></reply>

The Bill underwent Pre-Legislative Scrutiny in the first half of 2021 and the Joint Oireachtas Committee published its report in July. I am currently carefully considering the recommendations from that process and hope to publish this Bill by the end of the current parliamentary session. </p><p>Coroners are independent public officials who have the general duty to hold an inquest if they are of the opinion that the death or deaths may have occurred in a violent or unnatural manner or happened suddenly and from unknown causes.  The Coroners Act 1962 makes only limited provision in respect of exhumation and removal of a body, providing only for the Minister for Justice to order an exhumation at the request of the Coroner if the Coroner is informed by a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that a death or deaths may have occurred in a violent or unnatural manner. The Coroner cannot exhume for the purposes of identification. The Coroners Act does not provide for the establishment of Identification Programme, using DNA to establish familial matches, as proposed under the new legislation. </p><p>The proposed legislation is intended to complement the Coroners Act 1962 by providing a mechanism for guaranteed<i></i>intervention at the Tuam site, which otherwise would have been difficult to achieve. It does not remove the obligation on the coroner to hold an inquest where it is required under the 1962 Act and, importantly, where the remains show evidence of violent or unnatural death, the Director overseeing the intervention must immediately inform the coroner within whose district the remains were recovered and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p><p>In May 2021, draft legislation was published to guarantee a clear right of access to birth and early information for all persons who are adopted and others who have questions in relation to their origins. The proposed Birth Information and Tracing legislation aims to enshrine in law the importance of a person knowing his or her origins. I am giving careful considerations to all feedback received on the draft legislation as part of the process of drafting the Bill. </p></reply>

Currently the group is monitoring the CES Phase Two Action Plan which covers the period 2019 &ndash; 2021. </p>  <p>  Key areas of recent progress under the CES to progress equal employment for persons with disabilities, including those with blindness or visual impairment, involve the production of an online training programme to support employers in becoming &ldquo;disability confident" and of a Guide to Promoting Inclusive Employment, the latter by the Public Appointment Service, and the funding and establishment of a disability information service for employers . This service, &lsquo;Employers for Change: A Disability Information Service&rsquo;, provides advice and information on employing staff with disabilities, with a view to enhancing the confidence and competence of individual employers to employ, manage and retain staff with disabilities.</p>  <p>  An Action Plan for Phase Three of the CES covering the 2022-2024 period is currently being developed.  Its focus will be on achieving implementation of the six strategic priorities and on encouraging companies to employ people with disabilities, including those with blindness or visual impairment.</p></reply>

Both the joint communique and an initial response from Ireland were published on the UN website on 10 November. </p>  <p>  The Government is committed to addressing the legacy of Mother and Baby institutions in a transparent and survivor-centred manner. The publication of the Final Report of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes in January of this year was accompanied by a formal apology by An Taoiseach and a Government commitment to a Strategic Action Plan encompassing a suite of 22 specific measures. </p>  <p>  This Action Plan, which was published yesterday, takes account of the Commission of Investigation&rsquo;s recommendations, as well as the priority needs and concerns of survivors and former residents and their families, as established through engagement with those most affected.</p>  <p>  The General Scheme of a Certain Institutional Burials (Authorised Interventions) Bill, which was approved and published in December 2019, was designed to provide the required legal basis for intervention at the Tuam site and other locations should similar circumstances come to light.</p>  <p>  I referred the General Scheme to the Oireachtas for Pre-Legislative Scrutiny in January 2021. Numerous submissions were made to the Joint Oireachtas Committee and a number of people gave powerful and moving testimony. The Committee published its report on the legislation in July. I am currently carefully considering the recommendations from that process and hope to publish this Bill by the end of the current parliamentary session.</p>  <p>  As set out in Ireland&rsquo;s initial reply, consideration is also being given to the issues raised in relation to the proposed legislation in the joint communique. With regard to the concerns raised in relation to coronial jurisdiction, it is important to clarify that the proposed legislation is intended to complement the Coroners Act 1962 by providing a mechanism for guaranteed intervention at the Tuam site.  It does not remove the obligation on the coroner to hold an inquest where required under the 1962 Act and, where the remains show evidence of violent or unnatural death, the Director overseeing the intervention must immediately inform the coroner within whose district the remains were recovered and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></reply>

Details of the consultation, and findings arising from the process are set out on www.gov.ie/en/consultation/13be2-consultation-on-the-apprenticeship-action-plan-2021-2025/. </p>  <p>  In moving to a single model the objective is to build on the strengths of both the existing craft and the consortia led models. The single model must be capable of delivering apprenticeships which can flex to accommodate the rapid rate of change driven by technological adaption, digital and environmental transformation which is inherent in today&rsquo;s economy while retaining the high standards required from Ireland&rsquo;s apprenticeship system.</p>  <p>  The existing craft apprenticeship structure relies on a heavily standardised approach to the 25 existing programmes, with academic oversight and curriculum development undertaken by a central body (SOLAS).  All craft apprenticeships are four years in duration, with the majority of programmes following a standard seven phase approach of on-the-job and off-the-job training. Advice from the partners on the structure and content of the apprenticeships is through a subcommittee of the SOLAS Board, with Phase 2 delivery undertaken across the Education and Training Boards (ETBs) and phase 4 and 6 undertaken in the Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) through the HEA. There is significant partnership and buy-in from the education and industry partners and a well established reputation internationally.  </p>  <p>  The existing system has seen two major shocks in the past 15 years, firstly the 2007 housing and economic crash and most recently the COVID-19 pandemic.  While those involved in apprenticeship delivery have moved to meet the challenges presented on both occasions, the need for rapid movement has also highlighted limitations of the more centralised craft apprenticeship system compared to individual consortia who had more flexibility to adapt delivery and assessment processes to the changed environment. </p>  <p>  The existing consortia-led or post-2016 apprenticeships operate under a structure whereby the academic content of the apprenticeship is agreed by a consortium of education and training providers, employers and relevant partners with the off-the-job training delivery managed by coordinating providers who are themselves part of the consortium. This approach has allowed for rapid re-alignment of off-the job training delivery to allow for apprenticeships to continue insofar as possible during the COVID-19 period, proving resilience and flexibility under testing conditions.  Apprentice Occupational Profiles, including QQI level and duration are approved at national level through the Apprenticeship Council. </p>  <p>  Over the period of the action plan, the dual system of programme governance will be replaced by a single distributed system of programme governance &ndash; the single apprenticeship system.  Responsibility for curriculum and apprenticeship content will be placed close to where activity is taking place which will leverage the core strengths of education and training providers, employers and partners who are immersed in the respective industry. It will also foster the integration of apprenticeship within the quality assurance arrangements of the educational institutions across further and higher education.  The new National Apprenticeship Office will bring together the oversight and funding roles of SOLAS and the HEA as they relate to apprenticeship into a single office, providing national level oversight of all apprenticeships. The office will provide support for the new apprenticeship consortia and will be informed by the National Apprenticeship Alliance which will comprise stakeholder representatives, including a subcommittee focussed on advising measures for broadening diversity in the apprentice population.  Therefore, while there is a move towards a distributed model of apprenticeship, there is a significantly changed and enhanced role for national level governance and oversight mechanisms.</p>  <p>  The process by which this transition will take place will be planned in close collaboration with apprenticeship stakeholders, including union partners, through representation on the National Apprenticeship Advisory Committee and the National Apprenticeship Alliance.   </p></reply>

In the case of the 37 apprenticeships established since 2016, the rate of pay is agreed between the apprentice and the employer. The minimum rate of pay for the 25 craft apprenticeships are agreed by the partners within the relevant sector, or are set out in Sectoral Employment Orders (Construction Sector and Mechanical Engineering Building Services Contracting Sector). Minimum agreed rates vary between occupations and sectors but in all cases craft apprenticeship rates are expressed as a proportion of the qualified rate, from 33% of the qualified rate in year one to 90% in year four. All apprentices are excluded from the provisions of the National Minimum Wage Act 2000.</p>  <p>  Neither the Department or SOLAS monitor or collect data in relation to apprentice wages other than in relation to the payment of training allowances.  Training allowances paid to craft apprentices by Education and Training Boards (through the Education Shared Business Services) on periods of off the job training are based in the agreed industry rate. </p>  <p>  The core regulatory standards for apprenticeship provided for in the 1967 Act have been enhanced through statutory rules and administrative guidance. A significant number of measures are in place to support and protect the apprentice. The Apprenticeship Code of Practice, which specifies the rights and responsibilities of apprentices and employers and is signed by both parties, forms the basis of each apprenticeship contract.  In tandem with adherence to core regulatory standards, apprenticeships are underpinned by a strong framework of quality assurance to ensure programmes provide a high quality learning experience for apprentices.</p>  <p>  Under the new Action Plan apprentices will be supported to complete their programmes through clearer communication, support networks and increased ownership of their learning journey. The voice of apprentices in shaping the future of the system will be formalised within the single system of apprenticeship, enhancing the existing apprentice feedback mechanism which is inherent in the QQI quality processes. Apprentices will be included both looking to the future through representation on the apprenticeship stakeholder oversight and advisory structures and also through an annual survey of apprentices which will provide a robust system view for the prior year. This will provide multiple fora through which apprentices may voice concerns over any issues pertaining to the conditions of their employment, which may then be addressed directly.   Monitoring medium to long term outcomes for apprentices will also be formalised through the commencement of graduate tracking.  </p></reply>

They comprise of a standard seven phase programme of alternating on-the-job and off-the-job phases. The off-the-job training for these programmes is delivered in Training Centres, Institutes of Technology and Technological Universities. Given the practical nature of off-the-job training for craft apprentices, the shutdown of on-site learning activity in 2020 and 2021 had a significant impact on the ability of craft apprentices to progress through their course.</p><p>At the end of October 10,333 craft apprentices were waiting for access to off-the-job training.  6,426 of these were waiting over 6 months, of which 3,942 of these were waiting longer than one year.  The average waiting time is being collated and will be forwarded to the Deputy once available. </p><p>In addition to the general activity surrounding a return to on-site learning across the further and higher education sector a number of specific actions were put in place to support craft apprentices to progress in their training in a timely manner.</p><p>2022 will see an increase of over 3,100 off-the-job training places being made available across craft apprenticeship phases 2, 4 and 6 over 2021 scheduled numbers (pre-COVID expected provision). This additional capacity has already begun to come on-stream from September 2021 and will be delivered under a three-step response plan agreed by SOLAS, HEA and education and training providers. The immediate focus is on the three craft apprenticeships with the longest waiting lists, namely Electrical, Plumbing and Carpentry &amp;amp; Joinery.  </p><p>For Phase 2, which is delivered in ETBs, a focused, time-limited response will increase the number of intakes per year from two to three. Planning is also underway for further expansion of workshops to facilitate additional classes in 2022. Phase 2 off-the-job training capacity is expected to increase to 5,390 places in 2022. Phase 4 and 6 training is delivered in Institutes of Technology and Technological Universities. In the region of 8,800 off-the-job training places will be provided across phases 4 and 6 in 2022, growing to over 9,000 off-the-job training places the following year.</p><p>&euro;17m additional funding was provided under Budget 2022 to facilitate the response to the backlogs across SOLAS and the HEA. Subject to continued access to workshops and training facilities in addition to the rollout of additional places, it is expected that the majority of craft apprentices waiting for off-the-job training at Phases 4 and 6 will be called in the early months of 2022. The waiting list for Phase 2 apprentices is expected to be completely cleared by the end of 2022. Public updates on actions taken to address the waiting lists are posted on www.apprenticeship.ie<i><font color="#0000FF"> </font></i>to ensure that information is available to  apprentices, employers and prospective apprentices. </p></reply>

However, the nature of the naturalisation process is such that, for a broad range of reasons, some cases will take longer than others to process. In some instances, completing the necessary checks can take a considerable period of time. </p>  <p>  In addition, the combined impact of the 2019 High Court judgment in the Jones case and the necessary health restrictions arising from the pandemic, has resulted in the processing time for standard applications increasing. </p>  <p>  However, my Department is taking a number of steps to speed up the processing of applications and a number of digitisation measures have also been introduced to increase efficiency in the process, including eTax clearance, eVetting and online payments. The end result of the digitisation process will be to free up more staff to focus on processing applications in a timely and efficient manner, to improve service to our customers and reduce waiting times. </p>  <p>  This year, we are on track to deliver approximately 11,000 decisions, significantly exceeding the levels achieved in the last two years. Additional staff have also been assigned to the citizenship team.  Based on these measures, my Department's objective is to achieve an improved timeframe of 6-9 months for decisions on a majority of applications during 2022. </p></reply>

However, they will still be recorded as a refusal of leave to land. </p><p>Arrangements for the removal of persons refused permission to enter the State are essentially operational matters for the GNIB who work closely with civilian immigration officers on these matters. Detention of a person refused entry to the State is only undertaken as a last resort. There is a statutory obligation to return a person refused entry permission as soon as is practicable. Non-custodial measures, such as a requirement to report to a Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na station or a requirement to reside in a specified place, are widely used as alternatives to detention.</p><p>Section 5 of the Immigration Act, 2003 (as amended by the International protection Act, 2015), contains the main provisions dealing with the removal from the State of persons refused permission to enter. It specifies that a person to whom this section applies may be arrested by an immigration officer or a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and detained in a prescribed place of detention for the purpose of facilitating their removal from the State, which must be as soon as is practicable. It also provides that a person may be detained for a period not exceeding 12 hours at the airport or port from which the person is due to depart.</p><p>Work has been completed on a new Block F in Cloverhill remand prison which is intended to be used to accommodate people detained for immigration purposes and ensure they can be housed separately from people on remand. The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic required significant measures within the Irish Prison Service (IPS) to manage and control infection risk, and it was necessary to re-purpose Block F as an isolation unit for those prisoners who have, or are suspected of having, the virus. It is intended that when the pandemic is over, Block F will revert to its original intended use, subject to the availability of staff and the impact on resources. While this will address the situation in the immediate term, work is also proceeding on the consideration of a longer-term sustainable and compliant solution as part of my Justice Plan 2021. However, the Deputy will appreciate that there are complex issues arising and a detailed assessment of the feasibility of the various options is required and work is ongoing in that regard.</p><p>The former Transaer building at Dublin airport has been refitted and now contains the new Dublin Airport Garda station and additional office facilities occupied by the GNIB. I understand that the GNIB took up residence in the office facility during July 2019 and the local Garda&iacute; moved into the new Garda Station during December 2019. The Garda station contains four one person cells and two additional detention rooms. While the building works have completed, the cells have not been fully commissioned at this time and outstanding matters are being addressed by the authorities. It is intended that the GNIB will detain persons refused leave to land, overnight at the Dublin Airport Garda station when the detention facilities are fully commissioned.</p></reply>

We must ensure there cannot be such serious safeguarding failures in other settings.</p>  <p>  To strengthen the health and social care sector&rsquo;s wider adult safeguarding framework, the Department of Health is currently developing a national policy on adult safeguarding in the health and social care sector, which includes disability services.

Public health advice remains that those who are not fully vaccinated should avoid congregated indoor settings for their own and others safety.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, a series of decisions were taken over the summer months and more recently so that all aspects of the economy and society have now reopened. However, in line with the public health advice above, access to more high risk activities and settings is restricted to those who have been fully protected by vaccination or who have had a previous COVID-19 infection. </p>  <p>  HIQA undertook an evidence review on higher-risk environments and activities for NPHET in November 2020, drawing on national and international evidence. There is a growing body of evidence on the activities or settings associated with a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. In particular, there is evidence in relation to the higher risk associated with indoor environments due to the increased likelihood of crowded spaces, prolonged and intense contact with others, poor ventilation, and noise levels, and the higher risk associated with certain activities including dining, drinking, exercising, singing or shouting.

That Policy set out the roadmap for the future provision of oral healthcare to the eligible population. It has two key goals; first, to provide the supports to enable every individual to achieve their best oral health, and second, to reduce oral health inequalities across the population, by enabling vulnerable groups to access oral healthcare and improve their oral health. </p>  <p>  The Dental Treatment Services Scheme, which dates from the 1990s is available to medical card holders aged 16 and over. The dental care is provided by independent dental practitioners who have a contract with the HSE. Patients may choose to have their treatment undertaken by any dentist who participates in the scheme. The Scheme covers a dental examination, two fillings in each calendar year, prescriptions, denture repairs and extractions as necessary. Other more complex treatments such as the provision of dentures require the approval of the HSE before the dentist can proceed and in this case the dentist applies directly to the HSE.</p>  <p>  There is a need to align the DTSS with best international evidence and practice, and legislation, as outlined in Smile agus Sl&aacute;inte, the National Oral Health Policy. Regretfully, the COVID-19 pandemic caused the roll-out of the Policy to be delayed and the proposed review of the DTSS contract to be deferred.</p>  <p>  Nevertheless, there has been continued engagement between my officials, the HSE and the dental community throughout the pandemic on infection control measures, guidelines for safe dental practice, and ensuring that dental professionals were included in the high-risk group for early vaccination. This sustained engagement was with a view to ensuring that a safe satisfactory service could be continued for the eligible population.</p>  <p>  I have acknowledged that there is a need for a substantive review of the DTSS and have given a commitment that the review would be undertaken. I have also acknowledged the immediate issues of concern with current arrangements under the Scheme.</p>  <p>  I instructed my officials to hold talks with the IDA to address both issues. I am aware that preliminary talks were held in June this year and that it is proposed to hold further talks in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  I would also wish to point out that I secured additional funding of &euro;10 million in Budget 2022 to address immediate issues with the DTSS, which is on top of the annual allocation of &euro;56 million for 2022.</p></reply>

The committee's recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation. It makes recommendations on vaccination policy to my Department. The NIAC continues to revise recommendations to allow for the introduction of new vaccines in Ireland and to keep abreast of changes in the patterns of disease. Therefore, the immunisation schedule will continue to be amended over time.</p><p>In 2009, the NIAC recommended HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccination for all 12 to 13 year old girls to reduce their risk of developing cervical cancer when they are adults. In September 2010, the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of secondary school.</p><p>In June 2017, on foot of the NIAC&rsquo;s recommendation that the HPV vaccine should also be given to boys, my Department asked the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to undertake a health technology assessment (HTA) to establish the clinical and cost-effectiveness of extending the immunisation programme to include boys in the first year of secondary school.</p><p>The HIQA completed the HTA in December 2018, recommending that the HPV immunisation programme be extended to include boys. A policy decision was made to extend the HPV immunisation programme to include boys, starting in September 2019, with the introduction of a 9-valent HPV vaccine.</p><p>The ages at which vaccines are recommended in the immunisation schedule are chosen by the NIAC in order to give each child the best possible protection against vaccine preventable diseases. As the HPV vaccine is preventative it is intended to be administered, if possible, before a person becomes sexually active, that is, before a person is first exposed to HPV infection.</p><p>Therefore, the gender-neutral HPV vaccination programme targets all girls and boys in first year of secondary school to provide maximum coverage. All vaccines administered through the School Immunisation Programme are provided free of charge.</p><p>My Department will continue to be guided by NIAC's recommendations on any emerging evidence on this issue in the future.</p><p>Anyone not in 1st year of secondary school or age equivalent in special schools or home schooled during the 2020/2021 school year who wishes to get the HPV vaccine, must go to their GP or sexual health clinic and pay privately for the vaccine and its administration. This applies to everyone whether or not they have a medical card/GP visit card, as it is outside of the HPV immunisation programme.</p><p>My Department has asked the National Immunisation Advisory Committee to consider the clinical effectiveness of providing the HPV vaccine to:</p><p>- girls and boys in secondary school who were eligible to receive HPV vaccine in 1st year but who did not receive it; and</p><p>- women up to the age of 25 years who have left secondary school and who did not receive the vaccine when eligible.</p><p>If NIAC conclude that there is sufficient evidence to support providing the HPV vaccine to one or both groups, HIQA will undertake a cost-effectiveness assessment on that basis.</p></reply>

Public health advice remains that those who are not fully vaccinated should avoid congregated indoor settings for their own and others safety.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware, the National Public Health Emergency Team gave some consideration to the issues arising for those people that can&rsquo;t receive a COVID-19 vaccine for medical reasons as part of its discussions on the 18th October 2021 on the continuing response to COVID-19 and the extension of Covid Pass arrangements. The matter is being given further consideration.</p><p>The Deputy may wish to be aware that on 15 July, NIAC made a recommendation, which was endorsed by the Chief Medical Officer and accepted by the Minister for Health that while the preference was for homologous vaccination regimens (using the same vaccine as part of a two dose regime) that selective use of heterologous vaccination schedules (two different vaccines used as part of two dose regime) should be permitted where a second vaccine dose of a homologous regimen is contraindicated, irrespective of whether the first dose was an mRNA or adenoviral vector vaccine. NIAC in conjunction with the RCPI and the Irish Association of Allergy and Immunology have prepared a guide to aid vaccinators and other healthcare workers on how to advise allergic individuals in respect of receiving a COVID-19 vaccine, this guide is available here: rcpi-live-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/FAQs-about-COVID19-Vaccines-and-Allergies_12August2021.pdf </p></reply>

These include (a) a reduction in capacity to comply with public health guidance, (b) restrictions on new entries, (c) closures due to outbreaks and (d) difficulties carrying out face to face assessments and validating waiting lists as many of the interactions are telephone only. </p>  <p>  Unfortunately, the necessary Covid-19 safeguards have resulted in increases in waiting times for residential addiction treatment across the country ranging from an average of 2-6 weeks in some services to an average of 6-9 months in other services. The HSE cannot change the capacity issues that have arisen due to the introduction of social distancing measures to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic.  </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the limitations of Covid-19, the Department of Health provided an additional &euro;2 million for residential drug and alcohol treatment services in 2021. This funding will provide an additional 100 stabilisation treatment episodes as part of the North East Inner City initiative, a further 150 episodes nationally in tier 4 residential treatment services and 100 treatment episodes in a residential step-up treatment facility for CHOs 3, 4 and 5. </p>  <p>  In addition, over &euro;1.3 million is being provided for the establishment of a 20 bed residential therapeutic community for expectant women and women with children in the mid-west region, which will cater for 125 episodes per annum.</p>  <p>  Altogether, this funding will provide an additional 475 treatment episodes. </p>  <p>  Public health guidance and support have been provided to residential services during Covid-19.  The restoring of rehabilitation beds to pre-Covid-19 levels will depend on public health guidance and the prevalence of Covid-19 in society.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge the challenges faced by service providers during Covid-19 and will continue to support service providers to fully resume services. </p></reply>

The strategic action plan for the period 2017 to 2020 contains 50 actions. The implementation of these actions is monitored through the national oversight structures, supported by the coordinated system of monitoring, research and evaluation set out in the strategy. </p>  <p>  The mid-term review of the strategy shows significant progress in implementing the action plan for the period 2017 to 2020, with only a small number of the 50 actions outstanding. We have improved access and availability of drug services, especially services for women, people who are homeless and those with heroin addiction. There is a new clinical programme for dual diagnosis and the government is championing an alternative health-led approach for the possession of drugs for personal use.</p>  <p>  I have announce six strategic priorities for the remaining years of the strategy until 2025. These will strengthen the health-led approach to drug use, as agreed in the Programme for Government, and align with the EU Drugs Strategy and Action Plan. I will now work with all stakeholders to agree additional actions under these priorities. </p>  <p>  The mid-term review  is available here www.gov.ie/en/press-release/1dda3-minister-feighan-publishes-mid-term-review-of-national-drugs-strategy-and-strategic-priorities-for-2021-2025/</p>  <p>  To support the implementation of the strategic priorities, I provided additional funding of &euro;6m for new health measures in Budget 2020.

I am reviewing all available options for the further protection of children in our schools. Following advice from the Chief Medical Officer, I have requested that the HSE, liaising as appropriate with the Department of Education, establish a programme of rapid antigen testing of close contacts in specific primary school settings in response to the notification of COVID-19 cases, guided by agreed thresholds and criteria informed by recently published ECDC guidance on the management of close contacts.</p>  <p>  Asymptomatic child household close contacts aged 13 years or less continue to be advised by the HSE to restrict their movements (stay at home) and the HSE will arrange PCR testing as appropriate. Asymptomatic children aged 13 or older (which includes children of secondary school age) who are fully vaccinated close contacts are already included in the HSE programme in which close contacts are provided with antigen tests for self-testing. Anyone with symptoms of COVID-19 is advised to immediately self-isolate and seek a PCR test through the HSE.</p>  <p>  Further information is available in the Guidance for COVID-19 Contact Tracing for Children (>3 months to under 13 years of age) published by the Health Protection and Surveillance Centre, available at www.hpsc.ie/a-z/respiratory/coronavirus/novelcoronavirus/guidance/educationguidance/Contact%20tracing%20under%2013s.pdf</p>  <p>  The role of testing and contact tracing, as part of the wider public health response, has been under ongoing review throughout the pandemic and will continue to be reviewed and amended in line with the epidemiological profile of the disease, its impact on healthcare utilisation and outcomes, the vaccination status of the population and ECDC guidance.</p></reply>

This means a farmer in receipt of CAP payments is obliged to retain existing hedgerows on their land.  This condition will continue under the next CAP.  </p>  <p>  In addition, I propose to broaden the Conditionality requirements so that a minimum of 4% of each farm must be devoted to ecologically beneficial features such as hedgerows and other nature- and biodiversity-rich features.  This will place a direct economic value on retaining and, where necessary, creating these features.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Eco-Scheme is a new annual agri-environmental scheme that farmers will be able to avail of under the next CAP.  I propose to use this scheme to build on Conditionality requirements including, for example, by rewarding farmers that have a higher proportion of their land devoted to ecologically beneficial features such as hedgerows. </p>  <p>  A flagship multi-annual Agri-Environmental Climate Measure is also proposed for the CAP Strategic Plan.  It will include specific, prescription-based, actions for new hedgerow planting and, where necessary, hedgerow rejuvenation by coppicing or laying. For two results-based field actions (low input grassland and multi-species leys) farmers will be rewarded for the quality of hedgerows and treelines.  This will encourage improved hedgerow management, and protect and enhance the carbon and biodiversity value of this landscape feature.</p></reply>

Moving funds into one scheme will mean reducing the funding available for another. All elements under the direct payments ceiling are inextricably linked and it is challenging to examine them in isolation. </p><p>My Department continues to engage with farmers, their representative organisations and our European colleagues in analysing the effects of all the proposed changes, including changes to convergence.  The outcome of these continued discussions and the results of these analyses assist the decision-making process on the implementation of new CAP regulations in Ireland.</p></reply>

The PPNs are the main link between these groups and their local authorities, and they enable the groups to make their voices heard within formal local decision-making structures. Over 18,000 volunteer-run groups nationwide are currently registered with a PPN.</p><p>My Department provides funding and a range of operational supports to PPNs at a national level so that local communities, including marginalised communities, can continue to have an influence on matters that affect them. The PPNs are accountable to my Department for their use of public monies and the activities they undertake on behalf of their communities. The Department also chairs and provides administrative support to the National PPN Advisory Group. </p><p>My Department is currently funding and advancing a number of important national initiatives and key recommendations made by PPN stakeholders in the PPNs' Annual Reports to promote their development (e.g. training, awareness-raising, IT support, Visions for Community Wellbeing). Two important initiatives supported by my Department in this regard are the national training course for PPN stakeholders, which is currently underway, and a communications campaign due to be conducted next year. The Department also recently published a PPN Handbook to assist and guide the PPNs and stakeholders in their day to day work.</p><p>In 2021, my Department also commissioned an independent 'root and branch' review of PPN structures to make recommendations that will support the ongoing development of PPNs. The final review report is expected to be complete by the end of 2021.</p><p>Information on the number of staff in each PPN is enclosed with this response. In total, there were 55.7 whole-time equivalent staff members across the network 31 PPNs in 2020. It is important to note that not all PPN staff are employees of their corresponding Local Authority. PPNs can be &lsquo;hosted&rsquo; by a number of bodies who may provide a legal structure for their operation as employers as necessary. While the majority of PPNs are hosted by their Local Authority, others have established independent companies or entered into hosting arrangements with local community/non-profit Companies Limited by Guarantee (CLGs) to act as employers.</p><p>Under Section 46 of the Local Government Reform Act 2014, each Local Authority must have a local PPN structure, which <i>'shall seek to provide for participation by the local community'</i>. Circular CVSP 1/2014 specifies that<i>'the PPN will be the main link through which the local authority connects with the community, voluntary and environmental sectors without prejudice to other consultation processes.'</i> <table>    <tr>       <th>PPN</th>       <th>Resource Worker (WTE)</th>       <th>Administrator / Support Worker (WTE)</th>       <th>Development Worker (WTE)</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Carlow</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cavan</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>0.5</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Clare</td>       <td>1.6</td>       <td>0.4</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork County</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Donegal</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin City</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>D&uacute;n Laoghaire/ Rathdown</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>0.8</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Fingal</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway City</td>       <td>0.7</td>       <td>0.75</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway County</td>       <td>0.5</td>       <td>1.25</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerry</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilkenny</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Laois</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Leitrim</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick</td>       <td>0.75</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Longford</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mayo</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Meath</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Monaghan</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Offaly</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Roscommon</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Sligo</td>       <td>0.6</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>South Dublin</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>0.85</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Tipperary</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Waterford</td>       <td>1.5</td>       <td>0.5</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Westmeath</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wexford</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wicklow</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>TOTAL: 55.7</td>       <td>26.65</td>       <td>28.05</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-11-17a.750.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1563" speakername="Joe O'Brien" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021111700087#WRU02800"><p>My officials have regular engagement with the Department of Health regarding the National Drugs Strategy.  My Department is represented on its Oversight Group and recently participated in the mid-term review of the strategy.</p>  <p>  The strategy is relevant to my Department's work in the community and voluntary sectors as it is vital in ensuring the collective input of the statutory, community and voluntary sectors, to provide a coordinated response to drug and alcohol use in Irish society.</p>  <p>  The strategy also involves mobilising communities and building their resilience to respond to the drug problem, particularly marginalised communities.  This links well with my Department&rsquo;s Social Inclusion &amp;amp; Community Activation Programme (SICAP) which supports those hardest to reach, and those who are most at risk of marginalisation. </p>  <p>  The Department has two main goals within the strategy, which relate to providing community supports in collaboration with schools and other youth programmes, and improving the life chances of those that are marginalised in society.   Both goals are implemented under SICAP which provides &euro;200m to Local Development Companies over six years to work with marginalised individuals and groups.  </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to assist with the important work of the National Drugs Strategy into the future.</p></reply>
