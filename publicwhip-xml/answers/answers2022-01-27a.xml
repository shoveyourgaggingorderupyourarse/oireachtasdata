This ensures that the Passport Service protects the rights of the child and their guardians. </p>  <p>  Due to the rigorous checking process in place, the processing time for first time applications is currently 40 working days. This compares to 10 working days for simple adult online renewals and 15 working days for complex and child online renewals.   </p>  <p>  When passport applicants do not provide all of the required documentation to the Passport Service, unfortunately, it can take much longer to process the application and issue a passport. There are currently 73,000 first time applications on hand with the Passport Service. Of these, 32,000 or 43% are incomplete applications. In these cases, the onus is on the applicants to submit required documentation to complete the application so that their passport can be issued. The experience of the Passport Service is that it can take weeks and sometimes months to receive the necessary documents after an applicant applies online. </p>  <p>  It is a priority for the Passport Service to improve processing times for first time applicants in 2022. The ongoing staff recruitment drive and upskilling of existing staff will greatly assist with this. There are also a number of system and website improvements being implemented that will help to enhance customer experience.</p>  <p>  Given the level of demand expected by the Passport Service this year, I urge anyone who intends to travel in 2022 to apply online now for their passports.</p></reply>

This followed calls between us in October and December last year. We discussed the ongoing EU-UK discussions on the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland, bilateral relations, developments in Northern Ireland and current foreign policy priorities. </p>  <p>  With regard to the ongoing EU-UK discussions, I emphasised that Ireland and the EU remain fully committed to providing certainty and stability for people and business in Northern Ireland. I noted that the Protocol is the joint EU&ndash;UK solution to mitigate against the disruption Brexit causes for citizens and businesses on the island of Ireland and that it can work if we allow it to, with flexibility and pragmatism. As you will know, Commission Vice President &Scaron;efcovic and Foreign Secretary Truss held meetings on 13-14 January, and earlier this week on 24 January.  </p>  <p>  With reference to the wider context, I raised my ongoing commitment to work towards strengthening bilateral relations post-Brexit and suggested approaches to consider. We discussed the importance of intensifying inter-parliamentary links and ongoing collaboration in key sectors. </p>  <p>  With regard to developments in Northern Ireland, I spoke in favour of a partnership approach between our governments based on the Good Friday Agreement. I also outlined the Government&rsquo;s consistent position in relation to legacy and the importance of a collective approach to find an agreed way forward on this most sensitive of issues.</p>  <p>  We also discussed our ongoing cooperation on the UN Security Council, as well as a range of global and foreign policy issues, including developments in Ukraine.</p></reply>

The Fund has supported over 3,000 projects with more than &euro;60 million in grant funding since its establishment.  </p>  <p>  In spring 2021, I approved a new strategy for the Reconciliation Fund for the period 2021-2024, to ensure that the Fund continues to support our vision of a reconciled Ireland and remains relevant, effective, and efficient over the coming years, particularly given the difficult contexts of Brexit and COVID-19.  To support implementation of this ambitious new strategy, I have also increased the Reconciliation Fund budget, with grants awarded in 2022 expected to reach &euro;5.0m, up from a budget of &euro;3.7m in 2020.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Reconciliation Fund continues to make a vital and effective contribution to peace on these islands through its support for reconciliation based projects in a range of sectoral and geographic areas. </p>  <p>  To ensure that maximum benefit is achieved with available financial resources, applications undergo a rigorous assessment stage, including consideration by an Interdepartmental Consultative Committee, to ensure that those projects with greatest potential impact and strongest alignment to the criteria of the Fund, are supported.  Formal written reporting is required on completion of projects.  The impact of projects is also assessed through engagement with funded organisations and on-site monitoring visits.  </p>  <p>  Formal reporting and the feedback we get on the ground at community and political levels (as well as via our annual Reconciliation Networking Forum), indicate that our grants are effective in fulfilling the objectives of the Fund.  </p>  <p>  I recognise that Brexit has led to more civic discussion and debate about constitutional change, and I believe that the Reconciliation Fund has an important role to play in supporting initiatives in this area, by funding opportunities for research and inclusive dialogue which aim to foster greater mutual understanding and sustainable North-South links.  </p></reply>

Ireland is also consistently found to be the most principled donor by the respected international thinktank ODI, in particular for our focus on those furthest behind. </p><p>Since taking up our seat on the UN Security Council last year, Ireland has consistently called for full respect of human rights and international humanitarian law, and unhindered humanitarian access to all those in need. Last year, Ireland and Norway successfully led negotiations on the renewal of the critical Syria humanitarian cross-border resolution. It ensured that life-saving humanitarian aid was able to continue to reach 3.4 million Syrian men, women and children in the northwest of the country.</p><p>We have also worked hard to ensure that the Security Council&rsquo;s attention is focused on the humanitarian and human rights situations in many parts of the world.  Security Council attention to such situations as Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Myanmar and Yemen will remain a priority throughout the rest of our term.</p><p>My Department is implementing a comprehensive approach to our work in conflict-affected settings. This uses our development cooperation assistance, our political engagement and partnerships, and our membership of the UN Security Council to deliver for those in greatest need. This approach ensures that humanitarian, development and peace activities are coordinated under common objectives, and it puts &ldquo;lasting peace&rdquo; for affected communities at the centre of all our actions. </p><p>Decisions about the channels for the delivery of aid, be it bilateral or multilateral, are informed by the circumstances and context of a given crisis or development need.  The United Nations system and the International Committee of the Red Cross and Red Crescent are important partners given their ability to respond.  Amongst OECD countries, Ireland allocates one of the highest percentages of our development assistance to NGOs, while Ireland's partner countries in Africa and elsewhere are an expression of our bilateral solidarity.</p></reply>

The Irish Embassy in Ankara remains accredited to Iran.</p>  <p>  The second phase will involve the re-opening of a full Embassy in Tehran with a resident Irish Ambassador in 2023 and planning is already underway for this.</p></reply>

It reiterates Ireland&rsquo;s strong commitment to supporting and protecting civil society space. It also commits to strengthening collaboration with Irish civil society partners on public engagement and outreach.</p>  <p>  My Department publishes a report annually on Ireland's Official Development Assistance (ODA) programme, known as Irish Aid, and these are available on the website. The reports include statistical information on programme expenditure showing the distribution of aid, including the total amounts given to civil society organisations.</p>  <p>  With regard to figures for 2021, validation of data on Ireland&rsquo;s ODA programme is done in arrears. Prior to publication, draft statistical returns are shared with the relevant OECD Development Assistance Committee experts for assurance that Ireland's reported spending meets the internationally accepted criteria of what can be counted as ODA.  This assurance is important to maintaining Ireland's reputation as a quality donor. The 2021 Report will be published later this year.</p>  <p>  Ireland is amongst the OECD donors which provide the greatest percentage of bilateral assistance to civil society organisations, typically around double the OECD average. The 2020 OECD DAC Peer Review of Ireland found that &ldquo;Ireland&rsquo;s partnerships with civil society are particularly strong and are characterised by mutual trust, quality funding based on clear criteria and an open culture for substantive, regular dialogue&rdquo;.  It also found that Ireland is a global leader in promoting civil society space and that our partnerships with civil society are a hallmark of our development co-operation. </p></reply>

Globally, gender-based violence has increased as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated restrictions. </p>  <p>  Ireland is among OECD countries with the highest annual proportion of official development assistance (ODA) invested in gender equality measures, including the reduction of gender-based violence. </p>  <p>  Ireland funds initiatives to this end through Irish and international NGOs, the UN and through our country programmes, mostly in Africa. In 2021, my Department, through the Irish Aid programme, committed approximately &euro;15 million annually to address gender based violence.  This includes partnerships with the International Rescue Committee, and the UN Trust Fund to End Violence Against Women, which supports grassroots efforts in over 80 countries. The UN Population Fund (UNFPA) is a longstanding partner of Ireland&rsquo;s. They address gender based violence by providing sexual and reproductive health services, explicitly combating harmful practices such as genital mutilation and child marriage.  Irish Aid's support for education for girls also helps keeps girls safe.</p>  <p>  My Department is also a member of the Irish Consortium on Gender Based Violence. The Consortium facilitates advocacy, learning and capacity building of Irish NGOs to respond to GBV.   </p>  <p>  In recent years, my Department has supported work to prevent and respond to gender-based violence in a large number of countries, including Palestine, Ethiopia, Uganda, Tanzania, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Liberia, Vietnam, Zimbabwe and Zambia.  For example, in Zimbabwe, the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent lockdown contributed to a 75% increase in demand for services for women suffering from gender based violence. In response, Ireland supported Oxfam to scale up services to respond to domestic violence and advocate for women&rsquo;s rights. This provided support for 1,500 individuals per month, and doubled the capacity of shelters. </p>  <p>  Gender features as a theme of the 2020 Irish Aid Annual report, which contains more information on this issue.</p></reply>

The former Ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva met with the individual concerned on 2nd March 2016. The current Ambassador met with the individual concerned on 29 July 2019 and again on 16 September 2021.</p>  <p>  Ireland has raised the issue of the release of the names of NGO delegates to UN Member States and received assurances directly from the Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights (OHCHR) that, while there had been a historical practice whereby the names of participants were occasionally confirmed to States in limited circumstances, this practice has since ceased.</p>  <p>Ireland is a strong advocate, at the UN and globally, on the protection of civil society space and the prevention of reprisals against Human Rights Defenders which engage with Human Rights bodies at the UN. </p>  <p>  In common with other European Union Member States, Ireland has raised our concerns with China regarding the situation in Xinjiang on a number of occasions, both bilaterally and in multilateral fora. </p>  <p>  On 21 October 2021, Ireland joined a cross-regional statement on Human Rights in China at the Third Committee of the UN General Assembly, which calls on China to allow immediate, meaningful and unfettered access to Xinjiang for independent observers, including the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.</p>  <p>  We have also raised our concerns bilaterally with the Chinese authorities at senior official level and I discussed the issue with Chinese State Councillor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi during our meeting on 30 May. In that discussion, I outlined Ireland and the EU's position on the treatment of Uighurs and other minorities in Xinjiang.

Nearly 23 million Afghans face acute food insecurity. The UN launched its largest ever humanitarian funding appeal on 11 January seeking approximately $5 billion to meet the immense needs within Afghanistan and of Afghan refugees in the region.</p>  <p>  A donor-pledging conference on Afghanistan is likely to take place in March and Ireland will participate. In 2021, our humanitarian funding to Afghanistan increased fivefold to over &euro;5.3 million for UN agencies and NGOs. Last year, the EU and Member States allocated more than &euro;1 billion in funding to UN agencies and NGOs working in Afghanistan for humanitarian aid and to support basic needs. The EU also established a humanitarian air bridge that delivered 280 tonnes of lifesaving supplies.</p>  <p>  Ireland supports all initiatives to alleviate the suffering of the Afghan people. At the UN Security Council, we actively engaged in negotiations to ensure a clear and robust humanitarian carve out to the sanctions regime against the Taliban to ensure the delivery of essential humanitarian aid to the population. The resolution was adopted in December. </p>  <p>  A total of 108 Irish citizens and their dependents have been assisted in evacuating Afghanistan since August. </p>  <p>   My Department, including our Embassies in Abu Dhabi and Ankara, has worked with EU Member States and partners in the region to support ongoing evacuation efforts.</p>  <p>  Work continues to support the small number of Irish citizens and their dependents, less than 10, as well as residents, who remain in Afghanistan and wish to leave in the coming period.</p>  <p>  The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth administers the Irish Refugee Protection Programme. Over 500 Afghan nationals have been granted refugee status under this Programme, with 418 having arrived safely to Ireland. My Department has provided support, including through our Embassy network, in securing safe passage to Ireland for a number of these.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-01-27a.53.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022012700073#WRB01900"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22, 32, 38, 40, 45, 50, 56, 62, 64, 66, 67, 69, 75, 80 and 85 together.</p><p>Passport Service operations were severely disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021, as were many Government services. The Passport Service maintained operations throughout the pandemic, notwithstanding the fact that the processing of passports requires physical attendance on site to deliver this service. Despite the disruptions related to the pandemic throughout last year, the Passport Service issued over 634,000 passports in 2021 and 45% of simple adult renewals issued within one business day. </p><p>The Passport Service has been experiencing very high demand for passports since May 2021 and expects a high level of demand for passports to continue throughout this year. The Passport Service has put several measures in place to meet this anticipated demand. The Passport Service continually examines how to improve processing times and engagement with applicants. Preparation is currently underway for several system and service improvements that will enhance the customer service experience and will improve processing times. A particular improvement that will be of interest to Deputies is a change to the documentary management process that reduces the turnaround time when additional documents need to be submitted by the applicant. </p><p>In addition, my Department has been actively working with the Public Appointments Service to recruit additional permanent and temporary staff for assignment to the Passport Service. This recruitment drive has been underway since the last quarter of 2021 and will double the number of staff in the Passport Service from June 2021 levels.  A significant number of additional staff are being assigned to the Passport Service throughout January, February and March. I am confident that these additional staff will help to reduce turnaround times and to respond to the current and anticipated high demand for first time and renewal passports in 2022.</p><p>In the context of the National Development Plan, my Department is making a major investment in the future of the Passport Service.  Over the next couple of years, we will replace the core technology underpinning the service, which will deliver efficiencies and a more resilient passport system. Budget 2022 also included an investment of an additional &euro;10m in passport services in response to the increasing demand for passports both at home and abroad.</p><p>The current passport processing times are:</p><p>- 10 working days for Simple Adult online renewals</p><p>- 15 working days for Complex or child online renewals</p><p>- 40 working days for First Time Applications on Passport Online</p><p>- 8 weeks for An Post&rsquo;s mail-in &ldquo;Passport Express&rdquo; service</p><p>There are currently 100,000 online applications and 13,000 paper applications on hand with the Passport Service.  The passport processing times are based on current average application turnaround times and relate to passport applications submitted to the Passport Service with required supporting documentation. When passport applicants do not provide all of the requisite documentation to the Passport Service, it takes much longer to process the application and issue a passport. Passport Service figures show that 45% of current applications are incomplete and the onus is on the applicant to submit the required documents to the Service. While the Passport Service makes every effort to contact applicants in such circumstances, their experience is that many applicants take weeks and sometimes months to send in the necessary documents.</p><p>The Passport Service is currently experiencing high demand for first time passports, particularly for children. These first time applications are necessarily complex to process, since they are essentially applications for Irish citizenship. The Passport Service must validate the true identity of the applicant and take measures to confirm the applicant&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship. It is the statutory responsibility of the Passport Service to protect the integrity of the Irish passport. Accordingly, a rigorous analysis process is in place to verify the identity and citizenship status of first time applicants. In the case of first time passport applications for children, the consent of guardians must also be thoroughly validated. Due to the intensive analysis underpinning first time online passport applications, the processing time is 40 working days.</p><p>There are currently 30,000 first time child applications on hand with the Passport Service. Of these, almost 13,000 or 43% are incomplete applications that require additional documentation from the applicants&rsquo; guardians in order to complete the application and ensure that the child&rsquo;s passport can be issued.</p><p>Passport Online is the priority channel for applications as there are many efficiencies built into the system for both the applicant and the Passport Service. The processing of an online application is consistently up to four times faster than the processing time of a paper application. </p><p>Passport Online can be accessed by all first time applicants, irrespective of age  both children and adults, in Ireland, Northern Ireland, Great Britain, Europe, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the USA. All Irish citizens, including children, can use the online system to renew their passports from anywhere in the world.</p><p>I urge citizens to check the validity of their passports before booking travel and to ensure that they apply in plenty of time. In the case of people planning to travel this year, whose passports are already out of date or who have children who are first-time applicants, I would encourage them to apply now online.</p><p>The table below outlines the number of complete online passport applications currently on hand with the Passport Service by county. </p><p><b>Online passport applications with Passport Service by county</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>CARLOW </th>       <th>254 </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>CAVAN </td>       <td>306 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>CLARE </td>       <td>429 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>CORK </td>       <td>2,591 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>DONEGAL </td>       <td>557 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>DUBLIN </td>       <td>6,813 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>GALWAY </td>       <td>1,060 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>KERRY </td>       <td>586 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>KILDARE </td>       <td>1,155 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>KILKENNY </td>       <td>372 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>LAOIS </td>       <td>345 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>LEITRIM </td>       <td>115 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>LIMERICK </td>       <td>883 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>LONGFORD </td>       <td>143 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>LOUTH </td>       <td>653 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>MAYO </td>       <td>497 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>MEATH </td>       <td>1,013 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>MONAGHAN </td>       <td>215 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>OFFALY </td>       <td>261 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>ROSCOMMON </td>       <td>201 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>SLIGO </td>       <td>267 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>TIPPERARY </td>       <td>585 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>WATERFORD </td>       <td>549 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>WESTMEATH </td>       <td>361 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>WEXFORD </td>       <td>609 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>WICKLOW </td>       <td>696 </td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

The Agreements, as well as the principles and values underpinning them, are at the core of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to peace, reconciliation and prosperity on this island.</p><p>  The Peace Process has succeeded over the last two decades in moving definitively beyond the violence of the Troubles. However, it is an ongoing process and the work of peace requires a consistent commitment and renewed efforts in the face of new challenges. Since the conclusion of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998, it has been necessary to pursue a series of successive further political and legal agreements to consolidate the peace settlement provided for in the Good Friday Agreement.</p><p>Most recently of course, the New Decade New Approach Agreement, reached in January 2020, restored the devolved institutions after a three year absence. The Government is committed to working in support of the full implementation of the NDNA, and the fulfilment of our own commitments made alongside the agreement. An NDNA implementation review meeting is planned to take place in the period immediately ahead, which will provide opportunity to discuss the status of those commitments.</p><p>As co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, the Government has continued to work closely on a North/South and East/West basis in support of the devolved power-sharing institutions in Northern Ireland, through the mechanisms provided for the Good Friday Agreement, including the North South Ministerial Council, the British Irish Council (BIC) and the British Irish Intergovernmental Conference. (BIIGC).</p><p>The most recent BIIGC took place on 2 December in London. In this format, both Governments discussed a broad range of topics relating to Northern Ireland, including the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and subsequent agreements. I have also continued to engage regularly with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, and with the leaders of the parties in Northern Ireland, as we work to ensure progress, stability and address pressing challenges, including the outworkings of Brexit and the legacy of the Troubles. </p><p>A Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland is a central provision of the GFA. An Ad-Hoc Assembly Committee has been established, and the Committee published its research paper in March 2020, and launched a public consultation in May. The Government remains firmly committed to the provision of a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland.</p><p>All parties to the GFA recognised the importance of respect, understanding and tolerance in relation to linguistic diversity, which in Northern Ireland includes the Irish language, Ulster-Scots and the languages of the various ethnic communities.  There is now a commitment in place from the British Government to legislate to implement the relevant provisions of the NDNA agreement if the Northern Ireland Assembly fails to do so.</p><p>Progress has also been made regarding the Government&rsquo;s commitments supporting the Irish language in Northern Ireland, including the allocation of: &euro;3m as part of the commitment in Budget 2021 for Irish language broadcasting; &euro;1.8m over three years (2020-22) to support the Irish language in Northern Ireland; and an All Island expansion of existing Irish Language Network strategy.  </p><p>The Government continues to support the establishment of a dedicated structure for civic engagement by the Northern Ireland Executive as set out in the Good Friday Agreement under Strand One. In the NDNA agreement, it was agreed that the Compact Civic Advisory Panel would be reformed to propose the most appropriate model for civic engagement on specific issues.</p><p>The Government also continues to support the establishment of the North South Consultative Forum, as provided for under Strand Two of the GFA, and has worked to move the issue forward, submitting proposals to the Northern Ireland Executive for its consideration. We have also raised the issue at successive plenary meetings of the North South Ministerial Council.</p><p>Furthermore, the Reconciliation Fund, administered by the Department of Foreign Affairs, continues to support the vital work of peace and reconciliation. The budget of the Reconciliation Fund will increase to &euro;5.0 million this year, with these funds playing an important role to aiding a wide range of projects and organisations to carry out their impactful work across communities.</p></reply>

The conflict is having a devastating impact on civilians with widespread human rights violations, while the number of casualties continues to rise. Over 9 million people are in need of urgent humanitarian assistance.</p>  <p>  Ireland has played a leading role in the international response to the crisis. Through our bilateral engagements, as well as within the European Union and at the UN Security Council, Ireland continues to advocate for full humanitarian access to those in need, an urgent end to violence, dialogue, accountability for atrocities, and ultimately a political solution to the conflict. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s principal focus has been on the humanitarian consequences of the war and the need to end the violence. Last year, Ireland contributed almost &euro;25m to the humanitarian response in Ethiopia. </p>  <p>  The Ethiopian authorities indicated that their decision last November to restrict the size of our Embassy in Addis Ababa was due to the positions Ireland has articulated internationally, including at the UN Security Council, on the ongoing conflict and humanitarian crisis in Ethiopia.</p>  <p>  As we have made clear, our positions on the conflict are shared by our EU partners and the wider international community.  Our focus has been on ending the conflict and addressing humanitarian needs. Our solidarity with and commitment to the people of Ethiopia remains strong, and we will continue to have frank and constructive engagement with our Ethiopian counterparts. We hope the decision of the government of Ethiopia will be temporary, so that our Embassy staff can return to carrying out their important duties in the country as soon as possible.</p></reply>

We have consistently advocated for Afghan women and girls, who must be treated as equal citizens, with rights to full and equal access to education, to healthcare, to freedom of movement and participation in public life.  We have emphasised the need to maintain humanitarian access to address what is now the world&rsquo;s largest humanitarian crisis. Ireland strongly supported UN Security Council Resolution 2615, adopted on 22 December 2021, which exempts humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan from UN sanctions against members of the Taliban.</p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s approach is consistent with the EU Council Conclusions on Afghanistan of September 2021, to which we contributed and which highlight the effect of the Taliban actions on civil, political, social, economic and cultural rights, and on the gains made over the last two decades, which had been supported by the EU. Among the guiding principles agreed by the EU are that the Taliban must respect the independence of humanitarian operations and guarantee safe and unhindered access for all humanitarian staff, including all female staff, and that they must promote, protect and respect all human rights, in particular the full enjoyment of rights of women and girls. </p><p>I remain gravely concerned at the deteriorating human rights situation in Afghanistan.  The continued absence of many non-governmental organisations, civil society networks, and diplomatic missions from Afghanistan following the Taliban takeover has made the role of the UN in monitoring and reporting on developments inside Afghanistan, especially on human rights, more important than ever before.  Representatives of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) have met regularly with high-ranking members of the Taliban administration to highlight Afghanistan&rsquo;s human rights obligations under international law. The mandate for UNAMA is due to be renewed by the UN Security Council by 17 March. Ireland will advocate strongly for the maintenance of human rights tasks in that mandate, to operate in tandem with the implementation of last October&rsquo;s<i></i>EU-led resolution at the UN Human Rights Council on the &ldquo;Situation of human rights in Afghanistan&rdquo;, which establishes a mandate for a Special Rapporteur, to be appointed at the March 2022 session.</p><p>The UN launched a funding appeal on 11 January, seeking approximately $5 billion to meet the emergency humanitarian needs within Afghanistan and of Afghan refugees in the region.  This is the largest such humanitarian appeal ever issued by the UN.  Since the Taliban seizure of power, the EU and its Member States have allocated more than &euro;1 billion in funding to UN agencies and NGOs working in Afghanistan, for both humanitarian aid and for supporting basic needs (&lsquo;humanitarian plus&rsquo;). The EU also established a humanitarian air bridge that in 2021 delivered 280 tonnes of lifesaving medication, food and equipment to address COVID-19 to Afghanistan.  </p><p>In addition, the Government through its Development Assistance programme, Irish Aid, has provided over &euro;4 million in humanitarian support for the people of Afghanistan since mid-August. This funding has been allocated to the UN High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), the UN Afghanistan Humanitarian Fund (AHF) and UNICEF. These emergency response programmes are addressing the urgent needs of the population, including providing food aid, treatment for severe acute malnutrition in children, and other essential services. Ireland&rsquo;s humanitarian funding to Afghanistan increased fivefold in 2021 to over &euro;5 million &ndash; with the remainder provided at the beginning of the year to Concern Worldwide, HALO Trust and the AHF.</p><p>In addition, Ireland contributes to support global funds and provide core funding to key agencies that allocate funding to Afghanistan, including the EU, WHO, UNHCR, IFRC, ICRC and the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF). Ireland was the 9th largest donor to the CERF in 2021, providing &euro;11 million. Since August, the CERF has allocated more than &euro;68.6 million to Afghanistan.</p></reply>

Ireland is concerned by the build-up of Russian troops on its border with Ukraine and I continue to call on Russia to de-escalate tensions. In my own remarks, I have consistently underlined the need for strong and unified messaging from the EU.</p>  <p>  I and my EU colleagues discussed the situation in Ukraine most recently at the Foreign Affairs Council on Monday of this week (24 January). EU Foreign Ministers have been consistently engaged on this issue and have delivered clear messages of solidarity with Ukraine both at the Foreign Affairs Council of 13 December and again at our informal Foreign Minister's meeting in Brest, hosted by the French Presidency on 13 and 14 January.</p>  <p>  In remarks after the December Foreign Affairs Council, High Representative Borrell made clear that aggression against Ukraine, will come with political consequences and with a high economic cost for Russia. This message was further reinforced in the Foreign Affairs Council Conclusions of 24 January, which state that preparatory work has accelerated on restrictive measures in case of further military aggression by Russia against Ukraine. Council Conclusions also condemn Russia&rsquo;s continued aggressive actions and threats against Ukraine, and call on Russia to de-escalate.</p>  <p>  The UN Secretary General, Ant&oacute;nio Guterres on 21 January called on the international community to avoid a confrontation and to create the conditions for a diplomatic solution of the problem. Ireland has consistently reaffirmed its support for Ukraine at UN Security Council meetings on Ukraine, including at Arria formula meetings. Ireland co-sponsored the Arria formula meeting on Crimea organised by Estonia and Ukraine in March 2021, which also focused on the worrying human rights situation on the peninsula. On 9 December, Ireland co-sponsored the General Assembly resolution on the demilitarisation of Crimea, and joined the EU statement on 9 December, as we have done in previous years.</p></reply>

The coup is a reversal of the progress made towards democracy and rule of law in Myanmar which took years to establish. Ireland is actively engaged on this issue in our role as an elected member of the Security Council, including by calling on the military and all parties for an urgent end to violence, full respect for human rights and compliance with international law, including international humanitarian and human rights law.</p>  <p>  The situation in Myanmar has been considered seven times by the Security Council since the coup, most recently on 8 November 2021. The Council has expressed deep concern regarding developments in Myanmar, condemned the use of violence by the military, and called for the release of all those detained. The Council is actively monitoring the situation, and, most recently, a press statement was issued following the atrocities in Kayah State on 24 December. </p>  <p>  The united voice of the Security Council on the situation in Myanmar is welcome, sending a clear message to the Myanmar military. Ireland coordinates with likeminded Council members towards further action, and was also a member of the core group of nations who proposed the June 2021 United Nations General Assembly resolution which called for an end to arms flows to Myanmar.</p>  <p>  Military rule in Myanmar risks further human rights abuses and Ireland has voiced its concern at four sessions of the Human Rights Council since February 2021. Ireland has consistently voiced support for international efforts towards ensuring accountability and justice in Myanmar, including the ongoing processes at the Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar, the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court. </p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to work actively with our partners in the European Union, and through our position on the Security Council to promote the rule of law and protect the human rights of the people of Myanmar.</p></reply>

At the meeting, the French Presidency gave a presentation on the priorities for their presidency of the Council of the EU. The three overarching goals of the Presidency are a Sovereign Europe, a New European Model for Growth and Investment, and a &lsquo;more human&rsquo; EU. Ireland supports the priorities of the French Presidency. I look forward to working closely with my French colleagues over the coming six months.</p>  <p>  There was also a debate on a legislative package on reinforcing democracy and the integrity of elections. Ireland welcomes this legislative package and considers that it forms an important aspect of the European Democracy Action Plan as well as being complementary to the Government&rsquo;s own plans for a new Electoral Reform Bill currently under preparation. Given the challenges facing democracies at the moment, the measures contained within this package offer an effective means of safeguarding EU values against present and future threats.</p>  <p>  We also exchanged views on the Conference on the Future of Europe.

This assistance is provided through a wide range of agencies (including UNICEF, OCHA, UNRWA, WFP, WHO etc.) but it is the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) which is mandated to lead and co-ordinate international action to protect refugees worldwide and safeguard their rights and well-being.

Education is at the heart of delivering on this ambition.</p><p>My Department, through the Irish Aid programme, provides support for education in low income countries, with an emphasis on the most marginalised within those countries.  For example, in Uganda, Ireland focuses its education support in Karamoja, which historically has significantly lagged behind other regions of Uganda in terms of education access and achievement, particularly for girls.</p><p>Last year I announced a new pledge of &euro;60 million for the Global Partnership for Education.  This fund supports countries with the greatest education needs, targeting those with large numbers of children out of school, and weak school completion rates. Within those countries, it targets the most vulnerable and hardest to reach children. </p><p>Children in conflict situations and other humanitarian emergencies face some of the greatest inequalities in education.Since 2019 Ireland has committed &euro;11.85 million to Education Cannot Wait, a fund which supports the urgent education needs of children and youth caught up in wars, forced displacement, natural and man-made disasters. </p><p>Ireland addresses gender inequalities in education through better education planning, creating safe school environments, and reducing the risk of gender based violence.In 2020 Ireland launched the Drive for Five, a global call to action for the education of adolescent girls.  We continue to promote a holistic approach to getting all adolescent girls into school, keeping them there, and ensuring schools are supportive, safe and healthy environments.</p><p>COVID-19 disrupted education globally and has generated significant learning losses, disproportionately affecting poorer and marginalised students. An immediate priority is to use the Irish Aid programme to assist partner countries to safely reopen schools and enable the return to in-person learning for all, with remediation and acceleration programmes to make up for learning losses.</p></reply>

Due to the complex nature of the Foreign Birth Registration process, the large increase in applications received following the Brexit vote in the UK, and the pause in the Service due to necessary Covid-19 restrictions, applicants should allow approximately 2 years from the receipt of supporting documentation for processing of Foreign Birth Registration applications at this time. </p>  <p>  Due to Covid-19 restrictions, and the subsequent reassignment of Foreign Birth Registration staff to assist in the provision of essential passport services, the Foreign Birth Registration Service was paused for nearly 15 months across the 2020-2021 period.  Foreign Birth Registration staff have continually provided an emergency service for Foreign Birth Registration in cases of exceptional urgency, such as expectant parents, or stateless persons. Applicants who require an emergency service may contact the Passport Service directly.</p>  <p>  There are currently 32,000 applications awaiting processing. In 2021, over 7,000 Foreign Birth Registration applications were processed.  </p>  <p>  My Department is fully committed to the allocation of additional resources to assist with the processing of the Foreign Birth Registration applications currently on hand and the high volume of new applications anticipated this year. The Department has been actively working with the Public Appointments Service to recruit additional permanent and temporary staff for assignment to the Passport Service. This recruitment drive has been underway since the last quarter of 2021 and will double the number of staff in the Passport Service from June 2021 levels. A significant number of additional staff are being assigned to the Passport Service throughout January, February and March.  I am confident that the additional staff being assigned to the Passport Service will help to reduce turnaround times and to respond to the current and anticipated high demand for passports and Foreign Birth Registration this year.</p></reply>

The Agreement sets out that a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland should be based on the European Convention on Human Rights, enhanced by additional rights to &ldquo;reflect the principles of mutual respect for the identity and ethos of both communities and parity of esteem.&rdquo;</p><p>The full implementation and effective operation of the Good Friday Agreement and all subsequent implementation agreements is a central priority for this Government. These agreements, as well as the principles and values underpinning them, are at the core of the Government&rsquo;s approach to peace, reconciliation and prosperity on this island.</p><p>The Government advanced the view during the 2014 Stormont House talks that a Bill of Rights could set out precisely and formally the rights upon which a shared society for Northern Ireland could be based.  While there was not sufficient consensus to take this forward, the final Agreement did provide that the parties commit to: &ldquo;serving the people of Northern Ireland equally, and to act in accordance with the obligations on government to promote equality and respect and to prevent discrimination; to promote a culture of tolerance, mutual respect and mutual understanding at every level of society, including initiatives to facilitate and encourage shared and integrated education and housing, social inclusion, and in particular community development and the advancement of women in public life; and to promote the interests of the whole community towards the goals of reconciliation and economic renewal.&rdquo;</p><p>As agreed as part of the New Decade, New Approach agreement, an Ad-Hoc Assembly Committee has been established, and the Committee published its research paper on the &ldquo;Key Issues for a Bill of Rights&rdquo; in March 2020, and launched a public consultation in May. </p><p>The Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission (NIHRC) was established as a result of the Good Friday Agreement. It is part of a wider package of safeguards to ensure that every citizen in Northern Ireland is guaranteed equal status and equal protection under law. In February 2021, the NIHRC produced a response to the public consultation of the Ad-Hoc Committee, which emphasises that there is a need to harmonise the European Convention on Human Rights, as domesticated through the Human Rights Act, and any proposed Bill of Rights for NI to ensure a complementary interpretation about the meaning and scope of human rights.</p><p>At present, the Ad-Hoc Assembly Committee has concluded holding formal evidence gathering sessions on a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland. The next step, as agreed as part of the New Decade, New Approach Agreement, is for the First and deputy First Ministers to jointly appoint a Panel of five experts to assist the Committee in preparing its report.</p><p>As outlined in the Programme for Government, the Government is committed to working in support of the full implementation of the NDNA.</p><p>An NDNA Implementation Review Meeting is planned for the period ahead, which provides for an opportunity to discuss progress made to date as well as outstanding commitments. </p></reply>

As the Deputy has noted, the scheme has generated overwhelmingly positive feedback and has to date assisted over 120 participants returning to Ireland from all over the world in creating businesses and employment opportunities across the country.  </p>  <p>  The next cycle of the programme will get underway at the end of February this year.  </p>  <p>  Up to 50 places will be available annually which is a 20% increase in capacity from previous rounds.  We have also extended the cycle of the programme by an additional year. </p>  <p>  In line with best practice and the experience of similar schemes operated by other Government Departments, access to the scheme is by way of a competitive process. This ensures that the successful applicants are those best positioned to benefit from participation in the scheme. This is a driver of the good outcomes which are being achieved. </p>  <p>  This year we are introducing a community networking aspect for those who have completed the programme to support former participants and others to stay connected and to further enhance the assistance and advice we provide to our returning emigrant entrepreneurs. </p>  <p>  The Back for Business initiative has itself drawn lessons from other domestic and job creation networks. For instance, its reliance on peer to peer learning through volunteer lead entrepreneurs was drawn from the experience of the &lsquo;Going for Growth&rsquo; initiative supported for the last 14 years by Enterprise Ireland. That sister initiative, which is run in conjunction with KPMG, was a recipient of a European Enterprise Award for its work encouraging female entrepreneurs to increase their ambition and supporting them to achieve their growth aspirations and is an exemplar for our Back for Business Programme. </p>  <p>  I would call on all Deputies to encourage those they know that have returned to Ireland in the last three years, and are starting a new business, to apply for a place on Back for Business. Those interested should access www.backforbusiness.com and register their interest and a link to an application form will be sent to them. Closing date for receipt of completed application forms is midnight on 15 February. </p></reply>

The build-up of Russian troops on the border with Ukraine is a matter of great concern. It is important that dialogue be maintained, with the primary goal of de-escalating tensions in the region. In this regard, I welcome the intensive diplomatic efforts which have occurred in recent weeks, aimed at defusing tensions. These include bilateral discussions between the US and Russia, between NATO and Russia, and at the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. As a participating State in the OSCE, Ireland is pleased to express solidarity with Ukraine and seek a peaceful de-escalation of tensions in that forum.</p>  <p>  Over the course of the last year, the EU has dedicated significant time to the situation in Ukraine, not least at the Foreign Affairs Council. The EU has been and will remain united in extending solidarity to Ukraine and condemning Russian aggression. I commend Ukraine it on its resilience and restraint in the face of continued Russian aggression. The latest build-up of troops near Ukraine has caused a sustained period of heightened tension over recent weeks and months.  This has been exacerbated by Russia's security proposals which attempt to impinge on Ukraine's sovereign right as a nation to decide its own defence and external association policy. </p>  <p>  I and my fellow EU Foreign Ministers discussed the situation again on Monday of this week at the Foreign Affairs Council of 24 January. That discussion built on our detailed exchange at the informal Foreign Ministers meeting in Brest on 13 and 14 January hosted by the French Presidency. In my own remarks, I have consistently underlined the need for strong and unified messaging from the EU. </p>  <p>  EU leaders including the Taoiseach, at the European Council in December, clearly stated that any further military aggression against Ukraine will have massive consequences and severe cost in response. This has been reinforced in the Foreign Affairs Council Conclusions of 24 January, which state that preparatory work has accelerated on restrictive measures in case of further military aggression by Russia against Ukraine.  </p>  <p>  EU Foreign Ministers on Monday continued to emphasise the need for de-escalation and the prevention of further conflict in Ukraine. This is the outcome we want to see. Too many lives have already been lost in the conflict in Ukraine and we must always keep open the path of dialogue. This is why we and our EU partners view the Minsk Agreements as so important.  Their full implementation remains the best avenue to achieve peace in Ukraine. The OSCE as a platform for regional security has also featured heavily in our recent discussions. The OSCE is the body that brings all parties in the region to the table and I am in favour of the EU continuing to invest significant effort there.</p>  <p>  However, I and my counterparts also acknowledged that the EU must be willing to meet unacceptable behaviour from Russia with consequences. We cannot continue to do business with Russia as normal if it perpetrates further military aggression against Ukraine. This is why we have agreed to signal that preparatory work on restrictive measures has accelerated. We hope that this work won't be needed. We hope it won't come to that. But we need to be prepared to use the leverage we have in the interests of peace and security on the continent.</p>  <p>  EU Foreign Ministers have also engaged with Ukraine directly, to ensure that its voice is heard and that we understand its perspective. This includes engagements with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba. I discussed these matters in person with Minister Kuleba when I travelled to Kyiv on 23 August to represent Ireland at the International Crimea Platform, a diplomatic initiative by Ukraine to seek a peaceful end to the illegal Russian occupation of the peninsula.</p></reply>

Timing and context would affect whether such a loss of influence would be matched by a commensurate benefit for the Palestinian people and a positive impact on the peace process and a two-State solution.</p></reply>

The Government will continue to seek the full truth of these appalling attacks, and some measure of closure for those affected, in accordance with the three Motions passed unanimously by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.</p>  <p>  The all-party motion that was adopted by the D&aacute;il on 25 May 2016, like those adopted in 2008 and 2011,  calls on the British Government to allow access by an independent, international judicial figure to all original documents relating to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, as well as the Dublin bombings of 1972 and 1973, the bombing of Kay&rsquo;s Tavern in Dundalk and the murder of Seamus Ludlow. The Programme for Government reiterates Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to engaging with the British Government on this issue as matter of priority, in accordance with the All-Party D&aacute;il motions.</p>  <p>  I have consistently underlined to the British Government that the D&aacute;il motions represent the consensus political view in Ireland that an independent, international judicial review of all the relevant documents is required to establish the full facts of the Dublin and Monaghan atrocities.

Ireland continues to support health system strengthening through our funding to partners such as WHO, Gavi (The Vaccines Alliance), and to the Global Fund for TB, HIV / AIDS and Malaria.</p>  <p>  The WHO is optimistic that the world will hit the target of 70% of the world&rsquo;s population receiving their primary vaccination by mid-year. It is estimated that total production of vaccines will reach 19 billion by July. On 16 January, a shipment of vaccines to Rwanda included the billionth dose supplied via the COVAX facility. However, as long as a significant proportion of the world&rsquo;s population remains unvaccinated and without full access to testing, tracking and treatment, COVID-19 will remain a threat to lives and livelihoods.</p>  <p>  Last week, I announced an additional Irish contribution of &euro;5 million to COVAX at a Gavi event. This brings Ireland&rsquo;s overall contribution to COVAX to date to &euro;13.5 million. This supports the purchase and distribution of vaccines in lower income countries. Ireland was one of the first donors to agree to cover the additional costs associated with donations of vaccines via the facility. The recent additional funding to COVAX will contribute to those costs, the financing of vaccines, and support to country readiness, such as the provision of equipment and technical support to boost vaccine rollout.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health has received approval from Government to donate up to 5 million surplus vaccines to developing countries, largely through the COVAX facility. To date, more than 1.3 million of these doses have been delivered to countries including Nigeria, Ghana and Indonesia, with more expected. Further donations are expected in the coming weeks. The Department of Health, working closely with DFA, also facilitated the bilateral donation of 335,000 AstraZeneca doses to Uganda, specifically targeted to the vaccination of teachers to enable the reopening of schools. In addition, the response by the Irish public to the UNICEF &ldquo;Get a Vaccine, Give a Vaccine&rdquo; Covid-19 appeal has been exceptional, and acknowledged internationally.</p>  <p>  With support from the Irish Aid programme to the HSE Global Health programme, key lessons learned from Ireland&rsquo;s response to COVID-19 have been shared with the Mozambican health service, while health workers on the frontline of the pandemic in Jordan and Ethiopia were supported with psychosocial training for resilience.</p>  <p>  Finally, Ireland continues to promote the sharing of technology through various means, for example, the intellectual property underpinning Ireland&rsquo;s COVID Tracker App has been shared to assist countries in their contact tracing efforts. </p></reply>

We held an exchange with US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, by video conference during which we reiterated our shared commitment to Ukraine&rsquo;s sovereignty and territorial integrity. In our discussions, EU Foreign Ministers agreed that dialogue in line with the key principles that underpin European security, as enshrined in the UN Charter and the founding documents of the OSCE, is the best way to safeguard peace and stability. We also reiterated however that any further military aggression by Russia against Ukraine will have massive consequences and severe costs. We adopted Council Conclusions which reflected these positions. I emphasised the need to focus on diplomacy and dialogue, and I also updated my EU colleagues on Russian plans to conduct live fire naval exercises off the south west coast of Ireland.  </p>  <p>  We also assessed how the EU might best respond to recent developments in Syria and Libya. Ireland is currently co-penholder for Syria humanitarian issues on the UN Security Council, and I highlighted the humanitarian imperative to ensure access to aid for all those in need. </p>  <p>  The Council also exchanged views on the situations in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Indo-Pacific, Sudan and Mali. We agreed on our intention to progress restrictive measures against individuals responsible for destabilisation in Mali, in support of similar targeted actions already undertaken by ECOWAS, while also underlining the EU&rsquo;s commitment to supporting the Malian people.</p>  <p>  Council Conclusions on the EU&rsquo;s priorities in UN human rights fora in 2022 and on peace operations and crisis management operations for 2022-2024 were also agreed.</p></reply>

Since the launch of this Strategy, my Department has published a number of policies and supports, including a Maternity Leave Cover Policy, a Guide to Supports for Maternity, Adoptive and Parental Leave, and is currently in the early stages of developing a Menopause Policy. In addition, a gender pay gap report has been published for the past three years which also examines the levels of men and women at senior grades at headquarters and at Missions abroad. </p><p>My Department has an active Gender Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (GEDI) Sub-Committee of the Management Board which has five working groups, one of which focuses on gender equality issues, including through the implementation of a Departmental Gender Equality Action Plan. The work underway across my Department complements wider efforts towards gender equality being advanced through the Civil Service renewal process. </p><p>At present, at Assistant Principal level and above, 46 percent are women. The proportion of Heads of Mission, by gender for the years 2011 to 2021, is set out in tabular form below. The figures demonstrate significant progress towards parity over the course of a ten year period. The percentage of female Heads of Mission is set to increase to 46 percent by the end of 2022 following the summer rotations at Missions abroad. </p><p>My Department remains committed to efforts to enhance gender equality at senior levels along with other commitments in relation to equality, diversity and inclusion.  <table>    <tr>       <th>Year </th>       <th>Female </th>       <th>Male </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2011 </td>       <td>15% </td>       <td>85% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2012 </td>       <td>18% </td>       <td>82% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2013 </td>       <td>22% </td>       <td>78% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2014 </td>       <td>26% </td>       <td>74% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2015 </td>       <td>26% </td>       <td>74% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016 </td>       <td>26% </td>       <td>74% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017 </td>       <td>27% </td>       <td>73% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018 </td>       <td>29% </td>       <td>71% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019 </td>       <td>33% </td>       <td>67% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020 </td>       <td>33% </td>       <td>67% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021 </td>       <td>38% </td>       <td>62% </td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

I saw this first hand during my visit to open the new Consulate General on 1 October 2021. I engaged with representatives of numerous Irish community organisations at the opening reception in Manchester and during a programme at the Liverpool Irish Centre.</p><p>Since last July, the team at the new Consulate General has been active in engaging with our diaspora. It has visited Irish clubs in Liverpool, Leeds, Newcastle, Huddersfield, Warrington, and Manchester, including the Irish<i></i>Club mentioned by the Deputy. It has also met with several Irish community groups, such as Irish Community Care in Merseyside, and Irish Community Care Manchester, and Leeds Irish Health and Homes. In addition, the Consulate has engaged with Irish sporting and cultural organisations, including the Lancashire and Yorkshire GAA County Board, and met with Irish media entities, including Irish community radio programmes in Manchester and the makers of the Irish in the UK TV programme. </p><p>This outreach work builds on decades of engagement by Embassy London and the work of the Irish Abroad Unit in my Department. In 2021, funding of &euro;1,336,551 was allocated to 25 organisations in the North of England under the Emigrant Support Programme. </p><p>My Department is working with Enterprise Ireland to select a location for a permanent Ireland House in Manchester, which will include the long term chancery for the Consulate. The Ireland House will facilitate the collective work of Team Ireland - enhancing bilateral relations, deepening regional engagement, advancing our commercial interests and diaspora engagement. Specific requirements have been identified for an Ireland House in Manchester. The building that housed the Irish Club referenced by the Deputy has been visited by the Consulate General team and I can confirm that full consideration of the suitability of this premises has been considered, in line with these specific requirements.  </p></reply>

The Mission network works to increase trade, diversify our markets and support Irish companies to take advantage of new opportunities, which is particularly relevant as we recover from the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  The Mission network plays a key role in the Team Ireland approach, which sees Government Departments and State Agencies working closely with other Irish stakeholders to strengthen our international reputation and drive the development of trade, tourism, investment, science, technology and innovation, culture and education. Embassies and Consulates General provide support for Ireland&rsquo;s State Agencies strategic objectives and activities in overseas markets. The role of the Mission network in promoting Ireland as a location to do business, invest, study and visit, is particularly pertinent in markets with limited or no State Agency presence.</p>  <p>  In June 2018, the Government launched the Global Ireland initiative, which aims to double the impact and scope of Ireland&rsquo;s global footprint by 2025. Global Ireland's targets include enhanced global engagement, the expansion of Ireland&rsquo;s Embassy network and strengthening of Ireland&rsquo;s State Agency presence overseas. Each of these measures will increase Ireland&rsquo;s international visibility, facilitate market diversification and intensification, and deepen bilateral relations in support of the Government&rsquo;s economic and political objectives.</p>  <p>  This programme is now past the half way mark with 14 new Missions open and operational. To date, new Embassies have opened in Wellington, Bogot&aacute;, Amman, Monrovia, Santiago de Chile, Rabat, Manila and Kyiv, and new Consulates General in Cardiff, Frankfurt, Los Angeles, Manchester, Mumbai and Vancouver. We will also be reopening our Embassy in Tehran in 2023 and the Government has approved the opening of a further four new Missions in Dakar, Lyon, Miami and Toronto. New Missions have been opened in locations chosen on the basis, inter alia, of their potential to diversify our markets and increase trade and investment with Ireland. </p>  <p>  Officers based at our Missions engage in economic and public diplomacy to advance Ireland&rsquo;s prosperity, as part of their overall duties to promote Ireland's interests and support our citizens. They work on a range of trade-related issues, including market access, regulatory compliance, visas, phyto-sanitary issues, and double taxation agreements. </p>  <p>  The Mission network also supports Ministerial visits and trade missions, in partnership with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, other Government Departments and the State Agencies, which support the goal of securing high-level market access for companies based in Ireland that are aiming to grow business overseas, and in general helping deepen bilateral relations as the context in which trade and investment takes place.</p></reply>

Kazakh authorities have indicated that almost 1,000 people are still detained. It appears that initially peaceful protests at the beginning of the year rapidly escalated into violent clashes between apparently well-organised groups and the authorities. I welcome that calm has now been largely restored.</p>  <p>  However, I am particularly concerned at reports that orders to open fire with lethal force were issued. The UN Special Rapporteur on counter-terrorism and human rights has called for an independent, impartial, effective and public investigation to determine the legality of the use of force and to ensure accountability when lethal force was used by security services, law enforcement or the military. Ireland supports this call. Any domestic investigation must consider Kazakhstan's international human rights obligations.</p>  <p>  Ireland will use our platforms at the EU and the UN to emphasise the importance of protecting the human rights and fundamental freedoms of Kazakhstan&rsquo;s people.

Most recently, the spread of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 led to the introduction of new global restrictions on travel, many of which have since been eased. However, restrictions remain subject to change at short notice and this may remain the case for the foreseeable future.</p><p>The EU Digital COVID Certificate has been one of the EU success stories since the onset of the pandemic and it will remain an important tool to facilitate easier travel throughout the EU in the coming period. </p><p>Each country continues to be responsible for the definition of its own entry requirements and rules, including requirements to provide COVID-19 certificates of vaccination or recovery. There is no uniform approach to these requirements across the EU, and the United States of America also has its own specific rules. Information about entry restrictions applied by other countries is available on the Department of Foreign Affairs country-specific travel advice pages on our website<i>.</i>Anyone considering travelling abroad should monitor the latest advice before travel. </p><p>My Department provides comprehensive travel advice for over 200 countries so that citizens can make informed decisions on travel for themselves. I encourage citizens to exercise caution when making any decisions about international travel, taking account of their overall health and vaccine status, and to be aware of the risk of testing positive for COVID-19 while abroad. </p></reply>

The GDPR also increases the range of possible sanctions for infringements of these standards and obligations.  The accompanying Law Enforcement Directive (the Directive) was transposed into national law at the same time as the GDPR. The Directive establishes data protection standards for the processing of personal data by competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences and the execution of criminal penalties.</p>  <p>  The transfer of personal data from the EU to third countries is carried out under a number of transfer mechanisms set out in Chapter V of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The default transfer mechanism is known as  an &lsquo;adequacy decision&rsquo;, this is an implementing decision by the Commission which guarantees that the third country in question provides an equivalent level of protection of personal data as exists in the EU. Once a third country has been assessed by the Commission as providing an equivalent level of protection, transfers of EU citizen&rsquo;s data can take place between the EU and the selected third country under that adequacy decision, without limitation or additional safeguards.</p>  <p>  A new arrangement with the EU-US in regard to safe transfers of data is an outcome we want to see achieved. This is critical for business certainty but also for the successful operation of the GDPR. The Government respects the judgment of the European Court and in regards to the Schrems II case is fully supportive of the need to protect citizens&rsquo; data through enforceable safeguards and for proper redress mechanisms. </p>  <p>  Any future adequacy decision must work for both the EU and US in facilitating data transfers. It must also critically be able to pass any future scrutiny of the European Court of Justice. It will have to ensure that EU data subjects&rsquo; rights are thoroughly protected and are enforceable with proper redress mechanisms. We encourage the US administration and stakeholders to work positively with the European Commission in reaching a lasting and durable outcome to facilitate data transfers between the EU and US.</p>  <p>  The EU &ndash; UK adequacy decisions (GDPR and LED) are an important element of the new relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union enshrined in the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA).</p></reply>

During his St. Patrick's Day virtual visit last year, the Taoiseach raised the matter directly with President Biden. I also raised immigration issues in my meetings on Capitol Hill on my most recent visit to Washington, DC. These engagements will continue as we maintain close relations with Members of Congress and contacts from across the political spectrum in the US, and as we seek opportunities to deepen and strengthen our bilateral relations with President Biden's Administration.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to see that immigration issues, including possible pathways to citizenship, are a priority for President Biden, as demonstrated by his proposed US Citizenship Act of 2021. I look forward to working with his Administration as well as with the US Congress, on a bipartisan basis, as they pursue comprehensive immigration reform in the US. We will actively engage with the Administration and Congress on this matter through our Embassy in Washington, D.C. The Government continues to pursue the E3 Visa Bill, which, if passed, could allow access to thousands of US visas each year to Irish citizens, providing new opportunities to live and work in the US.</p>  <p>  Through our Embassy in Washington, D.C., as well as our Consulates across the US, my Department works closely with Irish immigration centres, which support the needs of Irish citizens. The Coalition of Irish Immigration Centers receives significant annual funding through the Government&rsquo;s Emigrant Support Programme. Last year, in response to the pandemic, a dedicated COVID-19 Response Fund for Irish Communities Abroad was set up to help these organisations meet the needs of those who are particularly vulnerable. In 2021, over &euro;4.22m was paid to diaspora organisations in the US for ESP and Covid-19 related projects and support.</p></reply>

Our thoughts are with the families who have lost loved ones in these attacks, and with the victims and survivors of these events. The publication of this report was undoubtedly an important and emotional moment.</p>  <p>  I am also aware of a scheduled D&aacute;il debate on the publication of this report due to take place in early February, which will provide an opportunity to discuss both this report and legacy developments.</p>  <p>  All families deserve access to information and a process of justice for their loved ones, regardless of the perpetrator.

Victims and families have been waiting for too long. We will continue to work for the implementation of such a framework, in order to support wider societal reconciliation, build greater community confidence in policing and meet the legitimate needs of victims and survivors in Northern Ireland and across the island of Ireland.</p>  <p>  The Government has consistently engaged with the British Government at all leveles to caution strongly against unilateral action in this area.

Ireland, together with Kenya, acted as co-facilitators in achieving agreement on the SDGs, which apply to both developed and developing countries.  </p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s first SDG National Implementation Plan was published in 2018. The preparation of Ireland&rsquo;s next National Implementation plan is underway, led by the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications. </p><p>Overall cross-Government efforts on achieving the SDGs in Ireland are coordinated through an inter-Departmental working group, in which my Department is an active participant. My Department also chairs a separate working group to coordinate efforts towards achieving the SDGs internationally, working with a range of Government Departments that spend Official Development Assistance. This is a useful forum for coordination of international efforts in key areas such as climate action, response to COVID-19, and Ireland&rsquo;s leading role on sustainable food systems.</p><p>The SDGs firmly underpin the Government&rsquo;s international development policy, A Better World<i>, </i>published in 2019<i>. </i>That policy &ldquo;grounds our international development policy in terms of what Ireland can, and must do, to achieve the SDGs.&rdquo; A Better World<i></i>identifies key priority themes which are rooted in Ireland's development journey, represent our unique global contribution, and are closely aligned with several of the SDGs. These include, among others, addressing hunger, health outcomes, education for all, gender equality, peace and justice and climate action.</p><p>My Department has put in place key systems and processes to ensure Irish Official Development Assistance contributes to delivering on the ambition of the SDGs. These include mandatory reporting on SDG outcomes at appraisal stage of programme development, and routine tracking of expenditure against SDG outcomes.  The Department is currently upgrading its electronic infrastructure for grant management which, when completed, will further improve our ability to monitor expenditure against SDG targets in real time. </p><p>Ireland's Global Citizenship Education Strategy, which I launched last year, has an emphasis on the SDGs at its core. Funding towards development research, such as the SDG Challenge Fund in partnership with Science Foundation Ireland, is focused on research solutions to intractable SDG challenges. And strong Irish leadership within the OECD Development Assistance Committee on civil society space is based on the unique contribution civil society will play in the achievement of the SDGs, across all targets.</p><p>The Irish Aid Annual Report details the breadth of Ireland&rsquo;s Official Development Assistance, presenting details of the impacts of Irish Aid&rsquo;s investments in the prior year. It details activities of other Government Departments which are supporting international development work. The most recent report, for 2020, is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p><p>Ireland is also an active member of the OECD&rsquo;s Development Assistance Committee. Each year, we report on Ireland&rsquo;s ODA expenditure to this committee in accordance with common ODA standards. We also actively participate in decisions about what these standards should be. Periodically, our development programme is reviewed by DAC peers. The most recent such review, in 2020, found that Ireland is a strong development partner that 'walks the talk' on its poverty focus and on its commitment to least developed countries.</p></reply>

The European Commission has been working with EU Member States including Ireland to identify options for possible cooperation. C-TAP is relevant to multiple Government Departments, including the Departments of Enterprise, Trade &amp;amp; Employment; Foreign Affairs; Health; and Further &amp;amp; Higher Education, Research, Innovation &amp;amp; Science.</p>  <p>  Initiatives such as C-TAP play a role in strengthening the COVID-19 response, but other actions are also needed to address bottlenecks in vaccine delivery and distribution. To date, my Department has invested &euro;200 million in COVID-19 response and global health, including strengthening health systems for the prevention and treatment of pre-existing conditions.</p>  <p>  Alongside discussions around C-TAP at EU level, Ireland will continue to support the sharing of technology, such as the sharing of the IP behind the COVID Tracker App. As part of the National Open Research Forum, we have granted non-exclusive royalty-free licenses through Knowledge Transfer Ireland. In addition, through Science Foundation Ireland we align with &lsquo;Plan S&rsquo;, which requires that scientific publications that result from publicly-funded research be made openly available.</p>  <p>  Already this year, my Department announced an additional contribution of &euro;5 million to COVAX, bringing Ireland&rsquo;s overall contribution to-date to &euro;13.5 million, to purchase and distribute vaccines in lower income countries. The Department of Health has committed to donate up to 5 million surplus vaccines to developing countries, largely through COVAX. To date, more than 1.3 million of these doses have been delivered to countries including Nigeria, Ghana and Indonesia, with more expected. This in addition to the bilateral donation of 335,000 AstraZeneca doses to Uganda.</p></reply>

The Unit is currently staffed by nine officials and is embedded in my Department's Development Cooperation and Africa Division. </p>  <p>  The Climate Unit has built upon the climate work that was already underway across the Department, in particular the funding of climate action through the Irish Aid programme. The Climate Unit currently has three main areas of thematic focus: Adaptation and Resilience, including Loss and Damage; Climate and Security; and Oceans.  In addition, the Climate team are working with colleagues to strengthen capacity across the Department on climate issues.</p>  <p>  At the World Leaders&rsquo; Summit at COP26, the Taoiseach announced that Ireland will more than double its international climate finance by 2023, to reach at least &euro;225 million per year. The target represents a significant increase on current levels of climate finance (&euro;93.6 million in 2019) and is likely to assist in making significant progress towards the Programme for Government commitment to &ldquo;at a minimum, double the overall percentage of our development assistance that counts as climate finance&rdquo; by 2030. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government has tasked the DFA Climate Unit with devising a strategy to scale up Ireland&rsquo;s climate finance contributions. </p>  <p>  The Strategy will provide a pathway to deliver on our targets, whilst ensuring that Ireland&rsquo;s climate finance is effective and impactful in supporting developing countries to address climate change. </p>  <p>  The Climate Unit is working closely with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, the Department of Finance and the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and the Marine, along with other Government Departments, in the development of the Climate Finance Roadmap. Consultation has also taken place with civil society. Work on the Roadmap is well advanced, with a view to finalisation in the first half of the year. </p></reply>

Settlement expansion, demolitions and evictions threaten the viability of a two-state solution.</p><p>During my visit to the occupied Palestinian territory in November, I saw first hand the impact that settlements are having on Palestinian communities and on prospects for peace. I am particularly concerned about developments in strategically sensitive areas around East Jerusalem.</p><p>I have conveyed in the strongest terms my concerns about settlements, which are illegal under international law, to the Israeli Foreign Minister, Yair Lapid. Ireland&rsquo;s Ambassador in Tel Aviv has also raised the issue directly with the Israeli authorities, most recently on 8 December. Ireland's Representative in Ramallah has made a number of visits along with EU colleagues to sensitive sites of concern in the West Bank.</p><p>Following the UN Security Council Open Debate on the Middle East on 19 January, Ireland made a joint press statement with France and Estonia, urging Israel not to proceed with new outline plans for the construction of hundreds of housing units in East Jerusalem, including the &ldquo;Lower Aqueduct Plan&rdquo;  between Har Homa and Givat Hamatos. The plans will further undermine the territorial contiguity of a future Palestinian State. Ireland supported the statement of 19 January by the EU External Action Service spokesperson which urged Israel not to proceed with these plans. I also echo calls by France, Germany, Italy and Spain for the Israeli authorities to reverse these decisions. </p><p>Ireland will continue to raise the issue at the Security Council, as well as at EU level and in our bilateral contacts.</p></reply>

This initiative will continue to support efforts to grow and diversify export markets, inward investment and tourism and underpin economic recovery, in close coordination with the relevant State Agencies. In addition, the strategy will ensure that Ireland is better positioned to build the alliances necessary to advance its interests and defend national positions in the post-Brexit EU, while also helping to secure our deep and positive relationship with the UK and its constituent parts into the future. </p><p>Ireland's network of diplomatic and consular missions worldwide is critical to the achievement of our foreign policy objectives, supporting our citizens internationally and providing a global economic platform for our businesses. The network also ensures efficient delivery of passport and consular services to our citizens, support to emigrant organisations and outreach to the diaspora and other networks of influence. </p><p>Since the launch of Global Ireland, 14 new missions have been opened. These are new Embassies in Wellington, Bogot&aacute;, Amman, Monrovia, Santiago de Chile, Kyiv, Rabat and Manila with new Consulates General in Cardiff, Frankfurt, Los Angeles, Manchester, Mumbai and Vancouver. Plans are underway to open an Embassy in Dakar and Consulates General in Lyon, Miami and Toronto before the end of  2022.

The rule of law and the protections afforded by the European Convention on Human Rights must apply equally to everyone and must be upheld, and this principle is at the core of the Stormont House framework.</p><p>The Stormont House Agreement was reached in 2014 by both Governments and the political parties after intensive negotiations, and sets out a comprehensive and balanced framework to address the painful legacy of the past. </p><p>The proposals published by the British Government on 14 July 2021 for a Statute of Limitation&rsquo;, ending criminal investigations and prosecutions relating to Troubles-related incidents, as well as inquests and civil litigation, represents a very radical departure from the Stormont House Agreement. We have been clear that this is not something we could support.  </p><p>Where the British Government propose significant changes to that framework, these must be discussed and agreed by both Governments and the parties to the Northern Ireland Executive. Only through a collective approach can we hope to deal with these issues comprehensively and fairly and in a way that responds to the needs of victims, survivors and society.</p><p>Following a meeting of the British Irish Intergovernmental Conference on 24 June, we agreed to begin an intensive process of engagement with the British Government and the Northern Ireland parties to find an agreed way forward, with discussions beginning in July. Importantly, this process engaged fully with victims&rsquo; representatives. It has also shown the breadth and strength of opposition to the proposals set out on UK Command paper on legacy.</p><p>At the last BIIGC, which took place on 2 December, I had a full discussion with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Brandon Lewis, in relation to the ongoing legacy engagement process, and to caution against unilateral action. The Taoiseach also wrote to the Prime Minister setting out his concerns on 7 December.</p><p>We have strongly communicated our position on this issue to the British Government and will continue to do so, and to seek a collective way forward. The Government will continue to engage and work with the British Government and the parties represented on the Northern Ireland Executive on this very important issue in the period immediately ahead.</p></reply>

Since publication of the White Paper in 2015, a total of 95 separate projects have been identified for completion over a ten-year period. To provide flexibility, projects may be sub-divided or merged, changing the top-line number.  Project and Programme Management Governance arrangements were put in place to monitor the ongoing status of individual projects and to review the scope of projects within the programme.</p>  <p>  Implementation of all of the projects is being carried out on a phased basis through the use of a project management framework with each being managed by a joint Civil-Military Project Team.  The overall process is being kept under on-going review and will be subject to change as issues arise and other business dictates.   </p>  <p>  Following on from the White Paper Update 2019 and the Government&rsquo;s High Level Implementation Plan to implement the Report of the Public Service Pay Commission, senior civil and military management concluded a review in early 2021 of the projects which resulted in reprioritisation of certain projects.  This took account of work that is progressing across the organisation which has been contributing to implementation of the White Paper.</p>  <p>  The review of progress on all projects led to the approval of an updated White Paper Programme Implementation Roadmap. Of the initial 95 projects, 66 have been formally initiated to date with 47 now formally closed and an additional four are in the closing process.  Commencement of a further 15 projects in the period 2022 to 2025 was also approved.  14 other projects have been deferred, pending recommendations of the Commission on the Defence Forces which is due to report shortly.</p></reply>

The Army's softskin fleet continues to be updated also with over 220 vehicles due for delivery in 2022.</p><p>In relation to air-based capability, the programme for the supply of two C295 Maritime Patrol Aircraft is well underway with delivery of the aircraft expected in 2023. Alongside the recently acquired PC-12 aircraft some &euro;276 million, including VAT, has been committed to the acquisition of all of these enhanced capabilities.</p><p>With regard to the Naval Service, the programme of works has for the midlife reft and upgrade of the L&Eacute; R&oacute;is&iacute;n has been completed, while works have commenced on L&Eacute; Niamh. The replacement of the flagship L&Eacute; Eithne with a multi-role vessel, MRV, is an important element of the EDP. Marine Advisors have been appointed to support the procurement of the MRV. The possible replacement of other vessels is also under consideration.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the Government established an independent Commission on the Defence Forces in December 2020. The work of the Commission encompasses the consideration of appropriate military equipment capabilities, structures and staffing, and their report will inform decisions regarding the future development of the Defence Forces.</p><p>I am satisfied that the Defence Forces have a modern and effective range of equipment which is line with best international standards, to enable them to meet operational requirements.</p></reply>

The White Paper, in addressing Air Corps capability, provided for the replacement of the Cessnas and Casa 235s fleets.  </p>  <p>  The Cessnas have now been replaced by three Pilatus PC-12 aircraft in the Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance (ISTAR) role providing a substantially increased capability with their state of the art surveilance technology.   A further Pilatus PC-12 was also procured arising from the demands of Covid.  A contract for the supply of two C295 Maritime Patrol Aircraft to replace the two Casa 235s was signed with Airbus in 2019, with delivery of the aircraft expected in 2023.  These C295s are larger and more capable aircfrat than those they replace and will enable the Air Corps to conduct martime patrols and surveillance acros Ireland's area of maritime interest, with enhanced capabilities.</p>  <p>  The White Paper also stated that should additional funding become available, the development of a radar surveillance capability for the Air Corps is a priority. Funding for this is not specifically provided in the current resource envelope and any future decisions in this regard will be in the context of priorities having regard to the ongoing security environment and any associated developments.  As outlined in the White Paper, the Air Corps's PC 9 aircraft provide a very limited air to air and air to ground capacity. Consideration of a more capable air combat intercept capability falls within the on-going Equipment Development Planning process, having regard to funding and other priorities. However, there are no plans to procure any such aircraft at his point.</p>  <p>  Following a commitment given in the Programme for Government a Commission on the Defence Forces was established by Government in December 2020 and their report is expected soon.  The Commission's  terms of reference included the consideration of appropriate capabilities, structures and staffing for the Defence Forces.  Their report will be fully considered when received and will inform decisions regarding the future development of the Defence Forces.</p></reply>

An annual grant is paid to both ONE and IUNVA to assist in their overheads. ONE is currently paid an annual grant of &euro;100,000 and IUNVA is paid an annual grant of &euro;11,000. </p>  <p>  As a further means of assistance, my Department has secured total funding of &euro;500,000 under the Dormant Accounts Fund to assist ONE and IUNVA with specific special projects. Almost &euro;300,000 was spent in 2021 while the remainder will be used to fund further special projects in 2022. </p>  <p>  On 3rd October 2021, I officially opened ONE's new residential home which can accommodate 5 retired members of the Defence Forces and a Veterans Support Centre in Cobh, Co.

The Report was accepted in full by the Government at that time and an extensive High Level Plan titled "Strengthening our Defence Forces&rdquo; was also agreed and published on the same date. The high level plan comprised 15 individual projects most of which have now been completed or at an advanced stage. </p>  <p>  In the course of the work on the projects, reports and papers were produced that relate to the identification, examination and consideration of options that inform management deliberations, but do not necessarily in themselves represent final proposals or discussion documents for exchange with the Representative Associations.  On that basis, it is not appropriate to provide the Representative associations with access to the contents of reports which are part of ongoing management deliberative processes.  My Department will of course, continue to engage with the Representative Associations on all matters that fall within the scope of representation, once Official side proposals are finalised.</p>  <p>  By way of an update on the status pf the projects, four of them, relating to pay provided immediate benefits to PDF members totalling some &euro;10m, as well as initiatives that will lead to further improvements. Also completed are projects on enhanced professional military education, bespoke leadership training, development of a mental health and wellbeing strategy, non-pay retention measures, consideration of the provision of additional specialist posts in certain areas, a review of technical pay groups and a review of recruitment processes.   The Workforce Planning Project is being progressed through the joint civil/military Strategic Human Resources Group</p>  <p>  The Review of Pay Structures project was intended to examine pay structures in the Permanent Defence Force and to fall under the public service pay agreement &ldquo;Building Momentum&rdquo;. However, in the intervening period, one of the tasks set for the Commission on the Defence Forces was also to examine pay structures in the Permanent Defence Force. The recommendations of another project dealing with incentivised long service arrangements for certain Officer and NCO ranks, fell to be considered in the context of the sectoral bargaining element of &ldquo;Building Momentum&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  The project examining Barriers to Extended Participation in the PDF was split into two phases. Phase 1 focussed on reviewing mandatory retirement ages for Officers. A review has been completed by civil and military staff and their Report contains a number of recommendations for extension in service limits. The recommendations require consideration from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, in relation to the implications on costs and pensions. </p>  <p>  Phase 2 examined the contracts of service and mandatory retirement ages for enlisted personnel.  In December 2021, agreement was secured with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform which will allow for an extension in service limits for all Privates and Corporals to remain in service up to 50 years of age, subject to them meeting certain criteria including medical and fitness standards. </p>  <p>  Arrangements were also secured which will allow for Sergeants to continue to serve beyond 50 years of age the details of which will be finalised following further discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. Other recommendations in this project will be considered in the forum of an Inter-Departmental Working Group, which the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has established to consider mandatory retirement ages for all public service groups with fast accrual pension arrangements.</p></reply>

The main day to day tasking of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the European Union. The Naval Service is tasked with patrolling all Irish waters from the shoreline to the outer limits of the Exclusive Economic Zone. These patrols are carried out on a regular and frequent basis and are directed to all areas of Irish waters as necessary. The role the Naval Service plays in Ireland&rsquo;s maritime domain is of central importance.</p><p>There are currently two medals that mark the service of personnel with either the Permanent Defence Force (PDF) or the Reserve Defence Force (RDF). The medal known as An Bonn Seirbh&iacute;se (The Service Medal) may be awarded to an officer, non-commissioned officer or private of the Defence Forces, or a member of the Army Nursing or Chaplaincy Service who possess the qualifying criteria for the award, as outlined in Defence Force Regulation A.9. Members or former members of the Army Reserve and Naval Service Reserve qualify for an Bonn Seirbh&iacute;se (Na h&Oacute;glaigh C&uacute;ltaca) (The Service Medal (Reserve Defence Force)) after 7 years service. </p><p>The award of either of these medals to qualifying personnel reflects the service given by those personnel to either the PDF or the RDF as the case may be, and by extension the wider public, during the periods for which they served. Whilst acknowledging the significant role of all Defence Forces personnel to the security of the State, I am satisfied that these medals meet the need of marking service of personnel with either the PDF or RDF as the case may be, and I have no plans to introduce additional medals in this regard.</p><p>Additional mission specific medals, such as An Bonn Seirbh&iacute;se Idirn&aacute;isi&uacute;nta Oibr&iacute;ochta &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann (The Defence Forces International Operational Service Medal) have been issued to personnel who have served on the humanitarian mission Op PONTUS in the Mediterranean. Subsequent missions to the Mediterranean as part of the EUNAVFOR mission (Op SOPHIA) have received authorised mission medals instead.</p><p>More recently, in June 2021, the Naval Service played a key role in tracking and identifying a fishing vessel which was carrying drugs estimated to be worth &euro;220 million. The vessel was intercepted off the Canary Islands after the Naval Service had brought the ship to the attention of Maritime Analysis and Operations Centre &ndash; Narcotics (MAOC (N)) the EU anti-drugs agency.  To recognise the work of the Defence Forces, in particular the Naval Service and Air Corps, I was delighted to see that they received the MAOC (N) Medal of Excellence  for their role in assisting in the interception of Trans National Organised Crime vessels transporting drugs to Europe.</p></reply>

On average, the Defence Forces conducts between 1,200 and 1,400 courses of training and education each year.</p>  <p>  The Defence Forces is committed to the promotion of lifelong learning and the accreditation of Defence Forces training and education where appropriate. As such, the organisation has a number of collaborative partners across the Further and Higher Education sector including IT Carlow, Maynooth University, Munster Technological University and SOLAS. In addition to these partnerships, the Defence Forces operates a refund of fees scheme that facilitates personnel in accessing partial funding to pay for courses in which they are engaged in their own time. </p>  <p>  The Defence Forces Policy on Specific Learning Difficulties (SLDs) provides information for Defence Forces training establishments, students and instructors on the supports available to personnel with SLDs. Guidance is available on disclosure, screening, teaching strategies, assistive technologies and assessment supports to be utilised. The Defence Forces has trained a number of Officers and Non Commissioned Officers as Student Liaison Officers to assist in the provision of these supports to personnel across the Defence Forces through the completion of a Level 9 Programme in Adult Guidance and Counselling. Defence Forces personnel are also supported to access further and higher education programmes through Recognition of Prior Learning and Work Based Learning Portfolios. These mechanisms allow access to programmes through non-traditional methods.</p>  <p>  The Defence Forces has recently published its first formal Professional Military Education Strategy, covering the period 2021 to 2024. It builds on the Professional Military Education framework previously developed for Officer Ranks, as well as the annual Training and Education Directive.</p>  <p>  The aim of the Professional Military Education strategy is to develop and maintain military capability by building on existing Professional Military Education concepts, incorporating 'best practice' approaches as utilised by other international military academies, Partner Nations, and national Higher Level Institutes in order to develop a future framework that clearly defines Defence Forces educational and career pathways, while also enabling an effective and progressive approach to the delivery of Defence Forces Education and Training needs. It will assist in ensuring that the Defence Forces attract, develop and retain high quality personnel and will underpin the capacity of the Defence Forces to fulfil the roles assigned by Government.</p></reply>

The independent Commission on the Defence Forces was established by Government in December 2020 and its terms of reference provide for their examining and making recommendations regarding the structures and size of the Defence Forces, defence capabilities, HR polices and strategies, the Reserve Defence Force, governance and high level command and control in the Defence Forces, and pay structures.  The Commission&rsquo;s overall approach is guided and informed by both the White Paper on Defence 2015 and the White Paper Update 2019.  The work of the Commission will inform the future development of the Defence Forces</p>  <p>  As part of a broad consultation process, the Commission invited submissions from individuals and organisations on matters  related to its terms of reference.  The Commission received nearly 500 submissions, all of which have been published on their website.  </p>  <p>  The Commission has met with a broad stakeholder group including the Defence Forces Representative Associations, commissioned and enlisted members of the Defence Forces, senior officials and personnel from my Department and the Defence Forces as well as other groups.  Members of the Commission also conducted site visits to military locations across the country, meeting nearly 1,000 military personnel.  In addition the Commission held two webinars, one in conjunction with the Royal Irish Academy (RIA) and one in conjunction with the Institute of International and European Affairs (IIEA).</p>  <p>  The Commission are finalising their work with a view to completing their report as soon as possible.  At that point the report will be fully considered.  Given the significant issues provided for in the Commission&rsquo;s terms of reference, there will be a requirement for consultation with Ministerial colleagues on any matters that fall within their remit, and to consider the legal and governance implications of the Commission&rsquo;s recommendations where required. I will also be seeking the views of my Department and the Defence Forces.  When these deliberations are completed I intend to revert to Government with a proposed plan of action.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, in advance of the publication of the report and the subsequent consideration of its recommendations, it would be inappropriate for me to engage in speculation regarding any of the Commission&rsquo;s potential recommendations or the response to those recommendations.</p></reply>

The provisional end of year figures indicate that there was an overall Defence Sector gross underspend of over &euro;25 million in 2021, approximately 2% of the Defence Sector allocation. </p><p>Expenditure under the Army Pensions Vote is essentially demand-driven and non-discretionary and a gross underspend of over &euro;2 million occurred in 2021. This underspend arose mainly due to less personnel exiting the Defence Forces than was originally estimated.</p><p>The provisional outturn for the Defence Vote indicates a gross underspend of &euro;23 million for 2021.

The MSPC owes its origins to the decision of the Oireachtas of Saorst&aacute;t &Eacute;ireann in June 1923 to recognise and compensate wounded members, and the widows, children and dependents of deceased members of &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann, including the National Forces, the Irish Volunteers, the Irish Republican Army and the Irish Citizen Army through the payment of allowances and gratuities.  Over time, provision was enhanced and broadened to include members of the Hibernian Rifles, Cumann na mBan, Fianna &Eacute;ireann and certain members of the Connaught Rangers.  Two streams of legislation are relevant to the material in the collection:</p><p>- The Army Pensions Acts from 1923 to 1953</p><p>- The Military Service Pensions Acts, 1924, 1934 and 1949. </p><p>The MSPC project is mandated to preserve and make available the files and records of the Department of Defence dealing with the service of qualifying members of these organisations from the period April 1916 to the 30<sup>th</sup>of September 1923. This involves cataloguing and digitising in the region of 275,000 files.</p><p>To date, there has been eleven releases of material under the MSPC project, the latest release was in November 2021.  Since the first release of material in 2014, more than 108,000 files have been individually catalogued by the MSPC team, with over 38,000 scanned files currently fully downloadable online. All releases of records from MSPC and the online resources are hosted on the Military Archives Website ().  </p><p>The Military Service Pension Collection (MSPC) has been key to some of the most dynamic recent research on the Irish revolutionary period and the records contained in the collection provide invaluable historical information that captures first-hand accounts of the experiences of the individuals involved in this defining period of Irish history.  Each release of material from this collection reveals previously unknown or forgotten experiences of those involved in events of that time. The continued digitisation and release of material from this collection presents the public with the opportunity to research information about their ancestors and their community during the period leading up to the establishment of Irish independence.</p><p>Looking forward, the MSPC project will continue to digitise and release additional material.  For 2022, it is planned that two further releases of material will take place during the year and planning is underway for a third publication from the MSPC Project.At present, it is expected that this planned publication will be ready for release in Quarter 4 of this year.  </p><p>The records in the MSPC are an important source for the history of the twentieth century Ireland as a whole and the planned  publication will further explore the collection and consider the role of the collection into the future.  Since the first release of material from this extensive historical collection it is clear that the records capture aspects of the lived experience in twentieth century Ireland and the collection contains many thousands of otherwise unrecorded voices. </p></reply>

From the 13th to the 17th September the men of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company endured almost continuous attack. At the end of the Siege, the men were taken into captivity until finally released on the 25th October 1961.</p><p>The issue of awarding of Military Medals for Gallantry (MMG) and Distinguished Service Medals (DSMs) to a number of personnel who served in Jadotville in September 1961 has been considered on a number of occasions over the years and a range of actions have taken place to give due recognition to the courage and bravery of all the members of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, 35<sup>th</sup>Infantry Battalion who were stationed in Jadotville in 1961. </p><p>Notwithstanding the actions that have been taken to date to recognise and honour the valiant actions and bravery of all of the men stationed at Jadotville sixty years ago, an Independent Review Group (IRG) was established to examine and report on matters relating to recommendations for military medals relating to events at Jadotville.The IRG completed its research in July 2021 and has submitted its report.The work of the Independent Review Group has now concluded.  </p><p>The IRG made a number of recommendations in its report, which was published in full last July,  including a recommendation that the 60th anniversary of Jadotville be commemorated.  Other recommendations relate to the awarding of medals, veterans affairs and honouring the role of families and the support they provided to veterans.  All recommendations have been considered at a high level.  </p><p>The deeply unsettling aftermath of Jadotville is detailed in the report as is the lack of personal welfare supports afforded to the men following events at Jadotville, their period in captivity and upon their return home. I have apologised to veterans and to their families on behalf of the State and the Government to the men of &lsquo;A&rsquo; Company, 35<sup>th</sup>Infantry Battalion and to their families for the lack of necessary supports or deserved recognition of their valiant service on their return from the Congo and for the many issues that arose as a result, some of which had tragic consequences.  I have also acknowledged that the lack of supports in place at that time is extremely regrettable.  There have been great steps in the intervening years to support Defence Forces personnel, their families and veterans through the work of the Defence Forces personnel support services.  </p><p>As a<b></b>matter relating to the IRG recommendations is currently before the courts, it would not be appropriate for me to provide any further information in relation to the various recommendations made by the IRG at this time.</p></reply>

The rate is currently &euro;4.20 per day.</p>  <p>  The rate was originally calculated based on a scale of provisions determined to deliver nutritionally balanced meals with recommended levels of essential food groups and having regard to the cost of such food to the Defence Forces and economies of scale that are achieved.

Average annual expenditure in this area in the three years 2019 to 2021 has been &euro;3.2 million.   </p>  <p>  The military authorities have advised me that the daily ration rate will be reviewed having regard to the re-tendering of OGP food contracts, a process which is currently underway.

It is envisaged that the Strategic Compass will set out policy orientations and specific goals and objectives in areas such as crisis management, resilience, capability development and partnerships.  EU Member States have, over the last number of years, worked together on its further development with the adoption of a finalised version of the Compass expected in March of this year. </p>  <p>  The first draft of the Strategic Compass was presented by HRVP Borrell to Foreign and Defence Ministers in a joint session of the Foreign Affairs Council in Foreign Affairs and Defence format on 15th November 2021. The draft set out an analysis of the prevailing strategic environment, followed by proposals in the areas of crisis management, resilience, capability development and the EU&rsquo;s work with key partners.</p>  <p>  Ireland has, and continues to play an active role in efforts to develop the EU&rsquo;s Strategic Compass.  Once agreed by all Member States, this policy document will serve to guide the EU&rsquo;s approach towards CSDP for the next decade, while also reflecting the increasingly complex security landscape faced by the EU. There are many proposals within the Strategic Compass which may lead to tangible future initiatives, but these remain under discussion by all Member States and are yet to be agreed. </p>  <p>  Ireland has always engaged constructively in the development of the EU&rsquo;s Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP). </p>  <p>  From Ireland&rsquo;s perspective, we welcome the Strategic Compass as a means of setting out our shared strategic vision as a Union for the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) and of enhancing the role of the EU as a security provider that can contribute effectively to international peace and security.</p>  <p>  In my view, the Strategic Compass also offers an important opportunity for the EU to project its values.  In my discussions with other Member States, I have therefore suggested that the starting point for the Compass, should be the core values that underpin our approach to CSDP, including our collective commitment to effective multilateralism and the rules-based international order. In this regard, the exercise offers an excellent opportunity to strengthen the EU&rsquo;s cooperation with the United Nations, including in the areas of peacekeeping and crisis management.</p></reply>

Defence Vote 36 provides funding for the pay and allowances of members of the Defence Forces, civilian employees and Departmental staff, ongoing Defence Forces operational and standing costs, the acquisition of military equipment along with the development of Defence Forces built infrastructure. It also provides funding for Civil Defence and the Irish Red Cross Society. Separately, Vote 35 provides for expenditure on Military Pensions. </p><p>On an annual basis, the Defence Group budget is determined within the overarching budgetary framework and approved by D&aacute;il Eireann, having regard to the level of resources available and defence policy requirements. Capital funding allocations are also framed by the multi-annual National Development Plan. </p><p>International comparison of military expenditure are made difficult by the lack of publicly available data, and by the breadth of difference between nations in their international security and defence policies. In addition, there is no EU requirement for Ireland to achieve any specific percentage of GDP target in relation to Defence expenditure, nor is there any agreement at EU level in this regard. It should also be noted that the CSO, in introducing Modified Gross National Income (GNI*), have recognised that the figures for Ireland&rsquo;s GDP are significantly impacted by the effects of globalisation.</p><p>As such, the international perspective is best used for context rather than comparison between militaries. </p><p>Against that background and using the latest data published by the European Defence Agency, details on defence spending as a % of GDP across EU Member States in 2019 indicates the level of Irish expenditure on defence, at 0.5% of GNI* , is lower than other neutral<sup>1</sup>EU states such as Austria, Sweden, Finland, Malta, and Cyprus.  </p><p>However, it is worth noting that within the resources allocated to Defence, the Defence Forces make a significant contribution to domestic security, provide a broad range of supports to the civil authorities, undertake roles such as Emergency Aeromedical Support (EAS) and fishery protection and are widely respected for their contribution to international peace and security. Ireland provides a level of support to the UN that, relative to the size of our Defence Forces, exceeds that of many countries. For this, we can be justifiably proud.</p><p>The Government remains committed to ensuring that the Defence Forces have sufficient funding to deliver assigned roles, both at home and overseas, in line with priorities as set out in the White Paper on Defence (2015) and the 2019 White Paper Update.</p><p>The Deputy will also be aware that the Government established an independent Commission on the Defence Forces in December 2020. The work of the Commission encompasses the consideration of appropriate military equipment capabilities, structures and staffing, and their report will inform decisions regarding the future development of the Defence Forces. The Commission are finalising their work with a view to completing their Report as soon as possible. The Commission's Report, when submitted, will be fully considered at that point. </p><p><i><sup>1</sup></i><i>defined as EU Non-NATO MS.</i></p></reply>

There is an establishment of 9,500 personnel for the Permanent Defence Force, 7,520 for the Army, 1,094 for the Naval Service, and 996 for the Air Corps.   </p>  <p>  While the Government remains committed to returning to and maintaining the agreed strength of the Permanent Defence Force across all three services at 9,500 personnel, there are a number of factors, some of which are hard to predict, that will impact on the timeframe within which this will be achieved. The on-going staffing challenges in the Defence Forces have been acknowledged and a range of measures have been taken to tackle them.</p>  <p>  There is ongoing recruitment, which has resulted in 576 personnel being inducted in 2021.  I launched a recruitment campaign specifically targeting potential Naval Service recruits in June 2021. 78 Naval Service personnel were inducted in 2021 comprised of 65 recruits, 8 cadets, 3 Direct Entry specialists and 2 re-joining enlisted personnel.</p>  <p>  The 2022 Recruitment Plan is not yet finalised. However the Defence Forces remain committed to optimising the number of personnel inducted in 2022 and target General Service Recruits, Cadets, Air Corps Apprentice Aircraft Technicians and specialists for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service. The Defence Forces are actively engaged in providing career talks within schools and participate in relevant events such as career guidance counsellor conferences and transition year events. </p>  <p>  The scope of direct entry competitions, along with their terms and conditions, continue to be expanded and revised to improve intakes, and the re-entry campaign for former members of the PDF continues.</p>  <p>In relation to retention, there has been significant progress on pay arising out of increases due from recent pay agreements, the most recent of which was a 1% increase on annualised salaries or &euro;500, whichever was greater, on the 1st October 2021, with further increases to follow. There are now Service Commitment schemes active in both the Air Corps and the Naval Service, and a special Naval Service tax credit for sea-going personnel remains available in 2022.</p>  <p>  In addition. in light of the particular challenges faced by the Defence Sector, the Government tasked the Public Service Pay Commission (PSPC) to undertake a comprehensive review and analysis of underlying difficulties in recruitment and retention in the Defence Forces. The reommendations of this report have been progressed through a series of speciifc projects. </p>  <p>  I am confident that the pay benefits delivered by the Public Service pay agreements, in tandem with the implementation of the PSPC's recommendations will improve recruitment and retention challenges currently being experienced by the PDF.</p>  <p>  Additionally, the Commission on the Defence Forces are finalising their work with a view to completing the report as soon as possible. The Commission's Report, when submitted, will be fully considered at that point and will inform future decisions regarding the Defence Forces.</p>  <p>  My focus remains on retaining and restoring the Permanent Defence Forces to its full capacity. </p></reply>

Rather than interpreting neutrality as meaning that Ireland should stand aside, successive Irish governments have considered that neutrality enhances our reputation internationally and enables us to engage more effectively in our efforts to promote peace and development through the UN, the European Union and our own bilateral actions.</p>  <p>  As I stated previously in respect of any deepening European Union and NATO links, it is my view that, as an active participant in NATO Partnership for Peace, Ireland should continue to welcome greater EU-NATO co-operation where it contributes to international peace and security and is focused on avoiding duplication of structures, systems and interoperability standards.  This ensures better coherence and effectiveness on the ground in peace support and crisis management operations.</p>  <p>  The international defence and security agenda is a busy and evolving one, with the threats and challenges we collectively face growing in recent years. In the context of addressing and indeed tackling these challenges, Ireland is a committed multilateralist and greatly values the contribution that we can, and do make, through our membership of the European Union and the United Nations. </p></reply>

The Council also reiterated its full support for Ukraine&rsquo;s sovereignty and territorial integrity and noted that "any further military aggression against Ukraine will have massive consequences and severe cost in response, including restrictive measures coordinated with partners." The Council urged diplomatic efforts to achieve the full implementation of the Minsk Agreements.</p>  <p>  Earlier this week, the Foreign Affairs Council, in which I participated, adopted conclusions noting that &ldquo;the EU has accelerated the preparatory work&rdquo; on a &ldquo;wide array of sectoral and individual restrictive measures that would be adopted in coordination with partners&rdquo; in the event of &ldquo;any further military aggression by Russia against Ukraine&rdquo;. These conclusions condemned Russia&rsquo;s continued aggressive actions and threats against Ukraine and called on Russia to de-escalate. Ministers concurred that the EU should continue with diplomatic efforts to convince Russia to take the path of dialogue and tasked the High Representative to keep coordinating the EU position with key partners like the US, NATO and OSCE. </p>  <p>  Ireland strongly supports the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, a position we have repeatedly reaffirmed at the UN Security Council meetings on Ukraine and in EU meetings, including at a meeting of EU Defence Ministers on 12 January and meetings of EU Foreign Ministers on 13/14 January and on 24 January.</p>  <p>   The Deputy will be aware that the deployment of contingents of the Defence Force on overseas military operations must be approved under an appropriate resolution of the United Nations Security Council and is subject to Government and D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approval as appropriate.  In considering any mission, the Government takes many factors into account including the capability requirements of the operation and the capacity of the Defence Forces to discharge the mandate of the operation.   The Deputy will note the strong emphasis by the EU on diplomatic efforts to de-escalate the current situation and, as such, the issue in question does not arise at this time.  </p></reply>

Neither military or defence matters, nor fisheries management, come under the remit of the OSPAR Convention. </p>  <p>  The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage are the responsible Department for all matters relating to the OSPAR Convention.</p>  <p>  The North Atlantic Current and Evlanov Sea basin marine protected area (NACES MPA) and the North-East Atlantic Environment Strategy 2030 (NEAES 2030) constitute two key deliverables of the 2021 Ministerial meeting under the 1992 OSPAR Convention, which took place in Portugal in October last.</p>  <p>  The North Atlantic Current and Evlanov Sea basin MPA is situated in mid-Atlantic area beyond national jurisdiction waters, in other words in the High Seas. While this important site for marine birds lies within the OSPAR Maritime Area, it lies far beyond Ireland&rsquo;s maritime area.</p>  <p>  The Naval Service is the State's principal sea-going agency tasked with a variety of defence and other roles. While the main day to day tasking of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the European Union, it also carries out a number of other non-fishery related tasks such as search and rescue, diving operations, drugs interdiction as well as many more. In terms of fishery protection, the Naval Service is tasked with patrolling all Irish waters from the shoreline to the outer limits of the Exclusive Economic Zone. </p>  <p>  There appears to be little direct role to be played by the Naval Service as a result of the recently announced NACES MPA. However my Department looks forward to further engagement with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage on this matter if required. </p></reply>

Defence Ministers also received a short Current Affairs briefing which touched on topics such as the situation at the Ukrainian border and the European Security Architecture, as well as the situation in Mali.</p>  <p>  The working dinner, in which I participated, was also attended by United Nations Under-Secretary General for Peace Operations Jean-Pierre Lacroix and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, as well as the Chair of the Sub-Committee of the European Parliament on Security and Defence (SEDE) Nathalie Loiseau MEP. The discussion focused on the threats posed by various mercenary groups - notably the Wagner Group - in Libya, Syria, Ukraine and Central African Republic for example, with the discussion invited to focus on the threats faced, ways to tackle it, and concrete proposals on how to strengthen CSDPs operational effectiveness in that context. I took the opportunity to express Ireland's deep concern at the increasing engagement of both State and non-State actors in a number of countries where the EU has been working to improve peace and security and their negative impact on CSDP missions and operations. The NATO Secretary General also took the opportunity to debrief EU Defence Ministers on that day's meeting of the NATO-Russia Council.</p>  <p>  The working session on 'Safeguarding the EU&rsquo;s strategic interests in contested domains: focus on outer space', took place in the framework of the ongoing work on the Strategic Compass, with discussions focusing on the increasing threats and challenges faced (in the context of an EU Space Strategy for Security and Defence); how to react to hostile behaviours in space, how to protect space related assets and how space services best serve security and defence, in particular situational awareness for our CSDP missions and operations.</p>  <p>  The joint working lunch between Foreign Affairs and Defence Ministers focused on the first revised text of the Strategic Compass, which was presented to Ministers by the High Representative/Vice Prisident, Josep Borrell. Ministers provided their first reactions to the revised text with a view to providing guidance for further work within the Council, to ensure that the Strategic Compass is both ambitious and actionable prior to its adoption in March. Ireland welcomed the progress on the Strategic Compass as set out in the revised draft and urged a continued emphasis on multilateralism and the importance of the EU-UN strategic relationship.</p></reply>

As part of this project the Department of Transport convened an inter-Departmental/Agency Steering Group of which both the Department of Defence and the Air Corps were members. </p><p>A strategic assessment and preliminary appraisal document in line with the Public Service Code was brought to Government for information in July 2020. This preliminary appraisal, which included an appraisal of various service delivery options, was compiled by the Department of Transport&rsquo;s Project Team in conjunction with KPMG, and was shared with the Steering Group before going to Government in summer 2020. The preliminary work included an appraisal of the options of the State assuming full responsibility for the service, either through the Air Corps or a dedicated Irish Coast Guard Aviation Branch. Both options were ruled out for a variety of reasons but notably the risks to the State and questions around potential affordability and deliverability.  </p><p>I agreed with the strategic assessment and preliminary appraisal and I confirmed then, as I do again now, that I did not see the Air Corps taking full responsibility for search and Rescue (SAR) aviation services in Ireland&rsquo;s SAR domain. However, given the Air Corps' historic role in SAR provision, at the end of 2020 I asked Defence officials to engage further with the Department of Transport to explore the option of the Air Corps providing some element of the next generation SAR aviation service while at the same time ensuring that the service meets domestic and international obligations for SAR and represents value for money for the State. </p><p>There was proactive and realistic engagement between the Defence Organisation and the Department of Transport Project Team during the first 6 months of 2021. This included the consideration of the option of the Air Corps providing some element of the helicopter and fixed wing SAR service as part of the Transport Project Team&rsquo;s detailed appraisal and business case. The option which included the Air Corps providing an element of the helicopter and fixed wing SAR service did not emerge as the preferred option. </p><p>In July 2021, the Government agreed to commence the formal procurement process for a new Coast Guard aviation service.  The decision was based on the detailed appraisal and business case prepared in accordance with the Public Spending Code.  The Government also agreed that the Department of Defence, working in conjunction with the Irish Coast Guard, would examine whether the fixed wing element of the proposed service could be delivered by the Air Corps in line with the requirements and parameters set out in the business case. </p><p>Additional project time was afforded for these further discussions to take place which concluded in October 2021 with a fixed wing proposal submitted to the Department of Transport. Whereas it was decided not to initially proceed with the full Air Corps proposal, provision has been made within the procurement process which provides for the Air Corps to undertake the fixed wing element of the service at the appropriate time should the Air Corps have the capacity and availability to provide this service. </p><p>It has been important that a full and realistic consideration is made of all of the viable options available to the State. I am satisfied that this is the approach that has been taken. </p><p>Both the Naval Service and the Air Corps currently provide support to the Coast Guard on a request and availability basis.</p></reply>

In regard to a business operating in the health and fitness sector, such as a gym mentioned in the detail, it should be noted that the Local Enterprise Offices do not ordinarily provide direct grant-aid to areas such as retail, personal services, local professional services, gyms/local building services, as it may give rise to the displacement of existing businesses. </p>  <p>  However, the Local Enterprise Offices do provide a wide range of high-quality business and management development programmes that are tailored to meet specific business requirements. Whether it is starting a business or growing a business there is something suitable for anyone exploring self-employment as an option. </p>  <p>  In particular, I would encourage the person to enquire about the Start Your Own Business Programme. The objective is to assist clients in assessing their business idea, its viability and helps them decide if they should proceed or take a step back. The programme covers topics such as Starting up / getting started, Identifying, understanding, and researching your target market, Developing your Business Plan amongst other vital areas of interest to a new business. </p>  <p>  I would also suggest seeking the advice of a LEO Business Mentor; the Mentor programme is open to both new and existing businesses located within the Local Enterprise Office region and is designed to match up the knowledge, skills, insights and entrepreneurial capability of experienced business practitioners with small business owner/ managers who need practical and strategic one to one advice and guidance. The mentor contributes independent, informed observation and advice to aid decision making. Mentors can also advise on finance options available to entrepreneurs and can assist with applications and referrals to Micro-Finance Ireland, which provides vital support to eligible microenterprises by lending to businesses that cannot obtain loans from other commercial lenders and who do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by commercial lenders. It offers loan funding, including Start-up Loans, from &euro;5,000 to &euro;25,000. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that the Department of Rural and Community Development (DRCD) provides some funding to social enterprises as defined by the National Social Enterprise Policy 2019 &ndash; 2022, with a view to complementing mainstream business supports.</p>  <p>  Support may also be sought from Local Development Companies (LDCs), which are volunteer-led multi-sectoral partnerships, delivering community and rural development from a bottom-up perspective. Local Development Companies are located throughout Ireland, in every local authority area.</p></reply>

Account is also taken of contextual factors such as Brexit and, in the current context, COVID 19.</p>  <p>The most recent review concluded on 27th October. To alleviate continued shortages in construction, to assist in the deliver on the National Planning Framework objective of 33,000 new homes per annum until 2030 and to deliver on our Climate Action targets, an additional 8 construction sector categories of occupation were made eligible for a general employment permit.</p>  <p>  These newly eligible roles are for Electricians; Masons; Roofers, Roof Tilers and Slaters; Plumbers and Heating and Ventilating Engineers; Carpenters and Joiners; Floorers and Wall Tilers; Painters and Decorators; and Construction and Building Trades Supervisors.</p>  <p>  This essentially ensures that almost all construction roles can access the employment permit system.</p></reply>

It is administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI).  Since the scheme started, over 143,000 homes have received free upgrades.  The average cost of the energy efficiency measures provided per household in 2021 was &euro;17,100, an increase of approximately &euro;1,000 per home since 2020.  In order to qualify for support, applicants must own and live in their home which must have been built and occupied before 2006 and must be in receipt of certain social welfare payments.  Health status is not part of the eligibility criteria for the Scheme.  </p>  <p>  The average wait times were impacted by COVID-19 related restrictions on construction activity in place for periods during 2020 and 2021 when the scheme was fully paused in line with Government guidelines. Wait times have also been impacted by challenges associated with availability and longer lead in time for materials. The SEAI has also advised that wait times may vary, based on a number of issues. For instance, once the survey is completed and works are allocated to a contractor, the time to complete works is dependent on a number of factors including the scale of works to be completed, access to the property, availability of materials, weather and in recent years COVID-19 public health restrictions. </p>  <p>  There are currently just over 7,000 homes awaiting works on the Better Energy Warmer Homes Scheme work programme, a reduction of approximately 300 since December 2020. This includes homes that are: currently undergoing works; have been allocated to contractors for works; have completed an initial home survey and are awaiting allocation to a contractor or are awaiting the initial survey of their home.  The SEAI aims to significantly reduce the waiting list in 2022, on the basis of working first on homes that are longest on the waiting list.</p>  <p>  SEAI data indicates that for homes completed to date in 2021, the average time from application to completion was approximately 26 months.  For the same period, the average time for a surveyor to be allocated was approximately 18 months, a reduction of five months since December 2020.</p>  <p>  Budget 2022 has allocated &euro;202 million for residential and community retrofit this year. Over half of this (&euro;109 million) will be used to provide free energy efficiency upgrades to households in the Warmer Homes Scheme. In addition, delivery capacity in the supply chain has increased due to a new, broader contractor panel that commenced at the end of 2020. I have also secured additional resources to expand the capacity of the SEAI to deliver the scheme. SEAI received additional funding in Budget 2021 which delivered an increase of 30 staff across the organisation and Budget 2022 is providing funding for a further 30 staff this year.  Every effort is being made to maximise output since construction activity in the residential sector recommenced in mid-April 2021.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that there are other grants and schemes available from Government that could assist homeowners if there is an urgent need. These include the Department of Social Protection (DSP) Urgent Needs Payment available through the Community Welfare Service at local DSP offices and the grants funded by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage  to support housing adaptation and upgrade for older persons and people with a disability. </p></reply>

This includes consignments coming from the UK. The requirement for electronic import declarations for postal consignments came into force on the 1 July 2021. This is an EU requirement across all Member States and is necessary to protect public health, to ensure food safety and product standards and to protect EU businesses from unfair international competition thus preserving jobs for European workers including Irish workers.</p>  <p>  Consignments from outside the EU cannot be delivered to the importer without the submission of an electronic Customs declaration and the payment of any taxes and duties due. The importer may complete these procedures themselves but generally, private individual importers appoint a representative such as a courier company or a postal operator to complete these Customs procedures on their behalf. It is this representative who becomes liable for the Customs debt at the point of import.</p>  <p>  These representatives do not act on behalf of, nor do they collect the relevant taxes and duties on behalf of Revenue, but rather they act on the behalf of the importer and assist the importer in the clearance of their goods imported from outside the European Union. As this is a commercial arrangement between the importer and the representative, the matter of a tender process doesn&rsquo;t arise. </p>  <p>  The rate of Customs Duty which is owed is dependent on the origin and type of goods contained within the consignment. The rate of VAT applied is the rate which would be applied for the supply of similar goods in Ireland. </p></reply>

An increase of &euro;1,500 in the income tax standard rate band for all income earners was also introduced. Furthermore, the 2% rate band ceiling for USC was also increased for 2022 in line with the increase in the national minimum wage to ensure that a full-time adult worker who benefits from the increase in the hourly minimum wage rate of &euro;10.20 to &euro;10.50 will remain outside the top rates of USC. Further details can be located at the following link - <i>www.gov.ie/en/publication/7e491-taxation-measures/</i>. </p><p>Having regard to the fiscal demands and pressures facing the State in 2022, it was not possible to increase all tax credits and remain within the fiscal parameters. However, the tax changes introduced in Budget 2022, will benefit all income earners who pay income tax, including those persons in receipt of the Single Person Child Carer Credit, and are aimed at helping taxpayers at a time when prices are rising.  I would also note that those in receipt of this credit may also have entitlement to an increased standard rate band each year which is &euro;4,000 higher than that which applies to a single person who is not entitled to the credit.</p><p>In all the circumstances, I am satisfied that the Single Person Child Carer Credit in its current form is appropriately calibrated at present and there are no immediate plans to review or amend the credit.</p></reply>

The independence of banks in which the State has a shareholding is protected by Relationship Frameworks which are legally binding documents that cannot be changed unilaterally. These frameworks, which are publicly available, were insisted upon by the European Commission to protect competition in the Irish market. The AIB Relationship Framework is available to view on my Department's website. </p>  <p>  My officials contacted AIB and received the following response:</p>  <p>  "AIB is undertaking a review of all investments in the property funds, known as Belfry, sold between 2002 and 2006. Each investment is examined on a case by case basis to determine if redress may be due in certain instances. The bank is continuing to communicate with Belfry investors to make them aware of this review, to provide progress updates and to advise a dedicated contact point for any queries. AIB is focused on completing its review of these legacy investments in a timely manner. Based on initial assessments, a provision of &euro;75 million has been taken for the anticipated cost of redress and other related costs that may be payable. This was set out in a note in AIB&rsquo;s H1 2021 accounts. </p>  <p>  "In July 2021, the bank settled legal claims from approximately 270 investors in Belfry Funds. A provision amounting to &euro;25 million was taken at that time in relation to this settlement and the associated costs."  </p></reply>

However, please be assured that we have made clear our expectations of all regulated firms, that consumers and investors are treated in a fair and transparent way, and that firms fully comply with both regulations and our supervisory expectations. If consumers or investors have queries in relation to their Belfry Funds, they should contact AIB directly at<i>belfryenquiries@aib.ie</i>.&quot;</p></reply>

I have no role in the day to day workings of the office or in the decisions which he takes.</p>  <p>  The redress that can be directed by the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman is outlined in the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman Act 2017, as amended (&lsquo;the Act&rsquo;). </p>  <p>  In drafting this legislation, my Department reviewed the legislation underpinning the Pensions Ombudsman (the Pensions Act 1990, inserted by the Pensions (Amendment) Act 2002), and the Financial Services Ombudsman, (Part 7 of the Central Bank Act 1942, as inserted by the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Act 2004). In a number of areas the different treatment of the two respective categories of Financial Services and Pensions was maintained. </p>  <p>  Therefore, different rules continue apply in relation to financial redress in respect of financial services and pension providers which reflects the different characteristics of pension products and other financial products and services.</p>  <p>  However it is important to note that financial redress is not the only option available to the FSPO to address complaints in relation to financial services and pension providers. The objective of the Office is broader than the provision of financial redress. </p>  <p>  The role of the FSPO is to resolve complaints from consumers through independent, fair, impartial, confidential and free service. For some consumers this may be an informal process, for others it may involve mediation, investigation, decision and settlements or redress. </p>  <p>  While there is no plans to amend the FSPO Act at this time, the Department continually reviews all consumer protection legislation, including the FSPO Act, under our remit to ensure that a comprehensive framework is in place which provides adequate protections for consumers in respect of regulated financial services. </p></reply>

The Sectoral Adaptation Plans are available at <i>www.gov.ie/en/collection/51df3-sectoral-adaptation-planning/</i>.</p><p>The Climate Action Plan 2021 lists the actions needed to deliver on Ireland&rsquo;s climate targets and sets indicative ranges of emissions reductions for each sector of the economy. The Plan will be updated annually, including in 2022, to ensure alignment with legally binding economy-wide carbon budgets and sectoral ceilings.</p><p>The OPW is co-ordinating Ireland&rsquo;s whole of Government approach to flood risk management through the Interdepartmental Flood Policy Co-ordination Group, across the following strategic and policy areas:</p><p>- <b>Prevention - </b>avoiding construction in flood-prone areas.</p><p>- <b>Protection - </b>taking feasible measures to protect areas against flooding.</p><p>- <b>Preparedness - </b>planning and responding to reduce the impacts of flood events.</p><p>The members of this Interdepartmental Group are proactively progressing a wide range of significant policy initiatives, for example: </p><p>- The Department of Social Protection has an important role in assisting households in the immediate aftermath of emergency events through the Humanitarian Assistance Scheme.  The purpose of this scheme is to prevent hardship by providing income-tested financial support to people whose homes are damaged from flooding and severe weather events and who are not in a position to meet costs for essential needs, household items and structural repair. </p><p>- The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment operates the humanitarian support scheme for small businesses, community, voluntary and sporting bodies provides assistance to those affected by flooding.  The scheme provides a one-off emergency humanitarian support contribution (max. &euro;20,000) towards the costs of returning business premises&rsquo; to their pre-flood condition including the replacement of flooring, fixtures and fittings and damaged stock. </p><p>- The Department of Rural and Community Development has developed a draft Framework Proposal for Community Resilience within Major Emergency Management.  The draft Framework explores the potential additional support structure that can be built into existing response plans, facilitating greater co-operation and understanding at a local level while providing the potential for extra resources if, and when, required.  </p><p>- The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage is designated as the Lead Government Department with responsibility for severe weather events including flooding.  Local Authorities are designated as the lead agency for response to flooding in the Framework for Major Emergency Management. </p><p>- The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage published the <i>Planning System and Flood Risk Management Guidelines for Planning Authorities </i>in November 2009.  The Guidelines provide for the incorporation of flood risk identification, assessment and management into the planning process.  </p></reply>

At this meeting, the Government also agreed the General Scheme of the National Cultural Institutions (National Concert Hall) Amendment Bill 2022 providing for an amendment to the National Cultural Institutions (National Concert Hall) Act 2015, and providing for an Amendment to the Broadcasting Act 2009. </p>  <p>  The existing provisions of the National Concert Hall Act 2015 are considered broad enough to include the transfer of the NSO as part of the NCH's brief  to promote and support the performance of music supported by the express power to enter into arrangements for this purpose.  It was on this basis that the transfer was agreed by Government, in advance of amending the NCH Act.</p>  <p>  The Government considers it desirable to amend the Act of 2015 and the Broadcasting Act 2009 to expressly give the NCH the power to own and maintain an orchestra. In this regard the General Scheme of the National Cultural Institutions (National Concert Hall) Amendment Bill 2022 will shortly be submitted to the Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media for pre-legislative scrutiny. </p>  <p>  The decision to transfer the NSO at this time will have a positive impact on the operation of the orchestra including in relation to recruitment.  At present, the playing complement is below that required to perform the full repertoire of classical programming, leading to a reliance on casual performers supplementing the members of the orchestra for many performances.  This lent urgency to the task of enabling the NCH to commence the process of restoring the orchestra to full strength and their being empowered to deliver on the artistic vision outlined in the Boaden report. </p></reply>

The Government is committed to increasing social housing delivery and plans to deliver more than 90,000 social homes to 2030. </p><p>My Department operates a number of funding programmes that assist local authorities to work in partnership with AHBs to construct, purchase and lease new homes and make them available for social housing. One such programme that provides finance to assist AHBs progress construction projects is the Capital Advance Loan Facility (CALF). </p><p>CALF funding is capital support provided to Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) by local authorities to facilitate the funding of construction, acquisition or refurbishment of new social housing units.  This loan facility can support up to 30% of the eligible capital cost of the housing project, with the housing units provided to local authorities for social housing use under long-term lease arrangements known as Payment and Availability Agreements. A nominal interest rate of 2% fixed per annum is charged by the local authority on the initial capital amount.<b></b>Repayments on either the capital or interest are not required during the term of the loan (between 10 and 30 years), although where an AHB chooses to, repayments can be made during the term. At the end of the term, the outstanding capital amount plus the interest accrued, is owed and repayable to the local authority. The local authority issues the CALF monies to the AHB and the local authority, in turn, recoups same from the Department.</p><p>With regard to the specific project mentioned by the Deputy, I can confirm that the project received conditional CALF funding approval in 2019 for 34 social housing homes.

The applicant must be discharged from bankruptcy proceedings. It should be noted that a return to solvency should not be interpreted as a return to creditworthiness, which is a separate assessment.</p><p>In recognition of such instances, an exemption to the First Time Buyer eligibility criteria can be applied under the Fresh Start Principle. </p><p>The final decision regarding the Local Authority Home Loan application is made by the relevant Local Authority Credit Committee on a case by case basis.</p><p>Further details can be found on <i>localauthorityhomeloan.ie/</i>.</p></reply>

It provides for a range of proportionate sanctions to be imposed after investigation. Complaints in relation to building regulations will continue to be dealt with under the Building Control Act.</p>  <p>  The Bill provides that when the register is operating on a statutory basis, the Admissions and Appeals Board shall publish information in relation to sanctions of registered members as it thinks fit and that the statutory body shall also prepare an annual report of its proceedings under the Act. </p>  <p>  The current Construction Industry Register of Ireland (CIRI) register was established in 2014 by the Construction Industry Federation and approximately 800 building and contracting entities are included on the register.

Many thousands of Irish emigrants fleeing Ireland at that time found refuge and a new home in the United States, and many of these are the ancestors of the 30 million Americans who now claim Irish heritage.</p>  <p>  -    Ireland&rsquo;s Great Hunger Museum at Quinnipiac University holds an impressive collection of art, artefacts and literature related to the Famine. Showcasing collections such as these is important in ensuring the story of where the Irish came from is not forgotten. The Museum has played an important role in that process. </p>  <p>  I am aware of the challenges facing the museum in recent years and believe that, should the museum not reopen in its current location, it would be important that a new home be found for this collection. The aim should be to re-house the collection so that the works it contains remain accessible to the public and researchers alike. I am aware that there is strong preference amongst the Irish American community for it to remain in the United States. Should another museum or institution be identified to host the collection, my Department would be happy to discuss if there are any ways we can offer support. Other Departments may also wish to consider this. </p></reply>

Along with our EU partners, we have consistently called on Russia to de-escalate the tensions caused by its protracted military build-up. The build-up of Russian troops near its border with Ukraine is a significant cause for concern to us.</p>  <p>  It is the fundamental and inalienable right of a sovereign and independent state to chart its own path in the world; to choose its own foreign policy and to make arrangements for the security and defence of its territory. Ireland has made its own choice to be a committed member of the EU. Ireland&rsquo;s policy of neutrality remains very clear and accepted by our EU partners. In fact, Ireland is one of five EU Member States that pursue a policy of military neutrality.  Just as we would not accept another state dictating what foreign or defence policy we choose to follow as a nation, Ukraine has the sovereign right to follow its own foreign and defence policy without interference from outside its borders.</p>  <p>  I have been closely engaged in this issue at the EU for many months. I and my EU colleagues discussed the situation in Ukraine most recently at the Foreign Affairs Council on Monday of this week (24 January). The EU is united in its support to Ukraine and its commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty. We have sent a clear message to Russia to defuse tension in the context of their activities on the border of Ukraine, and to give reassurance to the rest of the world on its intentions.</p>  <p>  As EU Foreign Ministers, we condemned Russia&rsquo;s continued aggressive actions and threats against Ukraine. We have also been clear that, should Russia decide to invade Ukraine militarily, there would be severe consequences for such action from an EU perspective, in terms of sanctions and restrictions. These would follow quickly and would have a sustained and significant effect.</p></reply>

I expect that by the end of this month, staffing numbers will be at approximately 775. This is a 70% increase on June of last year. Significant numbers of staff will continue to be assigned to the Passport Service throughout February and into March.</p>  <p>  The Irish Passport was recently ranked 5th in the Henley Global Passport Index as it provides our citizens with visa free access to 187 countries. In order to protect the integrity and security of the Irish passport, Passport Service staff continued to work on-site over the past challenging two years to deliver this essential service to our citizens. Despite pandemic-related disruptions, the Passport Service issued over 634,000 passports in 2021. </p>  <p>  I am confident that the additional staff that have been assigned and will continue to be recruited over the coming weeks will have a positive impact on processing times, particularly for first time passport applications.</p>  <p>  I am aware that there is pent-up demand for passports due to the challenges with international travel over the past two years. I urge citizens to check the validity of their passports before booking travel and to ensure that they apply online in plenty of time. The processing of an online application is consistently up to four times faster than the processing time of a paper application. </p></reply>

As a committed signatory to the Call for Action on the Protection of Women from Gender Based Violence (GBV) in Conflict, Ireland is a leading voice in ensuring that every humanitarian response from the outset includes the policies, systems and mechanisms necessary to prevent and mitigate GBV. Furthermore, through a Strategic Partnership with the International Rescue Committee, Ireland funds life-saving services for women and girl survivors of GBV in five of the most protracted, underfunded humanitarian settings in Africa &ndash; South Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia, Kenya and Burundi.</p>  <p>  Ireland is also actively engaged in the work of the Security Council&rsquo;s Working Group on Children and Armed Conflict, and its efforts to protect children in situations of conflict. President Higgins delivered Ireland&rsquo;s national statement in the annual Security Council Open Debate on Children and Armed Conflict on 28 June, 2021. </p>  <p>  In relation to Sudan, at the UN Security Council, Ireland has ensured that protection of civilians and, in particular, women and children, is prioritised both in sanctions discussions, and in the UNITAMS and UNISFA peacekeeping mission mandate renewals. Ireland has also ensured that the voices of Sudan&rsquo;s leading women&rsquo;s rights activists are heard in these discussions. Ireland used its platform as president of the Council in September 2021 to call for all UN Member States to enable women and youth to play an active part in the implementation of peace agreements to ensure durability of peace in Sudan and other conflict-affected countries throughout the world. In fact, during Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the Council in September, sixteen of seventeen civil society briefers were women, a new record for women&rsquo;s participation at the Council. Ireland also supports the work of Strategic Initiative for Women in the Horn of Africa (SIHA), a coalition of women&rsquo;s rights activists working to advance the rights of, and address violence against, women and girls in the Horn of Africa.</p>  <p>  In relation to Belarus, in 2021, Ireland allocated &euro;100,000 to the IFRC to support the Lithuania Red Cross&rsquo; response to the migrant crisis on the Lithuania-Belarus border. In addition, the IFRC launched an operation through their Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF) to assist refugees in Lithuania. Ireland is a regular contributor to the DREF and contributed &euro;1 million to this fund in 2021. IFRC has been supporting extremely vulnerable people at the border, including women, persons with disabilities and children &ndash; many of them without a parent or guardian. In October 2021, my colleague Minister of State Byrne visited the Lithuanian-Belarussian border, accompanied by members of the Lithuanian Government. In November 2021, Ireland requested, along with EU member states France and Estonia, that the UNSC hold an AOB discussion on Belarus, focused on the ongoing migration issue. Ireland expressed concern about the deteriorating situation at the EU-Belarus border and highlighted the need to prevent a humanitarian crisis unfolding. Ireland also co-sponsored the recent package of sanctions against the Lukashenko regime.</p></reply>

Following her taking responsibility for Brexit policy issues in December 2021, we spoke by phone on 21 December, and met in person in London on 6 January.</p>  <p>  During these engagements, I emphasised that Ireland and the EU remain fully committed to providing certainty and stability for people and business in Northern Ireland. I noted that the Protocol is the joint EU&ndash;UK solution to mitigate against the disruption Brexit causes for citizens and businesses on the island of Ireland and that it can work if we allow it to. </p>  <p>  I also speak regularly with Commission Vice-President Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efcovic. Most recently we met in Brussels on 24 January, shortly after his latest meeting with the UK Foreign Secretary. I reiterated to him Ireland&rsquo;s strong support for his approach. </p>  <p>  I welcome the recommencement of talks on the Protocol with the meetings of Vice-President &Scaron;efcovic and Foreign Secretary Truss. The positive tone from Secretary Truss is welcome, as is her stated determination to find a solution. The decision to have a meeting of the Joint Committee next month along with a continuation of intensified technical talks is a positive development. However, following the package of measures put forward by the European Commission, we need to see the UK Government meaningfully demonstrate its willingness to come to a deal on the key issues</p>  <p>  On 25 January, Vice-President &Scaron;efcovic briefed the General Affairs Council on his recent engagements with the UK. It was clear the solidarity that has been the hallmark of the EU&rsquo;s approach to Brexit remains strong. </p>  <p>  Reaching an agreed approach on the Protocol could help reduce tensions ahead of the Northern Ireland Assembly elections. I will continue to meet with political business and community leaders to listen to their concerns and to raise them with my counterparts across the EU. </p>  <p>  The EU has made clear that it is ready to find flexible ways of implementing the Protocol, but it is not going to renegotiate it. Renegotiation is not necessary in order to solve legitimate challenges experienced by people and businesses in Northern Ireland</p>  <p>  A positive outcome to discussions on the Protocol would also be an important factor in allowing us to turn a page and open up a new chapter in a forward-looking EU&ndash;UK partnership. There are a range of global challenges which will greatly benefit from the EU and UK working together.</p>  <p>  Northern Ireland is seeing the benefits of the Protocol &ndash; in jobs and investment announcements.  Businesses recognise the opportunities presented by the Protocol and the unique position of having free and full access to both the EU single market and the rest of the UK internal market. The Protocol will work if we allow it to with flexibility and pragmatism. </p></reply>

The agreement is underpinned by provisions to ensure a continued level playing field for businesses as well as extensive governance structures and processes for resolving any disputes which might arise. </p>  <p>  The EU and the UK have been meeting regularly through those governance structures over the past year. A meeting of the EU-UK Partnership Council took place last June, at which the EU was represented by Commission Vice President Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efcovic and the UK was represented by David Frost. At that meeting, the two sides discussed the implementation of the Agreement, including in the areas of fisheries, work visa fees, law enforcement and judicial cooperation, and the UK&rsquo;s participation in Union programmes.</p>  <p>  All of the Specialised Committees, the forums for EU-UK engagement across each of the areas covered by the agreement, have now met at least once and discussions have largely been productive. Ireland has actively contributed to the preparation of the EU side&rsquo;s position for those meetings and we continue to follow very closely, with the European Commission, the overall implementation of the agreement.</p>  <p>  Effective implementation of the TCA is a priority for Ireland. Not only does it underpin our trade and business relationship with the UK, but it also provides the framework for cooperation in a wide range of areas of significance to us. It also provides a platform for developing further cooperation into the future. </p>  <p>  Reaching an agreed approach on the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland will be an important factor in allowing us all to turn a page and open up a new chapter in a forward-looking EU-UK partnership. There are a range of global challenges which we will all be better equipped to address with the EU and the UK working together. </p></reply>

This funding was allocated to the UN High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), the UN Afghanistan Humanitarian Fund (AHF), UNICEF, Concern Worldwide and HALO Trust. Our partners in Afghanistan are implementing emergency response programmes to address the urgent needs of the population, including providing food aid, treatment for severe acute malnutrition in children, and other essential services. A donor-pledging conference on Afghanistan is likely to take place in March and Ireland will participate. </p>  <p>  Ireland is also contributing to the EU response, which allocated more than &euro;1 billion in funding last year to UN agencies and NGOs working in Afghanistan for humanitarian aid and to support basic needs. The EU also established a humanitarian air bridge that delivered 280 tonnes of lifesaving supplies.  </p>  <p>  In addition, Ireland contributes to global funds and core funding to key agencies that allocate funding to Afghanistan, including WHO, UNHCR, IFRC, ICRC and the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF). Ireland was the 9th largest donor to the CERF in 2021, providing &euro;11 million. Since August, the CERF has allocated more than &euro;68.6 million to Afghanistan. This year we will renew our multiyear partnership with CERF and increase our annual contribution from &euro;10m to &euro;11.5m, as I announced at the CERF pledging conference in December. </p>  <p>  Ireland supports all initiatives to alleviate the suffering of the Afghan people. At the UN Security Council, we actively engaged in negotiations to ensure a clear and robust humanitarian carve out to the sanctions regime against the Taliban to ensure the delivery of essential humanitarian aid to the population. The resolution was adopted in December.</p></reply>

The Agreement also made a commitment to establish a North West Development Fund and for the Irish Government to provide &euro;2.5 million to the Fund, to be complemented by matching funding from the Northern Ireland Executive.  The initial Irish Government contribution of &euro;2.5 million, from the Department of Foreign Affairs, was transferred to Derry City and Strabane District Council in December 2015. </p><p>Operated jointly by Donegal County Council and Derry City and Strabane District Council, the Fund is used to support three main pillars in the North West:  Regional Economic Growth, Regional Physical Development and Regional Social and Community Well-Being.  It is not intended for capital projects; rather it is intended to animate proposals, business cases and processes that are strategically relevant for the overall health and growth of the North West region.</p><p>The Fund has been established under the principle of subsidiarity and &lsquo;place-based leadership&rsquo;, that decisions for the region are best made locally and that spend priorities will be identified and agreed between the two Councils. </p><p>In line with a condition of the transfer of Government funding in December 2015, the Fund is subject to full audit and governance arrangements, under a Partnership Agreement between the two regional Councils, who operate the Fund. A Terms of Reference covers all relevant aspects of Fund management, including annual monitoring, expenditure and approval limits, delegated authority and all associated legal, financial and equality implications. </p><p>Individual projects are assessed, monitored and managed by officials from Derry City and Strabane District Council and Donegal County Council and progress against key performance indicators is reported to the North West Strategic Growth Partnership, which brings together senior Government officials from relevant Departments North and South, the CEOs of both Councils, and other stakeholders to deliver on the strategic priorities. Officials from the Joint Secretariat of the North South Ministerial Council also continue to attend meetings of the North West Strategic Growth Partnership.</p><p>The North West Development Fund has delivered on a range of initiatives including joint research on the impact of Brexit on the North West region, joint trade missions and greenway projects.  </p><p>As part of the <i>New Decade, New Approach</i>agreement in January 2020 the Irish Government committed to continue its support for the work of the North West Strategic Growth Partnership and in principle to provide further funding to the North West Development Fund in collaboration with the Northern Ireland Executive.</p><p>Reflecting this commitment, in October 2021 the Irish Government, through the Department of Foreign Affairs, contributed an additional allocation of &euro;1 million to the North West Development Fund.  This allocation is intended to supplement the original allocation of &euro;2.5 million provided by the Irish Government in 2015, to facilitate the extension of the current phase of the Fund in accordance with the established financial management and governance procedures, and to allow the continuation of activities supported by the Fund up to the end of 2022. </p></reply>

The exercises are not taking place within Ireland&rsquo;s territorial waters, but 240 kilometres off the south west coast and within Ireland&rsquo;s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). </p>  <p>  Under international law, states are entitled to freedom of navigation in another state&rsquo;s EEZ, having due regard to the rights and duties of the coastal state. The Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) was informed of the exercise via standard procedures and issued a statement to that effect. </p>  <p>  However, in light of the current political and security environment in Europe, I have raised a number of concerns with the Russian Ambassador to Ireland in respect of these exercises. Officials from my Department, including the Secretary General of the Department of Foreign Affairs, have also held several additional discussions with the Russian Ambassador in this regard.  </p>  <p>  In the course of these conversations, I have clearly outlined to the Russian Ambassador our concerns in relation to both the timing and the nature of these planned naval exercises. As I have previously stated, we find ourselves at a moment when there is a need for de-escalation, to lower tensions and to avoid military activity that could be seen as unhelpful. </p>  <p>  During the meeting of EU Foreign Ministers in Brussels, our discussions focused on the security situation in Europe, with a focus on Ukraine.

The talks comprised three strands, involving representatives of the Taliban, representatives of Afghan civil society, and representatives of the governments of Norway, France, Germany, Italy, the UK, and the US. The EU also took part in some of these talks, represented by its Special Envoy for Afghanistan Tomas Niklasson. </p>  <p>  EU Special Envoy Niklasson has already had a number of meetings with Taliban representatives in Doha, in line with the EU&rsquo;s five benchmarks for engagement with the Taliban agreed by Foreign Ministers in September 2021. In his meetings, Special Envoy Niklasson continues to emphasise the need for the Taliban to respect the human rights of all Afghans as well as discussing the humanitarian and &lsquo;humanitarian plus&rsquo; assistance that the EU is providing for Afghanistan through UN agencies, international organisations, and NGOs. In his meeting with the Taliban representatives who travelled to Oslo, he again raised human rights concerns and he reconfirmed that the EU would continue its humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan, calling for further meetings moving forward, as well as discussing Taliban engagement with UN-appointed special rapporteurs.</p>  <p>  Since the Taliban seizure of power last August, the EU and Member States have allocated more than &euro;1 billion in funding to UN agencies and NGOs working in Afghanistan, for both humanitarian aid and for supporting basic needs (&lsquo;humanitarian plus&rsquo;). The EU also established a humanitarian air bridge that in 2021 delivered 280 tonnes of lifesaving medication, food and equipment against COVID-19 to Afghanistan.  The EU has re-established a minimal diplomatic presence in Kabul in recent days, in order to better engage with the Taliban-appointed caretaker cabinet on humanitarian and human rights issues.</p></reply>

The build-up of Russian troops on the border with Ukraine is a matter of great concern. It is important that dialogue be maintained, with the primary goal of de-escalating tensions in the region. In this regard, I welcome the intensive diplomatic efforts which have occurred in recent weeks, aimed at defusing tensions. These include bilateral discussions between the US and Russia, between NATO and Russia, and at the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. As a participating State in the OSCE, Ireland is pleased to express solidarity with Ukraine and seek a peaceful de-escalation of tensions in that forum.</p><p>Ireland has repeatedly reaffirmed its support for Ukraine at United Nations Security Council meetings on Ukraine, including at Arria formula meetings. We have also stressed our non-recognition of the illegal annexation of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol, encouraged full, secure and unimpeded access for the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission, and called for the full implementation of the Minsk Agreements. </p><p>EU Foreign Ministers discussed the situation in Ukraine at the Foreign Affairs Council on 13 December, in Gymnich formation on 13 and 14 January, and again at the Foreign Affairs Council of 24 January. In my own remarks, I have consistently underlined the need for strong and unified messaging from the EU. In remarks after the December Foreign Affairs Council, High Representative Borrell made clear that aggression against Ukraine, will come with political consequences and with a high economic cost for Russia. This has been re-enforced in Foreign Affairs Council Conclusions on 24 January, which state that preparatory work has accelerated on restrictive measures in case of further military aggression by Russia against Ukraine. The Council Conclusions also condemn Russia&rsquo;s continued aggressive actions and threats against Ukraine, and call on Russia to de-escalate.</p><p>I and my counterparts at the Foreign Affairs Council have dedicated significant time to the security situation in Ukraine this year, including through engagements with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba. I also discussed these matters with Minister Kuleba when I travelled to Kyiv on 23 August to represent Ireland at the International Crimea Platform, a diplomatic initiative by Ukraine to seek a peaceful end to the illegal Russian occupation of the peninsula.</p></reply>

These include Sierra Leone and Liberia, following on from UN peacekeeping operations there, Mozambique, where there has been internal conflict for much of the last decade, and Ethiopia.</p>  <p>  Ireland works with a wide range of partners including the UN, Development Banks, and NGOs, as well as in our capacity as an EU Member State, to ensure that our assistance reaches those most in need. </p>  <p>  The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance (UN OCHA) provides vital needs assessments which ensure Irish Aid is targeted at the most compelling humanitarian crises.  Last year, my Department provided over &euro;5 million in direct support to each of the following countries &ndash; Afghanistan, Somalia, South Sudan, Syria and Yemen. This is in addition to our contributions to UN humanitarian organisations, the Red Cross family, and the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), which also provided support to these protracted crises.</p>  <p>  Over the past two years, my Department has invested &euro;200 million in global public health, much of which reaches countries experiencing humanitarian emergencies.  In addition to my Department&rsquo;s partnership with the HSE in our bilateral partners to help build more resilient national health systems, Ireland is a longstanding core supporter of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (Global Fund), which supports eligible countries with essential treatments and medical supplies. Ireland is currently a Board member at the Global Fund, championing their work in fragile contexts.</p>  <p>  The total Irish Aid contribution to date to COVAX is &euro;13.5 million. Through our complementary support to the Global Vaccine Alliance (Gavi), which co-leads COVAX, Irish Aid is directly contributing to immunising refugees and internally displaced populations in the world&rsquo;s poorest countries.</p>  <p>  Irish Aid supports efforts to improve global governance of water and sanitation, especially in countries affected by humanitarian crises. For example in Gaza, Ireland is partnering with the French Development Agency to provide sustainable solar power to the North Gaza Emergency Sewage Treatment plant to ensure adequate clean water. In Mozambique, Ireland works with local government representatives to build new water systems, install water access points and rehabilitate existing boreholes. In Liberia, Ireland is supporting the multi-NGO WASH consortium to deliver water and sanitation to rural communities. Irish core support for UNICEF contributes to improved water supplies and sanitation facilities in schools and communities, and safe hygiene practices in 90 countries. </p></reply>

It also considers the role of the EU and UN in amplifying Ireland's voice and extending its influence.  That vision was amplified in 2019 with the publication of A Better World, the Government&rsquo;s policy on international development, and the Global Ireland policy, enhances our ability to advocate for and achieve our foreign policy objectives, including international development, peace, disarmament and security<i>.</i></p><p>During this second part of Ireland&rsquo;s tenure on the Security Council, our engagement will continue to be guided by the principles that the Government agreed at the start of our term: building peace, strengthening conflict prevention, and ensuring accountability.</p><p>Accountability for human rights violations, including genocide and ethnic cleansing, remains a key priority. Ireland has been active in the Security Council and other<i></i>international fora on these matters, both independently and as part of the EU. For example, at both Human Rights Councils 43 and 44, Ireland joined other EU Member States in co-sponsoring resolutions on protecting populations from genocide.</p><p>A strong international criminal justice system is also central to fighting impunity. While states bear the primary responsibility to investigate the most serious international crimes, including war crimes and genocide, Ireland regards the International Criminal Court as the cornerstone of such a system. We are a consistent and strong supporter of the Court.</p><p>Ireland is the informal focal point on hunger and conflict on the Security Council, reflecting the importance which addressing hunger has in our development programme.</p><p>In December&rsquo;s Nutrition for Growth Summit, hosted by Japan, Ireland pledged to spend &euro;800 million over the next five years on nutrition programmes and interventions. These pledges show Ireland's commitment to place nutrition at the forefront of development priorities and as a critical element in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.</p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s strong relationship with the World Food Programme, the largest humanitarian agency fighting hunger worldwide, is a key part of our work to address famine. Under a new agreement signed in December 2021, Ireland will provide at least &euro;75 million to WFP over the next three years (2022 &ndash; 2024).</p></reply>

We recognise the value of enlargement as a transformative driver for stability and peace in candidate countries and are concerned at both the increasing disillusionment with the enlargement process in the Western Balkans and the resultant decline in public perception of the EU in the region.</p>  <p>  For this reason, it was welcome that the Declaration adopted at the EU-Western Balkans Summit last October contained a clear signal of the continuing priority afforded by the EU to the Enlargement dossier and to achieving early progress in advancing the accession process. </p>  <p>  There are five recognised candidates for membership of the European Union: Turkey, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Albania, and Serbia. Kosovo and Bosnia and Herzegovina are recognised as potential candidates by the EU. Bosnia and Herzegovina has formally submitted an application for membership, while Kosovo has a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the European Union.</p>  <p>  The European Commission presented Member States with the main findings and recommendations of the seven country reports on 19 October in last year&rsquo;s &lsquo;Enlargement Package&rsquo;. This was followed up with the agreement of Council Conclusions on the Enlargement and Stabilisation and Association Process in December. While situations vary from country to country, limited progress in the enlargement process overall was noted due to both the impact of the pandemic and ongoing delays and blockages in the enlargement process. </p>  <p>  While technically remaining the two front-runners in terms of EU accession, there is general agreement within both Council and Commission that both Serbia and Montenegro need to increase the dynamism in their reform agenda. Serbia needs to accelerate its reforms regarding fundamental rights and the rule of law, and make significant progress in the normalisation of relations with Kosovo. A recent positive development has been the holding of a referendum on 16 January which saw a number of amendments to the Serbian constitution relating to the judiciary system approved. In Montenegro, more intensive efforts in relation to freedom of expression, media freedom and the fight against corruption and organised crime are required. We have called for intensified dialogue among all parties in Montenegro to address those issues currently giving rise to tensions within the country</p>  <p>  Both North Macedonia and Albania have clearly fulfilled the conditions necessary to commence accession negotiations. In our view, shared almost unanimously within the Council, the negotiating frameworks for both countries should be agreed and Intergovernmental Conferences held as soon as possible to start the accession process. We continue to advocate for this at EU meetings and working groups. </p>  <p>  Kosovo is a potential candidate for membership of the EU. The Commission&rsquo;s report on Kosovo in 2021 noted that the political situation there remains challenging. Rule of law, judicial reform, public administration reform, organised crime and normalisation of the relationship with Serbia are just some of the areas that must be comprehensively addressed in order for Kosovo to advance on its European path.</p>  <p>  The EU has clearly set out the fourteen priority areas for reform which need to be progressed, if Bosnia and Herzegovina is to advance on its European path. We call on all parties and leaders within Bosnia and Herzegovina to avoid further delay in progressing this urgent reform agenda, including in the areas of electoral and constitutional law.</p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to support strongly the enlargement process and offer any practical assistance it can to candidate countries engaged in accession negotiations to the EU. It is our firm belief that it is through EU membership that peace and security can best be ensured throughout the Western Balkans. </p></reply>

As a Member State, Ireland contributes to the significant European Union development and humanitarian response in Somalia, and in countries affected by Boko Haram.  </p>  <p>  Since 2015, Irish Aid has contributed &euro;34 million in humanitarian funding to alleviate the conditions of people in distress across the Lake Chad region. This includes funding to Concern Worldwide, Goal, and Plan International Ireland, as well as to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). </p>  <p>  Through the UN Office for West Africa and the Sahel (UNOWAS) and the UN Peacebuilding Commission, the United Nations is helping stabilise the situation in the Lake Chad region. Ireland is penholder, together with Niger, on the UNOWAS file at the UN Security Council. In its Presidential Statement on peace consolidation in West Africa of 17 August 2021, the Security Council strongly condemned continued attacks against civilians in the region, and both attacks and threats of attacks against schools, children, and educational personnel, including recent abductions in Nigeria.</p>  <p>  Irish Aid provides funding to support those displaced by conflict in North-East Nigeria, where the numbers of people in need of humanitarian assistance and protection are at the highest levels recorded.</p>  <p>  Additionally, Ireland is a member of the International Support Group of the Regional Stabilisation Strategy for the Lake Chad Basin (ISG), and has observer status at the Sahel Alliance: both are forums which enable donors to coordinate support in addressing the challenges in Boko Haram-affected areas of the Lake Chad Basin.  </p>  <p>  Since 2012, Ireland has provided over &euro;57 million in humanitarian assistance to Somalia, including to communities displaced by conflict in Al Shabaab-held areas. With humanitarian needs in these regions likely to remain acute, Irish funding will continue to target those most in need.  The UN-mandated African Union-led peacekeeping mission in Somalia (AMISOM) supports the Federal Government of Somalia in its efforts to combat Al-Shabaab. Ireland is Chair of the Somalia Sanctions Committee at the UN Security Council. That Committee oversees an arms embargo and other tools to encourage a more peaceful and secure Somalia, including engagement with Al Shabaab. This complements Ireland&rsquo;s role as an EU Member State supporting Somalia, including the strengthening of its government institutions. </p>  <p>  The EU has three Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) Missions in the Horn of Africa. A number of Irish nationals are deployed to the civilian mission EUCAP Somalia, including the current Head of Mission. In the Sahel, Ireland currently has 20 Defence Forces personnel participating in EUTM Mali. Ireland also deploys one expert to the civilian mission EUCAP Sahel Niger. 14 Defence Forces personnel are deployed in the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilisation Mission in Mali (MINUSMA). Ireland&rsquo;s participation in these missions allows us to contribute to peace and security, help protect human rights, and put in place conditions for sustainable development.</p></reply>

The coup is a reversal of the progress made towards democracy in Myanmar that has taken years to establish. </p><p>On 6 December 2021 State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi was sentenced by a military court; an additional sentence was imposed on 10 January 2022. It is possible that there will be further sentences in the coming period in line with the charges put forward by the military regime. Ireland has joined statements by the European Union and the United Nations Security Council expressing deep concern at the sentencing of Aung San Suu Kyi, President Win Myint and others. The court proceedings appear to be an attempt to exclude Aung San Suu Kyi and democratically elected leaders from future political engagement and the inclusive dialogue process called for by ASEAN.  Ireland condemns these politically motivated verdicts and believes they represent another step towards the dismantling of the rule of law and a violation of human rights in Myanmar. </p><p>Ireland is actively engaged on the crisis in Myanmar in the context of our role on the United Nations Security Council and through the EU. The situation in Myanmar has been considered seven times by the Security Council since the coup, most recently on 8 November 2021. The Council has condemned the use of violence by the military, and called for the release of all those detained.  The united voice of the Security Council on the situation in Myanmar is welcome, sending a clear message to the Myanmar military.</p><p>Ireland has also voiced its concern at four sessions of the Human Rights Council since February 2021 and has consistently supported international efforts towards ensuring accountability and justice, including through the Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar, the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court.</p><p>Ireland supports the EU's adoption of the sanctions against the perpetrators of the coup and the economic entities that sustain them and endorses the strong and comprehensive approach set out in the Council Conclusions adopted by the EU Foreign Affairs Council on February 22 2021. We will continue to work with partners to consider further actions to restore the democratic path in Myanmar.  <i></i></p></reply>

The highest number of these violations concerned the recruitment and use of children as child soldiers. The Secretary-General also pointed to the COVID-19 pandemic as an aggravating factor in the recruitment and use of children as child soldiers since 2020, particularly where their access to education and other key social services has been severely hampered, exposing them to even greater risk of recruitment. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s membership of the Security Council offers us an opportunity to play an active role in combating violations against children in conflict situations. The Security Council has established tools to strengthen child protection and to support international standards on CAAC including a comprehensive monitoring and reporting mechanism.  Ireland is an active member of the UN Security Council Working Group on CAAC which adopts conclusions on country situations of concern and ensures follow up of the recommendations at country level.</p>  <p>  Ireland is also an active member of the Group of Friends of CAAC as well as the Group of Friends of the Reintegration of Child Soldiers. Ireland continues to combat the use of child soldiers through our development programme, with a focus on addressing the socio-economic causes that contribute to this situation, through providing access to education, skills and livelihood opportunities. Ireland is also a signatory to the Safe Schools Declaration which outlines a set of commitments designed to strengthen the protection of education from attack, restrict the use of schools and universities for military purposes and ensure the continuity of education in armed conflict zones.  </p></reply>

Against the backdrop of increasing restrictions, it is essential that human rights organisations can continue to play an unhindered role in protecting human rights at all levels.</p>  <p>  Ireland is therefore a strong supporter of international human rights organisations, both in terms of our funding, including in response to conflict and other humanitarian catastrophes, and in terms of our coordination and engagement with them in key fora such as at the Human Rights Council and during our term on the UN Security Council. </p>  <p>  At the Human Rights Council, Ireland in coordination with international human rights organisations and a cross regional group of Member States, leads on a resolution most recently renewed in July 2021 to ensure the continued protection of civil society space as a human rights concern.  In September 2021, as part of a small core group, Ireland led a successful resolution condemning acts of intimidation or reprisals against Human Rights Defenders engaging with the United Nations.</p>  <p>  Ireland remains fully committed to supporting the participation and coordination of international human rights organisations with the Human Rights Council, Special Procedures, Treaty Bodies, and as key interlocutors with the Universal Periodic Review process, and indeed as key partners with the European Union and in other relevant fora. </p></reply>

These channels include funding through Multilateral Organisations, Non-Government Organisations and government systems in partner countries amongst others. Approximately 60 percent of Ireland&rsquo;s total ODA is administered by the Department of Foreign Affairs with the balance administered though other Departments. </p><p>My Department works closely with selected partners to ensure lasting improvements in the lives of communities living in poverty and supporting the delivery of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Each year Ireland bilaterally supports partners to undertake approximately 900 project-type interventions across more than 80 countries. Funding to our partners range from core contributions through to specific-purpose programmes that address humanitarian and development needs. This international work is supplemented by our development education engagement that takes place here in Ireland. Annually, approximately fifty Development Education projects are supported. These range in size and scale and target primary, secondary and third level students and well as the general public.</p><p>My Department publishes a report on Ireland's ODA programme, known as Irish Aid, each year. The report includes statistical information on programme expenditure in a series of annexes which clearly show the distribution of aid, the amounts allocated to our priority focus areas and amounts given through the various channels and countries. The annual report serves as a core accountability and transparency tool, providing a comprehensive overview of expenditure under the aid programme, and demonstrating the results that have been achieved. Annual Reports for 2020 and previous years are available on the Irish Aid website. The report on 2021 will be available later this year.</p></reply>

Embassies and Consulates General provide support for Ireland&rsquo;s State Agencies by supporting their strategic objectives and activities in overseas markets. The role of the Mission network in promoting Ireland as a location to do business, invest, study and visit, is particularly pertinent in markets with limited or no State Agency presence.</p><p>In June 2018, the Government launched the Global Ireland initiative, which aims to double the impact and scope of Ireland&rsquo;s global footprint by 2025. Global Ireland's targets include enhanced global engagement, the expansion of Ireland&rsquo;s Embassy network, and the strengthening of Ireland&rsquo;s State Agency presence overseas. Each of these measures will increase Ireland&rsquo;s international visibility, facilitate market diversification and intensification, and deepen bilateral relations in support of the Government&rsquo;s economic and political objectives.</p><p>This programme is now past the half way mark, with 14 new Missions open and operational. To date, new Embassies have opened in Wellington, Bogot&aacute;, Amman, Monrovia, Santiago de Chile, Rabat, Manila and Kyiv, and new Consulates General in Cardiff, Frankfurt, Los Angeles, Manchester, Mumbai and Vancouver. We will also be reopening our Embassy in Tehran in 2023 and the Government has approved the opening of a further four new Missions in Dakar, Lyon, Miami and Toronto. New Missions have been opened in locations chosen on the basis, inter alia, of their potential to diversify our markets and increase trade and investment with Ireland. New Missions have been opened in locations chosen on the basis, inter alia, of their potential to diversify our markets and increase trade and investment with Ireland. </p><p>Officers based at our Missions engage in economic and public diplomacy to advance Ireland&rsquo;s prosperity, as part of their overall duties to promote Ireland's interests and support our citizens. They work on a range of trade-related issues, including market access, regulatory compliance, visas, phyto-sanitary issues, and double taxation agreements. COVID-19 has impacted how everyone works, including our mission network. However, it has also provided opportunities for new ways of working and engaging, and has resulted in new tools and strategies for pursuing Ireland's interests.</p><p>The Mission network also supports Ministerial visits and trade missions, in partnership with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, other Government Departments and the State Agencies, which support the goal of securing high-level market access for companies based in Ireland that are aiming to grow business overseas, and in general helping deepen bilateral relations as the context in which trade and investment takes place. </p></reply>

Under this &lsquo;fast accrual&rsquo; pension scheme, maximum retirement benefits accrue after 31 years.  The 21-year pension, the rate of which varies according to retiring rank and other factors, is payable for the person&rsquo;s lifetime. </p><p>Where qualifying service is more than 21 years, an &lsquo;additional increment&rsquo; is payable at a flat rate (generally &euro;9.21 a week currently) for each year of service in excess of 21 years up to a maximum of 31 years&rsquo; service.  This gives a maximum additional increment of &euro;92.10 weekly. However, under the &lsquo;pre-April 2004&rsquo; pension scheme rules, this additional increment ceases to be payable if and when the pensioner reaches the prescribed age for the State Pension (Contributory), that is, at age 66 to 68 depending on a person&rsquo;s date of birth. </p><p>These arrangements are in accordance with the long established principle of integrating occupational pensions with Social Insurance benefits of employees who are in full PRSI class.  This includes NCOs and Privates who are fully insured for the range of social insurance benefits under the Social Welfare Acts, such as the State Pension (Contributory).  </p><p><i>Integration </i>means that a person&rsquo;s entitlement to social insurance benefits is taken into account when calculating the rate of their occupational pension payable. In an integrated pension scheme, the State Pension or similar contributory Social Welfare benefit is regarded as part of the overall pension package payable to the individual. The integration principle applies right across the public service and, indeed, in many areas of the private sector as well as in other countries. </p><p>It might be noted that the method of integration for these &lsquo;pre-April 2004&rsquo; military pensioners is in fact more favourable than in other areas of the public service.  In the public service generally, integration begins from the time the occupational pension commences payment, for example from age 60/65 where &lsquo;standard accrual&rsquo; pensions apply in pre-2013 public service schemes.  </p><p>Furthermore, the maximum personal rate of State Pension payable (&euro;253.30 a week currently if under age 80) is considerably more than any reduction that could happen under the Defence Forces pension schemes by virtue of the loss of the additional increment on qualification for the State Pension.  This is the scenario for any former member who retires with between 22 and 31 years&rsquo; service under the &lsquo;pre-April 2004&rsquo; pension scheme.</p><p>The foregoing atypical integration arrangements do not apply to NCOs and Privates enlisting on or after 1 April 2004, and whose occupational pensions are subject to standard integration with social insurance benefits along with other public service employees insured for full PRSI.</p></reply>

While the main day to day tasking of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the European Union, it also carries out a number of other non-fishery related tasks in tandem with maritime surveillance, and as such any Naval Service patrol should be viewed as a multi-faceted activity. </p>  <p>  The Air Corps Maritime Patrol Squadron carries out aerial surveillance of the Irish Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) using the two CASA CN 235 maritime patrol aircraft. These aircraft are equipped with state-of-the-art surveillance and communication equipment which offers aerial assistance to the Naval Service in patrolling the Irish EEZ.</p>  <p>  The Naval Service and the Air Corps provide assistance and support to search and rescue missions on an as available basis, however, the lead agency for search and rescue (SAR) in Ireland's SAR domain is the Irish Coast Guard.</p>  <p>  In terms of fishery protection the Naval Service is tasked with patrolling all Irish waters from the shoreline to the outer limits of the EEZ. These patrols are carried out on a regular and frequent basis and are directed to all areas of Irish waters as necessary. The Sea Fisheries Protection Authority are the competent authority in relation to fisheries control in Ireland's EEZ. </p>  <p>  My Department has applied for EU funding in support of the Defence Forces via the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) Operational Programme (2014-2020). Approval in principle has been received for a number of relevant projects, including projects specifically linked to Naval Service and Air Corps capabilities and operations.  </p>  <p>  My Department has also begun discussions with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to investigate the possibility of securing additional future funding to support Naval Service and Air Corps operations under the new European Maritime Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund (EMFAF) 2021 &ndash; 2027. </p>  <p>  Ireland  is currently involved in an European Defence Agency project named Maritime Surveillance (MARSUR) Networking - Operations Support &amp;amp; Development (MARSUR III). This is the third iteration of the MARSUR projects. The main objective of the EDA Maritime Surveillance programme is to further develop a Recognised Maritime Picture (RMP) exchange network amongst Member States. An RMP is a picture or map that shows all vessels and activities that are present in a particular maritime area.  It links to national and international data and information on vessels, the marine environment, infrastructure etc. that has been compiled from various monitoring and surveillance systems. The MARSUR Project continues to enhance, upgrade and develop the capability for participating Member States to share different levels of classified information across the network.</p>  <p>  The MARSUR projects have assisted Member States, including Ireland, to combat drug trafficking, smuggling, illegal immigration and migration and international terrorism.  Better exchange of information plays an important part in protecting maritime trade, the maritime environment and natural resources.    </p>  <p>  As a committed EU Member State, Ireland supports fully the efforts of EU Member States to improve the Union's capacity to respond to the prevailing challenging security environment, including in the area of defence. </p></reply>

These patrols are carried out on a regular and frequent basis and are directed to all areas of Irish waters as necessary. I am advised that the fleet is managed to ensure maximum availability to meet operational requirements.</p>  <p>  On any given patrol day the Naval Service can carry out a number of taskings on behalf of other State agencies such as the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Customs Service of the Revenue Commissioners. </p>  <p>  At any one time the Naval Service can have a number of ships  that are on active operations around the Irish EEZ whilst a number of others are undergoing routine resupply, maintenance and down time for ships companies.</p>  <p>  The operational patrol profile of the ships cannot be discussed in detail due to the security implications to ongoing operations, however, Naval Operations Command operate a rotating patrol schedule to maintain a constant presence in the Irish EEZ.</p>  <p>  The White Paper on Defence sets out an ambitious programme of capital investment in the Naval Service, including the mid-life refit and upgrade of the P50 class of vessels, and the replacement of the flagship L&Eacute; Eithne with a multi-role vessel.  The MRV, is an important element of the Defence Equipment Development Plan and is provided for in the Government's National Development Plan as a major capital project. It is the Government&rsquo;s intention that this new vessel will provide a flexible and adaptive capability for a wide range of maritime tasks.  </p>  <p>  Projects for other vessel replacements , such as the replacement of the Coastal Patrol Vessels, the L&Eacute; Ciara and L&Eacute; Orla will  being considered over the lifetime of the White Paper on Defence in the context of overall capability development and funding along with the overall Equipment Development Plan process. These ships will be replaced with similar sized vessels with countermine and counter-IED capabilities. This will provide an enhanced capability for the Naval Service in meeting a broad range of ongoing requirements and contingencies, including the protection of Ireland&rsquo;s vital sea lanes of communication. </p>  <p>  Current recruitment initiatives are aimed at increasing the number of available sailors within the Naval Service in order to restore the full fleet to operational status. The recruitment and retention of technical and non-technical personnel for the Naval Service is central to the ongoing Naval Service Regeneration plan. My focus is on returning the Naval Service to its full capacity. </p></reply>

The ARM E ensures that all maintenance is carried out in accordance with manufacturer&rsquo;s recommendations, and in adherence to industry best standards. Maintenance schedules are planned in so far as possible with a view to maximising fleet availability. </p>  <p>  The aircraft are made available in accordance with scheduled operations and non-scheduled operations. Service Level Agreements (SLA) stipulate the amount of hours dedicated to each area, as well as the required availability. Where SLAs are not applicable to an operation, Air Corps Headquarters directs the respective Units to have aircraft available, as necessary.</p>  <p>  The Equipment Development Plan (EDP) published in June 2020, completed through extensive joint civil-military work, provides a comprehensive list of planned equipment projects by means of a five-year rolling plan.  The EDP builds on the intentions set out in the White Paper in relation to equipment acquisition, modernisation and upgrade and has been developed to ensure that the Defence Forces have the major equipment platforms, ancillary equipment and force protection equipment to carry out their important roles both at home and overseas. </p>  <p>  A step change in military air-based capability is being achieved through the delivery into service of Pilatus PC-12 aircraft.  While nominally a replacement for the Cessna, the new aircraft move capabilities considerably ahead of the previous level.  The original order of three aircraft which were delivered in September 2020 was augmented on an urgent basis by an additional aircraft delivered in April 2020 to enhance fixed wing capacity to meet demands arising from Covid-19.</p>  <p>  During the Covid-19 Pandemic, the strategic use of State aircraft ensured the continuity of operations, both domestically and overseas, which had been impacted by the worldwide restrictions on civilian air transport services. In 2020, the Air Corps utilised fixed wing assets to conduct over 125 military transport missions involving the movement of Defence Force personnel (incl. MEDEVAC), equipment and  PPE to Defence Overseas missions with a further increase in Air Corps flights in 2021.</p>  <p>  The White Paper also provides for the replacement of the CASA 235s with consideration to be given to their replacement with larger more capable aircraft.  A contract for the supply of two C295 Maritime Patrol Aircraft was entered into with Airbus Defence and Space in December 2019, with delivery of the aircraft expected in 2023.  The cost of the contract including ancillary support is &euro;229m inclusive of VAT. In addition to the principal role of maritime surveillance, particularly fishery protection, the aircraft will also enable the Air Corps to provide a wide range of services including logistics support and transport of troops and equipment, medical evacuation and air ambulance, search and rescue and a general utility role.</p>  <p>  This significant investment in maritime patrol aircraft is an example which demonstrates my commitment to update and upgrade the Defence Forces equipment and capability, within the financial envelope available.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Defence Forces, including the Air Corps have the necessary modern and effective range of equipment available to them which is in line with best international standards in order to fulfil all roles assigned to them by Government. </p></reply>

It provides a comprehensive list of planned equipment projects which will be progressed over five years. This plan builds on the intentions set out in the White Paper in relation to equipment acquisition, modernisation and upgrade and has been developed to ensure that our Defence Forces have the major equipment platforms, ancillary equipment and force protection equipment to carry out their important roles both at home and overseas. </p>  <p>  The Equipment Planning process recognises the need to maintain and upgrade military capabilities having regard to emerging operational requirements and changes in technology and this is an ongoing process. </p>  <p>  Modern secure communications are essential for the Defence Forces and in that regard Defence Force personnel are suitably equipped in a variety of roles with required communications and global positioning systems (GPS) equipment. GPS systems are used to aid navigation and as a force protection measure. They are integrated on board vehicles, vessels and aircraft control systems and embedded in communications systems used by Defence Force personnel in order to achieve a Joint Common Operating Picture. </p>  <p>  I am advised by the Military Authorities that the Defence Forces operate many different types of radar systems. Existing capabilites available to the Army include radar systems such as the Giraffe Mk4 short-range air defence system and the Foxtrack X-Band ground surveillance radar. The Air Corps use surface search radar on the CASA 235 maritime patrol aircraft and all aircraft are fitted with a transponder and the automatic identification system (AIS) for identification and tracking. The Naval Service use maritime surface search radar and the Recognised Maritime Picture (RMP) systems for surveillance and tracking. </p>  <p>  It remains Government policy, as per the 2015 White Paper on Defence, that should additional funding, beyond that provided for in existing plans becomes available, the development of a radar surveillance capability for the Air Corps, will be considered.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Government established an independent Commission on the Defence Forces in December 2020. The work of the Commission encompasses the consideration of appropriate military equipment capabilities, structures and staffing, and their report will inform decisions regarding the future development of the Defence Forces. </p></reply>

The Defence Forces continue to carry out the roles assigned by Government, including security operations, critical supports to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and supports to other Government Departments and Principal Response Agencies. In particular, in recent times, the Defence Forces have played an important role in the Covid 19 response through providing a broad range of supports to the HSE which has provided surge support to our health services through bolstering their capacity and providing them with the additional resiliency needed to respond to the Covid 19 pandemic.  </p>  <p>  My priority as Minister for Defence is to ensure that the operational capability of the Defence Forces is maintained to enable the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service to carry out their roles as assigned by Government. </p>  <p>  At National level, representation on the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning by both the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces, ensures the fullest coordination and cooperation in the event of an emergency. </p>  <p>  In accordance with the Framework for Major Emergency Management, primary responsibility for responding to emergencies such as severe weather events or terrorist attacks rests with the three designated principal response agencies, namely, the relevant Local Authority, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and the Health Service Executive. The Defence Forces provides assistance within means to the appropriate Lead Department or Principal Response Agency in the event of a natural disaster or an emergency situation in its Aid to the Civil Authority (ATCA) and Aid to the Civil Power (ATCP) roles. </p>  <p>  In respect of security threats, responsibility for the internal security of the State rests with the Department of Justice and Equality and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. In that regard, among the roles assigned to the Defence Forces in the White Paper on Defence (2015) is the provision of ATCP which, in practice, means to provide assistance and support to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when requested to do so. There is on-going and close liaison between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces regarding security matters, including ATCP deployments and includes military training activities which are specifically designed to respond to possible security emergencies. Regular coordination and liaison meetings also take place between the Defence Forces and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to ATCP issues.</p>  <p>  The Government established an independent Commission on the Defence Forces in December 2020. The work of the independent Commission on the Defence Forces underpins this Government's commitment to ensuring that the  Defence Forces are fit for purpose, in terms of meeting immediate requirements and also in terms of seeking to develop a longer term vision beyond 2030. The Commission are finalising their work with a view to completing the Report as soon as possible. </p>  <p>  I am committed to ensuring that the personnel of the Defence Forces continue to be equipped and trained to best international standards and I can confirm that the Defence Forces keep their operational plans and response capabilities for dealing with a wide range of threats and emergencies under constant review. I am satisfied that the Defence Forces will continue to respond in an effective and timely manner to such events were they to occur in the state.</p></reply>

In the current school year over 121,400 children, including over 15,500 children with special educational needs, are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;289m in 2021. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, my Department commenced a review of the School Transport Scheme in February 2021. The review is being conducted with a view to examining the current scheme and how it currently operates,  its broader effectiveness and sustainability and that it adequately supports the provision of services to students and their families. </p>  <p>  The review encompasses the School Transport Scheme for Children with Special Educational Needs and the Primary and Post-Primary School Transport Schemes in terms of how each element of the schemes currently operate, to include eligibility criteria, trends, costs and cost drivers, and overall effectiveness in meeting the objectives of the schemes.  The review will also examine the potential for integration of different strands of the scheme and a more co-ordinated approach with other Government Departments that also use transport services.  </p>  <p>  Following commencement of this review the Steering Group presented me with an initial interim report on eligibility with an examination of issues for mainstream pupils relating to the nearest and next nearest school.  Following consideration of this report, I approved the extension of temporary alleviation measures in the current school year for transport for post-primary students who are otherwise eligible for school transport but are attending their second nearest school and have applied and paid on time.  </p>  <p>  Wider considerations relating to operation of the scheme are now taking place in the next phase of the review which is currently underway.  The Steering Group will continue to report to me on an interim basis as the review progresses. While work on the review has been impacted somewhat by the ongoing challenges of the pandemic, efforts are continuing to complete the review as close as possible to the previously announced timeline of end of quarter 1 2022.</p></reply>

These guidelines will facilitate schools in the provision, on a voluntary basis, of extra-curricular activities after school hours.</p>  <p>  With regard to funding provision my Department provides a number of policies and programmes which are supportive of afterschool clubs or activities for students at risk of educational disadvantage.  </p>  <p>  DEIS &ndash; Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools is the main policy initiative of the Department of Education to address educational disadvantage at school level. In the 2021/22 academic year there are 884 schools (687 Primary and 197 Post Primary) in the DEIS Programme serving over 180,000 pupils. My Department spent over &euro;150 million on the DEIS Programme in 2021, which included over  &euro;26 million for the School Completion Programme.</p>  <p>  Budget 2022 has allocated the largest-ever increase in funding for the DEIS programme, providing for an additional allocation of &euro;18 million in 2022 and rising to an additional &euro;32 million in 2023. This means that by 2023 my Department will target over &euro;180 million at addressing educational disadvantage through the DEIS programme, an increase of 20%.</p>  <p>  All DEIS schools receive a  DEIS grant which is to be used to support the implementation of the schools&rsquo; DEIS Action Plan for Improvement. This Plan sets targets under key themes, such as attendance, retention, progression, literacy and numeracy, partnership, transition, wellbeing and examination attainment (post-primary only).  A key focus of these themes is that they are targeted at those students most at risk of educational disadvantage. It is a matter for the school Board of Management to allocate DEIS grant funding so that it targets those students deemed most in need; this can include afterschool activities.</p>  <p>  The School Completion Programme (SCP) is a key support under my Department&rsquo;s DEIS programme. SCP supports students in relation to school attendance, participation and retention. These interventions and supports may include afterschool clubs, which are allowable under the SCP funding. In March 2021 I announced a 5% increase in funding for the School Completion Programme to support the attendance and participation of vulnerable learners and those at risk of education disadvantage. </p></reply>

This was acknowledged in the Comprehensive Review of the Special Needs Assistant Scheme (SNAs) published by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) in 2018. </p>  <p>  The Review made a number of recommendations regarding SNAs including referencing the training needs of SNAs.  In this regard, the NCSE recommended that a new national training programme at Level 5 of the National Qualification Framework be developed for existing SNAs who do not have the requisite level of training and for new SNAs on appointment.  The NCSE also recommended that training tailored to the specific complex needs of some students being cared for by SNAs would also be provided.</p>  <p>  The policy advice has been considered by the Department. It was decided that priority should be given to the development of a training programme for SNAs who may not have had a recent opportunity to access a training programme tailored to their role.  The new first national training course for SNAs provided by UCD now in place aims to enhance the knowledge, skills and expertise of SNAs whose work is central to the inclusion of students with additional care and complex needs in school life. The programme is fully funded by the Department and delivered at no cost to the SNA. </p>  <p>  This is the first national training programme for SNAs employed in schools and is tailored to their needs.  As this is the first programme, it is appropriate to take the time to review outcomes which will inform the future approach to ongoing training and professional development of SNAs. Part of that consideration will include accreditation.</p>  <p>  Raising the minimum qualification for appointment as a special needs assistant has been referred to the Workplace Relations Commission and the Department has been engaging in that process. </p>  <p>  The recruitment and appointment of Special Needs Assistants is a matter for the individual school authority and the Department's circular 36/2020 and 51/2019 sets out the current educational requirements for appointment as a Special Needs Assistant (SNA). In addition, the actual requirements for a post will vary depending on the specific needs of the children and the school to which the SNA is to be appointed. The Department does not believe that the existing minimum qualifications has impacted on the calibre of person appointed and it is also the case that people with experience and/or higher qualifications than the minimum are often the successful candidate in competitions held by schools.</p>  <p>  However, having considered the claim and, in particular, the period of time since they were set, the Department is open to reviewing the position. However, the Department is not yet in a position to indicate when that review might take place but is of the view that the forthcoming review of the SNA contract proposed as part of the Building Momentum national pay agreement should be carried out and implemented first.</p></reply>

In the current school year over 121,400 children, including over 15,500 children with special educational needs, are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;289m in 2021.</p>  <p>  The purpose of my Department's School Transport Scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school.</p>  <p>  In general children are eligible for school transport if they meet the distance criteria and are attending their nearest school. </p>  <p>  Children who are eligible for school transport and who complete the application process on time are accommodated on school transport services where such services are in operation.  </p>  <p>  Children who are eligible for school transport but for whom no service is available may, following an application process for transport within the prescribed time limits, receive a Remote Area Grant towards the cost of private transport arrangements.  The grant amount is distance related and is payable annually at a fixed daily rate (from &euro;1.30 - &euro;5.10 per day), to each eligible family, regardless of the number of children from the same family, travelling to a particular school.</p>  <p>  Children who apply but who are not eligible for school transport are considered for spare seats that may exist after eligible children have been facilitated; such seats are referred to as concessionary seats. </p>  <p>  In cases where the Department is satisfied that the nearest school is full, eligibility for school transport will be determined based on the distance that children reside from their next nearest school having regard to ethos and language.  If a family require further information in regard to the closest school being full they can contact School Transport Section of my Department. Further information in this regard is available on my Department's website www.education.ie. </p></reply>

This patronage process is open to all patron bodies and prospective patrons.  Parental preferences for each patron, from parents of children who reside in the school planning areas concerned, together with the extent of diversity currently available in these areas, are key to decisions in relation to the outcome of this process. </p><p>The new Online Patronage Process System (OPPS) has been developed by my Department to provide objective information to all parents and guardians which will allow them to make an informed choice in expressing a preference for their preferred model of patronage for their child&rsquo;s education. </p><p>Three of the new schools in Donaghmede_Howth_D13 have been established and have had their patronage determined through a patronage process:</p><p>1.  Stapolin Educate Together NS (primary)</p><p>2.  Belmayne Educate Together SS (post primary)</p><p>3.  Gaelscoil Ghr&aacute;inne Mhaol (primary) (under the patronage of An Foras P&aacute;tr&uacute;nachta)</p><p>All three schools are multi-denominational in ethos.</p><p>Additionally, there are projects planned and in train at Grange Community College and Gaelchol&aacute;iste Reachrainn, both under the patronage of Dublin &amp;amp; Dun Laoghaire ETB, which are providing additional multi-denominational post primary school places in the area.  </p><p>Further to this, the Schools Recon?guration for Diversity process, supporting transfers of schools to multi-denominational patrons in response to the wishes of local families, has been developed in order to accelerate the delivery of multi-denominational schools across the country.</p><p>This Reconfiguration process involves the transfer of existing schools as opposed to the amalgamation and/or closure model of the patronage divesting process. The Department has been engaging with representatives of the Irish Episcopal Conference (Catholic bishops) as the majority patron of schools nationwide with a view to developing an agreed approach to the next phase of the process. School communities who wish to explore the potential to transfer patronage should contact their school patron in the first instance.</p></reply>

The minor works funding is a capital grant and provides good flexibility to address issues at local school level.

Ventilation guidance for schools was published by the Department in May 2021.</p><p>Schools are urged to: </p><p>- Consider if room ventilation especially in classrooms, break rooms and canteens can be improved without causing discomfort. </p><p>- Ensure that, wherever possible, doors and windows are open to increase natural ventilation. </p><p>- Increase air flow and ventilation weather permitting</p><p>The over-arching approach for schools should be to have windows open as fully as possible when classrooms are not in use (e.g. during break-times or lunch-times and also at the end of each school day) and partially open when classrooms are in use. It is worth noting that windows do not need to be open as wide in windy/colder weather in order to achieve the same level of airflow into the classroom. This will assist in managing comfort levels and also heating costs during periods of colder weather.</p><p>You will also be aware that the Enhanced Minor Works for Primary Schools Grant Funding issued recently and this is intended to support the operation of schools generally and particularly within a Covid-19 environment, with a specific focus on providing additional support to schools for the implementation of the ventilation guidance published by the Department.</p></reply>

Updated guidance for schools on Practical Steps for the Deployment of Good Ventilation Practices in Schools was provided at the end of May following the work of an expert group that carefully considered the role of ventilation in managing COVID-19. The updated guidance for schools is also fully in line with the most recent guidance on non-healthcare building ventilation during COVID-19, published by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre November 2021. </p>  <p>  The Expert Group note in its own report that very good advice is contained in the Department of Education&rsquo;s Practical Steps for the Deployment of Good Ventilation Practices in Schools.</p>  <p>  They also note that it must be emphasised that ventilation should be delivered as part of a layered strategy of protective measures to control the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19. Along with these preventative actions, ventilation further reduces the risk of COVID-19 transmission in schools.</p>  <p>  The over-arching approach in the guidance is for schools to have windows open as fully as possible when classrooms are not in use and partially open when classrooms are in use. </p>  <p>  Air cleaning devices are not a substitute for good ventilation but can be considered pending the completion of interventions/works where poor ventilation persists. This is line with the Expert Group recommendations. Air filtration does not negate the need for natural ventilation and opening windows as required. Furthermore Mike Ryan of the World Health Organisation&rsquo;s Health Emergencies Programme has advised that schools not rely solely on air filters.</p>  <p>  Schools that identify inadequate ventilation in a room can utilise their minor work grant or apply for emergency works grant assistance to address ventilation enhancements where the minor work grant does not cover the full cost of the works required.</p></reply>

The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2022 the Government increased the weekly means threshold for the fuel allowance scheme by &euro;20 to &euro;120 above the appropriate rate of contributory State pension representing a 20% increase in the threshold which enables more people to qualify for this support.  The &euro;120 allowable means limit is significantly more than the &euro;33 weekly rate of fuel allowance.</p>  <p>  Further changes to the fuel allowance scheme in Budget 2022 included increasing the weekly rate of fuel allowance by &euro;5 to &euro;33 per week, with immediate effect and with effect from September 2022 the reduction of the qualifying period for Jobseeker&rsquo;s and Supplementary Welfare Allowance recipients from 15 to 12 months.</p>  <p>  The Government has, therefore, implemented significant improvements through Budget 2022.  Any proposal to further increase the allowable means for fuel allowance purposes or any further changes to the eligibility criteria would have to be considered in this context and in the context of the overall policy and budgetary situation.</p>  <p>  Under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme, Exceptional Needs Payments may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which customers are unable to meet out of their own resources, and this may include exceptional heating costs.  Decisions on such payments are made on a case-by-case basis.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The purpose of the Fund is to provide funding to higher and further education institutions to assist them in offering supports and services to eligible students with disabilities so that they can participate on an equal basis with their peers.  </p>  <p>  The FSD supports HEIs in providing supports to students with disabilities, including assistive technology i.e. &ldquo;any item, piece of equipment or product system, whether acquired commercially off the shelf, modified or customised/custom-built, that is used to increase, maintain or improve functional capabilities of individuals with disabilities&rdquo;. C Pen readers would be an example of this type of technology available through the FSD.

This significant investment demonstrates the Government's commitment to increasing the Garda workforce to enable the organisation to keep our communities safe and prevent crime in all its forms.</p>  <p>  Separately, Minister O'Gorman has secured an increase of &euro;41m for Tusla under Budget 2022. This includes the budget which will be allocated to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence frontline services.</p>  <p>  Also under Budget 2022, some &euro;13m was allocated to my Department to help tackle domestic, sexual and gender-based violence &ndash; this was a &euro;5m increase on previous years, and reflects the fact that tackling these crimes and supporting victims is a priority for this Government. </p>  <p>  Last November, I confirmed details of 18 organisations to receive funding primarily for regionally based domestic abuse services in an effort to increase these organisations' abilities to support victims, especially given the rise in those seeking help during the pandemic. A total of &euro;445,000 was allocated. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that the manner in which all Garda investigations are conducted, including unsolved murders, and how resources are deployed are matters for the Garda Commissioner and his management team.  As Minister, I have no role in this regard.</p>  <p>  That said, I am informed that the Serious Crime Review Team (SCRT) continue to review serious cases that remain unsolved. The SCRT is concerned with the review of unresolved historical and current major crime incidents, with the primary aim of assisting in identifying new investigative opportunities in a case.</p>  <p>  The SCRT is committed to establishing and identifying new lines of enquiry that might support the lawful cultivation of more evidence with a view, ultimately, to a prosecution.

As Minister, I have no direct role in these matters.</p><p>I am assured, however, that Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of policing priorities and crime trends, to ensure their optimum use. I understand that it is a matter for the Divisional Chief Superintendent to determine the optimum distribution of duties among the personnel available to them, having regard to the profile of each area within the Division and its specific needs.</p><p>Budget 2022 has provided an unprecedented allocation of in excess of &euro;2 billion to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which includes funding for the recruitment of 800 additional Garda trainees and 400 Garda staff.

As a result of the successful roll out of the programme to all prisons, the Service was able to unwind a significant amount of measures in all locations with the exception of Cloverhill Prison which did not have a critical mass of prisoners vaccinated at the time. </p><p>In October 2021, following the latest advice from Government, the Prison Service commenced a significant unwinding of measures in line with similar action taken in the community. </p><p>This included:</p><p>- the recommencement of physical visits in all locations (except Cloverhill Prison), </p><p>- the removal on the restriction preventing the mixing of prisoners from different areas within the prison, </p><p>- the return of constructive activities to full capacity, </p><p>- the recommencement of prisoner temporary release programmes, and </p><p>- the resumption of religious services. </p><p>The resumption of these services was contingent on the continuation of a number of infection control measures to ensure the health and safety of both staff/service providers and prisoners.  </p><p>A number of other restrictions were retained at that time including the continued suspension of non-essential prison visits, the continued suspension of group gatherings including award ceremonies and presentations, the continued need to maintain social distancing and the wearing of face coverings in line with both public health guidance and Government restrictions in place in the community. </p><p>The Irish Prison Service introduced a Covid-19 Contingency Plan which is implemented during an outbreak of the virus within a prison. Under this Plan restrictions are introduced to prevent the spread of Covid  within the prison and these include the suspension of physical visits, the closure of staff gyms and the introduction of a restricted regime for prisoners in the infected area while mass testing is underway. </p><p>The Irish Prison Service has been managing a number of Covid-19 outbreaks in prisons since November 2021 which have resulted in a significant number of prisoners testing positive for the virus. </p><p>The Service intends to conduct a further review of remaining restrictions once all outbreaks have been successfully concluded and the unwinding of these measures will be determined by the level of risk posed to prisons at that time.  </p></reply>

While drug treatment services are provided in all closed prisons, the same type of programmes are not offered in open prisons as a condition of transfer to an open prison is that the prisoner is drug free.  </p>  <p>  The Prison Service advise me that It is considered that approximately 70% of prisoners who are committed to custody have addiction issues.  It is the policy of the Irish Prison Service that, where a person committed to prison gives a history of opiate use and tests positive for opioids, they are offered a medically assisted, symptomatic detoxification, if clinically indicated. </p>  <p>  Patients can, as part of the assessment process, discuss other treatment options with healthcare staff; those treatment options may include stabilisation on methadone maintenance for persons who wish to continue on maintenance while in prison, and when they return to the community on release.</p>  <p>  I am further informed that the Irish Prison Service engages Merchants Quay Ireland (MQI) to provide a prison-based addiction counselling service. This service includes structured assessments and evidence-based counselling interventions, with clearly-defined treatment plans and goals. </p>  <p>  The Merchant Quay Ireland service provides a range of counselling and intervention skills related to substance misuse and dependency. These skills include, motivational interviewing, motivational enhancement therapy, twelve step facilitation programme, cognitive behavioural therapy and harm reduction approaches. Prisoners are offered one to one counselling and group work interventions. Merchants Quay Ireland counsellors work to address presenting issues and to explore the underlying reasons for drug use and how this impacts on the prisoner and wider community. </p></reply>

Applications will be accepted until 24 February 2022, with up to 500 places available for eligible Afghan family members.</p>  <p>  The Programme enables current or former Afghan nationals living legally in Ireland to apply to  have certain close family members come to live with them in Ireland. There is no prohibition on a resettled refugee making an application under the Programme, as long as they can meet the requirement of providing accommodation and supports for their family member(s).  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, no immigration programme can be unlimited in scope, therefore, in line with policy considerations, certain conditions apply. The Programme has been developed to allow as many families as possible the opportunity to have some family members join them here in Ireland.  Allowing applicants to nominate larger numbers of family members for admission, would mean that some families would miss out.  </p>  <p>  At this time, the Government decision is to allow up to 500 places under the Programme.  There are no plans for approvals beyond this at this stage. However, developments at EU level may play a role at a later stage. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, it is important to note that all current immigration avenues remain open for new applications, including visa and family reunification applications. The Afghan Admission Programme is additional to the current suite of immigration schemes and should not be viewed in isolation.  Many people are already availing of these other avenues, and will continue to do so.   </p>  <p>  While the situation in Afghanistan is dire for everyone, we are all acutely aware that some groups face an even greater risk to their freedoms and safety, most especially women, girls and minorities. This has been well documented by multilateral organisations like the UN and civil society organisations that have been working in Afghanistan for many years.  </p>  <p>  For this reason, my Department is prioritising these and other groups for admission.

The Bureau&rsquo;s remit is to target a person's assets, wherever situated, which derive, or are suspected to derive, directly or indirectly, from criminal conduct. Since its inception, the Bureau has been at the forefront of fighting organised crime in this jurisdiction and disrupting the activities of criminal gangs by depriving them of ill-gotten assets.</p><p>The Bureau is widely regarded as a best practice model in the context of combating organised crime. It works closely with law enforcement bodies at national and international levels and continues to relentlessly pursue the illicit proceeds of organised crime activity. The actions of the Bureau send a strong message to criminals and to local communities that profiting from crime will not be tolerated.</p><p>The table below sets out the physical cash seized by the Criminal Assets Bureau for the years 2015 up to and including 2021.

Given the expertise required for the position, a small number of candidates, identified as having suitable experience, were contacted and invited to apply for the role of independent Chair.  </p>  <p>  It is my intention that the appointment will be made as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  As I have set out previously, the review will comprise a three-part approach to appraise the operation of the Act, with strands focusing on service users, service providers and a public consultation. Independent research commissioned to inform the service user and service provider strands will form key elements of the review. Upon completion, a full report with any necessary recommendations, will be submitted to me as Minister for consideration.</p></reply>

At present all children up to and including the age of 5 are eligible for a GP visit card and therefore GP care without charges.</p><p>The Health (General Practitioner Service and Alteration of Criteria for Eligibility) Act 2020 provides, amongst other things, for the phased expansion of GP care without fees to all children aged 12 years and under in three phases: to children aged 6 and 7; to children aged 8 and 9; and to children aged 10,11 and 12. Budget 2022 provides for the initial stage of this phased expansion, the provision of GP care without fees to all children aged 6 and 7 and my Department has commenced work to roll the service out this year.</p><p>The specific date for commencing the expansion remains under consideration in light of COVID-19 and the additional pressures the expansion might place on general practice in that context and will require consultation with the IMO, representing General Practitioners. It is important to ensure that any additional pressures placed on general practice will not limit its capacity to meet the needs of all patients in the community.</p></reply>

A pro-rata arrangement will apply for eligible part time staff / equivalents and supernumerary students who were required to perform training in clinical sites.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health will also introduce a measure for making a similar payment to staff in private sector nursing homes and hospices that were affected by Covid-19.</p>  <p>  I would like to assure the Deputy that work is underway to ensure fairness in the application of this measure as the Government intended. The Department and the HSE are currently engaging in finalising arrangements to give effect to the Government announcement concerning the Recognition Payment. Full particulars, eligibility and terms and conditions that apply to this payment shall be made available shortly. It is important that this measure is applied fairly as intended and I welcome the work that is ongoing to ensure this is so.</p>  <p>  There are many, many individuals in our country who did so much during the pandemic. I and the Government is sincerely grateful for this commitment but it is appropriate that these public sector frontline healthcare workers get particular recognition. They exposed themselves to particular COVID-19 risks that did not exist in other work environments or those working from home. I am also deeply appreciative of all those frontline workers who worked in our nursing homes and hospices during this pandemic and that they also get similar recognition.</p>  <p>  Outside of the above recognition, the Government also notes that some private healthcare companies have recognised the work of their employees during the pandemic. I would encourage private healthcare companies that have not already done so to consider appropriate measures to recognise their own frontline workers for their work during this most trying period.</p></reply>

While significant work continues to positively impact on waiting times and improve pathways to elective care, acute hospitals have been impacted by operational challenges arising from surges in cases related to the Delta and Omicron variants.</p><p>As part of the response to this the HSE advised all Hospital Groups to take a series of immediate actions which included a period of prioritising unscheduled care, COVID care and urgent time sensitive work - in particular in Model 4 hospitals. Services are beginning to return to normal but elective procedures continue to be affected by staff absences due to Covid and emergency department pressures that are running above 2019 levels.</p><p>The HSE has confirmed to the Department that patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p><p>The Department of Health continues to work with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to identify ways to improve access to care, including through increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services, providing virtual clinics, and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.</p><p>In addition, the Department of Health, the HSE and the NTPF are also working on a Multi Annual Waiting List Plan to bring waiting lists in line with Sl&aacute;intecare targets over the coming years. This process will be overseen by a Ministerial Taskforce, chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Health and includes representatives from the HSE and National Treatment Purchase Fund.</p><p>For 2022 an additional allocation of &euro;250 million, comprised of &euro;200 million to the HSE and &euro;50 million to the National Treatment Purchase Fund has been provided in respect of work to reduce hospital and community waiting lists. The &euro;250 million will be used to fund additional activity in both the public and private sectors. The &euro;50 million additional funding provided to the NTPF brings its total allocation for 2022 to &euro;150 million, and as a consequence there will be a budget of &euro;350 million available to support vital initiatives to improve access to acute hospitals and community health services.</p><p>The information requested by the deputy concerning hip/knee replacements at each hospital in the requested time-bands, is outlined in the attached documents.</p><p>Hips <table>    <tr>       <th>Row Labels</th>       <th>0-12 Mths</th>       <th>12-24 Mths</th>       <th>24-36 Mths</th>

There are no plans currently to introduce such a policy in Ireland.

The paper being prepared by my Department seeks to explore the complex issues raised by mandatory vaccination as part of the wider, comprehensive, evidence-based strategy for managing the pandemic and will be discussed by the National Public Health Emergency Team in due course. </p></reply>

The 2021 average price was 8.71% lower than that of 2020. As of 16th January, the average grade E pig price came in at 141.02 &euro;/100kg,  9.15% lower than the same week last year. However, this is still well above the EU average price of 132.48&euro;/100kg.</p>  <p>  At the recent European Council of Agriculture Ministers, I clearly expressed my concerns in relation to the difficulties facing the Irish pigmeat sector, both in relation to the ongoing impact of increases in fuel, fertiliser, feed and energy prices over recent times which are putting farmer margins under significant pressure, and the sustained nature of the difficulties being experienced on the pigmeat market. I sought the rapid deployment of appropriate solutions on both issues. </p>  <p>  I met with members of the IFA Pig Committee last week to discuss concerns. Following this, Minister Heydon and I then met with the main banks to discuss the current challenges in the pigmeat sector and the importance of their ongoing support. </p>  <p>  At this meeting I emphasised the importance of the pig sector, its overall resilience and the importance of their support to their customers through the current downturn in the business cycle.  The key message was that farmers experiencing cashflow difficulties should engage with the banks as soon as possible to discuss options and that the banks remain committed to supporting their customers in the period ahead. </p>  <p>  Separately, Minister Heydon and I, met with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) to discuss the Brexit Impact Loan Scheme and the COVID- 19 Credit Guarantee Scheme, both of which are financed by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in partnership with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. These finance schemes can be used for working capital finance and include features which address the current financial needs of pig farmers.</p>  <p>  Minister Heydon chaired the Pig RoundTable this week and had a further detailed discussion with all stakeholders, including farm organisations and the processing industry, on the issues facing pig farmers.  In terms of State supports Bord Bia outlined the significant efforts being made to promote quality assured Irish pigmeat on the domestic and export markets; and Teagasc outlined the dedicated advisory supports being provided to pig farmers.  </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to closely monitor the market situation and is examining possible measures to assist in supporting farmers through this significant market disturbance. </p></reply>

However, my Department provides funding to supplement investment by local authorities in their library services. Funding is provided as a contribution towards the cost of developing library buildings, technological capacity and other areas of activity that enhance local library services.</p>  <p>  In 2019, capital funding of &euro;690,000 was provided by my Department for sensory equipment and facilities in public libraries which were approved in response to a call for proposals to library authorities. The aim of this funding was to improve the library experience and services for children, teens and adults with sensory impairments, additional needs, learning difficulties, those on the Autism spectrum and their parents, guardians and carers. While this Call for Proposals included Assistive Technology such as C-PEN readers, no such readers were sought by the authorities. </p>  <p>  In 2021, funding of &euro;200,000 was made available under the Dormant Accounts Fund for a specific Digital Equity and Social Inclusion initiative, which included Assistive Technology, such as C-PEN readers. I understand that a number of local authorities purchased Assistive Technology as a result of this funding, including C-PEN readers.</p>  <p>  As part of the Dormant Accounts 2022 Action Plan, a further &euro;150,000 will be made available to library authorities for the Digital Equity and Social Inclusion Programme which will again allow for the purchase of Assistive Technology, such as C-PEN readers.  This Call for Proposals will issue to all local authorities shortly and it will be a matter for each authority to submit their funding proposals to my Department for approval.</p></reply>

Typical projects are the renovation of community centres, disability access projects and purchase of equipment.   The 2021 &euro;4.5 m fund is now closed  but it is hoped to run the CEP again.  It is normally advertised in each Local Authority area by the Local Community Development Committees (LCDCs) who administer the grant on behalf of this Department. </p>  <p>  In November 2021 my Department launched the Community Activities Fund. This is a &euro;9m fund to support community and voluntary groups impacted by COVID-19.  The Fund will support groups, particularly in disadvantaged areas, with their running costs as well as with improvements to their facilities.  Groups will also be able to use the funding to carry out necessary repairs and to purchase equipment.  Groups should contact the LCDC in their area for further details.</p></reply>
