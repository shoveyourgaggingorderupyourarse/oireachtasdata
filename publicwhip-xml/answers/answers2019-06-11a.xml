This is set out in the regulations governing the Scheme and ensures the effective targeting of limited resources. I have no plans to change this provision.</p><p>Applicants who are separated or divorced may be treated as first-time buyers, in accordance with the regulations, if they meet certain conditions, including: </p><p>- they are separated or divorced under a court order or by a separation agreement;</p><p>- the property being purchased is the first property since leaving the family home;</p><p>- they have left the family home and retain no interest in it; or</p><p>- the other party has remained in the family home.</p><p>In meeting the conditions as set out above, in particular that the other party has remained in the family home and that the potential applicant has relinquished any rights they had over that property, no financial gain should have been made by the potential applicant in exchange for relinquishing their rights to the property in this manner. Were the individual to have made a financial gain in releasing their rights to the property, such as being bought out by the other party who remains resident in it, they would be deemed to have been compensated for their interest in the property, and therefore not be eligible as a first-time buyer.</p><p>The final decision on loan approval is a matter for the relevant local authority and its credit committee on a case-by-case basis.  Decisions on all housing loan applications must be made in accordance with the Regulations establishing the scheme and the credit policy that underpins the scheme, in order to ensure prudence and consistency in approaches in the best interests of both borrowers and the lending local authorities.</p></reply>

Individuals, who in the past may have been reluctant to avail of full time work as they might lose their Rent Supplement support, can now move to HAP, avail of full-time employment and still retain their housing support, with an appropriate adjustment being made to their differential rent.</p>  <p>  At the end of Q1 2019, there were more than 45,900 households having their housing needs met through the HAP scheme, with over 27,000 landlords and agents in receipt of monthly HAP payments. The Residential Tenancies Acts 2004 - 2019 regulate the landlord-tenant relationship in the private rented sector and set out the rights and obligations of landlords and tenants. HAP supported tenancies are afforded the same protections available to all private rented tenancies. </p>  <p>  Each local authority has statutory discretion to agree to a HAP payment up to 20% above the prescribed maximum rent limit to secure appropriate accommodation for a household that requires it.  While there is no legislative provision precluding HAP supported households contributing towards their monthly landlord rent, local authorities have a responsibility to ensure that tenancies are sustainable and are advised not to provide HAP support to tenancies where the household would not be in a position to meet the rental costs involved.</p>  <p>  The Homeless HAP Place Finder Service provides all local authorities with the option to pay deposits and advance rental payments for any households in emergency homeless accommodation, in order to secure accommodation through the HAP Scheme.  In addition, the normal 20% discretion beyond the rent limits is increased to 50% for homeless households in the Dublin Region.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied with the operation of the HAP scheme, which continues to play an important part in meeting social housing needs.  I will, however, keep its operation, and the operation of social housing delivery streams more generally, under ongoing review.  </p></reply>

The RIA sets out a number of options for establishing an electoral commission, including functions that might be assigned to it.  These options and functions have regard to the recommendations in the 2016 report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht on the establishment of an electoral commission.</p>  <p>  Proposed functions for an electoral commission could include having oversight of running elections and referendums; taking over the functions of the Referendum Commission; taking over the functions of the Standards in Public Office Commission in regard to political spending and donations; responsibility for the Register of Political Parties; and having a research function.  The RIA also recommends that an electoral commission be assigned responsibility for voter education and engagement programmes.  Such programmes could assist the public in having a better understanding of the voting system.  </p>  <p>  Twenty-three submissions were received in the course of the public consultation process.  These are being considered in my Department as part of the process to inform a preferred option for establishing a commission, which will be brought to Government for consideration.  Once a preferred option is agreed, work would then commence in the Autumn on the preparation of the necessary legislation to establish an electoral commission.</p>  <p>  In relation to voter registration, the position is that the preparation of the register of electors is a matter for each local authority, as a registration authority. It is the duty of registration authorities to ensure, as far as possible and with the cooperation of the public, the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the register.  In support of activity by local authorities in preparing the register of electors, my Department promotes greater awareness of the register of electors through an annual campaign of promotional posters, the use of social-media and the taking out of both newspaper and on-line advertisements.  A separate initiative in relation to the modernisation of the electoral register is under way, in relation to which a public consultation has also been concluded, the submissions on which are currently being considered.</p></reply>

The Regional Spatial and Economic Strategy for the North-Western Regional Assembly area, which includes Donegal, is currently at amended draft stage.  It is envisaged that the Regional Strategy, after a final round of public consultation, will be approved during Autumn 2019.  Further to this, Donegal County Council will be required to either commence or vary their Development Plan, including their Housing Strategy for the County, with the process being completed by 2020/21, to cover the period to 2026/27.</p>  <p>  In this regard National Policy Objective (NPO) 37 of the National Planning Framework requires each local authority to carry out a Housing Need and Demand Assessment (HNDA) in order to correlate and accurately align overall future housing requirements, as an evolution of their existing Housing Strategy requirements under Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended). </p>  <p>  This process will assist local authorities in ensuring that long-term strategic housing needs are met across all types and tenures within their functional area, in both urban and rural locations.  My Department intends to provide further guidance to local authorities later this year, to support their HNDA work as part of the review of their Development Plans.  In tandem with the preparation of the HNDA methodology and guidance, my Department is also currently revising and updating Guidelines for Development Plan preparation, which will also be finalised by the end of the year.</p>  <p>  In this context, it will be a matter for Donegal County Council, having regard to the outcome of the processes outlined, and supported by updated guidance from my Department, to identify and ensure that their strategic housing needs are met in the years ahead. </p></reply>

The first, at Enniskerry Road in Stepaside, will deliver 155 homes, 50 of which will be cost rental. The cost-rental element of the project is being supported by &euro;4.5m in funding under the Serviced Sites Fund.  Construction is due to commence on the project later this month.</p>  <p>  Further work is underway in relation to the second project, which is located at St. Michael&rsquo;s Estate, Emmet Road in Inchicore, which is estimated to have the potential to accommodate approximately 470 homes in total, some 350 of which will be cost rental homes. Dublin City Council is continuing to work on its plan for this site and has appointed a dedicated project manager and a team to advance the development. Professional advisers have also been engaged to assist with the preparation of an Urban Design Framework Plan.</p>  <p>  These Cost Rental pilots will act as the first examples of how this model can work in an Irish context. They will provide very valuable lessons for the design of a wider policy framework, and will help to shape the contractual model and specifications for future larger-scale projects. Officials from my Department are currently developing the policy framework for this broader cost rental model, in conjunction with the Land Development Agency, the Housing Agency, and other bodies, with a view to progressing further sites to the development stage.  The policy framework will also benefit from input from the European Investment Bank, with which my Department has recently concluded an agreement for advisory services, drawing on the EIB's cost rental experience in other countries.</p></reply>

In particular, Rebuilding Ireland includes specific actions relating to the provision of emergency accommodation and the range of supports to be provided to households accessing such accommodation. </p>  <p>  Under Rebuilding Ireland, my Department is funding an initiative to provide homeless families residing in temporary emergency accommodation in the Dublin Region with access to free public transport for essential school journeys.  The Dublin Region Homeless Executive (DRHE) oversees the implementation of this initiative and, working in partnership with the National Transport Authority, has put arrangements in place for the provision of Leap cards to the families concerned.  These Leap cards provide for free public transport for school-going children and accompanying adults, where necessary.  The cards are distributed through the Family Homeless Action Teams, which are also funded by the DRHE.</p>  <p>  As the Leap cards were introduced to support essential school journeys, there are no plans to extend the provision of the cards outside of the school term. However, the Community Welfare Service of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection may consider, on a case-by-case basis, the needs of an individual household in respect of exceptional transport costs.</p></reply>

The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once off in nature.</p>  <p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced at that time also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.</p>  <p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support.  The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources. </p>  <p>  However, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is under way. The review will also have regard to current initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and cost rental and will be completed when the impacts of these parallel initiatives have been considered.</p></reply>

This is reflected in the reductions recorded on the social housing waiting list in Wexford, with the number of households on the list reducing by 567, or over 20%, between 2016 and 2018, with just under 2,000 additional housing supports provided in the county since 2016.  The target for 2019 is for the delivery of an additional 931 housing supports in County Wexford, comprising 353 homes through build, acquisition and leasing programmes and 578 households to be supported through the Housing Assistance Payment and Rental Accommodation Scheme, which will have a significant impact on further reducing Wexford's housing list. </p>  <p>  A substantial focus of all stakeholders is to increase supply through new build activity. At end 2018, Wexford County Council has a social housing construction programme of 58 projects, yielding almost 700 homes. This pipeline continues to grow with regular approvals for new schemes. I am confident that the actions, targets and resources available under Rebuilding Ireland provide a strong platform for continuing to reduce the number of households on waiting lists in Wexford and across the country. </p>  <p>  In order to support local authorities in delivering affordable homes, &euro;310 million is being made available from 2019 until 2021, under the Serviced Site Fund (SSF).  The SSF will fund facilitating infrastructure, on local authority sites, with a maximum funding rate of &euro;50,000 per affordable home. The first call under the SSF issued to 11 local authorities in urban areas in June 2018, where an affordability issue was identified.</p>  <p>  Following an economic assessment process, a second call issued under the SSF to 19 local authorities last month, including Wexford.  The closing date for applications under this 2nd call was 17 May 2019. A total of 30 submissions were received from 15 local authorities, including Wexford County Council, and these applications are currently being assessed, with a view to issuing approvals later this month.</p>  <p>  I and my Department will continue to work with all stakeholders in order to accelerate further the significant increase in the delivery of homes across all tenures in Wexford and nationally.</p></reply>

The low rate of fixed interest associated with the RIHL provides first time buyers with access to mortgage finance that they may not have otherwise been able to afford at a higher interest rate.  </p>  <p>  The scheme allows low-income first time buyers aged between 18 and 70 who cannot secure a mortgage from a commercial lender, to access sustainable mortgage finance that is designed to enable them to purchase a new or second-hand property, or undertake a self-build, within a suitable price range. Applicants must be in continuous employment for a minimum of two years (primary earner) or one year (secondary earner).  For single applicants, the income limit is &euro;50,000, rising to &euro;75,000 for joint applicants. The maximum price range for the value of a house that can be purchased under the scheme is &euro;320k in Cork, Dublin, Galway, Kildare, Louth, Meath and Wicklow and &euro;250k elsewhere. </p>  <p>  Based on the competitive borrowing achieved by the Housing Finance Agency, local authorities can offer a first tranche of fixed rate annuity finance to eligible borrowers at rates of 2.0% and 2.25% per annum, for twenty five and thirty years, respectively. Placing ceilings on the value of properties that may be purchased and aligning the terms of the loan with the Loan-to-Value elements of the Central Bank prudential lending rules guard against possible inflationary impacts on the market.   </p>  <p>  Towards the end of last year I asked my Department to undertake a review of the scheme's operation. In carrying out the review, the Department has consulted with a number of local authorities, the Housing Agency and the Housing Finance Agency. The review also has regard to the views raised by public representatives since the scheme's commencement.  In making any recommendations in relation to the operation of the scheme, the review must also take account of the need to ensure that lending issued under it is provided on a prudential basis, so as to protect the financial interests of both borrowers and local authorities.    </p>  <p>  The review has been submitted to me and I am currently examining it. </p>  <p>  When the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan was initially being developed, it was estimated that the drawdown of loans under the scheme would be approximately &euro;200 million over three years. From the data collated on the scheme to date, the RIHL has proven to be more successful than initially anticipated, as a result of which, the scheme would require a further tranche of funds to be borrowed by the HFA in order to enable its continuation.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently in discussions with the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance with regard to the amount of a second tranche of funding for the scheme, which I anticipate, will be finalised soon. When these discussions are concluded, I will be in a position to make an announcement on the matter.</p>  <p>  However, the scheme remains open and all local authorities have been advised to continue to receive and process applications up to and including the issuing of loans. </p>  <p>  Separately, I have commenced the relevant provisions of Part 5 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 to provide a statutory basis for the delivery of affordable housing for purchase.  I also signed regulations on 12 March 2019 under which local authorities make their Schemes of Priority, which provide the administrative framework through which affordable homes will ultimately be allocated under the scheme. </p>  <p>  Prioritising geographical areas for operation of the scheme is informed by economic assessments which local authorities have completed in relation to the affordability issues in their areas.  Delivery of affordable housing is to be supported using the Serviced Sites Fund (SSF) which will utilise a budget of &euro;310 million to provide site infrastructure support to help make available approximately 6,200 affordable homes over the next three years.  An initial 10 projects have been approved for &euro;43 million of funding under the first call for proposals under the Fund.  A second call issued on 9 April 2019, in response to which 30 submissions were received from 15 local authorities. These are currently being assessed by my Department and I intend to announce approvals under this second call in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

The accommodation sourced by tenants should be within the prescribed maximum HAP rent limits, which are based on household size and the rental market within the area concerned. </p>  <p>  Each local authority has statutory discretion to agree to a HAP payment up to 20% above the prescribed maximum rent limit in circumstances where it is necessary, because of local rental market conditions, to secure appropriate accommodation for a household.  It is a matter for the local authority to determine if the application of the flexibility is warranted on a case by case basis. </p>  <p>  At the end of Q1 2019, 35.7% of the total number of households being supported by HAP were benefiting from the additional flexibility. When the additional discretion available to homeless households in the Dublin Region is removed, 28.9% of households nationally were benefiting from the additional flexibility. </p>  <p>  In the Wexford County Council area, at the end of Q1 2019, 25% of households were benefiting from additional discretion, with the average rate of discretion being 16.3% above the applicable rent limits. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the existing arrangements under the HAP scheme provide adequate flexibility and discretion to local authorities, where necessary, to support households in securing accommodation.  Accordingly, I have no plans at present to increase HAP rent limits, a course of action which could have inflationary effects on rents and thereby have a potentially detrimental impact on the wider rental market, including for those households who are not receiving HAP support.</p></reply>

The significant progress being made in these areas is outlined on the Rebuilding Ireland website at .</p><p>Overall, the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan will increase the supply of new homes to 25,000 per annum by 2020; deliver an additional 50,000 social housing homes over the period 2016 to 2021; and meet the housing needs of a further 88,000 households through the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) Scheme and the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS).</p><p>The implementation of Rebuilding Ireland is a key Government priority supported by significant annual investment. For 2019 alone, funding of almost &euro;2.4 billion is being provided for all housing programmes, a 25% increase on the 2018 allocation. This investment will see the housing needs of almost 27,400 households being met, of which 10,000 will be new social housing homes delivered through build, acquisition and long term leasing programmes, with the remaining supports being delivered through HAP and RAS schemes.</p><p>Local authorities deliver a wide range of public services, including those in relation to housing. They derive their income to meet the delivery of these services from a variety of sources, including commercial rates, charges for goods and services and funding from Central Government. </p><p>Local authorities vary significantly from one another in terms of size, population, public service demands, the scale and timing of particular infrastructural investments  and other income sources; funding levels in the past have reflected this variety. Therefore, it is not possible to compare absolute levels of funding received in local authority areas, as to do so would not reflect the significant differences that exist between them. Indeed, it is a matter for each local authority to maximise local income sources and manage its own spending, in the context of the annual budgetary process. </p><p>Funding is available to support every local authority in delivering on their social housing targets and my Department will engage with any local authority in a position to deliver beyond its targets. Over the past three years, Meath County Council has received total funding of over &euro;122 million to meet the cost of its housing programmes.  </p><p>In 2018, the Council delivered 437 social housing homes through build, acquisition and leasing programmes, with an additional 767 households being supported through HAP and RAS, resulting in the needs of over 1,200 households being met across all delivery schemes in 2018.  Indeed, over the 2016 to 2018 period, the first three years of Rebuilding Ireland, more than 3,000 households in County Meath have had their housing needs met. </p><p>The level of progress being made is reflected in social housing waiting lists, which have reduced by 22% nationally, from 91,600 households to 71,858, between 2016 and 2018. In Meath, the number of households on waiting lists decreased by some 20% in one year alone, falling from 2,453 in 2017 to 1,966 in 2018.</p><p>In relation to social housing construction activity, my Department publishes comprehensive status reports, on a quarterly basis, on all social housing construction schemes for all local authority areas.  The most recent of these reports covers the period up to the end 2018 and contains information on the progress of over 19,134 new social housing homes nationally progressing through planning, design and construction, as well as homes delivered to end 2018.  The report, which is available on the Rebuilding Ireland website at , shows that Meath County Council, together with the Approved Housing Bodies with which it is working, has a social housing construction programme of 68 projects already complete or at planning, design, tender or construction stage, which will deliver 950 homes when complete.  This programme continues to be added to on an ongoing basis.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-06-11a.62.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1265" speakername="John Paul Phelan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019061100059#WRB04300"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 62 and 69 together.</p>  <p>  Rates income is critical to meet the cost of services provided by local authorities. Local authorities levy rates on any property used for commercial purposes in accordance with the details entered in the valuation lists prepared by the independent Commissioner of Valuation pursuant to the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015.  The annual rate on valuation (ARV) is applied to the valuation of each property, to obtain the amount payable in rates. The ARV is a reserved function decided by the elected members of each local authority in the annual budget. </p>  <p>  My Department has in recent years requested local authorities to exercise restraint in setting ARVs and they have responded positively in this regard.  The national average ARV has not changed significantly in recent years.  The national average ARV decreased slightly each year from 2010 to 2015 and has increased slightly each year from 2016 to 2019.  </p>  <p>  In overall terms, while economic activity has been expanding significantly in recent years, the overall rates income of local authorities nationally has remained relatively unchanged. The rates payable by individual businesses may change because of the impact of the revaluation programme being undertaken by the Commissioner of Valuation, or as a result of a stand-alone revision of a property's valuation. </p>  <p>  Reasons for valuation increases may be that the valuation of some properties had not been revised to take account of improvements or extensions for some time, or where the valuations were historically low in comparison with the general level of valuations on the valuation list.  In overall terms, I understand that of the revaluations conducted to date under the revaluation programme, approximately 60% of ratepayers have had their liability for rates reduced and approximately 40% have experienced an increase.  Additionally, gradual rates harmonisation across new local authority areas, following the merger of town and county councils in 2014, may have led to increases in certain areas. </p>  <p>  The Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the performance of his statutory functions and the setting of valuations for rating is his sole responsibility. I have no function in relation to decisions in this regard. The Valuation Office is currently engaged in a national revaluation programme, on a phased basis, the first revaluation of that scale, encompassing all rating authority areas, in over 160 years. </p>  <p>  The revaluation provisions in the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015 provide a modern statutory framework for the revaluation of all rateable property within a rating authority area so as to reflect changes in value due to economic factors, differential movements in property values or other external factors such as infrastructural changes in the vicinity of a property and changes in the local business environment.   </p>  <p>  Having up to date and consistent valuations, reflecting current market conditions, is critical to ensure that the levying of commercial rates is on a fair, equitable and consistent basis across all economic sectors and parts of the country and is the purpose of the national revaluation programme. The revaluation process includes comprehensive communication and appeals mechanisms. </p>  <p>  In order to ensure that the revaluation promotes equity across sectors and areas, but is also a revenue neutral exercise in overall terms, the Minister may limit the total amount of rates collectable within the local authority in the year following a revaluation to that collected in the previous year, subject to minor adjustments. </p>  <p>  In order to further improve the regime for the levying and collection of commercial rates, the Local Government (Rates) Bill 2018 is currently before the Oireachtas. The Bill is a key priority of my Department and, when enacted, will facilitate more effective and streamlined rates collection procedures. Included in the provisions of the Bill are:</p>  <p> - the removal of the requirement for ratepayers to pay their annual bill in two instalments (moieties) and provision to allow ratepayers to pay rates by instalments or through a payment plan agreed with the local authority;</p>  <p> - schemes for the abatement of rates on vacant properties;</p>  <p> - the levying of interest on unpaid and overdue rates; and</p>  <p> - the rendering of unpaid rates to be a charge on relevant property.</p>  <p>  Additionally, the Bill includes provisions to allow a local authority to introduce rates alleviation schemes, which would include schemes to support the implementation of the Government's Realising Our Rural Potential: The Action Plan for Rural Development.</p>  <p>  Further measures are currently being examined with a view to their introduction to the Bill at Committee Stage</p></reply>

This means that discrimination in the provision of accommodation or related service and amenities against people in receipt of rent supplement, HAP or other social welfare payments is prohibited. </p>  <p>  HAP is a form of social housing support under which local authorities make monthly payments on behalf of tenants directly to landlords in respect of rent, subject to the terms and conditions of the scheme.  Limerick City and County Council provide a highly effective transactional shared service on behalf of all HAP local authorities. The HAP Shared Service Centre (SSC) manages the collection of all HAP tenants&rsquo; differential rents, on behalf of the relevant local authority, and the payment of all HAP rents to landlords on behalf of tenants supported by the HAP scheme. </p>  <p>  HAP tenants source their own accommodation in the private rented market and are advised that this accommodation should be within the HAP rent limits provided to them by the local authority.  The rent limits are related to specific household types and to the rental market in the area. HAP is a form of social housing support that allows tenants to work full-time and retain their housing support so in many cases, people may make choices about affordability taking this into consideration.</p>  <p>  There is no legislative provision precluding HAP supported households contributing towards the monthly rent to their landlord.  However, local authorities have a responsibility to ensure that tenancies are sustainable and are advised not to provide HAP support to tenancies where they are not satisfied that the household would be in a position to meet the rental costs being sought.</p></reply>

Following receipt of such a proposal, the Minister requests the Director of the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) to conduct an assessment of the area to establish whether or not it meets the criteria for designation and to report to the Minister on whether the area should be designated as a Rent Pressure Zone. For the purpose of the Act, &lsquo;area&rsquo; is defined as either the administrative area of a housing authority or a local electoral area within the meaning of section 2 of the Local Government Act 2001. </p><p>Up until recently, for an area to be designated a Rent Pressure Zone, it must have satisfied the following criteria set out in section 24A(4) of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 (as inserted by section 36 of the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016):</p><p>(i) the annual rate of rent inflation in the area must have been 7% or more in four of the last six quarters; and </p><p>(ii) the average rent for tenancies registered in the area with the RTB in the last quarter must be above the average national rent (the National Standardised Rent in the RTB&rsquo;s Rent Index Report) in the last quarter (&euro;1,134 per month in Q4  2018).</p><p>However, on 30 May 2019, I signed the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 (Commencement) Order 2019 which appointed 31 May 2019 and 4 June 2019 as the dates on which specified provisions of the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 came into effect, including provisions in respect of the average rent qualifying criterion for RPZ designation. </p><p>Using RTB data, (i) the rent of a dwelling in the Greater Dublin Area (Kildare, Wicklow and Meath) will now be compared to the average rent across the country, excluding Dublin rents; and (ii) the rent of a dwelling outside of the Greater Dublin Area will be compared to the average rent across the country, excluding the Greater Dublin Area rents. </p><p>The RTB Rent Index Report includes a summary in Table 9 of the data used to establish whether each Local Electoral Area fulfils the criteria for designation as a Rent Pressure Zone. This ensures transparency in relation to the position of individual areas in terms of average rent levels and increases.</p><p>Further information on Rent Pressure Zones and designations is available on my Department's website at , by searching 'rent pressure zones - information'.</p><p>The data from the Rent Index Report for Q4 2018 relating to the local electoral area of Gorey, County Wexford is detailed in the following table.<table><tr><th>Local   Electoral Area</th><th>Quarters   &amp;gt; 7%</th><th>Average   2018 Q4</th></tr><tr><td>Gorey </td><td>5 </td><td>&euro;868.02 </td></tr></table></p><p>In Gorey, while more than 4 of the last 6 quarters have seen rent inflation of 7% or greater, the average monthly rent is below the national standardised rent of &euro;1,134 per month. Therefore, the Local Electoral Area of Gorey did not meet the criteria for designation. </p><p>The Q1 2019 RTB Rent Index, which is due to be published later this month, will allow the Housing Agency to recommend areas to  be considered for designation using the new criteria as set out in the 2019 Act.

It is now my intention to deliver on the will of the people of Limerick without delay. Significant work on the proposal has already been carried out in the form of the published document "Directly Elected Mayors with Executive Functions: Detailed Policy Proposals" approved by the Government on 20 March 2019. </p>  <p>  Under Section 44 of the Local Government Act 2019, the Minister is now required to prepare and submit to the Houses of the Oireachtas a report with legislative proposals for a directly elected mayor for Limerick. There is a further significant piece of work required to systematically analyse all legislation conferring functions and powers on local authority chief executives and this will involve consultation with key stakeholders.  </p>  <p>  Under the Act, the Report and legislative proposals must be submitted by 24 May 2021, two years after the plebiscite vote. However, I have asked my Department to prioritise this work with a view to bringing the Report and legislative proposals forward at the earliest opportunity.  </p>  <p>  Under the Government's proposal, a full 5 year term of office for the directly elected mayor with executive functions is envisaged, with elections taking place with local elections. However, a possible election date in 2022 was identified for the first directly elected mayor, with a consequently shorter first term envisaged up to the next local elections in 2024. </p>  <p>  In the expectation that the preparatory work can be carried out and the legislative process is prioritised in the Oireachtas, the first election for mayor could take place in Limerick City and County Council in 2021. </p>  <p>  The people of Cork City and Waterford City and County narrowly rejected the Government's proposals in the recent plebiscites in those local authority areas, and I fully respect the outcome of the votes there. In accordance with the legislation, the priority now is on delivering the mandate given by the people of Limerick.   </p>  <p>  In relation to Dublin, work is underway in the Department of the Taoiseach on proposals for the establishment of a new Citizens&rsquo; Assembly to consider a number of issues, including the issue of a directly elected mayor for Dublin and the form that this should take. The function of a Citizens&rsquo; Assembly is to inform the public and increase overall awareness of topics being examined. Consideration is being given to the parameters of this and other topics and how best to optimise the use of an Assembly&rsquo;s time and the taxpayers money. Proposals are expected to come before Government shortly. </p>  <p>  Finally, in relation to Galway, as provisions enabling the amalgamation of Galway City and County Councils and the holding of a plebiscite on a directly elected mayor for Galway included in the Local Government Bill were not passed by the Oireachtas, a plebiscite did not proceed there last month.  My Department is now working with the two local authorities to consider and recalibrate the local government modernisation programme in Galway in light of the passage of the Bill.</p></reply>

In broad terms, electronic voting and counting was originally proposed in order to: </p><p>- improve the efficiency of electoral administration; </p><p>- provide election results more quickly; </p><p>- make it easier for the public to vote; </p><p>- support a positive image of the country in the use of information technology.</p><p>However, over the course of the development and testing of the proposed electronic voting system, it became clear that, notwithstanding relatively minor issues in relation to the manual system of voting, there was, and remains, very significant public confidence in that system.  Equally, it became clear that the electorate were not supportive of the proposed roll out of electronic voting due to significant concerns that emerged in public debate, in particular, on the security of the vote.  Against this background, the then Government decided, in 2008, not to proceed with the implementation of electronic voting in Ireland.</p><p>While the counting period at the recent European Parliament elections in the South constituency took longer than would normally have been the case, the number of candidates standing for election and, consequentially, the size of the ballot paper contributed significantly to the counting period.  </p><p>While electoral law is subject to ongoing review, I currently have no proposals to examine, or introduce, measures in support of electronic and online voting at local and European elections held in the State.  </p></reply>

The Dublin Region Homeless Executive has developed a National Quality Standards Framework (NQSF) on behalf of my Department.  The Framework has been developed to ensure a more consistent approach in how local authorities and service providers respond to the needs of those experiencing homelessness.  The Framework was implemented on a phased basis in the Dublin region, with site visits commencing in February.  The experience gained from the recent completion of the roll-out in the Dublin region and the commencement of site visits has allowed the DRHE to evaluate how the Framework should be implemented nationally and to advise my Department accordingly. </p>  <p>  Last month, my Department wrote to local authorities, instructing them on the process for the implementation of the Framework, which is to be implemented on a nationwide basis over a 12-month period commencing on 1 July 2019.   Upon completion of the implementation phase, local authorities will commence site visits to ensure compliance with the Framework.  Management of these site visits will be a matter for local authorities.

This is consistent with the recommendations made by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services in 2017, and the legislative reforms in the Water Services Acts.</p>  <p>  In this context, Irish Water has proposed fully integrating its operations and ending the current operational arrangements for the delivery of water services through service level agreements with local authorities.  </p>  <p>  On 19 September 2018, the Director General of the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) reported on a process of engagement, undertaken at my request, with the parties involved in the transformation programme for Irish Water, including ICTU and relevant affiliated unions, local government management through the County and City Management Association, Irish Water and my Department.  In response to the WRC report, I asked the parties to engage in a process to work towards the development of a stable structural and operational framework for the future. </p>  <p>  This would replace the current Service Level Agreements for the provision of water services, with arrangements which:</p>  <p>  (a) provide Irish Water, as the national water services authority, with the necessary control of operations, accountability and capacity to manage risk and communicate and negotiate with all water services workers on the change agenda and provide a single identity for customer facing services; </p>  <p>  (b) ensure that Irish Water is not left without an appropriate skilled workforce to carry out its statutory functions and local authorities are not left with stranded costs; and,</p>  <p>  (c) address the concerns of workers in relation to the future deployment of the current local authority water staff, by developing arrangements which meet the objectives set out above, while not requiring the invoking of Section 19 of the Water Services (No.2) Act 2013, other than by collective agreement. Section 19 relates to the process of designation of local authority staff for transfer to Irish Water on termination of a SLA.</p>  <p>  I recognise the challenges involved in this process and the concerns which all parties to the process have, especially the workers.</p>  <p>  The proposed changes also give rise to significant challenges for the local government sector in Ireland. Any process of transformation needs to be cognisant of the potential impacts on the wider local government system.  Ultimately, given my Department's responsibility for the local government system, I want to ensure that our local authorities continue to be a vibrant and progressive component of public service delivery in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The formal engagement under the WRC commenced in February 2019 and two formal meetings have been held to date.  I am grateful for the commitment of the WRC in facilitating the process.</p>  <p>  There are also constitutional and governance issues that are of interest and relevant to the future provision of water services in Ireland.  These matters are being discussed between parties in different strands of dialogue outside of the WRC process.</p></reply>

In addition to an ambitious social housing programme being rolled out under Rebuilding Ireland, the Government's Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, which is designed to meet housing needs on a long-term basis, a network of family hubs is also being put in place to provide a better response than is possible through hotels, for addressing the immediate needs of families experiencing homelessness and requiring emergency accommodation.  As well as providing enhanced facilities, including in relation to cooking and laundry, families in hubs also receive better supports, including support to identify and secure an independent tenancy. </p>  <p>  On 18 April 2019, the Office of the Children&rsquo;s Ombudsman published &lsquo;No Place Like Home&rsquo;, a report into the experiences of children and parents of young children accommodated in family hubs. While the report notes a number of advantages of hubs over alternative forms of emergency accommodation, it also noted a numbers of areas of concern.  </p>  <p>  My Department is undertaking a detailed examination of the recommendations of the report, in consultation with the NGO service providers and the relevant local authorities.  In that context, I have written to each of the NGOs involved in the provision of services in family hubs, asking for their observations on the report, and I have also met with the Ombudsman for Children to discuss the report.  The issue of responses to the report that may be appropriate is being considered as part of that process. </p></reply>

The first call for proposals under the SSF in June 2018 was targeted at 11 local authorities where it was identified that the greatest affordability pressures exist.  I issued approval in December 2018 for funding for 10 infrastructure projects in Dublin and Cork, costing &euro;43 million, which will support the delivery of 1,400 affordable homes.  The overall cost and timing of delivery for these projects is contingent upon the completion of planning and procurement in the first instance, and local authorities are working to achieve delivery as quickly as possible, with the first tranche of affordable homes expected to be delivered next year.</p>  <p>  Following the first call under the SSF, all local authorities were requested to submit economic assessments to ascertain if the provision of affordable homes was appropriate in their areas.  A second call for proposals under the SSF issued to 19 local authorities on 9 April 2019,  based on these economic assessments.  In response, 30 submissions were received from 15 local authorities and these are currently being assessed by my Department.  I intend to issue approvals under this second call in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

However, a recent review of the on-line vacant site registers across all local authority areas shows there are collectively over 360 individual sites currently on the local registers.  Over 120 of these sites had been entered by 1 January 2018 and are therefore subject to the levy in 2019, unless development works were activated in the interim. </p>  <p>  As of 6 June 2019, sites with a value of &euro;364.2m were listed on local authority vacant site registers, of which &euro;254.5m related to sites listed on the registers prior to 1 January 2018. Without any changes to the number of sites currently listed on local authority registers, it is estimated that the levy proceeds nationally could be of the order of &euro;7.6m (applying the current 3% levy rate in respect of sites on the registers in 2018), increasing to &euro;25.5m in 2020 (applying the increased 7% levy rate in respect of sites listed on local authority registers in 2019).  </p>  <p>  Levy implementation progress reports were requested from local authorities late last year and all local authorities have submitted responses. These responses are currently being examined by my Department with a view to determining what, if any, further implementation supports may be required.</p></reply>

This is important for policy-making.</p><p>The work and associated reports of the NESC provide a unique analysis of the challenges facing Irish society and are an important contribution to policy development as they often have a focus on the strategic and longer-term view. For example, as part of Future Jobs Ireland 2019, NESC will develop policy recommendations for the operation of Transition Teams to manage the impact of economic transition on vulnerable workers and sectors. The project will provide a forward look at the economy in the context of a transition to a low-carbon and more digital future. </p><p>Recent reports published by the Council include:</p><blockquote><i>-</i>Climate Change Policy: Getting the Process Right;<br /><br />- Transport Orientated Development: Assessing Opportunity for Ireland;<br /><br />- Moving from Welfare to Work: Low Work Intensity Households and the Quality of Supportive Services; and<br /><br />- Urban Development Land, Housing and Infrastructure: Fixing Ireland&rsquo;s Broken System.</blockquote><p>I brought these reports to Government in advance of publication. </p><p>Since becoming Taoiseach, I have made nine appointments to the NESC. Five appointments were made on the basis of nominations from sectoral organisations, as provided for in the legislation.

Rates of reimbursement, fixed in accordance with UN categories of equipment and personnel, are agreed in a Memorandum of Understanding between Ireland and the UN for each mission.  The only missions for which Ireland is currently entitled to reimbursement of some troop and equipment costs are the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) and the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) on the Golan Heights.  The timing of the receipt of reimbursements is dependent on the financial situation at the UN.  Reimbursements are received in arrears.  </p>  <p>  A standard UN rate of reimbursement of $1,428 (&euro;1262) per month is paid to troop contributing countries in respect of each member of a military unit deployed to a United Nation field mission. This reimbursement represents a contribution by the UN towards troop sustainment costs incurred by the member States including, for example, the provision of food, lodging, medical support, communications, ordnance, and other goods and services and is paid directly to Governments in respect of deployed personnel.</p>  <p>  While deployed on such operations, personnel are paid a daily Unarmed or Armed Peace Support Allowance depending on the nature of the mission.  Unarmed Peace Support Allowance ranges from &euro;55.14 to  &euro;79.51 per day depending on rank, equivalent to about &euro;1,677 to &euro;2,418 per month.  For personnel in receipt of Armed Peace Support Allowance, the daily rates range from &euro;76.36 to &euro;101.75, equivalent to about &euro;2,322 to &euro;3,094 per month.  Both unarmed and armed peace support allowance are non taxable.  </p>  <p>  In addition, while serving on a UN peacekeeping mission, the UN also facilities the payment directly to personnel of a daily allowance of $1.28 plus a recreational leave allowance of $10.50 per day for up to 15 days of leave taken during each six-month period.</p></reply>

The service life of an Irish Naval Service ship is determined by the level of operational activity, but usually is around 30 years.

Over the course of their extension programmes, L&Eacute; R&oacute;is&iacute;n and L&Eacute; Niamh will be out of operation for a period of some twelve months each.</p>  <p>  The addition of L&Eacute; George Bernard Shaw to the fleet ensures that the Naval Service continue to have eight seagoing ships operational for the medium term.

Many security duties are demand led and the number of duties can fluctuate year on year. It is therefore not possible to provide a full year cost of the suggested increase mentioned. </p>  <p>  In accordance with the Public Service Stability Agreement, 2013-2016, (the Haddington Road Agreement), all sectors across the public service were required to contribute to additional pay and productivity measures. Other sectors delivered these savings through a variety of approaches including additional working time and reduced rates of overtime payments.</p>  <p>  The contribution from the Defence sector included a reduction of 10% on the rate of certain allowances payable to the Defence Forces. As part of the cost saving measures to be secured under the agreement, it was also agreed with the Permanent Defence Force Representative Associations that the Saturday and Sunday rates for Security Duty Allowance would be flat rated.</p>  <p>  The cost of restoring the premium rates and the 10% cut to SDA introduced in the Public Service Stability Agreement 2013-2016, would be in the region of  &euro;2 million per annum. This figure is based on the 2018 payments of SDA. As security duties are demand led and the number of duties can fluctuate year on year, this variable must be taken into consideration in comparing any actual figures with speculative amounts. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that the representative associations for the Permanent Defence Force, PDFORRA and RACO have made claims for the restoration of the premium rates which is being processed through the Conciliation and Arbitration (C&amp;A) Scheme.

I fully support the statement by EU High Representative Mogherini of 26 March last which voiced concern regarding the proposed amendments to the National Reconciliation Law in Guatemala, which would result in an immediate amnesty for perpetrators of grave human rights violations during the civil war. The proposed amendments to the law governing non-governmental organisations would also impede these groups' work and curtail the activities of human rights defenders. </p>  <p>  Ireland, along with our EU colleagues, deeply regrets the decision of the Government of Guatemala to terminate the 2006 Agreement with the UN establishing the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG). </p>  <p>  Since its establishment, the CICIG has been working effectively to combat corruption and impunity and to strengthen the rule of law in Guatemala.  I would like to again urge the Guatemalan Government to allow CICIG to continue its important work until the end of the current mandate in September 2019, respecting the integrity of CICIG national and international personnel and affording them all necessary protection. </p>  <p>  Officials at my Department in Dublin, and at our Embassy in Mexico, which has responsibility for our relations with Guatemala, are monitoring events in Guatemala closely and meet regularly with civil society and human rights groups to discuss the very concerning situation for human rights defenders in the country. </p>  <p>  Officials recently met with representatives of the organisation referred to by the Deputy, along with representatives from Peace Brigades International (PBI), a civil society organisation that receives funding from the Department. PBI provides protection measures to human rights defenders in Guatemala, including members of the 'New Day Ch'orti' Campesino Central Coordinator (CCCND), and my Department is pleased to support PBI in this important work. </p>  <p>  Support for human rights defenders is a long established priority of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy and we proudly play an active role in championing the promotion and protection of such activists, and indeed of open civil society space globally. </p>  <p>  Officials at my Department will continue to monitor developments in Guatemala closely and to engage on the human rights situation in the country with our EU, international and civil society partners.</p></reply>

The latest violence there has resulted in the deaths of hundreds of civilians, and displaced over 270,000 people last month, bringing the total number of displaced to over 300,000 since April. I am aware of the very alarming reports from medical professionals and other humanitarian organisations - including the organisation referred to by the Deputy - in relation to the situation there. I condemn in particular the airstrikes that are reported to have targeted medical facilities and schools, in contravention of international humanitarian law. Ireland will continue to call on all parties to uphold their ceasefire commitments, and cease military activities in the Idlib region. We will also continue to urge those with influence on the Syrian regime to exert pressure to ensure that civilians are protected, and to encourage the Syrian Government to engage fully with the UN-led peace process. </p>  <p>  This upsurge in violence has also had a serious impact on critical civilian infrastructure, including hospitals and schools, and the ability of humanitarian actors to carry out their activities has been severely compromised. I urge all actors to abide by UN deconfliction mechanisms to prevent further casualties and destruction, and to guarantee unrestricted access and safe channels for humanitarian assistance to reach those most in need.  </p>  <p>  Ireland and the EU firmly believe that eight years of war have shown that military action cannot bring lasting peace to Syria. Only a holistic and comprehensive political process can bring about a lasting end to the conflict. Ireland fully supports the UN-led efforts to bring about a political resolution to the conflict, in accordance with the 2012 Geneva Communiqu&eacute; and UN Security Council Resolution 2254.  The EU provides direct assistance to the Geneva peace talks and has launched, in coordination with the UN, an initiative to develop political dialogue with key actors from the region to identify common ground. </p>  <p>  Ireland is a strong and consistent donor to the Syria crisis response, and our funding supports those in most need inside Syria as well as Syrian refugees and vulnerable host communities in the region. In March 2019, Ireland pledged a further &euro;25m contribution to Syria and the region this year, bringing the total amount of humanitarian assistance committed to the Syria crisis to over &euro;143 million since 2012 &ndash; our largest ever response to any single crisis.

The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Karen Bradley, and I convened these talks in Belfast on 7 May.</p>  <p>  There has been constructive engagement in the process and it is clear that the parties want to see the institutions of the Agreement operating again on a sustainable basis. There has been broad consensus on some issues, but also key issues are still to be resolved.</p>  <p>  I and the Secretary of State believe that there is a genuine but narrow window of opportunity to reach agreement in the period immediately ahead and that it is essential to continue and intensify talks to this end.</p>  <p>  In their joint statement on 2 June, the Taoiseach and Prime Minister welcomed the constructive engagement in the process and underlined that it is imperative that the parties now move without delay to engaging substantively on the shape of a final agreement.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, the two Governments supported an intensification of the talks last week and there was engagement on outstanding issues by the leaders of the five political parties. Secretary of State Bradley and I are intensively engaged on behalf the two Governments in the talks at Stormont again this week, to encourage the party leaders to move towards a final agreement.</p>  <p>  Ultimately, it will be for the parties to rise to the challenge of finding an agreement. This will be difficult, but the two Governments believe that this can, and must, be achieved to get the devolved, power-sharing Assembly and Executive and the North South Ministerial Council functioning again. </p>  <p>  The Government will continue to do everything in its power, in accordance with its responsibilities as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, to secure the effective operation of all of its institutions.</p></reply>

However, final agreement regarding a civilian majority on a proposed 11-member Supreme Council was opposed by the Transitional Military Council, and negotiations stalled.   </p>  <p>  Shortly after dawn on 3 June, heavily armed security forces surrounded demonstrators and shot indiscriminately with live bullets and teargas. The official death toll is thought to considerably underestimate actual numbers killed.  The Transitional Military Council later stated that the raid targeted criminals amongst the demonstrators, a claim refuted by the Declaration of Freedom and Change, a broad coalition of opposition parties and the major force behind the protests. </p>  <p>  The Transitional Military Council announced that it was cancelling all agreements with the Declaration of Freedom and Change, saying it would move ahead with elections to be held within nine months. Demonstrators demand a longer period to guarantee fair elections.</p>  <p>  On 3 June, EU High Representative Mogherini issued a statement declaring that there can be no justification for the use of force to disperse peaceful protests, and that the Transitional Military Council is accountable for security and rule of law in the country, with a responsibility to act with restraint. The  T&aacute;naiste has endorsed this statement and has also strongly condemned the use of violence and excessive force against protestors.  </p>  <p>  On 6 June, the African Union decided with immediate effect to suspend Sudan from participation in all African Union activities until the effective establishment of a civilian-led transitional authority.  This followed sustained, but ultimately unsuccessful, engagement with Sudan in the weeks since the Transitional Military Council seized control, to encourage them to restore constitutional order.  </p>  <p>  My officials continue to actively monitor developments in Sudan, through the Embassy of Ireland in Nairobi, which has responsibility for Sudan, and through the European Union delegation in Khartoum.  Ireland continues to respond to on-going humanitarian needs in Sudan through the provision of humanitarian funding, with almost &euro;29 million provided through our UN, NGO and Red Cross partners since 2012.</p></reply>

All those in receipt of taxable income, including former civil servants, have benefited from these changes.</p>  <p>  Regarding tax credits, the Earned Income Tax Credit for self-employed persons and the Home Carer Tax Credit have also been increased in the last number of Budgets. Depending on their circumstances, former civil servants may have benefited from these increases.</p>  <p>  It is the Government&rsquo;s position that earners start to pay the marginal rate of income tax at too low a level and we are committed to reducing excessive tax rates for low and middle income earners while also keeping the tax base broad. It is expected that continued progress in this area will also be made in the context of limited resources available in Budget 2020, balanced against all of the competing demands.</p></reply>

Following a number of CJEU cases, Revenue issued a notice in mid-2011 that such admissions could no longer be treated as exempt and would be liable to VAT at the standard rate. On the following Budget night, my predecessor, Minister Noonan announced that he was going to make a change in the VAT treatment of admission fees and in Finance Act 2012, the second reduced rate (9%) was extended to open farms and built and natural heritage facilities.</p><p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that further to the notice issued in 2011 and Finance Act 2012, this change in the VAT treatment was publicised in the following ways:</p><p>- Finance Act 2012 Notes for Guidance for VAT, </p><p>- Revenue Tax Briefing (No. 1 of 2012), </p><p>- VAT leaflet on the VAT treatment of Entrance fees to Historic Houses and Gardens and certain other admissions to, and rights over, property, and</p><p>- The VAT rates database available on Revenue&rsquo;s website.</p><p>I am further advised that the 2012 Notes for Guidance and the 2012 Tax Briefing remain available in the Historic Material section of Revenue&rsquo;s website and the current guidance for these services is set out in the VAT rates database.</p><p>Since 1 January 2019, these services are liable to the reduced rate (13.5%) as is the case with similar tourism related services.</p></reply>

The report put forward options for further consideration, rather than recommendations, and any further consideration would require the participation of several Departments and organisations, including my own Department. The ten options are split into short, medium and long-term options. Five potential short-term options were identified as measures which could potentially be implemented within 18 months, i.e. within Budgets 2018 and 2019.</p>  <p>  One short-term option was to increase the mortgage interest deduction available to landlords.  In this context, it should be noted that in Budget 2017, a phased unwinding of the restriction on interest deductibility over five years for all residential landlords was initiated. The second step, an increase from 80% to 85% deductibility, took effect from 1 January 2018.  Budget 2019 accelerated progress in this area and, from 1 January 2019, the restoration of full mortgage interest deductibility for landlords of residential property has been in place. </p>  <p>  A further option was to consider introducing Local Property Tax (LPT) deductibility for landlords. Earlier this year, the report of the interdepartmental review of LPT noted that LPT is a relatively small expense and therefore is unlikely to make a significant difference to the position of any individual landlord in cash terms and so may not be regarded by landlords as a sufficient measure to encourage them to stay in or enter the rental market. The report also found that the measure would also have a deadweight cost in respect of landlords who do not intend to leave the rental market and would create a more favourable position for landlords of property compared to owner-occupiers, as owner-occupiers cannot claim a tax deduction for LPT. </p>  <p>  In Budget 2018 I introduced another of the short-term options, deductibility for pre-letting expenditure for previously vacant properties. This measure applies to residential premises which have been vacant for at least 12 months and which are then let after the date of the passing of the Finance Act 2017, i.e. after 25 December 2017. The expenditure is allowed as a deduction against rental income from that premises. It applies to expenses that would be allowable if they had been incurred while the property was let, such as the cost of repairs, insurance, maintenance and management of the property.  Certain limitations are in place regarding this measure, for example the expenditure must have been incurred in the 12 months before the premises is let as a residential premises.  The total deduction allowed is capped at &euro;5,000 per vacant premises and the deduction will be clawed-back if the property ceases to be let as a residential premises within four years of the first letting. I prioritised this option as it was specifically designed to encourage an overall increase in housing supply by bringing currently vacant property back into residential use.</p>  <p>  The final short-term option was to improve the collection and sharing of data on the rental accommodation sector.  A significant issue that hampered the progress of the Working Group was a lack of robust data on various elements of the housing market, due to the differing metrics used by the various agencies. The Housing Analytics Group, chaired by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, is currently active and a number of Departments and agencies are involved in its work, including the Residential Tenancies Board, the Central Statistics Office (CSO), Revenue and the Department of Finance. </p>  <p>  Five of the options put forward in the report were medium-term and long-term options. Medium-term options are measures which work with the current tax system but might take longer to develop and implement, and as such would require a longer lead-in period. The long-term options look at the potential for more fundamental changes to the tax system, and so would require significantly greater resource commitments to progress.  Consideration of these options will continue within the relevant time frames.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, taxation is only one of the policy levers available to the Government through which to boost rental and overall housing supply and that, in line with the Tax Expenditure Guidelines, consideration of whether a tax measure is the most appropriate policy tool for a given purpose would be required. Ireland&rsquo;s past experience with tax incentives in the housing sector strongly suggests the need for a cautionary stance when considering intervention in the rental sector. There are many competing priorities which must be considered when deciding which policy measures to introduce and the rental sector is just one of many other sectors that may require assistance and intervention.</p></reply>

The Regulations introduced on 1 January 2016 also provided that credit unions could apply to the Central Bank to retain individual members&rsquo; savings in excess of &euro;100,000, which were held at commencement of the Regulations and that credit unions with total assets in excess of &euro;100 million can apply to the Central Bank for approval to increase individual member savings in excess of &euro;100,000.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank developed an application processes to facilitate credit unions in seeking the two types of approvals outlined above. As provided for in the Regulations, in order for approval to be granted an applicant credit union must have demonstrated that the granting of such approval is consistent with the adequate protection of the savings of members and effective and proportionate regulation having regard to the nature, scale and complexity of the credit union. The submission deadline for applications to retain savings in excess of &euro;100,000 was 27 June 2016. The application form to increase savings in excess of &euro;100,000 does not have a submission deadline and will be accepted from individual credit unions with assets over &euro;100 million on an ongoing basis.</p>  <p>  In the feedback statement to CP88 the Central Bank also committed to undertaking a review of the continued appropriateness of the savings limit within three years of the introduction of the 2016 Regulations. The Central Bank envisages that it will commence such a review by year end 2019.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy might also wish to note that in line with Programme for a Partnership Government commitments, the Department of Finance requested the Central Bank to review the continued appropriateness of the savings limits on Credit Union members, and additionally following engagement the Central Bank accepted Department of Finance observations regarding simplification of the application process to retain Credit Union members&rsquo; savings in excess of &euro;100,000.</p></reply>

It has revealed the unacceptable damage that misconduct can cause to consumers up to and including the loss of their homes and properties in some cases. To this end there has been &euro;665 million of redress and compensation issued to customers at end February 2019.</p>  <p>  In order to deter financial misconduct and promote compliance and high standards in financial services, the regulator&rsquo;s overall strategy has been to take firm enforcement action. The record fine issued to PTSB recently illustrates this.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank of Ireland has markedly changed its approach to banking supervision since the crisis. This new approach can be seen through, for example, the Central Bank Reform Act 2010, the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 and the European Single Supervisory Mechanism. To further support the work and power of the regulator, I am bringing forward the Central Bank (amendment) Bill which will introduce an advanced Senior Executive Accountability Regime (SEAR) which will, in tandem with new enhancements to the fitness and probity regime, help prevent something like the mortgage tracker issue happening again. </p>  <p>  I would remind the Deputy that as Minister for Finance there are strict rules around how I can intervene even in banks in which the State has a shareholding. The day to day operations of the banks are the sole responsibility of the boards and management teams and each bank must be run on an independent and commercial basis. The banks&rsquo; independence is protected by Relationship Frameworks which are legally binding documents that cannot be changed unilaterally. These frameworks, which are publicly available, were insisted upon by the European Commission to protect competition in the Irish market. </p>  <p>However as indicated this Government has firmly supported the work of the Central Bank of Ireland. This group of customers (often referred to as the &lsquo;prevailing rate group&rsquo;) has, directly as a result of the Central Bank&rsquo;s intervention, been included in the Tracker Mortgage Examination and has the benefit of the option to appeal or utilise any other options available to them (such as an appeal to the FSPO or independent legal action).  Speaking to the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and the Taoiseach on 26 March, Director General, Financial Conduct of the Central Bank, Derville Rowland confirmed that the Central Bank took the 'strongest reasonable approach' to the issue. It did not just look at the contract it also looked at the transparency requirements, the factors which pertained at the time the customers entered into the contract but could not challenge the interpretation of AIB further.</p></reply>

To qualify for a Primary Medical Certificate, an applicant must satisfy one of the following conditions:</p><p>- be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs;</p><p>- be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs;</p><p>- be without both hands or without both arms;</p><p>- be without one or both legs;</p><p>- be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg;</p><p>- have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.</p><p>The Scheme represents a significant tax expenditure. Between the Vehicle Registration Tax and VAT foregone, and the fuel grant, the scheme cost &euro;65m in each of 2016 and 2017, rising to &euro;70m in 2018. This figure does not include the revenue foregone in respect of the relief from Motor Tax provided to members of the Scheme.  </p><p>I understand and fully sympathise with any person who suffers from a serious physical disability and can&rsquo;t access the scheme under the current criteria.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-06-11a.328.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019061100065#WRH00500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 160 and 171 together.</p>  <p>  At the outset, the Deputy should note that I am responsible for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation.  Neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  Consequently, I am not in a position to direct insurance companies as to the price or the level of cover to be provided to consumers or businesses.  The Deputy will appreciate that I, as Minister for Finance, cannot comment on individual cases mentioned in the details supplied relating to insurance matters.</p>  <p>  However, I acknowledge the problems faced by many small businesses and voluntary/community associations in relation to the cost and availability of insurance as well as the frustrations that some may have with the pace of reform.  Unfortunately, there is no single policy or legislative &ldquo;silver bullet&rdquo; to immediately stem or reverse premium price rises.  This is because there are many constraints faced by the Government in trying to address this issue in particular the fact that  for constitutional reasons, it cannot direct the courts as to the award levels that should be applied and for legal reasons it cannot direct insurance companies as to the pricing level which they should apply in respect of businesses seeking insurance.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, I wish to re-emphasise how important this issue is for the Government. Consequently, following the publication of its Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance in 2017, the Cost of Insurance Working Group undertook an examination of the employer liability and public liability insurance sectors.  This second phase culminated in the publication in January 2018 of the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance.  I believe there has been significant progress in the implementation of the two CIWG Reports. Examples include the following:</p>  <p>  - the establishment of the Personal Injuries Commission, and its subsequent recommendations relating to addressing award levels for soft tissue injuries &ndash; this has provided the objective evidence we need to be able to address award levels;</p>  <p>  - the establishment of the National Claims Information Database in the Central Bank to increase transparency around the future cost of private motor insurance; the Central Bank is currently reviewing the possibility of expanding is scope to cover business insurance;</p>  <p>  - reforms to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board through the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (Amendment) Act 2019;</p>  <p>  - amendments to Sections 8 and 14 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 to make it easier for businesses and insurers to challenge cases where fraud or exaggeration is suspected;</p>  <p>  - the reform of the Insurance Compensation Fund to provide certainty to policyholders and insurers; and,</p>  <p>  - various reforms of how fraud is reported to and dealt with by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including increased co-ordination with the insurance industry, as well as the launch recently of Operation Coatee, a co-ordinated operation to tackle insurance fraud.</p>  <p>  I believe that these reforms are having a significant impact with regard to private motor insurance (CSO figures from April 2019 show that the price of motor insurance is now 24.4% lower than the July 2016 peak).  The Government is determined to continue working to ensure that these positive pricing trends can be extended to other forms of insurance, including those relevant to businesses.</p>  <p>  Undoubtedly the single most essential challenge which must be overcome if there is to be a sustainable reduction in insurance costs particularly for small businesses is to bring the levels of personal injury damages awarded in this country more in line with those awarded in other jurisdictions.  In this regard, the Personal Injuries Commission has highlighted the significant differential between award levels in Ireland and other jurisdictions, and has made a number of recommendations to address this issue, in particular the establishment of a Judicial Council to compile guidelines for appropriate general damages for various types of personal injury.  Both I and Minister of State D'Arcy believe that this awards gap needs to be significantly closed and we are working with the Minister for Justice and Equality, Mr Charlie Flanagan TD, to ensure that this happens at the earliest opportunity.</p>  <p>  Finally, I would like to assure the Deputy that the Cost of Insurance Working Group will continue to focus on implementing the recommendations of the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance in parallel with implementing those from the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance.  I am hopeful that the cumulative effects of the completion of the two Reports' recommendations will include increased stability in the pricing of insurance for businesses and a more competitive insurance market.</p>  <p>  In addition, you should note that Insurance Ireland operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to obtaining insurance.  Insurance Ireland can be contacted at feedback@insuranceireland.eu or 01-6761914.</p></reply>

The report concluded that there is not a compelling case for the State to establish a new local public banking system based on the German Sparkassen model in Ireland.</p>  <p>  However, a commitment was given in the report that my Department would arrange for an independent evaluation to consider how the objectives of community banking and how the local provision of banking and financial services could be furthered through other delivery mechanisms as well as continuing ongoing engagement with stakeholders and interested parties on this issue.</p>  <p>Following a procurement process, Indecon International Economic Consultants have been appointed to carry out this independent economic evaluation and run a stakeholder engagement forum.  Work on the independent evaluation is underway and a stakeholder forum was held on 28 May 2019.</p>  <p>  The purpose of this stakeholder forum was to obtain a better understanding of potential alternative models, as well as any gaps in or lack of such services that may exist.  It provided an opportunity for stakeholders and interested parties to share their experiences, views, ideas and suggestions in relation to community banking and the local provisions of banking and financial services including ways to improve and further these services for the benefit of local, rural and regional communities and businesses.</p>  <p>  Indecon will prepare a report on the economic evaluation and the work of the stakeholder forum.  The findings and recommendations of this report will inform any future policy action taken by my Department in order to better support local access to banking and financial services and access to finance by small businesses.</p></reply>

I would like to advise the Deputy that there are no property related tax incentives for investment funds.</p><p>Irish collective investment vehicles which are authorised and regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland are taxed under the gross roll-up regime.  This means that the investment undertaking is generally exempt from tax on the profits it earns on behalf of its unit holders.  The profits are allowed to grow on a tax free basis within the fund and are taxed at the level of the investor rather than the fund, as is standard international practice. Investment Undertaking Tax (&ldquo;IUT&rdquo;) is deducted at source by the investment undertaking and paid over to Revenue on behalf of the unitholder.  In general, IUT does not apply to non-resident investors provided the relevant declarations are in place with the investment undertaking.</p><p>Finance Act 2016 introduced the Irish Real Estate Funds (IREF) regime in response to concerns raised regarding the use of certain collective investment vehicles to invest in Irish property.  The investors had been using the structures to minimise their exposure to Irish tax on Irish property transactions.  IREFs are collective investment undertakings where 25% or more of the value of their assets is derived from real estate in the State.  Unit holders in the Irish Real Estate Fund are subject to IREF withholding tax at a rate of 20% on payments made to them by the Irish Real Estate Fund.  As with IUT, the IREF withholding tax is deducted by the Irish Real Estate Fund and paid to Revenue on behalf of the unit holder.  Unlike IUT, non-resident unit holders are also subject to IREF withholding tax.  In some circumstances the non-resident can make a claim to Revenue that the IREF withholding tax can be reduced under the terms of a double taxation treaty.  However, if a unit holder in an Irish Real Estate Fund holds more than 10% of the assets of the Irish Real Estate Fund, any payment from the Irish Real Estate Fund will be regarded as from immovable property and the IREF withholding tax deducted can not be reduced.  This contrasts with the gross roll-up regime where non-residents are exempt from exit tax entirely.</p><p>For both the gross roll-up regime and the IREF regime certain categories of investors such as pensions schemes, companies carrying on life business and charities are exempt from IUT and IREF withholding tax provided the appropriate declarations are in place.  This exemption is provided for as these categories of investor are more generally tax exempt.</p><p>In addition to the above and in the context of the question asked by the Deputy it may be appropriate to include commentary on the Real Estate Investment Trusts (&ldquo;REITs&rdquo;) regime.  While REITs must be Plcs which are listed on the main exchange of an EEA Member State, the Central Bank of Ireland requires that they have an Alternative Investment Fund Manager (&ldquo;AIFMs&rdquo;).  REITs are used as collective investment vehicles to invest in Irish rental property assets.  While they are not generally, in tax terms, described as funds, they are collective investment vehicles which are subject to Central Bank regulation and supervision and therefore may be within the scope of the Deputy&rsquo;s question.  The function of the REIT framework is not to provide an overall tax exemption, but rather to facilitate collective investment in rental property by removing a double layer of taxation which would otherwise apply to property investment via a corporate vehicle.  Subject to various conditions, REITs are exempt from tax in respect of their property rental business, subject to a requirement to distribute profits annually for taxation at the level of the investors.  This distribution is subject to Dividend Withholding Tax (&ldquo;DWT&rdquo;) at 20%.</p><p>In relation to the Deputy's question on annual tax yields, I am advised by Revenue that it is not possible to separately identify investment funds holding property or property related assets or holding shares and units in property or property related assets.  However, the aggregate amounts of taxes paid by entities of this type, including tax paid by Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) and Irish Real Estate Funds (IREFs), are provided under &lsquo;Financial &amp;amp; Insurance activities&rsquo; in the &lsquo;Revenue Net Receipts by Sector&rsquo; information available at link: <i></i>.</p><p>The Deputy may be interested to note that the amount of IREF withholding tax in 2018 was &euro;9m, while net Dividend Withholding Tax amounting to &euro;11.8m in 2017 and &euro;12.8m in 2018 was collected in respect of dividends paid by REITs.</p><p>I refer now to the Deputy's questions regarding the value of investments in property or property related assets located in Ireland held by investment funds, domiciled in both the State and abroad.</p><p>I am advised by Revenue that it is not possible to identify the value of investments in property or property related assets held by investment funds domiciled in the State from the information filed with Revenue. </p><p>In respect of Irish Real Estate Funds (IREFs), only partial information is available from the IREF tax returns filed with Revenue for the years 2017 and 2018.  In this regard, IREFs are required to file an IREF tax return only where they have a taxable event in a particular year and therefore not all IREFs will have made returns for these years.  IREFs, were required by regulation to file annual financial statements on or before 30 January 2019 with Revenue for accounting periods which ended during 2017 and accounting periods which ended on or before 30 June 2018.  The information contained on the financial statements is currently being reviewed and analysed by Revenue.  Once this analysis is completed, Revenue will be in a position to provide more detail on the value of Irish real estate held by IREFs.</p><p>Irish domiciled funds are all treated as &ldquo;investment undertakings&rdquo; under the TCA 1997.  Revenue collects annual financial statements from IREFs (being the Irish domiciled funds that had significant exposure to Irish property) but it does not collect the same data for non-domiciled investment funds.</p><p>A small number of non-domiciled funds may be indirectly investing in Irish property.  This matter is currently receiving attention in Revenue, and any Exchequer exposure is being kept under review.  Funds are described as non-domiciled in Ireland if they are administered here but subject to regulation by a regulator other than the Central Bank of Ireland, e.g. they are regulated in the UK.</p><p>Non-domiciled funds are, under the Tax Consolidation Act 1997, treated in the same manner as any other non-resident taxpayer when it comes to charges to tax in relation to Irish property.  While section 1035A and section 747G both provide that a non-domiciled fund will not be treated as having a taxable presence in Ireland by virtue of fund management services provided by an independent agent, they do not dis-apply the standard Irish property charging provisions (e.g. s.29 for CGT).  Therefore, if a non-domiciled fund has Irish property, or an interest in Irish property (for example through a shareholding in a non-resident Property Company), it will be subject to Irish tax on its profits or gains in the same way as any other non-resident, depending on the relevant double tax agreements that may be applied.</p></reply>

This Group included representatives from the Department of Finance, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, amongst other public and private bodies.  The Code of Practice is for guidance only and the employment status of an individual in relation to an engagement may in some instances fall to be determined by the Courts.</p><p>The question of whether an individual is engaged under a contract of service (an employee) or a contract for service (self-employed/partner) is a question of fact and general law.  To make a determination on employment or self-employment status the full terms of the contract and the circumstances in which it was made must be established.</p><p>In the case of share fishermen and women, the High Court has determined on a number of occasions that share fishermen and women were not employees but had a relationship with the boat owner or skipper in the nature of a partnership.  There are complex issues around the nature of this relationship, including the application of partnership law and capital allowances.  Revenue has published a Tax and Duty Manual (TDM 04-01-11) which outlines some of the issues that may arise. This is available at the link: <i></i>.</p><p>Under Part 41A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, a chargeable person (self-employed taxpayer) is required to submit a tax return to Revenue by 31 October in the year following the tax year to which the return relates (or by mid-November, if paying and filing through ROS) and to pay any balance of the liability (net of preliminary tax paid) in respect of income tax, USC and PRSI for the year to the Collector-General at the same time.  In effect, a self-employed individual discharges the combined income tax, USC and PRSI liability through the self-assessment system.</p><p>Where an individual is an employee, his or her salary or wages is chargeable to income tax under Schedule E and is subject to deductions under the PAYE system by his or her employer.  Emoluments is the term used to describe any remuneration assessable to tax under Schedule E. Part 42 Chapter 4 TCA 1997 imposes a legal obligation on employers to make deductions at source under the PAYE system from the payment of emoluments to an employee.  The employer is obliged to pay a PRSI contribution for employees under the PAYE system.  This employer contribution is paid for employees whose employment is insurable under the Social Welfare Acts.</p></reply>

I have no role in the day to day workings of the office or in the decisions which he takes.  </p>  <p>  One of the main roles of the Ombudsman is to investigate, mediate and adjudicate complaints about the conduct of financial or pension service providers.  The FSPO was established to provide an alternative to the Courts for consumers who have unresolved disputes with a financial or pension service provider and all investigations by the Ombudsman are free of charge to the consumer.  Subject only to an appeal to the High Court, a finding of the Ombudsman in respect of a complaint is legally binding on all parties.</p>  <p>  On the issue more generally, the Office of the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO) was established on 1 January 2018 to resolve complaints from consumers, including small businesses and other organisations, against financial service or pension providers.  The establishment of the FSPO resulted from the merger of the Office of the Pensions Ombudsman and the Financial Services Ombudsman&rsquo;s Bureau.</p>  <p>  In March 2019, the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman published an &ldquo;Overview of Complaints&rdquo; which provided a summary of the 5,588 eligible complaints made to the FSPO in 2018, its first year of operations.  While acknowledging the successful closure of 4,443 complaints in 2018, this report confirms that the volume of complaints received caused the FSPO to be unable to process complaints as quickly as it would wish to and a main priority for 2019 would be to improve the timeliness of its service and deliver faster resolution of complaints.</p>  <p>  A Workforce Plan for the period 2019 to 2023 was submitted to my Department in December 2018, which included an objective analysis of the level of resources currently available to the FSPO against both current and future demand for its services.  The Workforce Plan aimed to address the large existing caseload of 3,187 complaints which the Office inherited on 01 January 2018, along with the sustained pattern of increased demand which the office continues to experience. </p>  <p>  I approved a substantial increase in staff in the FSPO of 35 additional position and the Ombudsman has informed me that recruitment campaigns are currently ongoing.  Such additional resources will allow the FSPO to deliver a better faster service for its customers, keep pace with the speed of change, tackle existing waiting times, and deliver the objectives in its Strategic Plan 2018 &ndash; 2021.</p></reply>

These regulations were introduced on 1 January 2016 following a detailed consultation process with the sector (Central Bank Consultation Paper 88).  The Investment Regulations have since been amended with effect from 1 March 2018 following public consultation (Consultation Paper 109) and revised Lending Regulations will be introduced later this year following a consultation process which closed in February this year (Consultation Paper 125).</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be interested to note that, following a policy paper it published in December 2017, the Credit Union Advisory Committee (CUAC) proposed that credit unions should be permitted to charge an interest rate on loans greater than the present ceiling of 1% per month.  The CUAC recommendation proposed that this ceiling be raised to 2% per month.  This amendment would provide credit unions with greater flexibility to risk price loan products and in so doing may create an opportunity for new product offerings.  This recommendation from the CUAC followed a survey of the credit union sector which received responses from 117 credit unions.</p>  <p>  The CUAC Implementation Group considered this proposal and agreed in principle to recommend that the Minister raise the interest rate ceiling to 2% per month, and for flexibility to be introduced to allow the interest rate to be amended in future by Statutory Instrument following consultation with the Central Bank and CUAC.  This proposal will be considered by Government shortly.</p></reply>

Under these Relationship Frameworks, the relevant banks are required to consult with the Minister as part of any loan sale being proposed.  This consultation process does not require input from the Central Bank of Ireland.</p>  <p>  I have been advised by the Central Bank of Ireland that Provision 3.11 of the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 (&ldquo;the Code&rdquo;) requires that, where a regulated lender intends to transfer all or part of its &lsquo;regulated activities&rsquo; to another regulated entity, it must provide advance notification to both the Central Bank and affected consumers.  Specifically, a lender must provide a consumer with at least 2 months&rsquo; notice before transferring all or part of its loan book covered by the Code to another person. </p>  <p>  Most loan agreements include a clause that allows the original lender to sell the loan on to another firm, regardless of whether the loan is classified as performing or non-performing. </p>  <p>  When a loan is sold on to another regulated entity, the relevant Irish and EU consumer protections continue to apply.  Under the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2018, which came into effect on 21 January 2019, if a loan is transferred, the holder of the legal title to the credit must now be authorised by the Central Bank as a credit servicing firm.  Such credit servicing firms must act in accordance with Irish financial services law that applies to &lsquo;regulated financial service providers&rsquo;.</p>  <p>  If a borrowers&rsquo; mortgage protection policy and/or home insurance policy was obtained through the original lender, and is thus part of the lender&rsquo;s group insurance scheme, such policies may be impacted if the mortgage is transferred to a new loan owner, either as a result of switching mortgage providers or a loan sale.</p></reply>

It is important that Member States should prioritise investment needs and address bottlenecks and reforms with the aim of improving sustainable and inclusive growth.</p>  <p>  In this regard I welcome the publication of the European Commission&rsquo;s Country Specific Recommendations for Ireland.  While one of these recommendations calls on Ireland to continue to take action on addressing aggressive tax planning, it is notable that Commissioner Moscovici has publically acknowledged that we are on the right track and encouraged us to continue in this direction.</p>  <p>  Ireland's actions in recent years have demonstrated our clear commitment to taking action to address aggressive tax planning.  Ireland&rsquo;s Corporation Tax Roadmap, which was published last September, set out a clear range of actions which Ireland is taking on corporate tax reform.  Significant actions have already been taken on foot on the Roadmap including the introduction of Controlled Foreign Company rules, amendments to Ireland&rsquo;s exit tax rules, and the prompt ratification of the BEPS Multilateral Instrument.</p>  <p>  As set out in the Roadmap, further actions will be taken in Finance Bill 2019 including the amendment of Ireland&rsquo;s transfer pricing rules and the introduction of anti-hybrid rules. </p>  <p>  As a very open economy which serves as a key European base for a significant number of non-EU headquartered multinational companies, it is to be fully expected that Ireland would have a higher percentage of outbound royalty payments than other Member States.  Concerns about outbound payments are justified in circumstances where the relevant profits should in fact be taxed in the EU or where the profits are ultimately being untaxed (either in the recipient or parent jurisdiction).  It is my belief that neither of these concerns should arise in respect of outbound payments from Ireland.</p>  <p>  The international consensus reached during the BEPS project is that profits should be taxed where the &lsquo;DEMPE&rsquo; functions occur.  To the extent where DEMPE functions occur within the EU, Member States have the ability to tax the profits attributable to those functions within their jurisdiction under the international corporation tax framework.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the overwhelming majority of the outbound payments made from Ireland are made by companies which are ultimately owned by companies resident and taxable in the United States.  It is my understanding that reforms introduced by the US in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2017 should make it impossible for any such royalties to avoid tax in the US even if they are not paid to the US directly and are not taxed in the recipient jurisdiction.</p>  <p>  For these reasons I believe that the actions set out in the Roadmap are appropriate with regard to addressing aggressive tax planning but, as always, I will continue to keep the situation under review and shall act accordingly as circumstances demand.</p>  <p>  Ireland is fully committed to addressing the challenges that have arisen from the digitalisation of the world economy and we will continue to contribute positively to the discussion at both EU and OECD level in pursuit of a stable, and globally agreed international tax framework which is vital to facilitate cross border trade and investment.</p></reply>

Under this Directive, Member States are obliged to exempt certain fuels used for commercial aviation purposes from excise duty.  The scope of this exemption must include jet fuel (which is the most commonly used heavy oil in air navigation) and must encompass such fuel used for intra-Community and international air transport purposes.  A Member State may waive this exemption where it has entered into a bilateral agreement with another Member State to tax fuel for intra-community flights.  With regard to fuel for international transport, the scope for a Member State to take a unilateral approach to taxation is limited by international law and a range of bilateral and multilateral agreements that operate under 1944 Convention on International Civil Aviation (known as the Chicago Convention). </p><p>Member States may opt to exempt or partially exempt other fuels used for commercial air navigation from excise duty and may also opt to fully or partially exempt fuels used for domestic commercial aviation.</p><p>In line with Article 14 of the Energy Tax Directive, Ireland&rsquo;s Mineral Oil Tax (MOT) legislation, set out in Finance Act 1999, provides for jet fuel used for commercial aviation purposes to be exempted from excise duty.  This exemption covers both domestic and international commercial aviation. In addition, Finance Act 1999 provides for a partial relief from excise duty for light oil (aviation gasoline) used for commercial aviation.  Again, there is no distinction in national legislation between domestic and international commercial aviation in the operation of the partial relief.</p><p>The following table summarises the mandatory exemptions and excise duty measures for aviation fuels required under Article 14 of the Energy Tax Directive. It also summarises the MOT treatment of such fuels used for air navigation as set out in national legislation.<table><tr><th>Aviation Fuel/Use</th><th>Energy Tax   Directive</th><th>Finance Act 1999</th></tr><tr><td>Light oil (aviation gasoline) used for domestic commercial aviation </td><td>No mandatory tax exemption, Member States may opt to exempt or partially exempt</td><td>Partial relief from MOT, effective rate of &euro;355.44 per 1,000 litres (section 97B Finance Act 1999)</td></tr><tr><td>Light oil (aviation gasoline) used for   intra-Community/international commercial aviation</td><td>No mandatory tax exemption, Member States may opt to   exempt or partially exempt</td><td>Partial relief from MOT, effective rate of &euro;355.44 per 1,000 litres    (section 97B Finance Act 1999)</td></tr><tr><td>Light oil (aviation gasoline) used for private pleasure flying</td><td>Mandatory taxation</td><td>Full MOT rate of &euro;587.71 per 1,000 litres (section 96   Finance Act 1999)</td></tr><tr><td>Heavy oil (jet fuel) used for domestic commercial aviation</td><td>No mandatory tax exemption, Member States may opt to   exempt or partially exempt</td><td>Full exemption<br /><br />(section 100(2)(b) Finance Act 1999)</td></tr><tr><td>Heavy oil (jet fuel) used for used for   intra-Community/international commercial aviation</td><td>Mandatory tax exemption, except where bilateral arrangement entered into with another Member State</td><td>Full exemption<br /><br />(section 100(2)(b) Finance Act 1999)</td></tr><tr><td>Heavy oil (jet fuel) used for private pleasure flying</td><td>Mandatory taxation</td><td>Full MOT rate of &euro;479.02 per 1,000 litres<br /><br />(section 100(2)(b) Finance Act 1999)</td></tr></table></p><p>It is important to note that the tax exemption for heavy oil (jet fuel) used for air navigation for international and intra-Community transport purposes is mandatory, except where a bilateral arrangement to tax fuel for intra-community air navigation is entered into with another Member State.  This option has not been taken up by Member States to date as any such bilateral agreement would raise significant legal and competition issues in the event that aircraft operators registered in a non EU country also operated on a route between the Member States which were a party to the bilateral agreement.  As such, any material changes to the current tax regime would likely require a major revision of the Energy Tax Directive in order to deliver the necessary legal certainty and to ensure a level playing field between airline operators and between Member States.  This would be contingent on developments at international level as the EU regime on taxation of aviation fuels is based on the provisions of the Chicago Convention. </p><p>I am advised that consumption data required to estimate revenue that would be accrued if excise duty on aviation fuel was ended is not readily available.  Revenue will examine the issues further and will contact the Deputy directly in that regard.</p></reply>

While the proposed project for Buncrana is not in the first tranche of projects to be advanced, both the OPW and Donegal County Council will work closely to ensure that the project will be progressed as early as possible in the coming years and within the 10 year timeframe for the programme of investment.</p></reply>

The OPW advised the Council that the application could not be approved because the proposal did not meet certain criteria, including the cost benefit criteria, of the scheme.  The Council was also advised that it may be more appropriate for it to seek funding for a detailed coastal erosion and flood risk management study to better understand the coastal processes involved in the wider region and to inform any further applications for funding for works. No further application has been received to date. </p><p>In March 2016 the OPW approved funding of &euro;450,000 to Wicklow County Council to carry out emergency coastal protection works at the Murrough in Wicklow town.

The purpose of this review was to identify areas for potential future enhancement of the Phoenix Park that would improve the visitor experience for all users. It was developed with reference to the core principles of the &lsquo;Conservation Management Plan for the Phoenix Park&rsquo;, which remains unchanged by this process. </p>  <p>  It should be emphasised that the draft review is not a formal development plan or strategy for the Phoenix Park. It is not part of a formal statutory process of any kind. The OPW ensures at all times that it complies in full with all Directives including Article 6(3) of the Habitat's Directive as it applies to the Phoenix Park and this has been taken as a given in undertaking the review.</p>  <p>   The Draft Review was on public display for ten weeks in order to facilitate observations and comments from the public. It was considered that the Phoenix Park Visitor Centre was the best, most centrally located, venue for a public exhibition of information in respect of the Draft Phoenix Park Visitor Experience Strategic Review.  The full Draft Review and an executive summary were also available to view at the Visitor Centre. For those who were not in a position to view the exhibition in person, a comprehensive Executive Summary of the Report and a pdf of all the exhibition panels has been available for download from the Phoenix Park website.  Libraries, community groups, residents associations, schools, sporting bodies, charities and all other interested parties can still download this material for free and share with their members. OPW remains open to, and indeed welcomes, any further observations and comments from any party. The executive summary and detailed information panels were created to provide a clear summation of the key elements of the draft review with which it was hoped that the public would engage. It was believed that this would assist the public in considering the core findings and the ideas proposed in the draft review.</p>  <p>  Following a review of the observations and comments received from the public, the OPW will consider how best to advance a strategy of enhancement of visitor experience in the Phoenix Park. Any conservation projects or proposed developments arising from this draft review will be subject to the necessary regulatory and legislative requirements and go through the full planning permission process where necessary.</p></reply>

The period for observations was extended and concluded on the 29th May 2019 resulting in a ten-week period for observations.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that this document is not a formal strategic or statutory document for the Phoenix Park nor is it a development plan. It is an independent review of visitor experience at the Phoenix Park which makes suggestions as to how visitor experience could be enhanced in the future. OPW was seeking the public's observations on the main ideas in the independent Review but it must be emphasised that these are nothing more than ideas at this stage. Therefore, there are no screening determinations associated with such a report.

However, I would note in that regard that while I have administrative responsibility for the Civil Service Pension Schemes, I exercise a central policy/authorisation role in relation to all other public service pension schemes. </p>  <p>  I will comment on the general point raised by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  Public servants who retired from March 2012 onwards had the FEMPI (No. 2) Act 2009 pay reductions reflected in the salary rates that were used to calculate their pension benefits. However, in accordance with the protection known as the second 'grace period', they did not have the FEMPI 2013 reductions (imposed on 1 July 2013 on public servants on annual remuneration above &euro;65,000) so reflected, even if those reductions were imposed on their salaries while serving. Accordingly, for a public servant who retired after implementation of the FEMPI 2013 pay reductions (assuming he or she was affected by those reductions), his or her retirement pension and lump sum were calculated not on the basis of the lower salary rates in payment to serving employees at the date of his or her retirement but on the salary rates in payment on 1 January 2010.</p>  <p>  Section 6.2 of the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018 - 2020 (PSSA) committed the Government to adopting an equitable approach to various public service pensioner cohorts differentiated by date of retirement, in the context of the resumption of pay parity for the duration of the PSSA. </p>  <p>  Thus, for public servants retiring from 1 March 2012 onwards, to the extent that they retired on FEMPI reduced salaries when compared with public servants who retired from the same grade/payscale point before that date, they will receive, for the duration of the PSSA, pension increases in line with the pay increases due to their peers currently in employment. </p>  <p>  In accordance with normal public service pension arrangements, retirement lump sums are calculated on the rates of salary that a public servant is in receipt of at time of retirement (with the exception of the 'grace period' protection I have described above). There is no provision to review historical retirement lump sum payments in the context of the unwinding of FEMPI.</p></reply>

Alternatively, they may choose not to opt for the new course and may instead continue to use existing courses or choose other approaches to meet the requirements in this area. Schools may also decide to provide the PE short course in addition to their existing programmes. Circular 0079/2018, Arrangements for the Implementation of the Framework for Junior Cycle, states that schools should provide a minimum of 135 hours of PE spread across first, second and third year (i.e. the most common current allocation of PE provided by schools &ndash; two class periods per week).</p><p>The new short course in PE aims to develop students as knowledgeable, skilful and creative participants who are confident and competent to perform in a range of activities safely. The course aims to build students&rsquo; appreciation of the importance of health-enhancing and inclusive physical activity and a commitment to it now and in the future. </p><p>Senior Cycle</p><p>Under the current Rules and Programme for Secondary Schools, PE should form part of the curriculum. The syllabus in PE have been developed on the basis of a time allocation of two hours per week. In addition, the Department is currently working on two developments that will impact PE at senior cycle: </p><p>Leaving Certificate Physical Education</p><p>A new specification for Leaving Certificate Physical Education (LCPE) has been developed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment and approved by the Minister. This is a full subject that can be assessed as a Leaving Certificate subject in a manner similar to other subjects such as Maths and Irish. LCPE is currently being introduced on a phased basis to 64 schools nationally. The new subject will be available as a full (optional) subject to all post-primary schools from September 2020.<b></b></p><p>LCPE is designed to be taught in approximately 180 hours. It is recommended that of the five suggested class periods a week, a double period per week should be included to facilitate learners&rsquo; active participation in the three physical activities. </p><p>Senior Cycle Physical Education Framework</p><p>In addition to the specification for examinable LCPE at Senior Cycle, a Framework for Senior Cycle Physical Education (SCPE) has been designed to provide schools with a framework within which they can design a PE programme for those students who do not choose to take LCPE as part of their Leaving Certificate examination. </p><p>There are 40 post-primary schools participating in the phase 1 rollout of the Framework. The Framework is available now to all schools for their consideration in planning senior cycle PE. It will replace the guidelines set out in the Rules and Programmes for Secondary Schools which currently forms the basis for PE at senior cycle.</p><p>The Framework is designed to be taught over the two or three years of senior cycle education.  It is recommended that a double period or its equivalent per week is made available as a minimum requirement for teaching the Framework.</p></reply>

There are 91 schools in the C&amp;C and ETB Sector who meet this criteria, based on the information currently available to this Department. This is an initial step and has taken immediate effect.</p>  <p>  Schemes were initiated in 1978 and 1979 for the employment of Clerical Officers and Caretakers in schools.  The schemes were withdrawn completely in 2008.  </p>  <p>  These schemes have been superseded by the more extensive capitation grant schemes.  The current grant scheme was agreed in the context of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, published in 1991.  </p>  <p>  The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools now receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under these grant schemes.  It is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs. Where a school uses the grant funding for caretaking or secretarial purposes, any staff taken on to support those functions are employees of individual schools.  Specific responsibility for the pay and conditions rests with the school. </p>  <p>  On foot of a Chairman&rsquo;s Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department engaged with the Unions representing school secretaries and caretakers, including through an independent arbitration process in 2015. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for staff and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period.  This arbitration agreement covers the period up to 31 December 2019.  </p>  <p>  The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a Secretary or Caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration has from 1 January 2019, been paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay. </p>  <p>  Officials from my Department attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills on 9 April to discuss the status of non-teaching staff.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department recently had discussions with F&oacute;rsa trade union representatives as part of a planned meeting.  F&oacute;rsa took the opportunity to formally table a pay claim.  </p>  <p>  This was tabled as a follow-on claim from the current pay agreement for this cohort of staff which lasts until December 2019. The Department will seek to establish the full current cost of the trade union&rsquo;s claim. This is standard practice.</p>  <p>   F&oacute;rsa's claim will be fully considered once the current costings have been determined on completion of the survey.  The Department is fully open to having further dialogue with F&oacute;rsa once this work has been undertaken.</p></reply>

This decision is based a recommendation contained within a professional assessment in consultation with the National Council for Special Education (NCSE).</p><p>Students enrolling in specialised placements must have a report from a relevant professional or team of professionals stating that: </p><p>- S/he has a disability (in line with the designation of the special placement in question) and</p><p>- S/he has significant learning needs that require the support of a specialised setting and the reasons why this is the case.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has a statutory function to plan and co-ordinate the provision of education and support services to children with special educational needs including Autism, in consultation with the relevant education partners and the Health Service Executive (HSE). This includes the establishment of special class and special school placements in various geographical areas where there is an identified need.</p><p>Since 2011, the NCSE has increased the number of special classes from 548 in 2011 to 1,459 across the country now, of which 1,196 are Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) special classes.  Details of all special classes for children with special educational needs are available by county on the NCSE website <i>www.ncse.ie</i>.  </p><p>In Co. Kildare, there are currently 4 special schools and 75 special classes in mainstream schools, including 6 ASD Early Intervention classes, 46 primary ASD classes and 15 ASD post primary ASD classes.  </p><p>The NCSE has informed my Department that they intend to establish approx. 160 new ASD Special Classes nationally for 2019/20 school year to meet currently identified need.</p><p>In order to identify need in the area for forthcoming school years, the NCSE refer to professional reports indicating students require the support of a special class. In this regard Parents/Guardians of students with ASD seeking a special class placement should provide the relevant professional report to their local Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO) to inform the planning process. </p><p>Parents/guardians who may need advice or are experiencing difficulties in locating a school placement should contact their local SENO who can assist in identifying an appropriate educational placement for their child. Contact details are available on <i>www.ncse.ie</i>. </p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) published transitional guidelines for children with special needs. These wide-ranging and comprehensive guidelines provide advice and tips for parents, students and schools covering the transitions between all stages of education, including the transition from primary to post-primary - Guidelines on Moving from Primary to Post-Primary School.  These Guidelines are available at <i>www.ncse.ie.</i></p></reply>

There is no restraint with regard to staffing levels in any particular departments within an institution. As autonomous bodies institutions are responsible for managing the staffing levels within their departments in line with the conditions of the ECF and HR practices generally.</p></reply>

The NCCA is working particularly closely with students, parents and teachers in a representative sample of 41 schools.

There are 91 schools in the C&amp;C and ETB Sector who meet this criteria, based on the information currently available to this Department. This is an initial step and has taken immediate effect.</p>  <p>  Schemes were initiated in 1978 and 1979 for the employment of Clerical Officers and Caretakers in schools.  The schemes were withdrawn completely in 2008.  </p>  <p>  These schemes have been superseded by the more extensive capitation grant schemes.  The current grant scheme was agreed in the context of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, published in 1991.  </p>  <p>  The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools now receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under these grant schemes.  It is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs. Where a school uses the grant funding for caretaking or secretarial purposes, any staff taken on to support those functions are employees of individual schools.  Specific responsibility for the pay and conditions rests with the school. </p>  <p>  On foot of a Chairman&rsquo;s Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department engaged with the Unions representing school secretaries and caretakers, including through an independent arbitration process in 2015. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for staff and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period.  This arbitration agreement covers the period up to 31 December 2019.  </p>  <p>  The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a Secretary or Caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration has from 1 January 2019, been paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay. </p>  <p>Officials from my Department attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills on 9 April to discuss the status of non-teaching staff.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department recently had discussions with F&Oacute;RSA trade union representatives as part of a planned meeting. F&Oacute;RSA took the opportunity to formally table a pay claim.  </p>  <p>  This was tabled as a follow-on claim from the current pay agreement for this cohort of staff which lasts until December 2019. The Department will seek to establish the full current cost of the trade union&rsquo;s claim. This is standard practice.</p>  <p>  F&Oacute;RSA's claim will be fully considered once the current costings have been determined on completion of the survey.  The Department is fully open to having further dialogue with F&Oacute;RSA once this work has been undertaken.</p></reply>

Where the school is the sole primary school on an island the school will be able to appoint a second teacher.  In relation to single teacher schools generally with an enrolment of 15 or more pupils the school can apply to the staffing appeal board for a second post where the single teacher has children across 6 or more class groups.  </p>  <p>  Small schools have also benefitted from the 1 point improvement to the primary staffing schedule for all schools implemented in 2016 and again in 2018.  For the current school year, the staffing schedule at Primary level operates on a general average of 26 pupils to every 1 teacher (26:1) which is historically the lowest ever allocation ratio at primary level.</p>  <p>  In addition, the staffing process includes an appeals mechanism for schools to submit a staffing appeal under certain criteria, including a specific appeal measure for small schools, to the Primary Staffing Appeals Board.</p>  <p>  The estimated cost of restoring the staffing schedule for small schools to pre-2012 levels would be approximately &euro;3.5 million.</p></reply>

My Department therefore does not have details of the number of additional teachers allocated under the special education model that have additional  qualifications in special educational needs.</p>  <p>  In relation to the provision of a national training programme to ensure that all teachers receive training in special educational needs, I wish to advise that the Teaching Council is the statutory body with responsibility for professional standards and regulation of the teaching profession. </p>  <p>  Under Section 38 of the Teaching Council Act, all initial teacher education programmes are subject to review and accreditation by the Teaching Council, in accordance with the Criteria and Guidelines for Programme Providers (published in 2011 and revised in March 2017). In accordance with these Criteria and Guidelines, inclusive education is a mandatory component for all students in ITE. </p>  <p>  The learning outcomes of ITE programmes also reflect the need for the teacher to be able to conduct a systematic, holistic assessment of learner needs; to apply knowledge of the individual potential of students, their disposition towards learning and their backgrounds, identities and learning styles to their teaching; to set clear, challenging and achievable expectations for pupils; to evaluate learner progress; to act as an advocate for students, referring students for educational support as required and participating in the provision of that support, amongst other relevant outcomes. </p>  <p>  The Teaching Council is currently carrying out a review of the impact of the current programmes, with a view to amending the Criteria and Guidelines before the next round of accreditation commences in 2020. </p>  <p>  A recently published report from the National Council for Special Education on Initial Teacher Education for Inclusion: Phase 1 and 2 (NCSE Research Report No. 26), found that there is in general much good practice related to inclusive education in ITE, particularly in relation to the fostering of positive attitudes to inclusion, while also noting that there is scope for further alignment between theory and practice, in particular between student placement and the university experience. These findings will be considered by the Teaching Council in the course of its work.</p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) Support Service also provides for:</p>  <p>  - Continual Professional Development (CPD) and support for teachers in the area of special educational needs (SEN) to enhance the quality of learning and teaching in relation to Special Education Needs (SEN) provision</p>  <p>  - providing support and expertise to partner schools on issues related to behaviour</p>  <p>  - supporting the introduction of the new model of resource teaching allocation to schools and to develop capacity to meet the needs of students with SEN </p>  <p>  As CPD for teachers in the area of special educational needs is provided to schools by the NCSE support services, I have referred the part of the Deputy's question regarding the number of post-primary teachers that have participated in training and CPD on special educational needs since the introduction of the special education teacher allocation model in post-primary schools in September 2017, to the NCSE for direct reply to the Deputy regarding this matter.</p></reply>

These schools receive a grant in lieu of fees that had been levied prior to 1967. An additional per capita grant is paid to secondary schools in the voluntary sector in which instruction is through the medium of Irish in full or in part. The grant is not paid in either the Community and Comprehensive or the ETB sectors.</p>  <p>  Financial allocations to the ETB sector are made on a budget basis in respect of head office and other costs, including those relating to schools. ETBs are given a high level of autonomy in the management and appropriation of their budgets and each ETB is allowed to distribute its allocations in line with its priorities and perceptions of need. Any funding issues for an individual school have to be managed from within the relevant ETB&rsquo;s budget.  The Department does not earmark funding allocations for individual schools in the ETB sector. </p>  <p>  The Department&rsquo;s Policy on Gaeltacht Education 2017-2022 aims to ensure the availability of a high quality and relevant Irish-medium educational experience for all young people living in Gaeltacht areas and in this way to support the use of Irish as the main language of families and of Gaeltacht communities. Under the terms of the Policy, additional teaching and/or other resources, including dedicated continuing professional development (CPD), will be made available to schools whose applications to participate in the Gaeltacht Schools&rsquo; recognition process are approved.  It is envisaged that the allocation of resources will be on a staged incremental basis over a five-year period and will take account of the resources already allocated to each newly recognised Gaeltacht school in accordance with the language criteria set out in the Policy on Gaeltacht Education 2017-2022.</p></reply>

In that regard, as part of the demographic exercises, the Department engages with each of the local authorities to obtain the up-to-date data on significant new residential developments in each area. This is necessary to ensure that schools infrastructure planning is keeping pace with demographic changes as there is a constantly evolving picture with planned new residential development, including additional residential developments arising from the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF). </p>  <p>  With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level. Where demographic data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, depending on the circumstances, be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:</p>  <p>-   Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Extending the capacity of a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Provision of a new school or schools.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, in April 2018, the Government announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the next four years (2019 to 2022), including a new primary and post-primary school to be established in the Newcastle_Rathcoole school planning area as follows:</p>  <p>-   a new 8 classroom primary school to be established in 2020 to serve the Newcastle_Rathcoole/Saggart school planning area; and</p>  <p>  - a new 1,000 pupil post-primary school to be established in 2020 to serve the Tallaght and Newcastle_Rathcoole school planning areas as a regional solution.</p>  <p>  This announcement follows nationwide, demographic exercises carried out by my Department into the future need for primary and post-primary schools across the country and the 4-year horizon will enable increased lead-in times for planning and delivery of the necessary infrastructure. </p>  <p>  It is intended to deliver the two new schools as part of my Department's Design and Build programme in purpose-built accommodation on a shared site at Fortunestown Lane which is in the ownership of Dublin and Dun Laoghaire ETB.</p>  <p>  The Capital Programme provides for devolved funding for additional classrooms, if required, for schools where an immediate enrolment need has been identified or where an additional teacher has been appointed.

The review made a number of recommendations including the way SNA support is allocated to schools and the need to build school capacity through training. </p><p>The NCSE concluded that a better model of support was required, one which provides the right support at the right time provided by a range of personnel with relevant qualifications and skill sets.  The review recommended a new school inclusion model where the response by the State to the additional care needs for students in our schools would be broadened and better tailored to individual needs.</p><p>On 27 March I announced the trialing of the School Inclusion Model in 75 schools for the 2019/20 school year.</p><p>One feature of the School Inclusion Model is the development of a frontloaded allocation model of SNAs.  Frontloading SNA support eliminates the need for an individual assessment for each student, ending the link with the requirement for a formal diagnosis to gain access to support, and will reduce the delays in making supports available to schools. The proposed arrangements when implemented will also improve job security for SNAs in schools ensuring greater certainty for SNAs in relation to their employment status.</p><p>In conducting their review, the NCSE consulted widely and consultation will continue to be a central feature of the development and implementation.  Over 50 people including SNAs and their representatives attended an information and consultation event on 30 April 2019.  Further consultation is being undertaken directly with the Forsa union. </p><p>My Department published the Circular (number 71/2011, see below) concerning Croke Park Hours for SNAs, however, it does not get involved in the local management of how schools (as the employers) arrange the delivery of the hours from their staff (including SNAs).  However, point 9 of Appendix 1 of this circular does provide possible examples (not exhaustive listing) of the type of work that maybe undertaken by SNA&rsquo;s to meet their Croke Park hourly obligations.</p><p>Link to DES Circular 71/2011 is as follows: </p><p>Where a full-time SNA post within a school is reduced to a part-time post, the issue of redundancy payment in respect of the loss of hours may arise.  Redundancy arrangements for SNAs are set out in Department Circular 0058/2006.</p><p>Where a school/ETB has an additional allocation of SNA hours/posts then that additional allocation of hours/posts must be offered to an existing part-time SNAs in that school, in order of seniority, before the employer has recourse to these arrangements. This means that before an employer opts to recruit a further person as an SNA(s), they must ensure that all existing part-time SNAs in their employment, in order of seniority, have been offered a full-time position in the school or, in the case of ETBs, a full-time position in a school within the ETB scheme. The only exception that can be made to this rule is where a school/ETB has a determination in writing from the NCSE / SENO stating that their allocation must be split amongst a specific number of SNAs and/or stating that the allocation must be implemented in a specific fashion to address the care needs of the pupil(s). These arrangements are set out in Department Circular 0030/2019 published on 22 May 2019, which is available via the following link: https://www.education.ie/en/Circulars-and-Forms/Active-Circulars/cl0030_2019.pdf </p><p>The position on working hours for SNAs is that there are no nationally set working hours for full-time SNAs. In this regard, the contractual position in respect of the working hours of SNAs is as outlined in their contracts of employment which were agreed with the school management authorities and the relevant Trade Unions representing SNAs (F&Oacute;RSA and SIPTU) prior to their introduction in 2005. The working week for SNAs is defined in paragraph 2.5 of their contract as follows: &quot;You will be required to work normal classroom hours including class break periods and in addition to attend before and after school in order to help with the preparation and tidying up of classrooms, reception and dispersal of children etc. The hours of work will normally be from [xxxx] to [xxxx] daily during term time.&quot;</p><p>This standard contract has been designed to be flexible to cater for the different spectrum of working hours across all the various schools including primary, post-primary and special schools. No set hours were agreed but instead, full-time SNAs are expected to work for the normal school hours in the school that they are working in, and in addition to be available for a period of time before and after school in order to help with reception and dispersal of children and preparation and tidying up of classrooms etc. These times are set locally by the school management and will vary from school to school depending on the requirements of the school. </p><p>In addition, all SNAs were required to be available for a number of days at the start and finish of each school term not exceeding 12 in total. Under the Croke Park Agreement it was agreed to introduce greater flexibility to the use of these 12 days. These 12 days now equate to 72 hours (pro-rata for part-time SNAs) to be used by schools as an additional bank of hours to be utilised and delivered outside of normal school opening hours and/or the normal school year.</p><p>Furthermore, the contract for Special Needs Assistants in the post primary sector (link below) specifically requires that SNAs are required to work the month of June on examinations and work appropriate to the grade including training. This was agreed with the Unions representing SNAs (F&Oacute;RSA and SIPTU) when the contract was devised in 2005. This condition of service places a clear onus and obligation on the SNA to attend at their place of work and be available for work during the month of June.</p><p>It is a matter for school management as their employer to determine the precise work that is to be completed by SNAs during the month of June. The utilisation of this period is not specifically for examinations or training purposes only, although these are two of the purposes for which the period of work can be utilised. </p><p>Link to the SNA Contract of Employment for the Post Primary sector:</p><p>Department of Education and Skills Circular SNA 12/05 (Post-Primary) .</p><p>This contract of employment is augmented by all of the relevant Departmental Circulars governing Special Needs Assistants which detail the standardised terms and conditions of employment for SNAs including leave entitlements.</p></reply>

The changes introduced took account of advice provided by the Teaching Council, which had engaged in a consultation process around a number of matters relating to entry to initial teacher education. The entry requirement for Irish is to increase from H5 to H4.</p>  <p>  I am aware that the introduction of the new, higher, standards has posed difficulties in timing for students applying to the Professional Master of Education (PME), the post-graduate entry route to primary teaching that you refer to. These were further impacted by other changes to the application process, which involved students applying to the four State-funded providers (DCU, Mary Immaculate College, Maynooth University and Marino Institute of Education ) having to take the Teastas Eorpach Gaeilge (TEG) test.</p>  <p>  I would like to inform the Deputy that the Minimum Entry Requirement for Irish for PME applicants will be H5 in 2020. The requirement for H4 for PME applications will not take effect until 2021.</p>  <p>  In summary: any applicant to the PME for 2020 will have to have both the Minimum Entry Requirement H5 for Irish and have successfully completed the Teastas Eorpach Gaeilge in order progress their application with the relevant ITE providers</p></reply>

Where the introduction of digital devices is planned, consultation with members of the school community including parents is advised. The cost and other implications must be fully considered by the Boards of Managements before a decision is made. It is important for schools, in conjunction with parents, to retain local autonomy for decisions on the use of digital technology, including tablet devices, laptops, and learning platforms, and how best to manage their integration into classroom practice reflective of their own context and requirements. In making this decision each school should refer to and reflect on the available information. </p>  <p>  All purchasing undertaken by schools of exhequer provided funding must be in compliance with Public Procurement Procedures.  Existing ICT purchasing Frameworks are in place operated by the Office of Government procurement for Desktop PCs/Notebooks/etc, with appropriately defined technical specifications.  These Frameworks should be engaged with and taken advantage of as they simplify the process of purchasing ICT equipment for schools. </p>  <p>  The Schools Procurement Unit (SPU) which is the central support resource for providing guidance to all primary and post-primary schools (except ETB schools) on any procurement-related issues. The SPU delivers free advice and practical support to schools to help them achieve improvements in their procurement processes, practices and outcomes.</p>  <p>  The Professional Development Service for Teachers Technology in Education (PDST-TIE) offers advice to schools and have developed an advice sheets on digital technology in education, including on the adoption of Laptops and tablets in schools. The information on their website outlines what these devices can offer schools to support teaching, learning and assessment, and facilitate students' active learning and collaboration. Specific items for consideration including software and hardware requirements, purchasing regulations, are addressed in the support information. </p>  <p>  I am keenly aware of the challenges faced by educators and parents, in relation to costs incurred, and my Department continues to work to help support schools and families meet these costs. In 2017 a circular letter issued to schools with measures to be adopted to reduce the cost of school uniforms and other costs. This circular also instructed schools to consult with parents and their school community on the issue of ensuring costs are reasonable for parents, and how to avoid costs acting as a barrier. This circular specified that wherever possible, generic rather than branded items should be specified (e.g. uniform, clothing, IT tablets, sports equipment etc.). </p>  <p>  The Digital Strategy for Schools 2015-2020, sets out a plan to embed the use of digital technology in teaching, learning and assessment, and affirms that the use of digital technology can enhance the teaching and learning experience. The Strategy recognises that schools require investment in their ICT infrastructure. Funding of &euro;210m has been committed to support the implementation of this strategy with &euro;60m issued to schools over the 2016/17 and 2017/18 school years and a further &euro;45m recently issued to schools in respect of the 2018/19 school year.</p></reply>

This study commenced in January 2019.</p><p>On a more general note, the DLF supports the Digital Strategy for Schools and other Department policies in a number of key areas including curriculum reform and implementation, skills development, teacher education and learner outcomes. It provides a Roadmap to help schools embed the use of digital technologies in teaching and learning and in leadership &amp;amp; management. The Framework promotes student engagement in the teaching and learning process whereby students become engaged thinkers, active and discerning learners and where digital interactions are respectful and positive and conductive to wellbeing.  The DLF supports and complements the School Self Evaluation (SSE) process and will allow schools to evaluate their own progress and measure where they stand against benchmarks of effective and highly effective practices in the use of digital techniologies in teaching and learning and leadership and management. The dissemination of the DLF, which is currently underway, is supported by an intensive CPD Framework including national seminars, webinars, online courses and direct school support. The Framework is also accompanied by Digital Learning Planning Guidelines, a comprehensive set of guidelines for schools on the implementation of the DLF including the development of a Digital Learning Plan. </p><p>More information on the DLF can be found at   </p></reply>

Where the introduction of digital devices is planned, consultation with members of the school community including parents is advised. The cost and other implications must be fully considered by the Boards of Managements before a decision is made. It is important for schools, in conjunction with parents, to retain local autonomy for decisions on the use of digital technology, including tablet devices, laptops, and learning platforms, and how best to manage their integration into classroom practice reflective of their own context and requirements. In making this decision each school should refer to and reflect on the available information. </p>  <p>  The Professional Development Service for Teachers Technology in Education (PDST-TIE) offers advice to schools and have developed an advice sheets on digital technology in education, including on the adoption of Laptops and tablets in schools. The information on their website outlines what these devices can offer schools to support teaching, learning and assessment, and facilitate students' active learning and collaboration. Specific items for consideration including software and hardware requirements, purchasing regulations, are addressed in the support information. </p>  <p>  The Digital Strategy for Schools 2015-2020, sets out a plan to embed the use of digital technology in teaching, learning and assessment, and affirms that the use of digital technology can enhance the teaching and learning experience. The Strategy recognises that schools require investment in their ICT infrastructure. Funding of &euro;210m has been committed to support the implementation of this strategy with &euro;60m issued to schools over the 2016/17 and 2017/18 school years and a further &euro;45m recently issued to schools in respect of the 2018/19 school year.</p></reply>

An important initiative in that regard is the "Greentown&rdquo; project, a research project led by the REPPP Project (Research Evidence into Policy, Programmes and Practice) at the School of Law in the University of Limerick (UL). The REPPP project is a strategic research partnership with UL which is supported by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, and also by my own Department.  Its specific focus is on examining the recruitment by criminal networks of children in Ireland and to make recommendations for interventions to disrupt this. </p>  <p>  In the absence of international models of intervention that could be readily deployed, the original Greentown report (December 2016) recommended the design of a programme to include interventions with children and their families to help them withstand the influence of criminal networks.  This new &ldquo;Greentown Programme&rdquo; has been designed with the input of leading international expertise on crime and criminal networks, together with Irish scientific, policy and practice expertise in child protection and welfare, drugs and community development. </p>  <p>  I understand that it is intended to commence a trial of the Greentown Programme approach, on a pilot basis, during 2019. </p>  <p>  More generally, I am currently developing a new Youth Justice Strategy with the assistance of an interdepartmental and interagency steering group.  The new Strategy will address the full range of issues relevant to youth justice, including how best to tackle the serious issues raised in the Deputy's Question.  </p>  <p>  A key issue here is how to ensure an integrated approach across all agencies, but in particular the relevant child welfare programmes, Garda Youth Diversion Projects and schools, to ensure a sustained and holistic response and that integrated services are provided to respond to the situation of children at risk, tailored to the individual child in the context of the specific family and the specific community and the issues they face.  The new Youth Justice Strategy will be published in draft form for a further round of public consultation before the end of this year and will be finalised early in 2020.  </p>  <p>  My Department also provides funding through the Irish Youth Justice Service (IYJS) to support the operation of 106 Garda Youth Diversion Projects (GYDPs).  These projects are community based multi-agency crime prevention initiatives which primarily seek to divert young people who have become involved in crime/anti-social behaviour.   </p>  <p>  For 2019, IYJS has a renewed emphasis on preventative work by GYDPs, looking at the child in the context of the specific family and the specific community.  This includes family support work and working with children aged 8 to 11.  The Department also supports pilot projects, to help develop better approaches in areas such as engagement with hard-to-reach or more challenging children, as well as mentoring initiatives.</p></reply>

The information requested by the Deputy in relation to the number of Garda&iacute; per head of population is therefore not collated.</p><p>I have been assured by the Garda Commissioner that Garda recruitment planned for 2019 will ensure that the Government's commitment to increasing the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 15,000 Garda members by 2021 will be achieved.</p><p>Garda strength for each Division by station and rank, from 2009 to 30 April 2019 is available on my Department&rsquo;s website through the following link.</p><p><i></i></p><p>For more general information on Garda Facts and Figures please see the following link.</p><p><i></i></p></reply>

Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of resources.</p><p>I have been informed by the Commissioner that the additional resources coming on stream have enabled him to assign resources to Specialist Bureaus such as the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.  This Bureau leads on the strategy for tackling drugs and works with Garda Divisional Drug Units nationwide in demand reduction and supply reduction at local level.</p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na remains resolute in its determination to act against those within society who pose a significant threat to the welfare and well-being of our citizens and the communities they serve. All Garda&iacute; have a responsibility in the prevention and detection of criminal activity whether it be in the area of drug offences crime or otherwise.  A core focus of the work carried out by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is aimed at tackling drugs and organised crime.</p><p>The number of Garda&iacute; by rank attached to the Kildare Drugs Unit as of 30 April 2019 (the latest date for which figures are readily available) was 11, of whom 2 were Sergeants and 9 were Garda&iacute;.</p><p>In 2017 the Commissioner established the Garda National Roads Policing Bureau (GNRPB) to ensure a consistent approach to road safety and enforcement of road traffic legislation across the country. This is achieved through coordination of enforcement and development of policy based on research and analysis of statistics and by engaging in campaigns in partnership with other State Agencies.</p><p>Furthermore, the Divisional Garda Traffic Corps have been re-named Garda Road Policing Units, to reflect the role the Units will play in denying criminals the use of the roads network. In addition to the Roads Policing Units focusing on the lifesaver offences of speeding, seatbelts, mobile phones and driving under the influence, they will also focus on crime prevention and crime detection. Divisional Roads Policing Units will work closely with other Divisional units to target known criminals and to disrupt their activities through strict enforcement of road traffic legislation.</p><p>The strength of the Kildare Roads Policing Unit as of the 30 April 2019 (the latest date for which figures are readily available) was 27, of whom 2 were Sergeants and 25 were Garda&iacute;.</p><p>For more general information on Garda Facts and Figures please see the following link.</p><p><i></i></p></reply>

Since the beginning of 2017, just under 480 new Garda staff posts have been sanctioned by the Policing Authority with the consent of my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. The Government provided funding in Budget 2019 to sustain continued recruitment into An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and, as part of this recruitment, the Commissioner decided to recruit a net 600 Garda Staff this year, which will facilitate the ongoing programme of civilianisation in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and allow for redeployment of approximately 500 experienced Garda&iacute; to frontline policing duties by the end of this year. This fully reflects the Governments&rsquo; continuing support for the Commissioner in reaching the target of 4,000 Garda staff by 2021.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that as of 30 April 2019, there were approximately 2,600 Garda staff undertaking administrative, professional, technical and industrial support duties. </p>  <p>  I am further informed that such staff positions range from clerical support and financial management functions to specialised roles in HR, IT and telecommunications, as well as teaching, finance and procurement, internal audit, communications, research and analysis, accommodation, scene-of-crime support and legal and medical services.

As Minister, I have no direct role in these matters. I understand however that Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure their optimum use.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that the budget allocation to the Garda Witness Protection Programme for each of the years 2017, 2018 and 2019 was &euro;1,198,000.</p></reply>

On completion of the necessary processing the application will be submitted to me for decision as expeditiously as possible. Should further documentation be required it will be requested from the applicant in due course.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, the granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements, not only within the State but also at European Union level, and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.  </p>  <p>  It is recognised that all applicants for citizenship would wish to have a decision on their application without delay. The nature of the naturalisation process is such that, for a broad range of reasons, some cases will take longer than others to process.  In some instances, completing the necessary checks can take a considerable period of time.  </p>  <p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS of my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose. This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process. The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from the INIS is, in the Deputy&rsquo;s view, inadequate or too long awaited.</p></reply>

Others may decide not to cooperate with the process (such as not returning their application questionnaires to the International Protection Office (IPO)) and therefore it is difficult to ascertain if they continue to reside in the State.  Some applicants may formally withdraw their international protection application and either leave the State or else reside in the State under a different immigration permission type. Therefore, because an individual has applied for asylum and their application has yet to be finalised, this is not determinative of the number of international protection applicants actually residing in the State at any given time.</p><p>Notwithstanding, and to give some context to the number of asylum seekers and refugees that have applied for an international protection status, I can inform the Deputy that as of end May 2019 there are some 8,116 persons who have made an international protection application or refugee status application whose application is ongoing.  Many of these are under active consideration either at first instance or appeal while others maybe the subject of judicial review, etc.  Included in this number are approximately 1,200 protection applicants who are considered not to be cooperating, for example, not having returned their international protection questionnaire or provided a valid address. </p><p>With regard to persons granted refugee status, I can inform the Deputy that a total of 5,449 persons have received an international protection declaration (refugee status or subsidiary protection status) since 2008 to the end of May 2019. In addition, a total of 1,307 programme refugees have arrived in the State under the UNHCR-led Refugee Resettlement strand of the IRPP (Irish Refugee Protection Programme), making a total of 6,756 persons who have been issued either a refugee or subsidiary protection status in the State during the period.  It is not possible to say how many of those granted status are currently in the State.  For example, some may have left the State voluntarily and it is expected that a significant number have gone on to become naturalised Irish citizens or have attained an alternative immigration permission.  </p><p>With regards to the age profile of those seeking international protection, for the reasons outlined, it is not possible to provide such figures for those resident in the State.  However, the following tables provide a breakdown of those currently at first instance stage (which is considered representative of the wider population) together with a breakdown of persons granted refugee status or subsidiary protection status for the period requested by the Deputy.  </p><p><b>Table 1:</b><b>Age breakdown &ndash; Asylum/International Protection Cases Pending in the International Protection Office for first instance recommendation decision on 31/05/2019</b><table><tr><th>Age    Profile</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>Minors (0-17 years)</td><td>1,103</td></tr><tr><td>Adults (18 and upwards)</td><td>4,626</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>5729</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Table 2: Age breakdown &ndash; Persons granted a protection status (refugee or subsidiary protection status) since 2008. </b><table><tr><th>Age Profile</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>Age Profile</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td>Minors (0-17 years)</td><td>2,305</td></tr><tr><td>Adults (18 and upwards)</td><td>4,451</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>6,756</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The new Tribunal will deal with allegations of serious misconduct by both solicitors and barristers and will replace the existing bodies which currently operate for that purpose and will be winding-down their existing caseloads. Extensive preparations have been on-going at the Legal Services Regulatory Authority to put the necessary procedural, staffing, IT and other supports in place with the intention of being in a position to receive and process public complaints from early October 2019. At that point, members of the public will no longer make their complaints through the legal professional bodies as they do at present but directly to the Authority and the new Disciplinary Tribunal will come into operation in its own right. </p>  <p>  Section 212 of the 2015 Act, provides that a barrister in employment whose name is entered on the Roll of Practising Barristers may provide legal services to his or her employer, including by appearing on behalf of that employer in a court, tribunal or forum for arbitration. Given that the Roll of Practising Barristers has now been established by the Authority it is also anticipated that section 212 will be commenced to coincide with the coming into operation of the public complaints and professional conduct regime of Part 6 of the 2015 Act later this year. </p>  <p>  This Autumn will also see the introduction of the new legal costs transparency regime set out in Part 10 of the 2015 Act including, separately, the transition of the Office of the Taxing-Master to that of the Legal Costs Adjudicators which will maintain a publicly accessible Register of its legal costs determinations. Similarly, the roll-out of Legal Partnerships and Limited Liability Partnerships is anticipated. The new professional conduct regime being introduced under Part 6 will, therefore, underpin the new legal costs and other obligations that will apply to legal practitioners being regulated under the 2015 Act. As Minister I will, of course, continue to support the roll-out of these various functions with the timely commencement of the relevant provisions.</p></reply>

This has seen an increase in the number of Garda members to just over 14,000 at the end of 2018, a net increase of over 1,000 since the end of 2016.</p><p>The Government has increased the budget for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to &euro;1.76 billion for 2019, including provision for the recruitment of new Garda&iacute; and Garda Staff this year. The Garda Commissioner has informed me that he intends to recruit a total of 600 trainee Garda&iacute; in 2019 and a net 600 Garda Staff. This Garda Staff recruitment will allow the Commissioner to redeploy a further 500 fully trained Garda&iacute; from administrative duties to frontline policing in 2019. This is in addition to the approximately 260 Garda&iacute; redeployed from administrative to front line duties by the end of 2018. </p><p>For more general information on Garda Facts and Figures please see the following link: <i></i></p></reply>

The Bill provides for the amendment of Article 41.3.2 of the Constitution to remove the minimum living apart period for spouses seeking a divorce and for the amendment of Article 41.3.3 which deals with the recognition of foreign divorces.</p>  <p>  After the Thirty-eighth Amendment of the Constitution (Dissolution of Marriage) Bill 2016 is signed into law by the President, the Government will bring forward a Bill to amend section 5(1)(a) of the Family Law (Divorce) Act 1996 to reduce the minimum living apart period specified in that Act to 2 years during the previous 3 years (from 4 years during the previous 5 years). I will seek Government approval shortly for the drafting of the Bill. </p>  <p>  The reduction of the minimum living apart period to two years will enable couples whose marriages have broken down with no reasonable prospect of reconciliation to regularise their affairs sooner.  A shorter living apart period will also have the potential to reduce the legal costs involved, as couples would be less likely to need to apply for judicial separation or make a formal separation agreement while waiting to become eligible to apply for divorce.</p></reply>

Under the Terms of the Scheme, the Tribunal is entirely independent in the matter of individual decisions on applications for compensation.</p>  <p>  Tribunal members, who are practising barristers and practising solicitors in the Courts system, provide their services on a part time basis to the Tribunal.  In order to continue to allow the Tribunal to address claims as promptly as possible within the funds available, I have recently extended the term of office of 5 members pending a competition for the recruitment of new members.</p>  <p>  The length of time taken to process an application can vary widely from case to case.  Each case is addressed on the individual application. While applications are processed with the minimum of formality compared to court proceedings where compensation is being claimed, in making their decisions Tribunal Members must be satisfied that all supporting documentation submitted is in order.  In some cases there can be delays pending the availability of all the required documentation and some cases are complex in terms of medical conditions.  For example, in the cases of serious injury to the victim, it can take considerable amount of time before the treating consultant is in a position to give a final prognosis.  It is also often necessary to await Garda reports arising from the related criminal investigation before a final decision can be made in a case.  By their nature, such investigations can be lengthy and complex.</p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that an assessment of the caseload of the Tribunal is currently being finalised and I expect to receive a report from my officials shortly.</p>  <p>  I can also advise the Deputy that my Department has submitted a request for a review of the Scheme to the Law Reform Commission (LRC) for consideration in the context of its Programme of Law Reform.</p></reply>

In furtherance of this commitment, a grant-aid scheme to assist groups in the establishment of community-based CCTV systems in their local areas is being administered by my Department.

Full details are available to download from my Department's website <i>www.justice.ie</i>and support and guidance is available to help interested groups to apply for this funding through a dedicated email address <i>communitycctv@justice.ie</i>I encourage any interested groups to make contact with my officials for further assistance. </p><p>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the majority of the CCTV systems on the motorways are controlled by Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) and operated on their behalf by the Motorway Traffic Control Centre.More generally, the Deputy may wish to be aware that the Programme for a Partnership Government also recognises that Garda&iacute; must have the modern technology and resources necessary to detect and investigate crimes, and to prevent loss and harm to citizens and their property on a 24/7 basis.  In support of this commitment, &euro;342 million is being invested in Garda ICT infrastructure between 2016 and 2021 to enable An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to utilise appropriate technologies in delivering professional policing and security services for the community and &euro;46 million is being invested in the Garda fleet over the same period, to ensure that Garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive on the roads and in the community to prevent and tackle crime.</p><p>I can also confirm that Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) technology is fitted in a number of official Garda vehicles which are allocated around the country and used on a daily basis to assist in the prevention and detection of crime, particularly on our roads network.</p></reply>

The preparatory phase will also involve a stakeholder consultation process, consideration of best international practice and the conducting of a full pilot survey in the field in 2020. </p>  <p>  Following the conclusion of the survey the state will have robust data on the prevalence of sexual violence, which in some cases will relate to such violence which occurs in a  domestic setting. This will inform Government policy and provide some insight into the cost of such violence.</p>  <p>  Internationally, the Deputy may be aware that the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE) has completed a study to identify and recommend appropriate methodologies to measure the cost of gender-based and intimate partner violence in EU-28 Member States. Three main types of costs were identified: lost economic output, provision of services, including health, legal, social and specialised; and the personal (physical and emotional) impact on the victim. The report is structured around these types of costs, providing accounts of the investigations into the methodologies in each of these fields found in the relevant literature. </p>  <p>  The EIGE report concluded that its detailed case study would not be easy to replicate in other countries as the data requirements are high. To illustrate the difficulties involved, a Council of Europe Study examined a range of estimates of the cost of gender-based violence. Depending on data and methods used, the lowest cost estimate was just 1.6% of the highest cost estimate, rendering any estimation meaningless in the context of such a broad divergence. I am informed that EIGE concluded that there is currently insufficient available data to robustly cost the impact of intimate partner violence separately for each EU-28 Member State.</p>  <p>  My Department has engaged with various EIGE meetings in relation to administrative data on gender-based violence and will continue to do so as practice develops.</p></reply>

Section 52 of the International Protection Act  2015 provides for the revocation of refugee status by the Minister in a number of circumstances. </p><p>Specifically, section 52(2) of the Act provides that the Minister &quot;...may, in accordance with this section, revoke a refugee declaration given to a person if satisfied that - </p><p>(a) there are reasonable grounds for regarding him or her as a danger to the security of the State, or</p><p>(b) the person, having been by a final judgment convicted, whether in the State or not, of a particularly serious crime, constitutes a danger to the community of the State.&quot;. </p><p>This legal provision is invoked from time to time.  In consideration of cases for revocation and continuation of their immigration permission to be in the State, detailed consideration must be given to a wide range of factors including the nature of offences, other ties to the State,  non-refoulement considerations as well as jurisprudence in this area.</p><p>It should be noted that the legal principle of non-refoulement means a state cannot expel or return a refugee in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where his or her life or freedom would be threatened on account of his or her race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion. The State&rsquo;s non-refoulement obligations arise under the 1951 UN Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol.</p></reply>

Under Article 41.3.2º, a court may grant a divorce only where specific conditions have been met. The Thirty-eighth Amendment of the Constitution (Dissolution of Marriage) Bill 2016, which was approved by the people in a referendum on 24 May 2019, provides for the amendment of Article 41.3.2º of the Constitution to remove the minimum living apart period for spouses seeking a divorce and for the amendment of Article 41.3.3º which deals with the recognition of foreign divorces. The existing provisions in Article 41.3.2º of the Constitution which require that there be no prospect of reconciliation and that &ldquo;such provision as the court considers proper having regard to the circumstances exists or will be made for the spouses and any children of either or both of them and any other person prescribed by law&rdquo; will continue in force in the Constitution.</p>  <p>  Pre-nuptial agreements are related to the concept of &ldquo;proper provision&rdquo;.  Currently, pre-nuptial agreements have no basis in law in Ireland and consequently, they are not strictly binding. However, couples are free to enter pre-nuptial agreements and such agreements can serve as guides for the court in divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes &ldquo;proper provision&rdquo; for each spouse, it is more likely to be persuasive on the court.</p>  <p>  The Law Reform Commission has included in its new Fifth Programme of Law Reform an examination of the &ldquo;proper provision&rdquo; requirement for divorce.  The Law Reform Commission has indicated that it will &ldquo;consider to what extent any further guidance may be provided in order to ensure a consistency in the approach taken to the exercise of this judicial discretion, in particular to assist spouses to reach settlements and resolve disputes more efficiently and at lower financial or cost.&rdquo; The outcome of the Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s examination of this issue will inform future proposals for any legislative reform in this area and I have no plans in the meantime to introduce legislation to legalise pre-nuptial agreements.</p></reply>

They include: </p>  <p>  - Further new or refurbished courthouses in regional cities and county towns where facilities remain substandard (including Galway City, Wicklow Town, Portlaoise, Tralee and Roscommon) and further provincial locations such as An Clochan Liath (Dungloe) to serve as the Gaeltacht court for the region, and Tuam; </p>  <p>  - Regional Family Law Centres; </p>  <p>  - A nationwide condition survey of all court buildings in the estate will be undertaken to determine their condition and identify works required in relation to any issues identified and meet ongoing maintenance requirements.</p>  <p>  The precise allocation and timing of additional funding over the entire ten year period remains to be fully determined.  It will be dependent on the outcome of further detailed planning and analysis of costs which will determine prioritisation of projects from a timing and budgetary perspective. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had inquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that in 2018 the Courts Service acquired full ownership of the historic Roscommon Courthouse from Roscommon County Council.

This must have been deeply distressing to all involved and I offer my unreserved apology for the breakdown in communication, which led to this unintended event. </p>  <p>  The Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) supported the organisation of a memorial for the person concerned, which was held shortly after her passing and was attended by her friends, centre management and members of staff from RIA.  I have written to her friends with the offer of assistance to organise an appropriate commemoration following her burial.</p>  <p>  By way of background, where a person dies while she or he is being provided with accommodation by RIA, RIA works closely with the centre manager to assist the family in accessing the supports provided by the State, and to ensure that any residents affected by the death are assisted in accessing services that can support them.  All deaths and serious incidents that occur within accommodation centres provided by the Department are referred to the Garda&iacute; as a matter of course and the Garda&iacute; in turn refer all deaths to the local Coroner&rsquo;s office.  As is the case with all Garda&iacute;/coroner matters, RIA is not privy to information held by the Garda&iacute; or by a coroner. </p>  <p>  The decision on whether to hold an inquest into the death of any person reported to the coroner, is a matter for the coroner who is independent in the conduct of their functions under the Coroners Act 1962.  I am informed by the relevant coroner in this case that an inquest will not be required as the post-mortem examination disclosed that death was due to natural causes.  The coroner, as required by law, provided details to the Registrar&rsquo;s Office to register the death.</p>  <p>  In an effort to better understand the communications between all parties concerned, a senior Departmental official spoke to the Coroner on 7th June 2019.  The Coroner pointed out that the normal practice, where someone is interested in the outcome of a coroner&rsquo;s consideration of whether an inquest will be held into the death of a person is necessary or when a person&rsquo;s remains are to be released for burial, is that a letter would be on file.  However as there was no formal request made in writing to record an interest in the release of the deceased's remains, he arranged for the appropriate and dignified burial of the deceased, through the relevant State agencies, as is the standard practice in these cases.</p>  <p>   While thankfully, the occurrences of deaths where the deceased remains unidentified, unclaimed or no next of kin is identified, are very rare, the Department will take all possible steps to ensure that this outcome is avoided in future and that friends or colleagues who have expressed an interest are properly informed through appropriate communications with the coronial service and by liaising with other agencies involved in this case.</p></reply>

As a result it would be contrary to national law for me or my Department officials to provide information which pertains to a protection applicant. The Chief International Protection Officer and his team of International Protection Officers are also bound by the confidentiality provisions of Section 26 of the 2015 Act to protect the identity of the applicant. The applicant or his legal representative should contact the International Protection Office directly either by email to info@ipo.gov.ie, by telephone to the IPO Customer Service Centre at 01 6028008 or in writing to Customer Service Centre, International Protection Office, 79-83 Lower Mount Street, Dublin 2. </p><p>Following the commencement of the International Protection Act 2015 on 31 December 2016, new arrangements for the investigation and determination of applications for international protection (refugee status and subsidiary protection) and cases involving permission to remain in the State have been introduced. Such applications are now processed, as part of a single application procedure, by the International Protection Office (IPO) which has replaced the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC) from that date. The staff of that Office (the Chief International Protection Officer and International Protection Officers) are independent in the performance of their protection functions. </p><p>For your information, on 27 February 2017, the Chief International Protection Officer, following consultation with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), published a statement on the Prioritisation of Applications under the International Protection Act 2015 which is available on the website of the International Protection Office (<i>www.ipo.gov.ie</i>). </p><p>Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS of my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

I had the benefit of hearing the concerns and suggestions put forward by locals, covering issues such as education, employment and sport, and an undertaking was given that the Government will give them further consideration.  I also took the opportunity to outline the whole of government approach which is being taken to policing and community safety under the implementation plan of the Commission of the Future of Policing in Ireland report overseen by the Department of An Taoiseach. </p>  <p>  We also met with senior members from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and my Department at Coolock Garda Station.

However, I am advised by INIS that holders gain employment in varied occupations with large numbers in the hospitality and retail sectors and with smaller numbers in areas such as ICT and HR, engineering, healthcare and working for NGOs. </p>  <p>  I should also add that not all applicants who are granted access to the labour market may choose to enter the workforce or may postpone doing so for a number of reasons such as participation in education or training programmes, which the permission grants them access to, or for family reasons such as childcare, etc.</p></reply>

In any given year the Health and Safety Authority carries out over 9,500 inspections and investigations under safety, health and chemicals legislation. The focus on inspection and investigation is risk based and evidence led with the highest levels of inspections and investigations taking place in construction; agriculture; manufacturing; wholesale and retail with written advice, improvement notices and prohibition notices for more serious breaches observed. The Authority had 15 prosecutions in 2018, resulting in total fines imposed of &euro;705,972.</p><p>In relation to chemicals, the Authority adopts a similar approach as it does with the occupational health and safety areas of its remit in terms of support, advice, inspection and investigation under the different regulations in addition to acting as the lead Competent Authority under the Chemicals Acts 2008 and 2010. As the Competent Authority, the Authority delivers on national objectives in relation to the evaluation, hazard identification and risk management of chemicals manufactured and used in Europe. The Health and Safety Authority also carries out Competent Authority functions in relation to Control of Major Accident Hazards Regulations (COMAH), completing specific inspections in the area as the regulator. The Authority is responsible in Ireland for delivering on national commitments in relation to the Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road and Use of Transportable Pressure Equipment Regulations by completing inspections of vehicles and premises.</p><p>In relation to the occupational hygiene programme and delivering on its policy and inspection objectives, the Authority targets actions in relation to asbestos, biological, chemical and physical agents by carrying out asbestos inspections and if required prosecutions in relation to asbestos and construction related contraventions. The Authority&rsquo;s role also extends into the area of market surveillance on chemical and industrial products which are placed on the Irish market to check whether they are in compliance with chemical and industrial products legislation requirements.</p><p>The Irish National Accreditation Board (INAB), which is part of the Health and Safety Authority, has the National Accreditation role in Ireland.  It assesses applicants for accreditation and accredits conformity assessment bodies.</p><p>I am satisfied that the Health and Safety Authority has been adequately funded over the years 2017 to 2019 to deliver effectively on its extensive mandate. </p></reply>

The Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority (IAASA) is an independent body responsible for the supervision of the auditing and accounting profession and its objects, functions and powers are set out in the 2014 Act. </p><p>IAASA&rsquo;s mission is to contribute to Ireland having a strong regulatory environment in which to do business by supervising and promoting high quality financial reporting, auditing and effective regulation of the accounting profession in the public interest. </p><p>In relation to accountancy, IAASA is responsible for the supervision of the prescribed accountancy bodies in respect of how these bodies regulate and monitor their members including on investigations and disciplinary matters. There are eight of these bodies currently. </p><p>In relation to auditing, IAASA is designated as the single competent authority with responsibility for the oversight of statutory auditors and audit firms in accordance with the EU Audit Directive (2006/43/EC as amended by Directive 2014/56/EU) and Regulation (EU) 537/2014. The oversight tasks in respect of statutory auditors are:</p><p>- the approval of accountants to act as statutory auditors and public registration; </p><p>- the adoption of standards on professional ethics, internal quality control of audit firms and auditing; </p><p>- continuing education of auditors; </p><p>- quality assurance of audits; and</p><p>- investigation and administrative disciplinary systems.  </p><p>Five of the prescribed accountancy bodies are recognised by IAASA for the purposes of carrying out oversight tasks of the approval and registration of statutory auditors and audit firms; continuing education; quality assurance systems; investigative and administrative disciplinary systems in respect of statutory auditors and audit firms. These are the recognised accountancy bodies. </p><p>Under the Audit Regulation, IAASA has direct responsibility for the quality assurance of audits of public-interest entities. Public-interest entities are systemically important entities such as credit institutions and insurance undertakings.  Entities with securities listed on a regulated main market in the EU are also classified as public-interest entities.  IAASA is also responsible for any investigations or sanctions arising, as a result of those quality assurance inspections. </p><p>IAASA also has discretionary powers under the 2014 Act including to inquire how a prescribed accountancy body has carried out its investigation and disciplinary procedures and to inquire into how a recognised accountancy body performs the audit oversight tasks. </p><p>IAASA also has responsibility for the registration and supervision of third country auditors i.e. auditors of companies incorporated in a country outside the EU that are listed on a regulated market in Ireland.</p><p>IAASA is independent in the exercise of its functions and details of its activities can be found in the Authority&rsquo;s annual reports which are submitted to Government and published on its website: <i>.</i></p></reply>

In this regard the Health and Safety Authority (HSA) carried out 18 inspections during from 2011 to the present and the breakdown of those inspections can be seen in the following table.<table><tr><th></th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th><th>2017</th><th>2018</th><th>2019</th></tr><tr><td>Inspections</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>6</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Investigations</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Verbal   Advice</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>3</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td></td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Written   advice</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>6</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Improvement   Notice</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr></table></p><p>The findings of these inspections led to 6 formal investigations taking place, 4 instances when verbal advice was provided, 13 instances of written advice and an improvement notice was issued in one instance.</p><p>The HSA&rsquo;s inspection of workplaces programme is carefully planned each year based on risk and as such its proactive programme of work focuses primarily on high risk sectors, sectors where there are a high level of workplace fatalities and serious injuries occurring such as agriculture, construction, health and social care sectors.  Given the low level of workplace incidents in fairgrounds, any inspections are reactive rather than proactive and the HSA does not have a proactive programme of work in this sector. </p><p>HSA inspectors are granted a broad range of enforcement powers through the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005. In instances where a serious breach of regulation/contravention in a place of work is identified, an Inspector can issue an improvement notice on the person in control of the place of work directing them to comply with the regulation within a set time frame.  As already indicated there was one improvement notice issued in this sector for the time period 2011 &ndash; 2018. </p><p>In addition should an Inspector observe a breach of regulation/contravention that could give rise to the immediate risk of serious workplace injury, the Inspector can issue a Prohibition Notice on the person in control of the place of work directing them to stop the activity immediately and not to resume until such time as there are appropriate remedial measures have been put in place to address the contravention and reduce the risk of serious injury.  No such Prohibition Notices were issued in this sector for the time period 2011 -2018. </p><p>Finally, in instances where an inspector observes minor contraventions they can issue written advice or give verbal advice to the person in control of the place of work.  During the period covered such advice was given in 17 instances.</p></reply>

Whilst site visits do remain an important tool in helping showcase regional locations to investors, it is important to remember that the final decision as to where to invest rests solely with the company concerned. It is also the case that site visit activity does not necessarily reflect investment potential, as a significant proportion of all new FDI comes from existing IDA clients already present in the country. </p><p>The following table provides details of IDA site visits to Counties Roscommon and Galway between 2016 and Q1 2019:<table><tr><th>County</th><th>2016</th><th>2017</th><th>2018</th><th>Q1    2019</th></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>42</td><td>62</td><td>54</td><td>9</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The system is intended to act as a conduit for key skills which are required to develop enterprise in the State for the benefit of our economy, while simultaneously protecting the balance of the labour market.  </p>  <p>  Only where specific skills prove difficult to source within the State and wider EEA, may an employment permit be sought by an employer to hire a non-EEA national.  The Employment Permits legislation prescribes a range of criteria when considering an application for an employment permit including a Labour Market Needs Test (LMNT).  The LMNT seeks to ensure that an offer of employment is first made to people already in the local and EEA labour markets before an application is made for an employment permit to employ a non-EEA national.  The Employment Permits Act 2014 prescribed the criteria to which employers must adhere in order to satisfy the LMNT and includes the provision that employers must advertise in National Newspapers. </p>  <p>  An examination of the operation of the Labour Market Needs Test (LMNT) was included in the Review of Economic Migration Policy which was published at the end of last year.  The Report found there is widespread support for retention of the LMNT, however it recommended modernisation and extension of the process by broadening the range of advertising methods to reflect modern advertising tools.  This will be addressed in new Employment Permit legislation which is being developed to consolidate the existing Employment Permit Acts and to implement the recommendations of the Review.  A consultation with stakeholders will be undertaken as the draft legislation is being developed.</p>  <p>  The highly skilled and ineligible occupations lists for employment permit purposes are subject to regular review to ensure the regime is aligned with prevailing labour market conditions.  The twice yearly review process examines labour market conditions at occupational level and adjusts access to the Irish labour market for non-EEA nationals on the basis of available evidence.  In addition to public submissions, the review process involves the in-depth examination of research and data from sources such as SOLAS, the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN), review of relevant Reports, outputs and initiatives and input from Government Departments.  Submissions received are also considered by the Economic Migration Policy Interdepartmental Group chaired by DBEI.</p>  <p>  In order to have the status of an occupation changed to make it eligible for employment permits, there would need to be a clear demonstration that recruitment difficulties are solely due to shortages of appropriate personnel across the EEA and not to other factors such as salary and/or employment conditions.  Organisations in the sector would need to provide the necessary data to substantiate their claims.  A detailed evidence-based case for removal of an occupation from the ineligible list, based on this detailed data would need to be put forward by the lead Department for the sector in question, in this case the Department of Health, to the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation for review and consideration.</p></reply>

This includes companies who are increasingly attracted to Ireland on account of Brexit. </p>  <p>  It is also the case, of course, that many prominent international firms, including companies from the UK automotive sector, already have operations in Ireland.  Increasing the scale of those operations can be as valuable to the country, if not more so, than securing new investments altogether.  Pursuing a twin-track strategy &ndash; targeting both new-name investors and the expansion of existing projects &ndash; has helped produce record foreign direct investment (FDI) results in recent years and should lead to further investment and job creation in the years ahead.</p>  <p>  The IDA&rsquo;s efforts to win more FDI are helped by our continued status as an attractive destination for overseas firms.  Our membership of the European Union is undoubtedly a key selling point and companies are keenly aware that locating in Ireland ensures barrier-free access to an EU market of over 500 million consumers.  Ireland therefore continues to be an attractive location for overseas mobile investment, as evidenced by the 70 Brexit-related investments and over 5,000 associated jobs that have been won to date.</p></reply>

I have long since recognised the need for clear policy in this area, particularly with regard to the sector over which I have responsibility.  This is why I sought Government approval in December 2017 to the development of an adult safeguarding policy for the health sector, together with underpinning legislation as required.  This will be the first such overarching policy for the health sector.  My Department's ongoing work in this area addresses the Government's Decision to approve this proposal.  An overarching sectoral policy of this nature is a complex undertaking, not least because the health sectoral policy will cover the public, voluntary and private sector and will include cooperation, collaboration, information-sharing and referral arrangements between the health and social care sector and other relevant sectors.</p>  <p>  My Department has established an inter-agency steering group to assist with the development of the health sector adult safeguarding policy.  This group contains representation from relevant public sector bodies and a citizen representative.  A number of representatives on the inter-agency steering group are also represent their organisations on Safeguarding Ireland (SI) - for example, five of SI's member organisations and two of its individual members overlap with the membership of the steering group. </p>  <p>  Comprehensive stakeholder consultation, including with Safeguarding Ireland, has been and will be a feature of my Department&rsquo;s development of a national health sectoral policy on adult safeguarding.  A major stakeholder consultation event is planned for Autumn and a public consultation is planned in relation to a draft policy.  As a key stakeholder, Safeguarding Ireland will be invited to participate in both of these consultation processes.</p>  <p>  It is recognised that adult safeguarding is a matter for every sector, including the health and social care sector.  I am not aware of specific plans that other Departments may have in relation to their sectoral responsibilities in this area, nor am I aware of any plans to establish an all of Government group.  As noted, my Department's focus is on delivering a comprehensive health sector policy and, subsequently, any required legislation to underpin it. </p>  <p>  The level of funding available to my Department and the quantum of services to be provided by the HSE, including in relation to its adult safeguarding functions, will be considered as part of the normal Estimates and budgetary process and the national service planning process.  As an operational matter, I am referring the PQ to the HSE for direct reply to the Deputy in relation to the specific resources allocated within the HSE to its National Safeguarding Office and each of its Safeguarding and Protection Teams for the years 2015 to 2019. </p>  <p>  I understand that funding support is provided to Safeguarding Ireland from the HSE&rsquo;s allocation from the Health Vote.  As an additional support, the HSE provides a secretariat service to Safeguarding Ireland.  I do not have details on the support provided by other Departments or Agencies to Safeguarding Ireland, I am therefore referring the PQ to the HSE for direct reply to Deputy, as the HSE in providing secretariat support to Safeguarding Ireland can provide details in relation to the level and source of resources provided to Safeguarding Ireland.</p></reply>

Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key health service objective.  However, the challenge is to do this in a safe and sustainable manner.  Treatment must be appropriate and proportionate and clinical decision-making, such as prescribing, should be based on both patient needs and sound medical evidence.</p>  <p>  Lidocaine 5% medicated plasters are licensed for localised relief of post-shingles pain in adults.  This is the patch's only licensed use in Ireland.  It has been reimbursed in the community drug schemes since 2010.</p>  <p>  Clinical concern arose as usage increased significantly, to the point where more plasters were being used in Ireland than in the entire UK National Health Service.  In such situations, it is important and appropriate for clinicians to review usage and, in 2016, the HSE Medicines Management Programme (MMP) reviewed the use of the plasters.  The review estimated that only 5-10% of prescribing was for the licensed indication.</p>  <p>  From September 2017, following the clinical review, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement approval system for the patches, to support appropriate use and patient care.  Under these arrangements, the patient's GP or consultant applies to the MMP for reimbursement approval on behalf of the patient. </p>  <p>  If an application is refused, the clinician may submit an appeal to the MMP, making a clear clinical case for the patient. Information for patients and practitioners is on the HSE MMP website at: hse.ie/yourmedicines.</p>  <p>  The outcome of an application or an appeal for reimbursement of lidocaine patches is a matter between the MMP and the treating clinician.  The Deputy will appreciate that, as Minister for Health, I cannot intervene in individual cases.</p>  <p>  The decision to introduce a new reimbursement approval process for a particular treatment is a matter for the HSE.  I fully support the objectives of the HSE Medicines Management Programme.</p></reply>

In 2018, the total budget for home support services was &euro;416.8 million, which provided 17.5 million home support hours, including hours provided as part of an Intensive Home Care Package. </p>  <p>  This year, in accordance with its National Service Plan, the HSE intends to provide 17.9 million home support hours to 53,000 people and a further 360,000 hours through intensive home care packages to 235 people.  This means that in 2019 a further almost &euro;30 million has been included in the home support budget and approximately 800,000 more hours of support will be provided throughout 2019.  Despite this significant level of service provision, the demand for home support continues to grow. It is important to note that capital budgets relating to projects such as infrastructure projects are separate to current budgets relating to service delivery. </p>  <p>  At the end of March there were 52,360 people in receipt of home support.  During the first quarter of the year 4.2 million hours were delivered nationally, 4,411 new clients commenced the service and 6,238 people have been assessed and are waiting for either new or additional home support services.  This is about 220 less than for the same period in 2018.</p>  <p>  Home Support services are delivered by either HSE directly employed staff, or by staff employed by approved providers who have met the HSE requirements, and specifications, through a tender process for the delivery of Home Support Services.  As services have developed the HSE has undertaken a comprehensive modernisation and improvement of home support services to better meet the needs of service users.  The HSE and unions have been engaged over the past number of years in a comprehensive negotiation process, under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission and in line with the public service agreement with a view to implementing an overall package of measures to improve the service for service users and for the staff delivering those services.</p></reply>

This will necessitate improving population health-based planning and developing new models of care to deliver more effective and integrated care, expanding community-based care to bring that care closer to home.  The further development and modernisation of the acute care system will also be required to address current capacity challenges and increase integration between the hospital sector and community-based care.  There will also be an expansion of eligibility on a phased basis to move towards universal healthcare and support a shift to community-based care.</p></reply>

However, the WFME standards also state that medical schools must have institutional autonomy to design the curriculum (Standard 1.2). </p>  <p>  The Irish College of General Practitioners (ICGP) is the recognised professional body for general practice and is responsible for post graduate specialist medical education, training and research in the specialty of general practice. </p>  <p>  The ICGP Curriculum for GP training focuses on generic learning outcomes which foster a patient centred approach to symptoms and support evidence-based practice.  GP trainees are taught to respond to all clinical presentations by recognising any knowledge deficits they may have and to seek the most rigorous evidence to care for their patients.  The curriculum also encourages reflection on patient communication, comprehensive care, and a holistic approach.</p>  <p>  With regard to chronic neurological conditions, the ICGP curriculum contains a number of learning outcomes including for example eliciting patients&rsquo; concerns and expectations, demonstrating empathy, understanding the importance of continuity of care and coordinating care with other primary health professionals to enable chronic conditions management and rehabilitation.</p>  <p>  The ICGP Curriculum does not list the many thousands of clinical conditions which a GP may encounter.  It does reference the most commonly encountered conditions and also those which could lead to devastating physical consequence for patients if not diagnosed early.  It also equips future GPs with the attitudes and skills to deal empathetically with all presentations. </p>  <p>  The ICGP continues to review the Curriculum on an ongoing basis to ensure it supports the development of GPs in a manner most fit for the general demands of the Irish Health system. </p>  <p>  The College does not have a specific educational module at present for practicing GPs on the topic of post viral fatigue syndrome.  Consideration will be given to the inclusion of this as an educational topic at future ICGP national conferences/educational events.</p></reply>

This commitment is outlined in the Programme for Partnership Government, which is guided by two principles: equality of opportunity and improving the quality of life for people with disabilities. </p>  <p>  The Department of Health has committed to the enactment of legislation to underpin a stand-alone, statutory scheme for the financing and regulation of home-care by 2021.  The statutory scheme will introduce clear rules in relation to what services individuals are eligible for and how decisions are made on allocating services.  The new scheme will help to improve access to the home care services that people need.  The system of regulation for home care will help to ensure that the public can be confident that the services provided are of a high standard. </p>  <p>  Although much work has been done, a significant amount of work still remains to be undertaken before decisions are reached on the form of the home care scheme and the system of regulation.  This is necessary to ensure that the reforms are successful, affordable and sustainable.  The matter is however being progressed as quickly as possible. </p>  <p>  HSE Disability Services provide personal and social supports based on the needs of the individual, rather than the provision of services based on a specific diagnosis or condition. </p>  <p>  As the question relates to services provided by the HSE, I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Psychiatric Nurses Association (PNA) state that their industrial action is in connection with two substantive issues.  The first is the automated deduction of union subscriptions.  The second is the refusal by the HSE to engage in negotiations with the PNA or to recognise the PNA as representing ambulance personnel. </p>  <p>  The focus of the National Ambulance Service in all circumstances is to ensure that service and care delivery is not compromised in any manner.  During the day of industrial action on 31 May the National Ambulance Service had a robust and detailed contingency plan in place to minimise any disruption and to ensure that patient safety would not be compromised.  This included managers who are qualified paramedics being available to carry out front line duties as well as the Department of Defence making a number of appropriately crewed ambulances available.</p>  <p>  NASRA is a group which is not recognised by the HSE and does not have negotiating rights.  The PNA does not have negotiating rights for ambulance personnel.  Ambulance front line personnel are fully represented by SIPTU, at all levels of employment with HSE, the Department and other fora.  Industrial relations policy has had a long standing objective of avoiding fragmentation in worker representation in public sector employments, and the trade union movement generally, so as to facilitate the orderly conduct of bargaining and other aspects of industrial relations.  I have had engagement with my officials concerning this dispute.  Government policy supports the policy of consolidation of trade unions, such as has happened recently in the formation of FORSA.  Giving recognition to NASRA would run counter to this objective.</p></reply>

Following analysis, the most appropriate project for this PPP project is a bundle of Community Nursing Units.  The HSE is currently undertaking significant planning and preparation work to progress this PPP project.</p>  <p>  PPPs offer an alternative model for delivering infrastructure, that can be effective in particular circumstances, and are subject to the same robust and rigorous project appraisal process as traditionally procured projects, in accordance with the Public Spending Code.</p>  <p>  The National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, also has a role in advising on the best way of financing large projects, which would include all PPPs.</p>  <p>  The Community Nursing Unit PPP will be delivered as a design, build, finance, and operate model (DBFOM).  The PPP company will be responsible for the design and build of the Community Nursing Units, including the funding the costs of construction which are estimated at &euro;150m.  Thereafter the PPP company will be responsible for providing facilities management and maintenance services for the contract period, typically 25 years, during which the HSE will pay the company an annual unitary charge payment.  At the end of this contract period the units will be handed over to the HSE who will be responsible directly for the facility management services provided previously by the PPP company.</p>  <p>  The HSE will be responsible for the provision of care services within these units.  Therefore the PPP company will not have any input into the clinical operation or staffing of these units, as that is a matter for the HSE.</p>  <p>  I understand that St Joseph's CNU, Ardee, Co. Louth is currently being considered for delivery as part of the PPP programme, while St. Mary's CNU, Drogheda, Co. Louth is expected to be delivered through the HSE's capital programme.</p></reply>

In this regard, the Government is committed to improving waiting times for hospital appointments and procedures.</p><p>The joint Department of Health/HSE/National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) Scheduled Care Access Plan 2019 was published in March and sets out measures to improve care for patients waiting for scheduled care in 2019 by reducing waiting times for inpatient/day case treatment and outpatient appointments. The plan places a strong focus on ten high-volume Inpatient/Day Case procedures. When combined with HSE activity, it is projected that the NTPF will be in a position to offer treatment to all clinically suitable patients waiting more than 6 months for one of these high-volume procedures.</p><p>A key element of the Plan is the stabilisation of the Outpatient Waiting List. Under the Plan the HSE, in line with the National Service Plan, will aim to deliver 3.3 million outpatient appointments, of which approximately 1 million will be first appointments. For its part the NTPF will aim to deliver 40,000 first Outpatient appointments.</p><p>The plan includes a target to reduce the number of patients waiting for and Inpatient/Day Case procedure from just over 70,000 in December 2018 to 60,000 by year end and to reduce the number of patients waiting for a first Outpatient appointment from over 516,000 at the end of 2018 to under 509,000 by the end of 2019. The latter target takes into account the fact that more than 800,000 new patients will be added to the Outpatient waiting list in 2019, a figure that is based on trends for the previous two years. </p><p>The NTPF advise that over recent months they have placed a particular focus on engaging with hospital groups and individual hospitals to identify outpatient waiting list proposals. While the NTPF have already approved over 38,000 outpatient appointments, they advise that the impact of these initiatives may not be seen until the end of the year. Approximately 75% of outpatient appointments approved to date relate to 4 high-volume specialities, specifically Ophthalmology, ENT, Orthopaedics, and Dermatology. </p><p>In addition, my Department is working with the HSE and NTPF, under the Access Plan, with the objective of developing medium-long term improvement initiatives for patient access to hospital procedures. This will include moving care to more appropriate settings and providing care at the lowest level of complexity such as providing ophthalmology in the community; maximising the use of Advanced Nurse Practitioner led clinics; and physiotherapists to manage orthopaedic clinics.</p><p>Navan Hospital IPDC waiting list has increased by 12% (+71) when compared to the same period last year but has decreased by 19% (-162) when compared to August 2018. Navan Hospital Outpatient waiting list has increased by 20% (+1,196) when compared to the same period last year.</p><p>*Due to the small volume of patients waiting in timebands over 12 months on the IPDC waiting list, and over 24 months on the Outpatient waiting list, to preserve patient confidentiality, these numbers have been included within the broader timebands of 12+ months and 24+ months respectively. </p><p>Navan Hospital IPDC April 2018-April 2019<table><tr><th></th><th>0-3 Mths</th><th>3-6 Mths</th><th>6-9 Mths</th><th>9-12 Mths</th><th>12+ Mths</th><th>Grand Total</th></tr><tr><td>Apr-19</td><td>379</td><td>156</td><td>86</td><td>53</td><td>6</td><td>680</td></tr><tr><td>Mar-19</td><td>346</td><td>201</td><td>100</td><td>56</td><td>8</td><td>711</td></tr><tr><td>Feb-19</td><td>371</td><td>204</td><td>115</td><td>38</td><td>12</td><td>740</td></tr><tr><td>Jan-19</td><td>359</td><td>222</td><td>137</td><td>33</td><td>7</td><td>758</td></tr><tr><td>Dec-18</td><td>372</td><td>205</td><td>121</td><td>20</td><td>3</td><td>721</td></tr><tr><td>Nov-18</td><td>384</td><td>225</td><td>99</td><td>26</td><td>8</td><td>742</td></tr><tr><td>Oct-18</td><td>386</td><td>276</td><td>95</td><td>35</td><td>8</td><td>800</td></tr><tr><td>Sep-18</td><td>413</td><td>287</td><td>73</td><td>46</td><td>11</td><td>830</td></tr><tr><td>Aug-18</td><td>439</td><td>261</td><td>83</td><td>52</td><td>7</td><td>842</td></tr><tr><td>Jul-18</td><td>459</td><td>203</td><td>89</td><td>35</td><td>6</td><td>792</td></tr><tr><td>Jun-18</td><td>479</td><td>129</td><td>66</td><td>35</td><td>8</td><td>717</td></tr><tr><td>May-18</td><td>432</td><td>145</td><td>55</td><td>59</td><td>8</td><td>699</td></tr><tr><td>Apr-18</td><td>339</td><td>154</td><td>85</td><td>23</td><td>8</td><td>609</td></tr></table></p><p>Navan Hospital Outpatient April 2018-April 2019<table><tr><th></th><th>0-3Months</th><th>3-6Months</th><th>6-9Months</th><th>9-12Months</th><th>12-15Months</th><th>15-18Months</th><th>18-21Months</th><th>21-24Months</th><th>24+Months</th><th>Grand Total</th></tr><tr><td>Apr-19</td><td>1727</td><td>1030</td><td>1155</td><td>1006</td><td>753</td><td>509</td><td>435</td><td>226</td><td>195</td><td>7036</td></tr><tr><td>Mar-19</td><td>1208</td><td>1002</td><td>1082</td><td>707</td><td>566</td><td>440</td><td>237</td><td>171</td><td>0</td><td>5413</td></tr><tr><td>Feb-19</td><td>1580</td><td>1300</td><td>987</td><td>1063</td><td>655</td><td>564</td><td>423</td><td>230</td><td>159</td><td>6961</td></tr><tr><td>Jan-19</td><td>1449</td><td>1259</td><td>1079</td><td>959</td><td>592</td><td>588</td><td>388</td><td>201</td><td>127</td><td>6642</td></tr><tr><td>Dec-18</td><td>1657</td><td>1083</td><td>1135</td><td>773</td><td>630</td><td>555</td><td>359</td><td>186</td><td>92</td><td>6470</td></tr><tr><td>Nov-18</td><td>1723</td><td>1071</td><td>1096</td><td>737</td><td>628</td><td>569</td><td>319</td><td>174</td><td>90</td><td>6407</td></tr><tr><td>Oct-18</td><td>1614</td><td>1140</td><td>1032</td><td>697</td><td>661</td><td>558</td><td>260</td><td>171</td><td>81</td><td>6214</td></tr><tr><td>Sep-18</td><td>1541</td><td>1254</td><td>923</td><td>696</td><td>665</td><td>532</td><td>241</td><td>200</td><td>26</td><td>6078</td></tr><tr><td>Aug-18</td><td>1542</td><td>1235</td><td>888</td><td>742</td><td>683</td><td>511</td><td>206</td><td>201</td><td>16</td><td>6024</td></tr><tr><td>Jul-18</td><td>1632</td><td>1170</td><td>854</td><td>748</td><td>677</td><td>437</td><td>217</td><td>165</td><td>16</td><td>5916</td></tr><tr><td>Jun-18</td><td>1645</td><td>1026</td><td>991</td><td>776</td><td>702</td><td>329</td><td>261</td><td>82</td><td>12</td><td>5824</td></tr><tr><td>May-18</td><td>1612</td><td>1063</td><td>997</td><td>775</td><td>716</td><td>323</td><td>262</td><td>74</td><td>11</td><td>5833</td></tr><tr><td>Apr-18</td><td>1621</td><td>1054</td><td>1038</td><td>834</td><td>632</td><td>315</td><td>247</td><td>88</td><td>11</td><td>5840</td></tr></table></p></reply>

These 10 procedures account for over a third of the active inpatient day case waiting list and represent 60% of NTPF planned activity in 2019.</p><p>In relation to the particular matter raised by the Deputy, the table provides the Inpatient and Day Case waiting list figures by hospital for the years 2016, 2017, 2018 and to the end of April 2019.</p><p>Inpatient/Day Case Waiting List - Orthopaedics by Hospital<table><tr><th>South South West HG</th><th></th><th>Apr-19</th><th>Dec-18</th><th>Dec-17</th><th>Dec-16</th></tr><tr><td></td><td>Bantry General Hospital</td><td>9</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Cork University Hospital</td><td>9</td><td>2</td><td>27</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Lourdes Orthopaedic Hospital Kilcreene</td><td>279</td><td>252</td><td>374</td><td>352</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>South Infirmary Victoria University Hospital</td><td>447</td><td>466</td><td>394</td><td>423</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>University Hospital Kerry</td><td>145</td><td>152</td><td>60</td><td>68</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>University Hospital Waterford</td><td>142</td><td>149</td><td>166</td><td>138</td></tr><tr><td>University of Limerick HG</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Croom Orthopaedic Hospital</td><td>186</td><td>145</td><td>78</td><td>159</td></tr><tr><td>RCSI Hospital Group</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Beaumont Hospital</td><td>183</td><td>162</td><td>175</td><td>191</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Louth County Hospital</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>18</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Connolly Hospital Blanchardstown</td><td>38</td><td>44</td><td>71</td><td>80</td></tr><tr><td>Ireland East Hospital Group</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Cappagh National Orthopaedic Hospital</td><td>1531</td><td>1413</td><td>1813</td><td>2055</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Mater Misericordiae University Hospital</td><td>129</td><td>145</td><td>223</td><td>184</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Our Lady's Hospital Navan</td><td>596</td><td>641</td><td>542</td><td>420</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>St. Vincent's University Hospital</td><td>24</td><td>25</td><td>40</td><td>51</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>St. Michael's Hospital</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>21</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin Midlands HG</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Midland Regional Hospital Tullamore</td><td>984</td><td>1067</td><td>1088</td><td>1237</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>St. James's Hospital</td><td>523</td><td>569</td><td>574</td><td>424</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Tallaght University Hospital</td><td>1476</td><td>1412</td><td>1659</td><td>1776</td></tr><tr><td>Saolta Hospital Group</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Letterkenny University Hospital</td><td>414</td><td>438</td><td>548</td><td>553</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Galway University Hospitals</td><td>1293</td><td>1199</td><td>1005</td><td>799</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Sligo University Hospital</td><td>391</td><td>271</td><td>392</td><td>429</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Mayo University Hospital</td><td>1297</td><td>1234</td><td>1142</td><td>823</td></tr><tr><td>Childrens' Health Ireland</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CHI at Crumlin</td><td>0</td><td>355</td><td>572</td><td>616</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CHI at Temple St</td><td>0</td><td>479</td><td>549</td><td>471</td></tr><tr><td>Small Volume Hospitals</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Small Volume Hospitals</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Grand Total</td><td><div>10099</div></td><td><div>10623</div></td><td><div>11533</div></td><td><div>11272</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

At its core, the strategy focuses on establishing the building blocks for a significant shift in the way in which health services are delivered in Ireland particularly in the shift of acute to community care settings.  It seeks to deliver on the Future of Healthcare Committee&rsquo;s vision of a health system in which care is provided in the right place, at the right time, by the right person and is always provided on the basis of need and not ability to pay with a priority focus on developing primary and community services within a national policy context. </p>  <p>  Sl&aacute;intecare is about delivering a health and social care service that meets the needs of our population and attracts and retains the very best healthcare professionals, managers and staff.</p>  <p>  With appropriate, well-governed investment, we will deliver a service that is given by the right team at low or no charge. Crucially, engaging with staff, staff representative bodies and the wider stakeholder network, to find new ways of working to deliver expanded services, will be essential to optimise the wealth of skills and knowledge inherent in our health workforce.  </p>  <p>  A detailed Sl&aacute;intecare Action plan for 2019 was completed and published on March 13   2019. The Action Plan sets out detailed deliverables and timeframes for 239 deliverables that are to be progressed in 2019 as part of the implementation of the Sl&aacute;intecare vision and firmly establishes a programmatic approach to the delivery of the Sl&aacute;intecare Strategy. The 28 deliverables for Quarter 1 are on track.</p></reply>

The exact prevalence of fibromyalgia in Ireland is not known but is estimated at 2% of the population. </p><p>Fibromyalgia can be a difficult condition to diagnose because there is no specific test and the symptoms can be similar to those of other conditions. There is currently no cure for this condition as the cause is unknown and the treatment requires interventions from various medical specialists for management of symptoms as they arise.</p><p>Fibromyalgia is not classified as a disability and there are currently no plans for its reclassification.  There are no plans at present to add this condition to the list of conditions currently listed under the Long-Term illness scheme.</p><p>It is important to note that to help the sufferers of this condition with the cost of the treatment, any patient is eligible to apply to the Drugs Payment Scheme or to apply for a Medical Card.</p><p>Under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;124 a month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals with ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p><p>People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. In the assessment process, the HSE can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.  </p><p>  People who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of GP consultations.</p><p>General medical services are provided by GPs.

These intervals are based on best international evidence. </p>  <p>  Regrettably, lab turnaround times for smear test results increased significantly during 2018 as a result of both out of cycle smears and greater uptake generally. However, the programme is now back to normal call-recall procedures and lab turnaround times are improving. While they can be as long as 30 weeks, two out of three labs are now returning results in eight weeks or less.  </p>  <p>  While a backlog of around 80,000 smears had built up, this has now begun to fall and was reported by the HSE to be down to around 54,474 by the 9th of June. </p>  <p>  Since the 1st of May, the third laboratory, which has the largest backlog, has ceased accepting new slides and is focused on clearing its backlog. I am pleased to say that the HSE has now agreed a deal with Quest Diagnostics to provide the additional capacity necessary to ensure the continuation of the national cervical screening programme. </p>  <p>  It is important to say also that the HSE has advised that the natural history of cervical cancer would indicate that the disease would normally develop over a period of 10 to 15 years. It has said that in this context, a delay in the return of cervical screening results, whilst undesirable, poses a very low risk to women. </p>  <p>  In relation to the correspondence forwarded by the Deputy, it is my understanding that the same correspondence was sent to CervicalCheck on 21st May 2019, who responded directly to the individual, copying the Deputy, on 22nd May.   </p>  <p>  The individual concerned opted to have her screening test taken in October 2018 processed as a private smear test with MedLab.  CervicalCheck is a government funded public programme and there is no provision  to  hold  information  (i.e. results or  otherwise)  pertaining  to  private smears.  These are considered non programme smears. The most up to date record relating to this individual is that the last screening test with the programme was in February 2016 and that they would be called in 3 years  for a repeat test. CervicalCheck then sent a letter dated 27.03.2019 as a follow on from the recommendation of this person's 2016 screening test.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the deputy.</p></reply>

Under the requirements of the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, the company had 28 days to respond or make representations to the HSE&rsquo;s proposed decision. </p>  <p>  I am advised by the HSE that the manufacturer submitted additional information and that the matter remains under consideration by the HSE.</p></reply>

The matters complained of included the impact of certain conduct on the health and well-being of personnel and procurement irregularities in the NMBI.  I am advised that the initial complaint did not characterise the matters as falling within the provisions of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 2005. The matter was referred to the Board of the NMBI to investigate in September 2014. In late September 2014 senior officials of my Department met with the President, Vice-President and another Board member and stated that it was important that a prompt, impartial and proportionate investigation must take place. </p>  <p>  In November 2014 my officials received a response from the Board of the NMBI in which the Board reported that it had formed the view that there appeared to be no foundation to the matters raised in the protected disclosure.  In order to be satisfied that the matter had been appropriately reviewed and an evidence based conclusion reached, officials from my Department requested the NMBI to set out the basis upon which it had arrived at this conclusion together with all evidence and documentation that had been relied upon.  The NMBI responded to say it was of the view that it was not appropriate to forward the material associated with the investigation.  My officials wrote again on this matter in December and, in the absence of receiving such assurances, the Secretary General of my Department wrote to the NMBI in January 2015.  The Secretary General conveyed the Department's continuing concerns that the NMBI had not provided evidence to satisfy the Department that the allegations had been investigated in an objective and transparent manner and set out the Department's strong view that the NMBI should appoint a third party with appropriate expertise and experience to carry out a review of the complaint.  </p>  <p>  In February 2015 the Board of the NMBI informed my Department that a third party had been appointed to carry out a preliminary external review of the complaint. My Department acknowledged this correspondence and stated that it looked forward to the outcome of the review. The review was completed in May 2015 and the Board of the NMBI informed my Department of the recommendations contained in the review in May 2015. In transmitting the recommendations to my Department by letter, the President of the NMBI copied a Board member and the CEO of the NMBI. My Department was not furnished with a copy of the review itself and is not familiar with the methodology adopted in the completion of the review or, for example, the manner in which interviews were conducted or the specific individuals who participated in the exercise.  Subsequently, in submitting a report to my officials in May 2016, the NMBI advised that the nature of some of the disclosures focused on what would generally be termed Human Resources related issues and the investigation of these was compounded by the departure of a former staff member.  I understand that the review conducted by the third party was shared with the person that was the subject of the complaint prior to the recommendations of the report being shared with my Department.</p>  <p>  On foot of that review, two reports were commissioned.  Crowe Horwath was engaged to carry out an Organisational Review and BDO was engaged to carry out a review of Remuneration and Contract Management of Non-Permanent Employees. BDO submitted two reports, the first in September and the second in November 2015. Crowe Horwath submitted a report in November 2015. The reports were accepted in full by the Board of the NMBI and they began to implement the recommendations.  This has resulted in a comprehensive change to the governance arrangements in the NMBI.  I can inform the Deputy that my Department was advised by the NMBI on 25 August 2015 that it did not intend to pursue the recommendation relating to an electronic record. However, I can advise the Deputy that my Department was subsequently (May 2016) advised of the steps that the NMBI took in respect of this specific recommendation.  The NMBI purchased specific software to enable electronic searching by key words and identified a number of documents for review.  This review took place and the complainant was advised of its outcome.  The NMBI further advised my Department that it was reviewing and updating its policies and practices in relation to NMBI provided technology and resources. </p>  <p>  The Board of the NMBI submitted a final report to my Department in May 2016 advising that the complaints raised in the Protected Disclosure had been upheld by the Board. The Board thanked the complainant for bringing these matters to its attention and stated that it had learned lessons. The Board set out a number of actions it had commenced to address the matters raised to ensure that similar situations will not arise again. </p>  <p>  I am advised that the complainant wrote to officials in my Department in February 2016 to outline their dissatisfaction with a number of matters in relation to the handling of their complaint. Included in this letter was a statement alleging that a person had sought to encourage the complainant to withdraw an element of their complaint.  I can further advise the Deputy that officials in my Department are aware that the complainant made a complaint to the Ombudsman regarding the conduct of the investigation.  </p>  <p>  I can advise the Deputy that my Department commissioned an independent review to examine the Department&rsquo;s handling of the protected disclosure. This review found that the Department had acted appropriately at all times, albeit I am aware based upon subsequent engagement between my officials and the complainant that the complainant does not accept the findings of this review. </p>  <p>  In view of the reports commissioned, the findings of same, and the steps taken by the NMBI to implement the recommendations of the reports, I am satisfied that significant action has been taken on foot of the complaints made.  These complaints were an important input to the enhancement of governance in the NMBI. </p>  <p>  The Deputy is aware of and has raised the obligations set out in the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 which provide that a person who receives a protected disclosure in the course of their duties shall not disclose information that might identify the person making the disclosure. Given that the matters referred to by the Deputy relate to a relatively small organisation, I am conscious that to discuss them in great detail may run a risk of inadvertently revealing information that could identify the discloser.</p>  <p>  In relation to the payment of legal fees, reference to such payment is included in correspondence from the complainant to my Department. My Department has requested that the NMBI provide the Deputy with information as to whether such payment was made and, if so, the reasons. </p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy has asked what responsibility I have for matters in the NMBI as Minister in the context of the Nurses and Midwives Act, 2011. I can advise the Deputy that the Act conveys certain powers on me as Minister.  For example, section 9 provides that I may require the NMBI to provide me with information in relation to the performance of its functions and section 11 provides that I may give general policy directions to the Board. The NMBI is an independent statutory body.  Its Board is made up of 23 people, some of whom are elected by registered members of the nursing and midwifery profession, some nominated by prescribed bodies and some appointed by the Minister for Health.</p></reply>

Lyme disease is a notifiable disease in Ireland since 2012.  The infection is confirmed by blood tests which look for antibodies to <i>Borrelia burgdorferi </i>produced by an infected person's body in response to the infection.  These normally take several weeks to develop and may not be present in the early stages of the disease.  </p><p>Laboratories in Ireland generally follow the standard approach to Lyme diagnostics which is a two-stage approach and involves using a sensitive enzyme immunoassay (EIA) as an initial, screening step.  Screening EIAs can be insufficiently specific, giving false-positive reactions in the presence of other spirochaete infections including syphilis, and certain viral infections including glandular fever.  In addition, sera from patients with autoimmune disorders and other inflammatory conditions can also lead to false-positive results. </p><p>Testing which is performed abroad may be performed in laboratories which have not met National or International Accreditation (Quality Standards).  These tests may be more likely to give a &ldquo;false positive&rdquo; result.  In undertaking Lyme testing, it is essential that the results are interpreted in the light of the clinical condition of the patient.  Irish laboratories have their own quality assurance methods to make sure the tests are working correctly as well as being accredited by the Irish National Accreditation Body to perform the test correctly.</p><p>If the result of this initial screen is equivocal, the patient's samples are referred to the U.K.'s Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory (RIPL) Service of Public Health England Porton which uses a two-tier system recommended by American and European authorities.  This involves a screening serological test followed by a confirmatory serological test.  All clinical (and other) laboratories must undergo continuous quality assurance to ensure that the quality of the diagnostics they provide is maintained at the highest international level for human diagnostics.  This two tier approach gives a great degree of certainty around the diagnosis of Lyme.  All testing in Ireland is confirmed by the RIPL. </p><p>Lyme disease is a well-recognised infection, which is familiar to GPs and hospital specialists (especially those specialising in Infectious Diseases, Neurology, Dermatology Cardiology and Microbiology).  Accordingly, such specialists would be very familiar with how to manage such patients, and as a result, all physicians deal with Lyme disease, as they would with any other infectious disease for which they have responsibility.  As testing and treatment for Lyme borelliosis is widely available in all major hospitals in Ireland there is no need for people to travel to other EU Member States for diagnosis or treatment. </p></reply>

A table outlining the core funding allocated to Drug and Alcohol Task Forces in 2019 is attached.</p><p>On 6th March 2019, I announced additional funding of &euro;1 million for the implementation of the National Drugs Strategy; &quot;Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery&quot;. This funding, which will be provided on a recurring, multi-annual basis, will address the priorities set down in the Strategy including early harm reduction responses, emerging trends in substance misuse, and improving services for at-risk groups.</p><p>Following consideration of the outcome of a consultation process with Task Forces and the HSE, I approved a three-strand funding model for this additional funding. Task Forces were notified of this funding model on 18 May.</p><p>Strand 1 of the funding model will allocate &euro;20,000 to each Task Force in 2019. In addition, &euro;10,000 will be provided on a recurring annual basis from 2020 onwards and will increase core funding by that amount. This additional funding can be used to enhance local drug and alcohol services.</p><p>Strand 2 will fund 12 strategic health initiatives on a regional basis, for a total of &euro;190,000 over three years, with &euro;40,000 in 2019, &euro;60,000 in 2020 and 2021, and &euro;30,000 in 2022 (on a half-year basis).</p><p>Task Forces and CHOs will be required to work together to develop proposals for funding. There will be a minimum of one strategic initiative per CHO. Two strategic initiatives will be funded in CHOs 7 and 9 where there are multiple Task Forces. The remaining initiative will be allocated to the next best quality application.

As a general rule public transport should be used in all circumstances where it is an option. This is in keeping with the principle of main-streaming with a clear focus on ensuring persons with a disability have access to the normal range of services and participate in community life as far as possible.  It must be noted that in general, day service users are in receipt of disability allowance and are automatically entitled to the Free Travel Pass, so there should be no additional cost burden at an individual level.</p>  <p>  In regard to developments to meet the day service needs of school leavers each year, all new service locations under development are located as close as possible to where people reside so as to reduce the travel time for each person and enable them to be more connected with their own local community.</p>  <p>  Funding is not provided for the transportation of young people to and from day services. However when all other options are exhausted and a person cannot avail of a day service because they do not have transport to attend, the service provider is advised to use some of the service money to cover the transport costs &ndash; this usually results in the provision of a reduced quantum of service.</p>  <p>  The HSE intends to liaise with the National Transport Authority and disability service providers to explore ways in which the Authority&rsquo;s services could assist people with disabilities. The National Transport Authority has a total of 17 Transport co-ordinating units called Local Link which provide safe secure and reliable Public Transport services in local and rural areas of Ireland through a combination of scheduled Public Transport services and door to door services. The HSE plans to explore the opportunities these units may provide to people with disabilities to access day services and participate in the social, educational and economic life of their local communities.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy's question relates to a service matter concerning an individual, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

Budget 2019 announced that the Government has further increased investment in tackling waiting lists, with funding to the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) increasing from &euro;55 million in 2018 to &euro;75 million in 2019. </p><p>The joint Department of Health/HSE/NTPF Scheduled Care Access Plan 2019 was published in March and sets out measures to improve care for patients waiting for scheduled care in 2019 by reducing waiting times for inpatient/day case treatment and outpatient appointments. The plan will place a strong focus on a number of high-volume procedures. When combined with HSE activity, it is projected that the NTPF will be in a position to offer treatment to all clinically suitable patients waiting more than 6 months for one of these high-volume procedures.</p><p>A key element of the Plan is the stabilisation of the Outpatient Waiting List. Under the Plan the HSE, in line with the National Service Plan, will aim to deliver 3.3 million outpatient appointments, of which approximately 1 million will be first appointments. Under the plan the NTPF will use &euro;6 million to deliver 40,000 first Outpatient appointments.</p><p>The plan includes a target that the number of patients waiting for a first Outpatient appointment will fall from over 516,000 at the end of 2018 to under 509,000 by the end of 2019. This target takes into account the more than 800,000 new patients who will be added to the Outpatient waiting list in 2019; a figure that is based on trends for the previous two years. </p><p>While the meeting of short-term targets is always welcome, more can be achieved and, in this regard, the HSE, Department of Health and NTPF, under the Access Plan, will work together with the objective of developing medium-long term improvement initiatives for patient access to hospital procedures. This will include moving care to more appropriate settings and providing care at the lowest level of complexity such as providing ophthalmology in the community; maximising the use of Advanced Nurse Practitioner led clinics; and physiotherapists to manage orthopaedic clinics.</p><p>The data requested by the Deputy is outlined in the appended table. It should be noted, as advised by the NTPF, that the Dublin Maternity Hospitals (Holles Street, the Coombe, and the Rotunda) do not submit full waiting list data to the NTPF. The Coombe and the Rotunda only submit Outpatient data, while Holles Street does not submit any data.</p><p>National Gynaecology IPDC Waiting List<table><tr><th>0-3 Mths</th><th>3-6 Mths</th><th>6-9 Mths</th><th>9-12 Mths</th><th>12-15 Mths</th><th>15-18 Mths</th></tr><tr><td>1866</td><td>1110</td><td>783</td><td>470</td><td>222</td><td>119</td></tr></table></p><p>National Gynaecology IPDC Waiting List (cntd.)<table><tr><th>18-24 Mths</th><th>24-36 Mths</th><th>36-48 Mths</th><th>48+ Mths</th><th>Grand Total</th></tr><tr><td>171</td><td>71</td><td>8</td><td>4</td><td>4824</td></tr></table></p><p>National Gynaecology Outpatient Waiting List<table><tr><th>0-3<br /><br />Months</th><th>3-6<br /><br />Months</th><th>6-9<br /><br />Months</th><th>9-12<br /><br />Months</th><th>12-15<br /><br />Months</th><th>15-18<br /><br />Months</th><th>18-21<br /><br />Months</th><th>21-24<br /><br />Months</th><th>24-36<br /><br />Months</th><th>36-48<br /><br />Months</th><th>48+<br /><br />Months</th><th>Grand Total</th></tr><tr><td>11861</td><td>5258</td><td>4330</td><td>3003</td><td>1725</td><td>914</td><td>665</td><td>510</td><td>930</td><td>174</td><td>7</td><td>29377</td></tr></table></p><p>National Gynaecology Outpatient Waiting List (cntd.)<table><tr><th>18-21<br /><br />Months</th><th>21-24<br /><br />Months</th><th>24-36<br /><br />Months</th><th>36-48<br /><br />Months</th><th>48+<br /><br />Months</th><th>Grand Total</th></tr><tr><td>665</td><td>510</td><td>930</td><td>174</td><td>7</td><td>29377</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings. </p>  <p>  The legislation underpinning the NHSS requires each private or voluntary nursing home to negotiate and agree a price for long-term residential care services with the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) should they wish to be an approved nursing home for the purposes of the Scheme. The NTPF negotiates with proprietors of registered nursing homes to reach agreement in relation to the maximum price that will be charged by each nursing home for the provision of long-term residential care services to residents participating in the NHSS. The process of setting prices with individual private and voluntary nursing homes is commonly referred to as the NTPF pricing mechanism. </p>  <p>  Cobh Community Hospital is not funded directly by the HSE as they receive their agreed NTPF rate through this pricing mechanism, under NHSS. The NTPF has statutory independence in the performance of its function and negotiates with each nursing home on an individual basis. The Department of Health has no role in these negotiations. </p></reply>

The legislation also provides for a period of public consultation.</p>  <p>  In the case of Aquaculture licensing, a foreshore licence is issued as a companion licence to an Aquaculture licence. Legislation governing aquaculture licensing provides for an appeals mechanism.

These are intended to complement sanctions and promote compliance and were required to be in place on 1st of January 2012.    Both of these EU regulations went through the ordinary legislative procedures at EU level which would have included widespread consultation with interested parties including the Member States, Advisory Councils, NGOs and the fishing Industry.  The matter has also been discussed at industry liaison meetings over the years.  The EU regulations are highly prescriptive in relation to licence holders, leaving little room for further negotiation.    </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that I am fully committed to delivering on Ireland's legal obligations in this regard at the earliest possible date.  </p></reply>

I have stressed the need for the Commission to be ready to deploy a range of measures to mitigate the potential impacts on the agri-food and fisheries sector. Avoiding a no-deal Brexit continues to be the Government&rsquo;s overriding policy priority.</p>  <p>  I am also keenly aware that the past few months have been very difficult for beef farmers in particular, following a difficult year for farm incomes in 2018 due to weather conditions. There has been a prolonged and exceptional period of depressed prices since last autumn, with the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the outcome of Brexit, among other factors, contributing to this market disturbance.</p>  <p>  The recent announcement by Commissioner Hogan of EU exceptional aid for the Irish beef sector is very welcome in this context.  I have been making the case for some time for an exceptional aid package from the EU Commission for Irish beef farmers, at EU Council of Agriculture Minister meetings, and in direct consultation with the Commission. The announcement by the Commissioner is another example of the importance of EU solidarity when it comes to facing significant economic challenges.</p>  <p>  This exceptional aid provision will be given effect through a Commission Implementing Regulation. While Member States will be invited to give an opinion on the draft Regulation through the Commission&rsquo;s Common Market Organisation Management Committee, the draft Regulation is within the Commission&rsquo;s own legal competence, and is not for negotiation with Ireland or indeed other Member States, in terms of its content.</p>  <p>  Further details on the aid package will be announced in due course following the appropriate stakeholder consultation.</p></reply>

However, some products are allowed for use on crops close to harvest for the control of problematic weeds. It should be noted that the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) review of glyphosate included an assessment of potential dietary exposure that could result from pre-harvest use and concluded that this use does not pose a risk to human health. </p>  <p>  With regard to glyphosate use in public spaces, there is a requirement through the Sustainable Use of Pesticides Directive (Directive 2009/128/EC) to minimise the use of pesticides in such areas.  This applies to all pesticides, not just those containing glyphosate.  Preference should be given to non-chemical weed control methods and, where this is not practical or economically feasible, it is only permissible to use products not classified as being hazardous to the environment. My Department has produced specific guidance for both public and private users alike to support sustainable use of pesticides in the amenity sector.</p>  <p>  Regarding the use of plant protection products containing glyphosate in Ireland, my Department continues to monitor international peer-reviewed scientific evidence and to follow EFSA and European Chemicals Agency conclusions and guidance.</p></reply>

I have stressed the need for the Commission to be ready to deploy a range of measures to mitigate the potential impacts on the agrifood and fisheries sector. Avoiding a no-deal Brexit continues to be the Government&rsquo;s overriding policy priority.</p>  <p>  I am also keenly aware that the past few months have been very difficult for beef farmers in particular, following a difficult year for farm incomes in 2018 due to weather conditions. There has been a prolonged and exceptional period of depressed prices since last autumn, with the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the outcome of Brexit, among other factors, contributing to this market disturbance.</p>  <p>  The recent announcement by Commissioner Hogan of EU exceptional aid for the Irish beef sector is very welcome in this context.  I have been making the case for some time for an exceptional aid package from the EU Commission for Irish beef farmers, at EU Council of Agriculture Minister meetings, and in direct consultation with the Commission. The announcement by the Commissioner is another example of the importance of EU solidarity when it comes to facing significant economic challenges.</p>  <p>  This exceptional aid provision will be given effect through a Commission Implementing Regulation. While Member States will be invited to give an opinion on the draft Regulation through the Commission&rsquo;s Common Market Organisation Management Committee, the draft Regulation is within the Commission&rsquo;s own legal competence, and is not for negotiation with Ireland or indeed other Member States, in terms of its content.</p>  <p>  Further details on the aid package will be announced in due course following the appropriate stakeholder consultation.</p></reply>

The agreement involves both parties working closely together to help ensure the country&rsquo;s statutory drainage objectives are achieved with an appropriate focus on the protection of fishery habitats and resources.</p>  <p>  The agreement has been secured at a time when Government investment in flood risk management operations is significant and follows the recent publication of the Government&rsquo;s Flood Risk Management Plans. This new partnership formalises the historical working relationship between the two organisations and commits them to continuing their positive engagement for the benefit of Ireland&rsquo;s fishery habitats and resources.</p>  <p>  Under the agreement, both parties will work across the Environmental River Enhancement Programme (EREP) and will focus on:</p>  <p>  - A series of scientific investigations to further understand environmental impacts of river maintenance works.</p>  <p>  - Development of best practice to minimise environmental impacts and maximise environmental gain of river maintenance and flood relief activities.</p>  <p>  - Work programme to identify barriers to fish passage on arterially drained rivers that have potential for improvements works.</p>  <p>  - Work elements to assist in all waters attaining &lsquo;Good&rsquo; ecological status by a specified date, as per the EU</p>  <p>  - Water Framework Directive.</p>  <p>  The full agreement is available on the IFI website www.fisheriesireland.ie and includes, inter alia, the provision of dedicated staff within IFI, the agreed need to generate fish and hydro-morphology Environment Quality Ratio scores in advance of any proposed works to identify actual need for works and to specify works, if required, that would be appropriate to the hydro-morphological character of the channel. This is particularly relevant to any IFI or local community initiatives regarding instream and riparian works. </p>  <p>  IFI and OPW have agreed that the matching of enhancement measures to the relevant channel is to be undertaken in a holistic manner, and must be dependent on the character and needs of the catchment and on the channel&rsquo;s hydro-morphological characteristics. </p>  <p>  The programme is driven by the requirements of the EU Water Framework Directive, particularly that the status of all water bodies should be at least &ldquo;Good&rdquo;. Overall status is assessed by a series of ecological indicators e.g. fish community and by habitat or hydro-morphology status. River enhancement, within the requirements of the Directive, goes beyond a narrow fisheries enhancement focus. The emphasis is on restoration of natural river processes and this type of approach should also broadly benefit fisheries. </p>  <p>  The EREP is undertaken by IFI and is an applied scientific study. OPW maintain approximately 2,000 km of channel each year and uses environmental guidance developed with IFI. The guidance is aimed at conservation and/or adding value for habitat creation and river enhancement.</p>  <p>  A significant outcome from the Water Framework Directive and its impact on EREP is that OPW and IFI have agreed that any proposed 'enhancement' measure should be tested in advance to assess current status of fish and habitat. Four such enhancement proposals are to be so tested in 2019 with surveys of fish and habitat status scheduled. </p>  <p>  For the Deputy&rsquo;s information, the 2017 annual report of EREP is available online on both OPW and IFI websites. The draft 2018 report is currently being jointly reviewed. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-06-11a.1897.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019061100100#WRTT05100"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 751, 779 and 780 together. </p><p>Recent scientific evidence indicates that air pollution is more damaging at lower concentrations than was previously understood. Air pollution also arises from a wide range of sources, including residential heating, transport and agriculture. With this in mind, I am committed to bringing forward Ireland's first ever National Clean Air Strategy. The Strategy, which I intend to publish later this year, will provide the policy framework necessary to identify and promote integrated measures across Government that are required to reduce air pollution and promote cleaner air, while delivering on wider national objectives. </p><p>The ban on the marketing, sale and distribution of bituminous coal, or &lsquo;the smoky coal ban&rsquo; as it is commonly known, has proven very successful since first introduced in Dublin in 1990 and subsequently extended so that it now applies in 26 urban areas nationwide. </p><p>I am disappointed that a number of coal firms have indicated they would legally challenge the decision of two former Ministers to extend the ban nationwide. As a result it has not proven possible to extend the ban nationwide for the 2019/2020 year. The coal companies have indicated that if the smoky coal ban is extended, they will challenge both the new ban and the existing ban, on the basis that the state should also have to ban the burning of other fossil fuels, including wood and peat products. I am working with the Attorney General to finalise a legally robust plan which will improve air quality by reducing particulate matter in the air. </p><p>Estimates of the numbers of deaths attributable to air pollution in 41 European countries are released on an annual basis by the European Environment Agency. This assessment requires information on air pollution, demographic data, and the relationship between exposure to ambient pollutant concentrations and a health outcome. Figures for 2019 are not yet available. The latest report, published in 2018, gives data for 2015 and is available at the following link:</p><p>It indicates that there were in the order of 1,150 premature deaths in Ireland attributable to air pollution in 2015.</p><p>In relation to the number of air pollution breaches so far in 2019, ambient air quality monitoring in Ireland is carried out in accordance with the requirements of the 2008 Clean Air for Europe (CAFE) Directive (Directive 2008/50/EC), and the Fourth Daughter Directive (Directive 2004/107/EC of 15 December 2004). These Directives also include rules on how Member States should monitor, assess and manage ambient air quality. </p><p>Following a review by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) of air quality monitoring and information provision in Ireland, a decision was taken to expand and enhance the air quality monitoring network. The roll-out of the enhanced network, the Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Programme (AAMP), is progressing and over the period 2017 to 2022 will more than double the capacity of ambient air quality monitoring in Ireland. One of the key objectives of the programme is to enhance the provision of real time air quality data to the public. My Department has committed funding of some &euro;5 million over the lifetime of the programme. </p><p>Regarding the number of breaches recorded this year, provisional data from the EPA, which is subject to further validation, indicates that up until 6 June, there have been 98 breaches of the PM10 daily limit value during 2019 at stations as outlined in the table. Under the provisions of the CAFE Directive, an exceedance for PM10 is recorded if the limit is breached more than 35 times at an individual monitoring station during the year. </p><p>Number of values greater than 50 ug/m3 <table><tr><th>Station Name</th><th>Year to date 06/06/2019</th><th>Station Location</th><th>Station Type</th><th>Station Operator</th></tr><tr><td>Ballyfermot</td><td>7</td><td>Dublin 10</td><td>Suburban Background</td><td>Dublin City Council</td></tr><tr><td>Blanchardstown</td><td>4</td><td>Dublin 15</td><td>Suburban Traffic</td><td>Fingal County Council</td></tr><tr><td>Brownes Road</td><td>1</td><td>Waterford City</td><td>Suburban Background</td><td>EPA</td></tr><tr><td>Castlebar</td><td>1</td><td>Co.

The procurement process is ongoing and continues until contract award. </p>  <p>  The Government Decision of 7 May 2019 means that it is intended to award the State Intervention contract for the NBP to the Bidder. This award is subject to the completion of the final stage of the procurement process, including finalisation of financial and legal documents. </p>  <p>  Not proceeding to a contract would involve significant opportunity cost for the State and its citizens. Firstly, it would at best result in a delay of a number of years in the delivery of a future proofed high speed broadband service to the 1.1 million citizens in the intervention Area and would also introduce considerable uncertainty as to whether or not some premises would be left behind. In addition, the analysis carried out suggests that any alternative option may be more costly than that to be delivered under the existing NBP draft contract. </p></reply>

The Plan commits to investing &euro;21.8bn in climate and low carbon related actions, of which, approx. &euro;3.7bn is identified for funding residential energy efficiency upgrades and retrofitting oil heated homes with heat pumps and solar PV. The Plan identifies a target for retrofitting private dwellings of 45,000 homes per year to a Building Energy Rating B from 2021.  </p>  <p>  It is clear that the Exchequer alone will not be able to fund the scale and depth of retrofit activity that needs to happen in order for us meet our climate targets. For that reason, alternative financing options will have to play a part in Ireland&rsquo;s strategy to decarbonise our buildings. Examples of these alternative approaches could include, for instance, the introduction of new mechanisms to lower the interest rates applicable to loans for energy efficiency works as well as energy performance contracting. </p>  <p>  My Department is currently working with a number of key stakeholders to explore the potential for the introduction of new ways to support energy efficiency in homes, including financing options.

This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment across the country, and a State intervention in those areas where commercial operators acting alone are unlikely to invest. The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector. In 2012, less than 700,000, or 30% of Irish premises had access to high speed broadband. Today, 74% of the 2.4 million premises in Ireland can access high speed broadband.</p><p>In April 2017, my Department published an updated version of the NBP High Speed Broadband Map.

Under the Acts, the primary management and enforcement response to littering (including dog fouling) rests with Local Authorities. It is a matter for each Local Authority to determine the most appropriate course of action to tackle litter pollution locally within the legislation provided. This includes the most appropriate public awareness, enforcement and clean-up actions in relation to litter and dog fouling, taking account of local circumstances and priorities.</p><p>My Department does not collate statistics on the number of fines issued by Local Authorities in relation to specific litter offences, such as dog fouling offences. However, my Department does publish data on the revenue generated from Local Authority on-the-spot litter fines and Courts' fines. The data is available at:</p><p>With regard to litter awareness, my Department has, since 1997, co-funded the Local Authority Anti-Litter and Anti-Graffiti Awareness Grant Scheme (ALAGS). Local Authorities are responsible for selecting suitable ALAGS projects for funding and deciding on individual grant allocations. Where possible, the focus is on voluntary initiatives by community and environmental groups, and also on involving schools and young people in anti-litter and anti-graffiti action. Typically, eligible projects include local media campaigns, clean-ups, primary/secondary school competitions, exhibitions, and the production of videos, posters and leaflets. </p><p>ALAGS funding increased by 28% in 2017 to &euro;884,000 and this level was maintained in 2018. In previous years Local Authorities have been requested to consider, where practical under the scheme, expending a portion of their grant on dog fouling awareness projects.</p></reply>

The public sector has already made a strong contribution in this regard with the most recently published statistics showing that the sector had improved its energy efficiency by 24% to end 2017. Cumulatively, the energy efficiency improvements achieved by public sector bodies have resulted in an avoided energy spend of more than &euro;1 billion and a carbon emissions saving of over 3.5 million tonnes.</p>  <p>  The achievements to date result from a combination of improved energy management as well as equipment and building fabric improvements. A combination of approaches will continue to be necessary in the future to meet our targets. These approaches include: </p>  <p>  - Energy management and behavioural change;</p>  <p>  - Natural renewal &ndash; buildings and vehicles replaced by more efficient models over time;</p>  <p>  - Energy supply efficiency &ndash; more renewable electricity requiring less primary energy to supply the energy consumed in buildings;</p>  <p>  - Targeted energy efficiency investment &ndash; including retrofits of buildings, fleets and facilities to reduce their energy consumption and/or increase renewable energy supply.</p>  <p>  The National Development Plan is making significant funding available in pursuit of our national targets. This includes funding of &euro;800 million for public building energy retrofit, along with further funding for school energy retrofits, third level building renovations, and public transport fleet replacement. The potential for this investment to be supported by non-exchequer sources of funding such as Energy Performance Contracting (EPC) will be also be explored. </p>  <p>  My Department is providing leadership and guidance to Government departments and public sector bodies to help them to achieve their efficiency targets as part of the process of implementing the Public Sector Energy Efficiency Strategy. This includes the SEAI engaging with Public Sector Bodies to assess the range and nature of project opportunities &ndash; including building fabric upgrades. This ongoing exercise will help to inform the assessment of the costs to achieve the targets for 2030 and beyond. It is also important to note that the achievement of public sector targets will require initiatives beyond the building stock including public transport fleets, water and waste facilities, public lighting and other energy users across the public sector.</p>  <p>  The forthcoming Government Climate Plan will also set out further commitments for public sector bodies to demonstrate leadership in taking climate action, including a specific climate mandate for each organisation and ambitious new energy efficiency and decarbonisation targets for the sector as a whole.</p></reply>

The Plan commits to investing &euro;21.8bn in climate and low carbon related actions, of which, approx. &euro;3.7bn is identified for funding residential energy efficiency upgrades and retrofitting oil heated homes with heat pumps and solar PV. The NDP also allocates funding of &euro;800m for public building energy retrofits, along with further funding for school energy retrofits and third level building renovations. </p>  <p>  In 2018, the total expenditure allocated to sustainable energy schemes administered by the SEAI was &euro;134m. The equivalent figure for this year is &euro;141m. The allocation for the Energy Programme in 2020 will be agreed during this year's Estimates process.</p>  <p>  It is clear that the Exchequer alone will not be able to fund the scale and depth of retrofit activity that needs to happen in order for us meet our climate targets. For that reason, alternative financing options will have to play a part in Ireland&rsquo;s strategy to decarbonise our buildings. Examples of these alternative approaches could include, for instance, the introduction of new mechanisms to lower the interest rates applicable to loans for energy efficiency works as well as energy performance contracting. </p>  <p>The forthcoming All of Government Climate Plan will set out the actions to be taken to make Ireland a leader in responding to climate change and at a minimum meet our targets for the period to 2030.</p></reply>

The Plan will set out how this Government intends to make Ireland climate resilient across our entire society. It will have a strong focus on implementation, including clear timelines and steps needed to achieve each action. The goals and targets will be informed by analysis of the most cost-effective choices available to reach our 2030 targets. By articulating a decarbonisation ambition range for each sector, the framework provided by the Plan will enable each sector to identify and put in place the most appropriate policy tools to deliver this stated ambition in order for Ireland to meet its 2030 targets. I intend that the Plan will be published shortly.</p>  <p>  Under the 2009 Effort Sharing Decision 406/2009/EC (ESD), which put in place binding annual emissions targets for each year between 2013 and 2020 for sectors outside the EU Emissions Trading System, Ireland must achieve a reduction of 20% relative to 2005 levels of emissions. Under the latest projections of greenhouse gas emissions, published earlier this month by the EPA, emissions from those sectors of the economy covered by the ESD could remain at between 0% and 1% below 2005 levels by 2020.</p>  <p>  The ESD allows Member States to meet their targets by means of unused emissions allowances from earlier years, or through purchasing allowances from other Member States or on international markets. Ireland has already acquired a portion of the additional allowances that will be required for compliance. However, I am advised that Ireland will need to purchase additional allowances to meet projected shortfalls in 2019 and 2020. Under the ESD framework, compliance for any given year is calculated up to 18 months after the year in question. Therefore, the final budgetary impact of the cost of allowance purchases in respect of any ESD compliance shortfalls in 2019 and 2020 may not arise until 2021 or 2022. My Department currently estimates the cost of this requirement to be in the region of &euro;6m to &euro;13m, depending on the price and final quantity of allowances required.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s strategy to meet its targets under the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol (2008-2012) included investments in three multilateral funds, as well as a number of transactions for the purchase of carbon credits directly from the market. Through the direct market purchases and investment in the three funds, a total of &euro;120 million was spent, in which 8,558,888 credits were received by the State. Of this total, 3,052,416 have been surrendered for compliance with the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol. The remaining number of carbon credits currently held by the State is 5,506,472, which may be used for ESD compliance. </p>  <p>  The latest emissions projections indicate that Ireland could exceed its cumulative annual greenhouse gas emissions ceilings for the 2021 to 2030 period under the EU Effort Sharing Regulation, by between 59 and 75 million tonnes of carbon dioxide-equivalent under different scenarios of policy implementation and assuming full utilisation of the Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry mitigation option.</p></reply>

This staff complement has significant experience in developing and implementing climate and energy policy at international, EU, national, regional and local levels. In addition to its own staff, the Department also has access to scientific and technical advice in agencies under its aegis to assist it in delivering the Government&rsquo;s climate policy objectives.  </p>  <p>  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the competent authority in Ireland for the preparation and annual publication of official inventories and projections of greenhouse gas emissions, and for reporting this data to the European Union and to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The Oireachtas receives a summary of the most recent inventory and projections prepared by the EPA each year in the Annual Transition Statement, which I am required to prepare and submit in accordance with the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015.</p>  <p>  The EPA also provides a range of expert scientific and technical advice on climate change to the Government. The EPA supports the Department in representing Ireland at relevant meetings of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The EPA also undertakes a number of climate-related research and awareness activities, including the provision of support for the delivery of activities under the National Dialogue on Climate Action. The EPA also produces, in accordance with its statutory mandate, a quadrennial State of the Environment Report which provides an integrated assessment of the overall quality of Ireland's environment, the pressures being placed on it and the societal responses to current and emerging environmental issues. The last such report was published in 2016, includes a specific focus on climate change, and is available from the EPA&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  The Department is also supported in the delivery of its policy objectives for the decarbonisation of the energy sector by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI). In addition to the delivery of a range of programmes and schemes on behalf of the Department, the functions of SEAI include the preparation of national energy statistics and projections. SEAI also undertakes national energy modelling functions, informed, inter alia, by data collected from the various schemes and programmes that it administers. </p>  <p>  SEAI had a total of 91 staff as at the end of December 2018. The EPA had a total of 410 staff at that time. While it is difficult to fully disaggregate the number of EPA staff working on climate issues, the EPA estimate this at 32.</p>  <p>  The work of both EPA and SEAI inform, in turn, the wider work of the Technical Research and Modelling (TRAM) Group, which provides the overall framework for the provision of technical capacity to Government Departments for climate action policy development and implementation. </p>  <p>  TRAM was established on foot of a Government Decision in 2015 and its membership comprises technical experts from relevant Government Departments and Agencies. In addition, representatives of externally contracted bodies providing modelling and analytical support may participate in TRAM meetings. To date, these services have been provided by the ESRI, UCC, UCD and EnvEcon. </p>  <p>  I am leading the finalisation of a Government Climate Plan which will set out the actions Ireland needs to take to reach our targets. The Plan will set goals for all key sectors including electricity, agriculture, transport, industry, buildings, waste management, and the public sector. I intend to seek Government approval to publish the Plan shortly. </p>  <p>  The Plan will lead to a significant step-up in policy ambition and delivery, to ensure that we at least meet our 2030 targets and get on a clear pathway to meeting our 2050 objectives. It will be updated every year, and will also be informed by the recommendations contained in the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Climate Action. </p>  <p>The goals and targets will be informed by analysis of the most cost-effective choices available to reach our 2030 targets. By articulating sectoral decarbonisation ambition ranges, the framework provided by the Plan will enable each sector to identify and put in place the most appropriate policy tools to deliver this stated ambition in order for Ireland to meet its 2030 targets.</p></reply>

These requirements are set out in the European Communities (Electronic Communications Networks and Services) (Framework) Regulations 2011 (S.I. No. 333 of 2011). ComReg is responsible for ensuring compliance with these provisions. </p>  <p>  The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) in my Department has been reviewing the full spectrum of cyber security risks associated with 5G systems since late 2018. This work will feed directly into the new National Cyber Security Strategy.</p>  <p>  In March 2019 the EU Commission published C(2019) Recommendation 2335, setting out an EU Process to jointly assess these risks. Member States have been asked to prepare national assessments and to forward these to the European Commission by end June for collation. The NCSC is working on this matter in close collaboration with other EU Members States and Institutions, ComReg, and the telecommunications industry to ensure that the review is comprehensive and evidence based.

The National Policy Position outlined a national target of reducing carbon dioxide emissions by at least 80% (compared to 1990 levels) by 2050 across the electricity generation, built environment and transport sectors. The National Mitigation Plan, published in 2017, set Ireland on a pathway towards achieving the 2050 decarbonisation target.  The Plan included over 100 emissions-reducing actions that were underway or planned, including a range of transport measures, and it set out the potential emissions impact and the estimated costs of many of the actions.  The National Mitigation Plan initiated the process of developing medium to long term mitigation choices for the next and future decades.</p>  <p>  My colleague, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment is now at an advanced stage in preparing a follow-on plan that will map out a whole-of-Government approach to Climate Action and meeting Ireland's emissions commitments.  My Department is working closely with his Department and across Government to ensure that the transport sector, which accounts for about 20% of Ireland overall carbon emissions (and about 27% of Ireland's accountable emissions in the non-ETS (emissions trading scheme) area), plays a key role in the overall Government approach to tackling climate commitments.  My Department has worked hard to develop an ambitious, challenging and wide-ranging set of actions, particularly for public transport and active travel.  The new Plan will be considered by Government shortly and then published. It will set out the situation across the various sectors, including transport, for delivering on the future emissions reduction targets.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware of our work to reduce the emissions from public transport. From next month, no diesel-only buses will be purchased for the urban PSO bus fleet and work has also been underway to trial and compare various options for low carbon alternatively-fuelled buses on Irish bus routes.  Of course, less than 5% of Ireland's transport-derived carbon dioxide emissions arise from public transport, so efforts to "green" the fleet - though important in leadership terms - will have only a limited impact in reducing emissions.  A critical area of challenge when looking at transport emissions is in targeting the 52% of emissions that come from private car use. This is where public transport and active travel offer real benefits in environmental terms: through expanding their capacity we can facilitate a shift from private car to public transport. Under Project Ireland 2040, we are investing &euro;8.6 billion in Ireland's public transport system.  We want to make public transport and active travel a viable alternative for more people for more of their journeys. Our substantial investment will be used to support the MetroLink, BusConnects and the DART Expansion Programme amongst other important projects. In fact, the NDP budget for new public transport/active travel projects is well above what we will be investing in new roads, which is a reversal of the balance of investment between these two areas in the past.</p></reply>

Neither the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport nor the Central Bank of Ireland has the power to direct insurance companies on the pricing of insurance products. The EU framework for insurance expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products. The provision of insurance cover and the price at which it is offered are commercial matters for insurance companies and are based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept and adequate provisioning to meet those risks. These are considered by insurance companies on a case by case basis.</p>  <p>  The most recent Consumer Price Index showed that the average cost of motor insurance actually fell more than 24% between its peak in July 2016 and April 2019.</p>  <p>  The Cost of Insurance Working Group chaired by Minister of State at the Department of Finance Michael D'Arcy TD is looking at the circumstances behind the rising cost of motor insurance and how to improve the situation, but will still not be able to directly affect the actual costs of motor insurance. A copy of the Cost of Insurance Working Group Report and subsequent updates can be found on the Department of Finance website. Recommendation 2 of the Report relates to insurers providing additional information on the premium breakdown to consumers. The Central Bank of Ireland published the Non-Life Insurance (Provision of Information) (Renewal of Policy of Insurance) (Amendment) Regulations 2018 on 21 December 2018 and these will come into effect on 01 November 2019.</p>  <p>  Insurance Ireland operates a free insurance information service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to obtaining insurance. All calls regarding refusal to quote, or quotations that are so excessive as to be in effect a refusal, should be directed to Insurance Ireland by phone at (01) 676 1820, by email at declined@insuranceireland.eu or by post at 5 Harbourmaster Place, IFSC, Dublin 1 quoting the Declined Cases Agreement.</p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from local authorities' own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.</p>  <p>  Before the financial crisis, local authorities could apply on a regular basis for grants for Specific (schemes costing less than &euro;5m) and Strategic Improvement Grants (schemes costing more than &euro;5m) for the strengthening, widening or realignment of regional and local  roads.  However, the extent of the cutbacks in grant funding during the crisis meant this grant scheme had to be curtailed from 2013 because expenditure on maintenance/renewal was falling well short of what was required to adequately maintain the regional and local road network. </p>  <p>  The current Capital Plan does provide for the gradual build-up in funding for the road network but it will take some time yet to reach the level required even for the  basic maintenance and renewal of the network.  For this reason, there continues to be limited scope for funding new or additional projects under the Specific and Strategic Grant Programmes.  </p>  <p>  Any projects proposed by local authorities for consideration under these Grant Programmes are assessed by the Department on a case-by-case basis.  All projects put forward by local authorities for consideration must comply with the requirements of the Public Spending Code and the Department's Capital Appraisal Framework (CAF).  Given the limited funding available for RLR improvement works it is important for local authorities to prioritise projects within their overall area of responsibility with these requirements in mind. Donegal County Council submitted a Preliminary Appraisal in relation to improvement works on the R232 in January this year. </p>  <p>  Grant funding of &euro;500,000 has been allocated for the R232 in 2019 and all available 2019 grant funding has now been allocated.  Future allocations will be considered as part of the decision making process for next year's grant allocations. </p></reply>

These in turn present opportunities but also risks. Governments and authorities worldwide are still developing their responses, taking account of the impacts of these changes on safety, the economy, employment, the environment, security and privacy (including data security).  For example, EU Member States have regular High Level Meetings on Connected and Autonomous Mobility (CAM), including representatives of the Commission and a number of industrial sectors, which my officials attend.  In turn, the Commission has recently proposed a Single Platform for open road testing and pre-deployment of Cooperative, Connected, Automated and Autonomous Mobility (CCAM), with specialised subgroups of national experts on specific aspects.</p>  <p>  We intend to lead the development of the Connected and Autonomous Mobility sector in Ireland with due regard to the range of important issues involved, the risks and opportunities.  In the near term, and in the context of the Government's new economic pathway, Future Jobs Ireland, we are working on guidelines for testing such vehicles, a strategic roadmap for the sector and an administrative review of the current road traffic legislation in relation to possible testing on the public road.  </p>  <p>  Good progress has been made particularly with regard to the Guidelines for testing.  The outcome of the review of road traffic legislation is currently being examined to determine whether and what formal legal advice may be required.  The conclusion of any such legal advice, together with the results of the administrative review and any developments at EU or other international levels, will then inform the decision of whether amendments to the Road Traffic Acts are needed.</p>  <p>  The question of what legislative change may be needed in areas which fall outside the remit of my Department are matters for the responsible Minister.</p></reply>

Please contact my office if a reply is not received with 10 days.</p>  <p>  The vast majority of public sports facilities are owned and operated by Local Authorities and many offer reduced rates for children and other users. In the National Sports Policy 2018-2027, the Government underlined that Local Authorities are well positioned to take a leading role at local level, working with Local Sports Partnerships and other relevant stakeholders to offer opportunities for all members of their communities to participate in sport and physical activity. My Department and Sport Ireland work in collaboration with Local Authorities, for instance at the Sports Leadership Group which includes a local government representative, the Chief Executive of South Dublin County Council, Mr Daniel McLoughlin.</p>  <p>  The National Sports Policy 2018-2027 also considered the issue of access to facilities. It recognised that while the majority of primary schools must access a swimming pool in the community to fulfil the aquatics strand of the PE curriculum, there is no specific funding available to help them defray costs like transport and facility hire.

The National Transport Authority (NTA) has statutory responsibility for the planning and development of public transport infrastructure in the Greater Dublin Area, including PSO bus fleet procurement. Project Ireland 2040 commits us to end the purchase of diesel-only buses for our urban PSO bus fleets from next month (July 2019).  To that end the NTA has advertised its intent to enter into a new bus purchase framework agreement to purchase hybrid buses in the short term.</p><p>The medium and longer term approach to the NTA's procurement of low-carbon buses will be informed by a range of matters, including the outcomes of the Low-Emission Bus Trials recently undertaken by my Department. Testing took place on the No. 9 route in Dublin City, operating from Broadstone depot and on the No. 207a route in Cork city, operating from Capwell depot. As part of the trial, three hybrid-electric double-deck vehicles and two full (battery) electric buses (single-deck) from a range of suppliers were tested. The operational phase of the low-emission bus trials has now concluded and the findings are currently being assessed. I expect that summary findings will be made available by my Department in the coming weeks.</p><p>The NTA's procurement strategy will also be informed by the recently revised Clean Vehicles Directive<i>, </i>which legislates at EU level for the purchase of vehicles by public authorities, including the purchase of public urban buses. The Directive sets procurement targets for Member States, including for the purchase of buses. </p><p>I am pleased to see fulfilment of our commitment to ending the purchase of diesel-only buses for the urban PSO bus fleets and I am satisfied that our on-going research on the medium and longer term technology potential, along with EU Directive requirements, will inform the NTA's approach to its bus purchase programme in the years ahead. </p></reply>

These applications were assessed first and approximately &euro;7m in allocations to 170 projects were announced on the 17th January. </p>  <p>  619 equipment only applications were assessed next and 466 allocations with a value of &euro;9.8m were announced to these organisations in May.</p>  <p>  Work is now underway in assessing the remaining applications for capital works.  </p>  <p>  For the first time applicants who submitted incorrect documentation under this round are being given the opportunity to correct their application during the assessment period. While there will be no undue delay in completing the assessment process, in view of the opportunity to correct documentation, the record number of applications received and the detailed information contained in each application, it is likely to take a number of months to have all applications assessed. Accordingly, I expect that it may be the third quarter of this year before the full set of allocations under this current round of the programme are announced. </p></reply>

The Plan will follow through on Government commitments made in First 5, the Whole-of-Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families, which include commitments to extend the regulation to all paid, non-relative childminders on a phased basis over the lifetime of the Strategy (2019-2028), building on the report of the Working Group on Reforms and Supports for the Childminding Sector. This extension of regulation will make National Childcare Scheme subsidies available to more parents and childminders.</p>  <p>  Childminders play a central role in the provision of both early learning and care and school-age childcare in Ireland. I can assure the Deputy, and the person whose concerns the Deputy has communicated, that the Childminding Action Plan will recognise the role, function and contribution of childminders and will facilitate their development through proportionate and targeted regulation.</p>  <p>  The Childminding Action Plan will be firmly rooted in the Working Group report &lsquo;Pathways to a Quality Support and Assurance System for Childminding&rsquo;. I established the Working Group on Reforms and Supports for the Childminding Sector in 2016 and asked it to submit short, medium and long-term recommendations for reform and support for the childminding sector. The Working Group submitted its report to me in 2018, and since then officials in my Department have been developing an Action Plan on the basis of the Working Group's recommendations. Like the Working Group's report, the Action Plan will contain short, medium and longer-term actions.</p>  <p>  Given the evidence on the benefits of quality childminding for children, and the continued support for childminding among parents, I am keen to extend regulation to allow childminders to take part in the National Childcare Scheme at the earliest possible opportunity. Clearly this requires extensive planning, consultation and a range of supports to be in place.</p></reply>

Under this Goal a funding scheme for service providers, including some homeless services was available immediately following publication of the Strategy. The measure was intended to improve their understanding of, and ability to engage with, LGBTI+ young people.  </p>  <p>  In 2018 Focus Ireland received capacity grant funding from DCYA to implement evidence based LGBTI+ training for its staff working with young LGBTI+ people.  It had a particular focus on supporting those who identify as trans. </p>  <p>  Goal Three of the Strategy aims to better understand the lives of young LGBTI+ people to ensure evidence informed policy making into the future. Earlier this year my Department commissioned a landscape analysis of existing research and data as relevant to Irish LGBTI+ youth.

The Scheme is intended to support the operation of volunteer-led youth projects.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware my Department is currently managing the most significant reform of youth services ever undertaken.

This mapping and tool will assist the Department and the relevant ETBs in developing a detailed social demographic profile in terms of both population numbers and deprivation levels.  My Department is committed to working with ETBs to identify requirements in their area and facilitate decisions on service requirement by reference to evidenced need.</p></reply>

This represents an increase in funding of some &euro;34m over 2018, and is the fourth year in succession that Tusla has received a significant increase it its funding. I strongly support the work of Tusla, and I am committed to supporting the Agency in meeting the needs of all children and families.</p>  <p>  Tusla operates an adoption information and tracing service at various locations throughout the country, as well as funding services provided by a number of adoption agencies and societies. The adoption information and tracing service oversees a broad spectrum of enquiries from a wide range of people, including adopted people, birth parents, adoptive parents, siblings of adopted people and other birth relatives and people raised in long- term foster care. The service operates on a limited-statutory basis within the wider legal framework of the Adoption Act 2010 and assists each of these categories of person with their information and tracing enquiries.</p>  <p>  As part of their Key Service Improvement Areas in 2019, Tusla has agreed to aim for a 10% reduction in the cases awaiting allocation for adoption information and tracing services. This is in the context of a dramatic increase in people seeking information or looking to trace their birth relatives.</p>  <p>  Applicants seeking an Information and Tracing Service from Tusla are prioritised based on nationally agreed priority categories. Tusla assigns cases a priority category on receipt and review of the application form. Tusla has provided the data below, which represents the current, longest waiting time for allocation to a social worker across the five Regions for Q1 2019. Variation in waiting times between the Regions, and across the categories is influenced by a number of operational and demand-led factors.</p>  <p>  Priority category 1 is based on a National Adoption Contact Preference Register match (NACPR) and the age threshold of birth parent (>70years). The longest waiting times for priority category 1 are as follows:</p>  <p>  DML - 2 months, DNE - 14 months, South East - 5 months, South West - 9 months, West - 3 months.</p>  <p>  Priority category 2 includes applicants with a medical condition (non-life limiting) or individuals who were previously in care. The longest waiting times for priority category 2 are as follows:</p>  <p>  DML - 2 months, DNE - 24 months, South East - 8 months, South West &ndash; 1.5 months, West - 9 months.</p>  <p>  General applicants are treated as priority category 3. The longest waiting times for priority category 3 are as follows:</p>  <p>  DML - 3 months, DNE - 40 months, South East - 18 months, South West &ndash; 30 months, West - 12 months.</p>  <p>  As data returns are collected and reported quarterly, Tusla do not calculate average waiting times as part of the dataset.</p></reply>

My Department has been advised by the Tusla Early Years Inspectorate that the National Vetting Bureau has confirmed that there is no provision in the relevant legislation to conduct vetting in respect of such persons where that person is not engaged in relevant work or activities as defined in the legislation.  Where such persons clearly state on their application for vetting that they have regular access to children as part of their duties, the National Vetting Bureau will process such applications.</p>  <p>  Engagement is ongoing between officials from my Department, Tusla and officials from the Department of Justice and Equality in relation to this matter.  Tusla has put in place a number of interim measures in response to this issue.  For example, they have issued a notice to all early learning and care and school age services advising that such persons, who have not been processed for vetting by the National Vetting Bureau but have regular access to and contact with children, should submit a new vetting application expressly clarifying that they have such contact with children. Furthermore, they have notified all services that such persons, who have access to and contact with children and who have been refused vetting, should not be allowed to carry out their duties when children are present.</p>  <p>  Garda vetting is just one of the tools designed to protect children.  The Children First Act 2015 promotes the protection of children from abuse and neglect, by setting out what persons and organisations need to do to keep children safe, and how to deal with concerns that a child may have been, is being, or is at risk of being abused or neglected.  For example, all persons running a registered early learning and care service and those employed in them as childcare staff are mandated persons under the Act.  Providers of relevant services to children must also undertake a comprehensive risk assessment of their services and prepare a Child Safeguarding Statement, which is a written statement that specifies the service being provided and the principles and procedures to be observed in order to ensure, as far as practicable, that a child availing of the service is safe from harm.  </p>  <p>  A Children First Inter-Departmental Implementation Group (CFIDIG) with membership from all Government Departments, the Health Service Executive, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Tusla, provides a forum for members to raise child welfare and protection issues of general concern or with a cross-departmental or cross-sectoral dimension.</p>  <p>  The National Early Years Children First Committee, established by my Department in 2013, is currently rolling out the 2019/20 Child Protection Plan. 62 Children First trainers are in place and are working to deliver training to early years childcare services on their requirements under the Children First legislation.  To date more than 15,000 early learning and care workers have received training.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore, my Department provides funding to both Early Childhood Ireland and Barnardos on the agreement that they act as an &ldquo;authorised signatory&rsquo; to process Garda vetting applications on behalf of the sector.</p></reply>

The 1:12 ratio was selected following consultation with an expert group on school-age childcare standards.  The Group included representatives from DCYA, National Childhood Network, Early Childhood Ireland, Barnardos, Children's Rights Alliance, Better Start, Childcare Committees Ireland, Irish Primary Principals Network, Childminding Ireland, National Parents Council, Quality Development of Out of School Services, Tusla, PL&Eacute; and the Department of Education and Skills among its members. The working group report that was submitted to my Department in 2018 recommended a ratio of 1 adult to 11 children. A 1:8 ratio was recommended in a 2005 working-group report. My Department ultimately decided on a 1:12 ratio.</p>  <p>  I do not expect to see an overall reduction in the number of school-age childcare places as a result of the new Regulations. In setting the ratio requirement, current practice was considered; while some providers have until now operated higher ratios than 1:12, the evidence suggests that a majority have operated lower ratios. The 1:12 ratio requirement is close to the expert group recommendation, and while some individual services may have to recruit additional staff or reduce places (if they choose to keep their staffing level constant), this will not be true for all school-age childcare services. </p>  <p>  Indeed, initial data  available to my Department indicates an increase in the number of services offering  school-age childcare. This demonstrates that various policy initiatives to encourage additional capacity in school age childcare are working. As of 5th June, 338  &ldquo;stand-alone&rdquo; school-age childcare services (i.e. services that only provide  school-age childcare) had applied for registration with Tusla, an increase on the  235 such services previously known to DCYA, Tusla and the City/County Childcare  Committees. These services are in addition to the approximately 1,600 Early Learning and Care services that also provide school-age childcare. </p>  <p>  To give service providers time to adjust to the new requirement I made a decision earlier this year, following discussions with sector representatives,  to delay the date on which the 1:12 ratio comes into force by 6 months, from 18th February to 18th August 2019. This decision recognised the difficulty for providers of adjusting their staffing ratio in the middle of the school year. If, in spite of the adjustment period for service providers, any parent finds it difficult securing a school-age childcare place for September, they should contact their local City/County Childcare Committee, which is available to support parents to locate childcare within their locality. Local contact details for City/County Childcare Committees can be found at www.myccc.ie.</p>  <p>  The 1:12 ratio enables services to make a reasonable profit given that wages in the sector average at &euro;12 per hour and pay costs are services' largest overhead. It should also be possible for services to recruit additional staff for school age childcare given that half of the sector work part-time only (ECCE hours and weeks) and many of these should be available to work additional hours.</p>  <p>  The introduction of Regulations for school-age childcare is a new and important development. While the Regulations introduced this year are limited in scope, I intend to introduce comprehensive Regulations that build on the initial Regulations as well as on the recommendations made by the standards working group.</p>  <p>  Public consultation is built into the process of developing these comprehensive Regulations for school-age childcare. On May 21st my Department launched the public consultation process. The consultation comprises an open call for submissions and an online public survey which are open until 5th July, as well as a focus group session with School Age Childcare Providers and an Open Policy Debate, both of which are taking place in June. Further information and links to the online survey and call for submissions can be found on my Department's website. </p>  <p>  I am delighted to state that the  2019 School Age Childcare Capital Scheme that I announced this week is expected to create approximately 2,300 new places nationally before the end of the year.  </p></reply>

This plan was approved by the Tusla Board and it was published on its website in November 2018. The current version, updated in line with the recommendation, represents the position as at April 2019 and includes comments on more recent achievements.  Tusla's 2019 business plan includes key deliverables from the strategic action plan.</p>  <p>  I established an Expert Assurance Group (EAG) to, amongst other things, monitor the progress of Tusla's action plan. I receive reports from the EAG which are published on my Department's website. The EAG has noted that Tusla has expended a considerable amount of time and resources responding to the key issues from the report. I have been advised by the Expert Assurance Group that the actions addressing the findings of the report and to improve services are well underway, and Tusla has the requisite mechanisms in place to monitor their implementation. The next meeting of the EAG is scheduled to take place on 12th June 2019.</p></reply>

It is not anticipated that there will be any significant difference between the amounts paid out by the Department to each LCDC/LA and the amounts paid out by that LCDC/LA to community groups.<table><tr><th>Local Authority area</th><th>2018 CEP Allocation</th><th>2019 CEP Allocation</th></tr><tr><td>Carlow </td><td>&euro;259,285</td><td>&euro;134,206</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan </td><td>&euro;274,141</td><td>&euro;134,757</td></tr><tr><td>Clare </td><td>&euro;336,239</td><td>&euro;139,257</td></tr><tr><td>Cork City</td><td>&euro;472,567</td><td>&euro;149,241</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>&euro;650,400</td><td>&euro;160,762</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal </td><td>&euro;632,449</td><td>&euro;159,461</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin City</td><td>&euro;1,364,607</td><td>&euro;212,306</td></tr><tr><td>Dun Laoghaire Rathdown</td><td>&euro;369,788</td><td>&euro;142,108</td></tr><tr><td>Fingal </td><td>&euro;493,131</td><td>&euro;150,521</td></tr><tr><td>Galway City</td><td>&euro;233,676</td><td>&euro;132,455</td></tr><tr><td>Galway </td><td>&euro;397,778</td><td>&euro;143,401</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry </td><td>&euro;382,630</td><td>&euro;142,409</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare </td><td>&euro;468,672</td><td>&euro;148,013</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny </td><td>&euro;289,901</td><td>&euro;136,319</td></tr><tr><td>Laois </td><td>&euro;294,177</td><td>&euro;136,524</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim </td><td>&euro;189,068</td><td>&euro;129,223</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>&euro;542,485</td><td>&euro;152,942</td></tr><tr><td>Longford </td><td>&euro;234,155</td><td>&euro;132,385</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>&euro;418,627</td><td>&euro;145,542</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo </td><td>&euro;425,542</td><td>&euro;145,203</td></tr><tr><td>Meath </td><td>&euro;393,662</td><td>&euro;142,893</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan </td><td>&euro;238,172</td><td>&euro;132,571</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly </td><td>&euro;322,142</td><td>&euro;138,550</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon </td><td>&euro;248,252</td><td>&euro;133,301</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo </td><td>&euro;263,402</td><td>&euro;134,084</td></tr><tr><td>South Dublin </td><td>&euro;750,743</td><td>&euro;169,399</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td>&euro;486,017</td><td>&euro;149,690</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford </td><td>&euro;402,777</td><td>&euro;144,499</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath </td><td>&euro;303,516</td><td>&euro;136,571</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford </td><td>&euro;494,079</td><td>&euro;150,065</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>&euro;367,921</td><td>&euro;141,343</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>&euro;13,000,000</td><td>&euro;4,500,000</td></tr></table></p><p>Details on approved projects for the 2017 Communities Facilities Fund are on the following link:</p><p><i></i></p><p>Details on approved projects for the 2017 RAPID programme are on the following link:</p><p><i></i></p><p>Details on approved projects for the 2018 Community Enhancement Programme are on the following link:</p><p><i></i></p><p>Details on approved projects for the 2018 Men&rsquo;s Shed fund (under the Community Enhancement Programme) are on the following link:</p><p><i>https://drcd.gov.ie/wp-content/uploads/Mens-Sheds-Funding-Jan-2019.pdf </i></p></reply>

This was intended to be a once-off payment, in recognition of the difficulties which many shows had experienced in previous years due to bad weather and increased insurance costs.  Each show was eligible to receive up to &euro;7,000 from the Government in an effort to support these important rural community events. The investment was carried out through the Irish Shows Association and the recipients were all members of that Association.</p><p>Having seen the positive impact of the investment in the shows and having regard to the funding available within my Department, in August 2018 I announced a further allocation of &euro;600,000 to the Irish Shows Association to support shows due to take place in 2019.  Each show was eligible to receive up to &euro;5,000 from this allocation. </p><p>Funding for Agricultural shows is provided on an exceptional basis and depends on the availability of funding in my Department&rsquo;s overall budget from year to year.</p><p>The following table outlines the funding allocated to Agricultural Shows via the Irish Shows Association for 2018 and 2019, by county.<table><tr><th>County</th><th>Name of Show</th><th>Grant Amount for Shows in 2018 </th><th>Grant Amount for Shows in 2019</th></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>Tullow</td><td>&euro;7,000</td><td>&euro;5,000</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td>Arva</td><td>&euro;7,000</td><td>&euro;5,000</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td>Virginia</td><td>&euro;7,000</td><td>&euro;5,000</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>Clarecastle</td><td>&euro;7,000</td><td>&euro;5,000</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>Corofin</td><td>&euro;7,000</td><td>&euro;5,000</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>Ennistymon</td><td>&euro;7,000</td><td>&euro;5,000</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>Kildysart</td><td>&euro;7,000</td><td>&euro;5,000</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>Kilrush</td><td>&euro;7,000</td><td>&euro;5,000</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>Mullagh</td><td>&euro;7,000</td><td>&euro;5,000</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>Newmarket-on-Fergus</td><td>&euro;7,000</td><td>&euro;5,000</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>Scariff</td><td>&euro;7,000</td><td>&euro;5,000</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>Bridgetown</td><td>&euro;7,000</td><td>&euro;5,000</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>Ballygarvan</td><td>&euro;7,000</td><td>&euro;5,000</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>Ballyvourney/Coolea</td><td>&euro;7,000</td><td>&euro;5,000</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>Bandon</td><td>&euro;7,000</td><td>&euro;5,000</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>Bantry</td><td>&euro;7,000</td><td>&euro;5,000</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>Barryroe</td><td>&euro;7,000</td><td>&euro;5,000</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>Belgooly</td><td>&euro;7,000</td><td>&euro;5,000</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>Carbery/Skibbereen</td><td>&euro;7,000</td><td>&euro;5,000</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>Charleville</td><td>&euro;7,000</td><td>&euro;5,000</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>Clonakilty</td><td>&euro;7,000</td><td>&euro;5,000</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>Cork Summer Show</td><td>&euro;7,000</td><td>&euro;5,000</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>Dunmanway</td><td>&euro;7,000</td><td>&euro;5,000</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>Inniscarra</td><td>&euro;7,000</td><td>&euro;5,000</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>Leap</td><td>&euro;7,000</td><td>&euro;5,000</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>Midleton</td><td>&euro;7,000</td><td>&euro;5,000</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>National Dairy Show</td><td>N/A</td><td>&euro;3,000</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>Schull</td><td>&euro;7,000</td><td>&euro;5,000</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>West Cork Horse Breeders</td><td>&euro;7,000</td><td>&euro;5,000</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>Adrara</td><td>&euro;7,000</td><td>&euro;5,000</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>Ballyshannon</td><td>&euro;7,000</td><td>&euro;5,000</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>Clonmany</td><td>&euro;7,000</td><td>&euro;5,000</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>Finn Valley</td><td>&euro;7,000</td><td>&euro;5,000</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>Glencolmcille</td><td>&euro;7,000</td><td>&euro;5,000</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>Inishowen</td><td>&euro;7,000</td><td>&euro;5,000</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>Meenacross</td><td>&euro;7,000</td><td>&euro;5,000</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>Flavours of Fingal Show</td><td>&euro;7,000</td><td>&euro;5,000</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>Irish Pony Breeders Show</td><td>N/A</td><td>&euro;3,000</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>Skerries (Irish Association Of Welsh Pony &amp;amp;

The Low Pay Commission was established in 2015 and its primary function is, on an annual basis, to examine and make recommendations on the national minimum wage, with a view to providing for adjustments which do not impact negatively on jobs or competitiveness.  The Commission thus takes an evidence-based approach to its recommendations, having regard to changes in earnings, productivity, overall competitiveness and the likely impact any adjustment will have on employment and unemployment levels.  </p>  <p>  Since its establishment the Commission has submitted recommendations on the appropriate rate of the National Minimum Wage for 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019. The Commission&rsquo;s recommendations, for increases of 50 cent in 2016, 10 cent in 2017, 30 cent in 2018 and 25 cent in 2019 have all been accepted by Government and represent an increase in the National Minimum Wage of 13.3% since 2015. With effect from 1 January 2019 the current rate of the National Minimum Wage is &euro;9.80 per hour.</p>  <p>  The most recent figures published by Eurostat (January 2019) show that Ireland has the second highest national minimum wage of any country in the EU at &euro;1,656.2 per month, behind only Luxembourg whose minimum wage is &euro;2,071 per month (for comparison purposes Eurostat converts countries&rsquo; hourly or weekly rates into monthly rates).  Allowing for purchasing power standards, Ireland drops to sixth place, but still remains in the group with the highest minimum wage rates in the EU.</p>  <p>  It is important that Ireland&rsquo;s statutory National Minimum Wage and the Living Wage concept are not conflated.  The Living Wage is a voluntary societal initiative centred on the social, business and economic case to ensure that, wherever it can be afforded, employers will pay a rate of pay that provides an income that is sufficient to meet an individual&rsquo;s basic needs, such as housing, food, clothing, transport and healthcare.  As a voluntary initiative, the Living Wage has no legislative basis and confers no statutory entitlement.  The National Minimum Wage, on the other hand, has a legislative basis and confers a statutory entitlement on employees, and a statutory obligation on employers. </p>  <p>  The setting of wages is a matter between employers and employees, which takes place in the context of the market, and Government does not interfere unduly in the process.  More broadly, this area also comes within the remit of my colleague the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, through her Department&rsquo;s responsibilities for industrial relations issues generally and wage-setting mechanisms such as Registered Employment Agreements (REAs), Joint Labour Committees (JLCs) and Sectoral Employment Orders (SEOs).</p></reply>

Self-employed class S contributions are not reckonable toward the award of credits.  </p>  <p>  Persons in receipt of carers allowance or benefit can qualify for credits where they have previously entered insurable employment and paid at least one PRSI contribution at Class A, B, C, D, E, H or P and where they have had a recent attachment to the workforce.</p>  <p>  In combination with paid PRSI contributions, credits can assist employees in qualifying for short-term schemes such as jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and enhance the level of benefit for long-term schemes such as the level of payment of State pension contributory (SPC).  Credits do not however, in isolation, entitle individuals to qualify for social insurance benefits.  It should be noted that only contributions in Classes A, E, F, G, H, N and S are reckonable for State pension purposes.</p>  <p>  Individuals who are caring and who do not qualify for carers allowance may qualify for the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme if their pension is decided by the yearly average method. The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme is designed to help homemakers and carers qualify for the SPC, and applies to homemaking periods since 6 April 1994.  It applies equally to both men and women.</p>  <p>  The scheme provides that years spent working in the home while caring on a full-time basis for a child up to 12 years of age or an incapacitated person age 12 or over will be disregarded in calculating a person's yearly average number of contributions for the purposes of determining the rate of their entitlement to SPC. In this way the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme ensures that an individual&rsquo;s entitlement to SPC is protected during periods spent caring.  As the homemakers scheme allows for years to be disregarded from the calculation, it is not considered a credit.</p>  <p>  In January 2018, the Government agreed to a proposal that will allow pensioners affected by the 2012 changes in rate bands to have their pension entitlement calculated by a new &ldquo;Total Contributions Approach&rdquo; (TCA) which will include up to 20 years of a new Home Caring period. Unlike the current Homemakers scheme, this allowance will apply to periods both before and after 1994. This approach is expected to significantly benefit many people, particularly women, whose work history includes an extended period of time outside the paid workplace, while raising families or in a caring role. It will make it easier for such pensioners to qualify for a higher rate of the State Pension (contributory). The TCA will ensure that the totality of a person&rsquo;s social insurance contributions - as opposed to the timing of them - determines a final pension outcome, and it also acknowledges, for the first time, the contribution made by home-carers in the period before 1994.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The package is generally available to people living in the State aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment or who satisfy a means test.  The package is also available to some people under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.</p>  <p>  Since 1 April 2012, new applicants in receipt of Carer's Allowance who are not living with the person for whom they provide care do not have an automatic entitlement to the household benefits package. Carers who live with the person they are caring for still have an entitlement of their own to the household benefits package and do not have to satisfy the household composition criteria.</p>  <p>  The Government values the role of carers very much and it is for this reason that they receive significant income supports from the Department.  In addition to carer&rsquo;s allowance, carers receive additional support in the form of free travel and household benefits (for those who live with the person for whom they care) and the annual carer's support grant (&euro;1,700) in respect of each person for whom they care.  Where a person is in receipt of certain qualifying social welfare payments, and also providing full-time care and attention to another person, they can keep their primary social welfare payment and also get the half-rate carer's allowance.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that carer's payments are made at a higher level than other working-age income maintenance payments made by my Department.  The weekly rate for Carer's Allowance is &euro;219 where one person is being cared for, and &euro;328.50 where it is two or more, compared to &euro;203 for most other income maintenance payments to those below pension age.  The means test for Carer's Allowance is also significantly more generous than those applying to other schemes.</p>  <p>  Any decision to change the qualifying criteria for HHB would have budgetary consequences and would have to be considered in the context of budget negotiations.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputies.</p></reply>

Social Welfare legislation states that jobseeker payments may be made until the person reaches pensionable age.  In this regard, the duration of jobseeker's payments will naturally adjust in line with increases in state pension age.</p>  <p>  Jobseeker's Benefit is normally paid for 9 months (234 days) for people with 260 or more PRSI contributions paid and for 6 months (156 days) for people with fewer than 260 PRSI contributions paid.  Arrangements are in place to provide that jobseekers whose benefit expires in their 65th year can generally continue to be paid benefit up until pensionable age provided they satisfy the necessary contribution conditions.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that there is no legally mandated retirement age in the State, and the age at which employees retire is a matter for the contract of employment between them and their employers.  While such a contract may have been entered into with a retirement date of 65, in the context of the previous State pension arrangements, there is no legal impediment to the employer and employee agreeing to increase the duration of employment for one or more years, if both parties wish to do so.  In this regard, the Workplace Relations Commission has produced a Code of Practice on Longer Working and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) has published guidance material for employers on the use of fixed-term contracts beyond normal retirement age.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Under this principle the benefits and pensions that are paid are not directly related to the amount of PRSI contributions paid by insured persons.  PRSI contribution income is instead redistributed to support contributors who are more vulnerable.</p>  <p>  In addition, there is a general principle of one person, one payment, which applies across the social welfare system.  Given the contingency-based nature of this system, it can happen that a person may experience more than one contingency at the same time, but generally, as these payments are to help them meet their income needs, he or she can receive only one of those payments.  This principle is common to social security systems across the world.</p>  <p>  There were a limited number of exceptions in the social insurance system to the general principle of one person, one payment.  These exceptions usually applied in the context of short-term benefits at reduced rates.  For instance, recipients of One-Parent Family Payment, Widows and Widowers Pensioners could, until recent years, also receive short-term social insurance benefits, such as Illness Benefit and Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit at half-rate at the same time.  These overlapping payment arrangements were introduced in the early 1950s when the social insurance system was first established, at a time when there were only 10 individual social welfare payments and when rates were significantly lower in real terms than they are now.  However, the social welfare system has been significantly developed over the intervening period, with the result that the number of possible combinations of concurrent contingencies has increased greatly.</p>  <p>  The concurrent payment of half-rate Illness Benefit and Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit in addition to One-Parent Family Payment, and Widows and Widowers Pensions was discontinued from January 2012, in the context of the Government&rsquo;s commitments to maintain existing core rates of primary payments for social welfare recipients. There are exceptions to this as in a case where a reduced Widows Pension is in payment and paid at a rate lower than the Illness Benefit Rate. In such circumstances Illness Benefit may be paid to ensure that the aggregate payment will equate with the maximum rate of Illness Benefit appropriate to the person&rsquo;s circumstances.  However, it is not possible for someone to be paid both a full rate Widows Contributory Pension (&euro;208.50 for someone under 66, plus allowances) and Illness Benefit (&euro;203.00 plus allowances).  Such combined rates of payments, neither of which are subject to a means test,  would be significantly higher than those paid to other people supported by my Department, many of whom are at significantly greater risk of poverty.</p>  <p>  To change the underlying principle of entitlement, and allow people claim multiple payments in the manner suggested, would involve significant additional expenditure which could prove unsustainable in the long-term, and would have to be considered in the overall policy and budgetary contexts.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

My Department will spend approximately &euro;248 million this year on HHB for over 446,000 customers. The package is generally available to people living in the State aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment or who satisfy a means test.  The package is also available to some people under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.</p>  <p>  Since 1 April 2012, new applicants in receipt of Carer's Allowance who are not living with the person for whom they provide care do not have an automatic entitlement to the household benefits package. Carers who live with the person they are caring for still have an entitlement of their own to the household benefits package and do not have to satisfy the household composition criteria.</p>  <p>  The Government values the role of carers very much and it is for this reason that they receive significant income supports from the Department.  In addition to carer&rsquo;s allowance, carers receive additional support in the form of free travel and household benefits (for those who live with the person for whom they care) and the annual carer's support grant (&euro;1,700) in respect of each person for whom they care.  Where a person is in receipt of certain qualifying social welfare payments, and also providing full-time care and attention to another person, they can keep their primary social welfare payment and also get the half-rate carer's allowance.</p>  <p>  The maximum rates of Carer's Allowance for those aged under 66, at &euro;219 (&euro;257 for carers aged 66 or over) for where one person is being cared for, and &euro;328.50 (&euro;385.50 for carers aged 66 or over) where there are two or more carees, is significantly higher than that for such Department Schemes as Jobseeker's Allowance, which is &euro;203 for those aged 26, and lower for younger claimants.</p>  <p>  The means test for carers allowance has been significantly eased over the years, and is now one of the most generous means tests in the social welfare system, most notably with regard to spouse&rsquo;s earnings.  At present the means test for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance allows for an income disregard of &euro;332.50 per week for a single person and &euro;665 for a couple. In the case of a single carer: - that person may retain a full-rate payment of &euro;219.00 while having an annual income of just under &euro;19,000.00, retain a payment of &euro;109.00 per week (just under half rate) while having an annual income of &euro;25,400.00, or retain the minimum payment of &euro;4 per week while having an annual income of &euro;31,100.00.</p>  <p>  Carers can also engage in employment, self-employment, training or education courses outside the home for not more than 15 hours a week.</p>  <p>  Any decision to change the qualifying criteria for HHB would have budgetary consequences and would have to be considered in the context of budget negotiations.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The most recent data shows that the national unemployment rate fell from a peak of 15% in 2012 to 4.8% by Q1 2019. Unemployment decreased by 18,500 (13.9%) in the year to Q1 2019 bringing the total number of persons unemployed to 114,400.</p>  <p>  Within the Mid-East region, which includes County Wicklow, unemployment has fallen from a peak of 17% in 2013 to 4.1% by Quarter 1 2019 with numbers in employment increasing from 272,400 in Q4 2013 to 341,300 by Q1 2019.</p>  <p>  While data from the Labour Force Survey is not available at the county level, trends in the Live Register can give an indication of underlying trends in local employment.</p>  <p>  Overall, the live register in Wicklow has fallen by 51.5% in the 5 years to April 2019, from 11,412 to 5,533. In the year to April 2019, the live register in Wicklow has fallen by just over 13%, in line with national trends.</p>  <p>  Government policy to reduce unemployment is twofold. The polices set out in the Action Plan for Jobs have created an environment in which business can succeed and has led to the creation of almost 400,000 jobs in Ireland since the economic low point of 2012.  Secondly, through the Pathways to Work strategy, my Department ensures that as many new jobs as possible are filled by people taken from the live register, particularly the long-term unemployed.</p>  <p>  Currently there are 8 case officers in the Intreo service in Wicklow.  A total of 2,883 customer engagements have taken place in 2019 between January and end May.  The Bray Local Employment Service has also carried out 1,399 customer engagements in the same period.</p>  <p>  Additionally, my Department has organised events for Jobseekers in County Wicklow. For example, during Jobs Week in March of this year, 16 employers and 13 service providers participated in the Jobs, Careers and Training Fair in Bray Institute of Further Education, which was attended by approximately 1,500 jobseekers.</p>  <p>  To date the policies being pursued under the Action Plan for Jobs and under Pathways to Work have been effective in reducing unemployment, both nationally and in Wicklow.</p></reply>

The cost of increasing all pension rates by &euro;9 per week, including proportionate increases for qualified adults and those on reduced rates, is estimated at &euro;297.2 million.</p><p>The Living Alone Increase is a supplementary payment for people on certain social welfare payments who are living alone. The estimated cost of raising the Living Alone Increase by &euro;3 per week, from &euro;9 to &euro;12, is &euro;32.6 million.</p><p>Those in receipt of a social welfare pension automatically receive an increase when they reach 80 years of age.  The cost of increasing the Over 80 Allowance by &euro;2 per week, from &euro;10 to &euro;12, is &euro;17.5 million.</p><p>The fuel allowance is a payment of &euro;22.50 per week from October to April to over 373,000 low-income households, at an estimated cost of &euro;235 million in 2019.  The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs. The estimated cost of increasing the fuel allowance to 32 weeks from 28 weeks to those eligible is &euro;33.6 million.</p><p>Any changes to the above schemes would have to be considered in an overall budgetary context.

In 2018 ENPs were made in respect of 2,812 funerals at a cost of &euro;5.317m and 69 burial expenses at a cost of &euro;140,674.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The estimated yearly cost of the increase in payment, taking into account there are approximately 512,000 recipients of the State Pension Contributory and the State Pension Non-Contributory, would be in the region of &euro;135m.  The costs would increase further if this was extended to recipients of other payments made to people of pension age, e.g. Widows Contributory Pensions, and Increases for Qualified Adults where the recipient is aged 66 or over.</p>  <p>  Any decision to introduce a new digital support allowance for all persons in receipt of the State Pension would have significant budgetary consequences and would have to be considered in the overall policy and budgetary context.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Where a person has authenticated their identity to a substantial level of assurance, they are issued a Public Services Card (PSC).</p>  <p>  This legislation also allows for the disallowance or disqualification from receipt of social welfare payments in the event that a person does not authenticate their identity.  As my Department spends over &euro;19bn annually on supports and services, the Deputy will appreciate that it is essential that all steps are taken to ensure the people who access our services are the people who are entitled to receive them. I consider it reasonable, therefore, to ask people to authenticate their identity in this manner.</p>  <p>  Data is not collected on the number of individuals who have had their payments stopped because they have failed to authenticate their identity.</p>  <p>  Once a person has authenticated their identity and been issued with a PSC, other public service bodies accept the PSC as evidence that the person has authenticated their identity.  This removes the need for the person to repeatedly register their identity details with different public bodies when accessing services.</p>  <p>  Earlier this year, my Department published the findings of a customer survey on the PSC. The results of the survey were very positive and showed strong support for the PSC and very high levels of customer satisfaction with the information provided and the processes involved in applying for a PSC. The results also showed that people welcome and support the sharing of identity information between public bodies because it makes their life easier when they are applying for public services.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The legislation underpinning the application of penalty rates is provided for in the Social Welfare Act, 2010.  Penalty rates were introduced as a means of encouraging jobseekers to engage with activation measures and co-operate with efforts of the Department to assist them in securing employment. </p>  <p>  Penalty rates can only be applied by a Deciding Officer of my Department in specific circumstances and in line with the legislation. A full examination of all the facts of each case is undertaken and only then is a penalty rate applied, if appropriate. It should be noted that penalty rates are only applied as a last resort and if dissatisfied with a decision to apply a penalty rate it is open to a Jobseeker to appeal that decision to the Social Welfare Appeals Office. </p>  <p>  In circumstances where a Jobseeker has failed to engage without good cause in the activation process, a penalty rate can be applied followed by a nine week disqualification of Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance or Benefit. The disqualification may only be imposed in circumstances where a person, who has already had his or her rate reduced by way of a penalty rate for a period of not less than 21 calendar days (3 weeks) and continues to refuse or fail, without good cause, to engage with the Department&rsquo;s activation service. However it is important to note that at any time while either a penalty rate or a nine week disqualification is in place, if the customer re-engages with the Department&rsquo;s activation service the sanctions will be lifted immediately and normal payment restored. </p>  <p>  As at the end of April 2019, there were 75,000 customers engaged with JobPath of which 487, or 0.6%, had a penalty rate applied to their Jobseeker&rsquo;s claim.  This figure is consistent with the overall level of penalty rates applied across all Jobseekers.  </p>  <p>   Unfortunately further data in relation to the question posed in this case is not available. </p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-06-11a.2387.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019061100111#WREEE04000"><p>The household benefits package (HHB) comprises the electricity or gas allowance, and the free television licence.  My Department will spend approximately &euro;248 million this year on HHB for over 446,000 customers. The package is generally available to people living in the State aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment or who satisfy a means test.  The package is also available to some people under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.  </p>  <p>  Since 1 April 2012, new applicants in receipt of Carers Allowance who are not living with the person for whom they provide care do not have an automatic entitlement to the household benefits package. Carers who live with the person they are caring for can still have an entitlement to the household benefits package and do not have to satisfy the household composition criteria.  </p>  <p>  The Government values the role of carers very much and it is for this reason that they receive significant income supports from the Department.  In addition to carer&rsquo;s allowance carers receive additional support in the form of free travel and household benefits (for those who live with the person for whom they care) and the annual carers support grant (&euro;1,700) in respect of each person for whom they care.  </p>  <p>  Where a person is in receipt of certain qualifying social welfare payments, and also providing full time care and attention to another person, they can keep their primary social welfare payment and also get the half-rate carer's allowance.  It should also be noted that since October 2013 the payment of half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance does not preclude a person from qualifying for fuel allowance.  If a person is in receipt of a non-contributory social welfare payment and a half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance, then they are deemed to have satisfied the means test and fuel allowance is payable subject to all remaining criteria being satisfied.  If a person is in receipt of a contributory social welfare payment and a half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance then they will have to undergo a means test for fuel allowance.</p>  <p>  The maximum rates of Carer's Allowance for those aged under 66, at &euro;219 (&euro;257 for carers aged 66 or over) for where one person is being cared for, and &euro;328.50 (&euro;385.50 for carers aged 66 or over) where there are two or more carees , is significantly higher than that for most schemes administered by my department.  </p>  <p>  The means test for carers allowance has been significantly eased over the years, and is now one of the most generous means tests in the social welfare system, most notably with regard to spouse&rsquo;s earnings.  At present the means test for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance allows for an income disregard of &euro;332.50 per week for a single person and &euro;665 for a couple.  In the case of a single carer, that person may retain a full-rate payment of &euro;219.00 while having an annual income of just under &euro;19,000.00, or retain a payment of &euro;109.00 per week (just under half rate) while having an annual income of &euro;25,400.00, or retain the minimum payment of &euro;4 per week while having an annual income of &euro;31,100.00. </p>  <p>  Carers can also engage in employment, self-employment, training or education courses outside the home for not more than 15 hours a week.</p>  <p>  Any decision to change the qualifying criteria for HHB or fuel allowance would have budgetary consequences and would have to be considered in the context of budget negotiations. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This change was signalled well in advance of its introduction. In 1993, "Developing the National Pension System - Final Report of the National Pensions Board&rdquo; was published, and recommended that the number of paid contributions required to qualify for a contributory pension should be increased to 520 contributions, in recognition of the expansion of PRSI coverage over the decades. The enabling legislation was contained in Section 12 of the Social Welfare Act 1997, which provided for the implementation of the change in two stages, with the paid contribution requirement being standardised initially at 260 from 2002, and rising to 520 from April 2012, 15 years after its introduction in law. </p>  <p>  Those who were affected by this change may or may not have an alternative State pension payment.  Where they do not and they have made no claim for a state pension, it is not possible to state what the rate of that payment would have been, had there been no policy change. </p>  <p>  The second change was introduced as part of Budget 2012.  From September 2012, new rate bands for State pension (contributory) were introduced. These new rate bands more accurately reflect the social insurance history of a person and ensure that those who contribute more during a working life are likely to benefit more in retirement than those with less frequent contributions during working life. </p>  <p>  Due to the interaction between these and other effects over the period from 2012, it is not possible to isolate the figures requested in tabular form. It has however been estimated that the savings to the Social Insurance Fund resulting from the change in rate bands was rising by roughly &euro;10 million per annum, as they applied to new pensioners from September 2012, and that this would have reached some &euro;60 to &euro;80 million by 2018, based upon those paid in the relevant ratebands.  However, the saving could be higher as some pensioners, as a result of this change, are alternatively paid State pension (non-contributory) at a higher rate than their SPC entitlement.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The effect of this is that a post-2012 pensioner who has 20 years of HomeCaring periods can qualify for a maximum rate pension with just 20 years of paid contributions.  Most pensioners with only 20 years contributions, whether qualifying under pre-2012 or post-2012 ratebands, could not qualify for a maximum rate pension under the Yearly Average system, unless they first entered insurable employment in their 40s, or later.</p>  <p>  The TCA ensures that the totality of a person&rsquo;s social insurance contributions, as opposed to the timing of them, determines what their final pension outcome will be. In particular it will benefit people whose work history includes an extended period of time outside the paid workplace raising families or in a full-time caring role. Crucially, unlike the current Homemakers scheme or earlier proposals for Homemakers Credits, HomeCaring Periods apply to periods both before and after 1994. This recognises that most people reaching pension age between 2012 and 2019, if they had taken a home caring break looking after young children, would most likely have done so before 1994.</p>  <p>  This approach will make it easier for many post-2012 pensioners affected by the 2012 rate band changes to qualify for a higher rate of the State pension (contributory), particularly if they were absent from the workforce caring for children, or an older person with a care need.</p>  <p>  Using figures provided by the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund, my Department estimated that the cost of the interim TCA approach for those who reach State Pension Age in 2019 would be circa &euro;54 million.  The precise figure will depend upon a number of factors, including take-up of HomeCaring periods, and also the inflows from other payments, where a person has no existing SPC claim in the system, but may now find it more advantageous than their current payment.</p>  <p>  At this stage, we do not have sufficient information to provide an estimate for 2020 costs, as the Department intends introducing further reform in this area, TCA 2020, within that timeframe.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

These payments are being reviewed under a new Total Contributions Approach (TCA) to pension calculation which includes provision for homecaring periods.</p>  <p>  Regardless of when a review is conducted, where an increase in payment is due, the person's rate of payment is adjusted without delay and arrears paid, backdated to 30 March 2018 or the person's 66th birthday if later.  Where a person's rate does not increase following review, the person will continue to receive their existing rate of payment.</p>  <p>  The detailed breakdown requested by the Deputy is not readily available, however, it should be noted that approximately 67% of cases, where increases were awarded, achieved the maximum personal rate State pension contributory. Based on an analysis of sample of cases where an increase was awarded, the best estimate at this stage is that 16% of those who received an increase received a weekly increase of over &euro;30; 36% received an increase of between &euro;20 - &euro;30; 4% received an increase of between &euro;15 and &euro;20; 4% received an increase of between &euro;10 and &euro;15; 4% received an increase of between &euro;5 and &euro;10; 36% received an increase up to &euro;5. Importantly, most of those who received less than &euro;5.00 following their review achieved maximum personal contributory pension rate, which cannot be further improved upon.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Their work involves the assessment of water bodies to understand any issues affecting water quality. Working with local communities, landowners, business owners and public bodies, the Programme team develops relevant and workable solutions to identified issues. </p><p>The Plan lists 190 Priority Areas for Action (PAA) around which LAWPRO&rsquo;s work is concentrated. Thirty-five of these areas are located in the South East Region. LAWPRO is currently carrying out local catchment assessments in nine of these areas as follows: <table><tr><th>Athy stream</th><th></th></tr><tr><td>Clodiagh (Portlaw)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Dinin (South, Main and Muckalee channels)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Owveg (Nore)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Sow</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Tay</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Burren</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Clashawley</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Nuenna</td><td></td></tr></table>These areas are all are tributaries of the Barrow, Suir, Nore and Slaney rivers and the assessment work is expected to conclude on each before December 2021.</p><p>Informing and working with local communities is an important part of LAWPRO&rsquo;s work. Prior to commencing their assessments, LAWPRO organises a community information meeting to discuss the water body with local people and interest groups. These meetings are publicised via the placement of adverts in local newspapers, and the distribution of posters and leaflets. Local meetings are followed by farmer engagement events organised by advisors from the collaborative Agricultural Sustainability Support and Advisory Programme, with the support of LAWPRO staff. The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine issues letters of invitation to farmers within the PAA for these events.</p><p>LAWPRO catchment scientists analyse feedback from local communities and farmers along with scientific data from the EPA, local authorities and other bodies before designing a fieldwork plan to address gaps in their understanding of how water flows through the catchment and the local pressures on water quality in that area. </p><p>As part of their fieldwork, LAWPRO catchment scientists walk the riverbanks and take water samples to assess the condition of the river. Once the fieldwork is concluded and analysed, LAWPRO discuss the outcome of the assessment with the relevant implementing bodies or landowners and agree timelines for implementation of measures to improve water quality. The advisors from the Agricultural Sustainability Support and Advisory Programme will discuss any agricultural measures with the farmers. </p><p>LAWPRO plan to carry out 101 detailed desk-studies, 87 community information meetings and conduct 75 catchment assessments nationally by December 2019. </p><p>LAWPRO will produce a report for each Priority Area for Action and information will also be available on the www.catchments.ie website later in the summer.</p></reply>

That Department has led an inter-agency review with a view to enhancing the mitigation of wildland/gorse fires. It is imperative that communities and relevant bodies continue to work together to seek to prevent and control wildland fires. </p>  <p>  Local authority fire services respond to incidents of fire in accordance with the provisions of the Fire Services Acts, 1981 and 2003. The officer in charge of the local authority fire brigade is empowered to request additional resources as part of the response, taking account of the situation confronted and drawing on standard approaches to firefighting and operational guidelines. </p>  <p>  The priority of fire services in responding to incidents of wildland fires is the protection of life in local communities and among emergency responders. An important secondary objective is working with local communities to try to protect infrastructure, family homes and other property, as well as conservation areas, where it is safe to do so.  </p>  <p>  The response to such wildfires is supported by well established arrangements where local authority fire services may, through the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management (NDFEM) in my Department, request the assistance of the Defence Forces. The kind of support provided to local authority fire services by the Defence Forces in wildland fire-fighting has been very effective and is greatly appreciated. </p>  <p>  It is acknowledged that the primary function of the Air Corps helicopter fleet is not fire-fighting and  there are times when aerial firefighting support may not be available or the helicopters may be deployed at other locations. In such instances, this information will be relayed to the senior fire officer at the scene who, depending on the circumstances, may decide to activate a procedure for the use of private helicopters with aerial firefighting capability, if this is available.  Irish Coast Guard helicopters provide a vital search and rescue service and would not be requested or deployed for aerial firefighting. </p>  <p>  It is anticipated that aerial firefighting support would only be requested from another jurisdiction in extreme circumstances where neither the Air Corps nor private helicopter capacity were available to provide assistance.  It is often the case that conditions which support the development of wildland fires will affect adjacent jurisdictions at the same time, and therefore its aerial firefighting resources may already be deployed.</p></reply>

There are three separate grants available, including the Housing Aid for Older People grant. Funding of &euro;71.25 million was allocated for the three grants in 2019, with responsibility for the apportionment between them being a matter for each local authority.  Any increase in funding would have to be considered in the context of the full suite of grants. An additional &euro;28.38 million would be required to restore the funding for the three grants to 2010 levels.</p>  <p>  The terms and conditions governing the grants were examined in 2013 by a review group that included representatives of grant beneficiaries and the local authorities. They considered how the benefits of the grants could be spread as widely as possible and to achieve fairness and value for money in the grants process. Arising from the recommendations of the review group, the income requirements, eligibility and maximum grant were revised in 2014 to focus the grants towards those with the greatest need. It is not possible to predict the number of potential new applications that fall outside the new criteria introduced in 2014, and therefore my Department is not in a position to furnish an estimate of the cost of reversing these policies.</p>  <p>  I am conscious of the benefit accruing from these grants, particularly in terms of facilitating older people and people with a disability, to remain living independently in their own homes.  This is recognised in the Programme for Government and as a consequence, funding has been increasing year on year since 2014.  As part of the annual budgetary process, consideration will be given in future years to increasing further the funding for these grants in line with both Rebuilding Ireland and the Government's Policy Statement on Housing Options for Our Ageing Population, which is available on my Department's website at the following link: www.housing.gov.ie/sites/default/files/publications/files/housingoptionsforanageingpopulationeng_web.pdf.</p></reply>

It is important to note that while my Department has overall responsibility for establishing and maintaining an effective regulatory framework for building standards and building control, it has no general statutory role in resolving defects in privately owned buildings, including dwellings, nor does it have a budget for such matters.  It is not possible for the State to take on responsibility/liability for all legacy issues, nor would it send the right message to the industry regarding their responsibility for compliance. </p>  <p>  Local authorities have extensive powers of inspection and enforcement under the Fire Services Acts 1981 and 2003, the Housing Acts and the Planning and Development Acts, all of which may be relevant where fire safety concerns arise in residential developments. Fire services may inspect buildings in cases of defects or complaints in respect of fire safety.  They work with building owners to ensure immediate risks are addressed, and  a plan put in place for works to bring buildings into compliance. They have enforcement powers for cases where co-operation is not forthcoming, or progress cannot be made on an agreed basis.  Local authorities are independent in the use of their statutory powers.</p>  <p>  In the interest of supporting owners and residents living in developments where concerns regarding non-compliance with fire safety requirements arise, it was agreed that a review be undertaken by an independent fire expert to develop a framework for general application.  In August 2017, the  Framework for Enhancing Fire Safety in Dwellings was published, which is intended to be used as a guide by the owners and occupants of dwellings where fire safety deficiencies have been identified, or are a cause for concern. The Framework will also be of assistance to professional advisors, both in developing strategies to improve fire safety and in developing strategies to enable continued occupation in advance of undertaking the necessary works to ensure compliance with the relevant Building Regulations. The Framework is available on my Department's website at the following link: www.housing.gov.ie/sites/default/files/publications/files/framework_for_enhancing_fire_safety_in_dwellings.pdf.</p>  <p>  In the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower tragedy in June 2017, and in recognition of fears expressed for fire safety, my Department's National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management was asked to convene a Task Force to lead a re-appraisal of our approach to fire safety in Ireland.  In its report, the Task Force acknowledges the importance of fire safety in apartment buildings and makes a number of recommendations in this regard and I have tasked the Directorate's Management Board with implementation of the recommendations within its remit, and oversight of the implementation of other recommendations.  The Task Force Report is available on my Department's website at the following link: www.housing.gov.ie/sites/default/files/publications/files/fire_safety_in_ireland_-_report_of_the_fire_safety_task_force.pdf. </p>  <p>  In addition, in relation to the Building Regulations, work has been on-going to review Part B &ndash; Fire Safety and a new Part B/ TGD B Volume 2 (2017) came into force on 1 July 2017.

Under the terms of the NTICI, which was underpinned by a once off fund of &euro;10 million, developments subject to valid taking-in-charge applications were eligible for inclusion in the associated call for funding proposals. Ultimately, &euro;7.5 million of the allocated funding was paid to local authorities in respect of 330 developments, containing some 14,930 homes. </p>  <p>  Findings and recommendations from the NTICI process were included in a report on the initiative that was published by my Department in December 2018. The report is available at the following link:  www.housing.gov.ie/sites/default/files/publications/files/national_taking_in_charge_initiative_report_dec2018.pdf. </p>  <p>  The publication of the NTICI report is of value to local authorities and other stakeholders in applying the lessons from the pilot authorities, in a more general roll-out of a streamlined approach to taking-in-charge, including through coordination with capital works by Irish Water. In this regard, my Department is liaising with Irish Water in relation to the report.</p>  <p>  Ultimately, however, progression of individual developments through the taking-in-charge process is a matter for the relevant housing developer, the residents in such developments and the relevant local authority, following the procedures laid out in section 180 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended).</p>  <p>  The National Development Plan, published last year, includes a provision for &euro;31 million for the period 2018-2021 for developer-provided infrastructure, commencing with a provision of &euro;6 million in 2019.  The multi-annual programme will be initiated through the invitation of project bids from local authorities followed by their evaluation by an Expert Panel, set up by my Department, to independently evaluate the bid projects to be approved for funding.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently finalising the details of the programme and it is expected that the invitation for project bids from local authorities will issue shortly, with approval of projects for this first cycle multi-annual programme to take place once proposals submitted have been assessed.</p></reply>

Thereafter, rent reviews can take place annually in RPZs. Tenants must be given 90 days&rsquo; notice of a new rent and can make an application for dispute resolution to the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) if they consider the rent increase to be in excess of the market rent. A dispute can also be raised where the dwelling is located in a RPZ and the tenant considers that the rent increase does not comply with the 4% p.a. rent increase restriction.</p><p>In the case of a tenancy of a dwelling in an RPZ, a landlord must, at the commencement of the tenancy, furnish the tenant with details of the amount of the previous rent for the dwelling and the date that it was set. In reviewing a rent in a RPZ, the landlord must also provide the tenant with 3 examples of rents for similar properties in a comparable area.</p><p>The rent increase restriction of 4% p.a. in RPZs equally applies to social housing tenancies under the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS).  Where the local authority in a RPZ wishes to offer a new RAS contract or to review a RAS rent, the rent increase restriction provisions under the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004-2019 apply as outlined above. It is a matter for each local authority, as the lessee in RAS contracts, to ensure compliance with the RPZ legislation in respect of RAS dwellings. The application of the Rent Predictability measures in RPZs assist local authorities and tenants to secure units within the private rental market at a more sustainable and predictable cost.  </p><p>The RTB provides information in relation to rent setting in RPZs at the following weblink: .</p></reply>

Towards the end of last year I asked my Department to undertake a review of its operation.</p>  <p>  In carrying out the review, the Department has consulted with a number of local authorities, the Housing Agency and the Housing Finance Agency (HFA). The review also had regard to the views raised by public representatives since the scheme's commencement.  In making any recommendations in relation to the operation of the scheme, it also takes account of the need to ensure that lending issued under it is provided on a prudential basis, so as to protect the financial interests of the borrowers and the local authorities.    </p>  <p>  The review has been submitted to me and I am currently examining it.</p>  <p>  When the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan was initially being developed, it was estimated that the drawdown of loans under the scheme would be approximately &euro;200 million over three years. From the data collated on the scheme to date, the RIHL has proven to be more successful than initially anticipated, as a result of which, the scheme would require a further tranche of funds to be borrowed by the HFA in order to enable its continuation.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently in discussions with the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance with regard to the amount of a second tranche, which I anticipate, will be finalised soon. When these discussions are concluded I will be in a position to make an announcement on the matter.  Ahead of such an announcement, the operation of the scheme is not affected; the scheme remains open and all local authorities have been advised to continue to receive and process applications up to and including the issuing of loans.</p></reply>

In the determination of the minimum reckonable income, local authorities can include income from a number of different sources and classes, such as from employment, private pensions, maintenance payments and certain social welfare payments, including pensions, where the social welfare payment is secondary to employment income. </p>  <p>  The minimum income criterion was introduced in order to ensure the sustainability of the scheme.  Applicants must demonstrate that they have an income that is long-term and sustainable in nature. This ensures that the tenant purchasing the house is in a financial position, as the owner, to maintain and insure the property for the duration of the charged period, in compliance with the conditions of the order transferring the ownership of, and responsibility for, the house from the local authority to the tenant.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that the financing of any house sold under the Tenant (Incremental) Purchase Scheme is a separate matter from the eligibility criteria for the scheme.  If the tenant is deemed eligible under the scheme, he or she may fund the purchase of a house from one, or a combination, of his / her own resources or a mortgage provided by a financial institution or a local authority house purchase loan.</p>  <p>  In line with the commitment given in the Government's Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan on Housing and Homelessness, a review of the operation of the first 12 months of the Tenant Purchase (Incremental) Scheme has been completed and a full report has been prepared setting out findings and recommendations.  </p>  <p>  Following consideration of a number of implementation issues arising, I expect to be in a position to publish the Review shortly. I intend to bring a comprehensive package of social housing reform measures to Government in the near future and the relevant recommendations made in the Review of the Tenant Purchase Scheme will be progressed as part of that process.</p></reply>

The 2011 Regulations do not provide local authorities with any discretion to exceed the limits that apply to their administrative areas. </p>  <p>  Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, and the universal social charge.  The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once off in nature. There is no provision in the policy to deduct any other regular outgoings, such as maintenance paid in respect of family members, from gross household income for the purposes of the income threshold. </p>  <p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced at that time also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.</p>  <p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support.  The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources. </p>  <p>  However, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is underway.  The review will also have regard to current initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and cost rental and will be completed when the impacts of these parallel initiatives have been considered.</p></reply>

A Part 4 tenancy may be terminated by a landlord or tenant, without reason, at the end of its 6 year term. Section 34 provides that a landlord must state a reason for the termination in any notice served, other than at the end of its six year term, in line with the grounds set out in section 34 of the Acts.</p><p>The Acts provide that a Part 4 tenancy can be terminated by a landlord during its term where: </p><p>-  A tenant is non-compliant with their obligations;</p><p>-  The dwelling is no longer suitable to the accommodation needs of the tenant;</p><p>-  A landlord wishes to sell the property;</p><p>-  A landlord requires the property for their own use of use by a family member; </p><p>-  A landlord wishes to refurbish the property; or</p><p>-  A landlord wishes to change the use of  the  dwelling.</p><p>The Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 further enhances the security of tenure for tenants by significantly extending the duration of tenancy termination notice periods; for example, a minimum of 180 days (approx. 6 months) notice must be provided by landlords who terminate a tenancy of between 3 and 7 years&rsquo; duration.  Termination notice periods of up to 224 days are required for tenancies of 8 or more years. <table><tr><th>Duration of tenancy</th><th>New Notice Period</th></tr><tr><td>Less than 6   months</td><td>28 days</td></tr><tr><td>Not less than 6 monthS but less than 1 year</td><td>90 days</td></tr><tr><td>Not less than 1 year but less than 3 years</td><td>120 days</td></tr><tr><td>Not less than 3 years but less than 7 years</td><td>180 days</td></tr><tr><td>Not less than 7 years but less than 8 years</td><td>196 days</td></tr><tr><td>Not less than 8 years</td><td>224 days</td></tr></table></p><p>In addition, further measures have been introduced to enhance and enforce tenancy termination provisions, including:</p><p>-  the application of the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB)'s new investigation and sanctioning regime to improper conduct by a landlord who contravenes the tenancy termination provisions; and</p><p>-  a new requirement for landlords to copy a tenancy termination notice to the RTB.</p><p>The RTB provides comprehensive information relating to tenancy terminations by landlords, including approved housing bodies, at the following weblink - .</p></reply>

The review of the aspects of legislation relating to regulation of fairground equipment and funfairs in section 239 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, particularly in respect of the specific legislative provisions relating to fairground equipment, is ongoing and includes an examination of international practice in the area of regulating public safety.

This included improved funding schemes for individual wells (more commonly known as private or household wells) and on-site wastewater treatment systems (more commonly known as septic tanks).</p>  <p>  The composition of the new multi-annual programme is based on recommendations from the Working Group that I established in April 2018 to conduct a review of investment needs and rural water services. The changes that I have approved to the individual wells grant scheme are, as follows:</p>  <p>  -  A maximum grant for rehabilitation works of &euro;3,000, which represents an increase of 47% on the current maximum grant amount;</p>  <p>  -  Where the local authority agrees that the most appropriate solution is to provide a new well, the maximum grant payable would be &euro;5,000;</p>  <p>  -  Recognising the role of the grant in improving quality, the water quality treatment element (typically filtration and UV filtration) will qualify for 100% funding up to a maximum of &euro;1,000;</p>  <p>  -  Up to 85% of other costs would be met, subject to the total combined maximum costs of &euro;3,000 for well rehabilitation or &euro;5,000 for a new well;</p>  <p>  -  For clarity, applicants would not be able to avail of both grant amounts, so they would not be able to avail of &euro;3,000 for well rehabilitation as well as the &euro;5,000 for a new well.</p>  <p>  The new funding scheme for on-site wastewater treatment systems (more commonly known as septic tanks) will replace the grant which was brought into operation by the Domestic Waste Water Treatment System (Financial Assistance) Regulations 2013.  Under certain conditions, households can receive a grant to assist them in carrying out remediation, repair or upgrading works to, or replacement of, their individual domestic wastewater treatment system (septic tank).  </p>  <p>  To avail of the grant the treatment system must have been inspected under the EPA&rsquo;s National Inspection Plan and an Advisory Notice must have been issued by the local authority under the Water Services (Amendment) Act 2012.  Also, the treatment system requiring attention must have been registered by the owner of the premises connected to it by 1 February 2013.</p>  <p>  In order to ensure greater uniformity with other measures in the Multi-Annual Rural Water Programme the means test that previously applied to this grant scheme is being removed and the level of grant support is being increased to 85% of the eligible costs of installation/upgrade or &euro;5,000 (up from &euro;2,500/&euro;4,000) whichever is the lesser.  This represents an increase of 25% and 100%, respectively, relative to the current maximum grant levels. </p>  <p>  Work is at an advanced stage of development for the funding schemes. I expect that the process will be completed in the coming weeks when the necessary regulations dealing with the financial assistance arrangements and related administrative matters are put in place. This will enable a circular letter, terms and conditions, guidance and application form to issue to local authorities shortly thereafter.</p></reply>

The composition of the new multi-annual programme is based on recommendations from the Working Group that I established in April 2018 to conduct a review of investment needs and rural water services.</p>  <p>  There is a two-strand approach to the considerations of the Working Group. Strand 1 considered the composition and distribution of funding for the Multi-annual Rural Water Programme 2019-2021, while Strand 2 is considering the more complex longer-focus issues surrounding the long-term future resourcing of the rural water sector.</p>  <p>  Capital funding of &euro;23 million had been provided in 2019 for the Programme, an increase &euro;3 million on that provided in 2018.  A total of &euro;75 million has been committed to the Programme under the National Development Plan from 2019 to 2021.</p>  <p>  The 2019-2021 funding cycle of the Programme consists of eight measures.  Most are further broken into sub-measures. These measures reflect the key challenges currently facing the rural water sector.</p>  <p>  Measure 6, Community Connections (Water and Wastewater) facilitates the continued expansion of the coverage of piped water supplies and central wastewater collection systems by extension off the public (Irish Water) network.  It includes a sub-measure Community Connection: Wastewater Network.  This sub-measure will support wastewater collection for population clusters, currently on deficient individual wastewater treatment systems (septic tanks), immediately adjacent to towns and villages through the development of community wastewater connection networks as extensions to the existing public wastewater collection system. </p>  <p>  Strand 2 of the considerations by the Working Group is currently underway and I expect a further report later in 2019. The wastewater infrastructure needs of rural towns and villages is an issue that the Working Group is to examine further.</p>  <p>  The Water Services Acts 2007 to 2017 already provide the necessary statutory framework for the delivery of water services.  Since 1 January 2014, Irish Water has statutory responsibility for all aspects of public water services planning, delivery and operation at national, regional and local levels.</p>  <p>  In May 2018 the Government approved the Water Services Policy Statement 2018-2025 and shortly after Irish Water submitted its Strategic Funding Plan 2019-2024 to my Department. The Strategic Funding Plan, which I have approved, details Irish Water&rsquo;s multi-annual strategic funding requirement of &euro;11 billion to 2024, comprising of a &euro;6.1 billion investment in infrastructure and assets and &euro;4.9 billion in operating costs.</p>  <p>  Irish Water will also play a key role in implementing Project Ireland 2040 which was published in February 2018 and incorporates the National Planning Framework (NPF) and the National Development Plan. Irish Water will take account of and support on-going work in developing subsidiary strategies to assist in implementing the NPF including the Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies as well as ongoing reviews of County Development Plans and Local Area Plans.</p>  <p>  I understand that Irish Water will be bringing forward proposals for a Small Towns and Villages Growth Programme which will support a number of the National Policy Objectives and National Strategic Outcomes under the NPF. The Small Towns and Villages Growth Programme is intended to provide water and wastewater growth capacity in smaller settlements which would not otherwise be provided for in its Investment Plan to 2024. Irish Water is to work with Local Authorities across the country in ensuring the investment is made where it is needed most, aligned to core strategies.  I understand that it is being proposed that the overall national budget for this Programme would be allocated between counties, based on an identified need against set criteria. </p>  <p>  Irish Water is subject to regulation by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU).  The proposals from Irish Water in this regard form part of the submissions from Irish Water to the CRU on its detailed investment plans under the Irish Water Investment Plan 2020 to 2024.  These submissions are currently being considered and a decision is expected from the CRU in the second half of 2019.  Subject to the outcome of this process it will then be a matter for Irish Water to progress its proposals in relation to the Small Towns and Villages Growth Programme. </p></reply>

It is estimated that this site can accommodate approximately 470 homes in a high quality mixed-tenure development. The current tenure mix as agreed with the Department is 30% Social and 70% cost rental.</p>  <p>  Plans regarding the development of the site at St. Michael's Estate are a matter for Dublin City Council, in the first instance. The Council has appointed a dedicated project manager and a project team to move the project forward. In addition to pre-existing consultative arrangements, the Council is also facilitating the establishment of a special Inchicore Regeneration Consultative Forum specifically for this project. As part of the consultative process open consultation sessions were hosted throughout November 2018. Furthermore, professional advisers have been appointed to develop an Urban Design Framework Plan.</p>  <p>  In addition to this, I appointed Mr Jack Nolan (retired Assistant Garda Commissioner) to undertake a scoping exercise for the Inchicore/Kilmainham area. This focuses on the long term economic and social regeneration of the community, and it is anticipated that his report will be submitted to me by the end of June.</p>  <p>  Last year, my Department had initial discussions with the European Investment Bank (EIB) regarding possible financing options for the St. Michael&rsquo;s site. The EIB remain very interested in the St. Michael&rsquo;s project and this initial contact has helped to facilitate a research project into the potential for the development of a broader cost rental sector in Ireland that my Department agreed with the EIB last month.</p>  <p>  Once the design of the project at St. Michael's Estate has been developed further by Dublin City Council, then more detailed financial modelling can be undertaken in relation to the cost rental element. This will build on the initial work undertaken by the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) last year, which indicated that rents that should be achievable will be competitive (15-25% below market), and it is expected that these will decrease further, relative to market rates, over time.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, work is continuing on the other cost rental 'pathfinder' pilot project at Enniskerry Road in Stepaside. This is a collaboration between my Department, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, the Housing Agency, Respond and Tuath Housing Associations, and the Housing Finance Agency.</p>  <p>  The Enniskerry Road development comprises 155 homes, 50 of which will be cost rental. I have approved funding of c.&euro;4.5m for the project under the Serviced Sites Fund and it is anticipated that construction will commence on site later this month.</p>  <p>  Both the St. Michaels Estate and the Enniskerry Road projects will provide very valuable lessons for the development of a national cost rental approach in Ireland and will help to shape the contractual model and specifications for future larger-scale projects.</p></reply>

In addition, further measures have been introduced to enhance and enforce tenancy termination provisions, including:</p>  <p>  -  the application of the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB)'s new investigation and sanctioning regime to improper conduct by a landlord who contravenes the tenancy termination provisions; and</p>  <p>  -  a new requirement for landlords to copy a tenancy termination notice to the RTB.</p>  <p>  The transition to tenancies of indefinite duration is being considered in the context of a further Housing and Residential Tenancies Bill which I will be bringing forward later this year and is expected to be the subject of pre-legislative scrutiny by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government in Q4 2019.

The Guidelines are available on my Department's website at the following link: www.housing.gov.ie/planning/guidelines/urban-development-and-building-height/urban-development-and-building-height-3.</p>  <p>  Publication of the guidelines, which were widely called for in the planning and development sector, followed a period of public consultation and consideration of over 100 submissions and a thorough assessment by my Department, details of which are available on my Department's website at www.housing.gov.ie/node/8956/public-consultation-responses. </p>  <p>  Under Section 30 of the 2000 Act, I am specifically precluded from exercising power or control in relation to any particular case with which a planning authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la is or may be concerned.  Objections in relation to particular planning applications are a matter for the relevant local authority or An Bord Pleanala in the event of an appeal. </p>  <p>  More generally, however, it is important to note that the guidelines specifically address their application in the context of areas covered by Strategic Development Zone (SDZ) Planning Schemes, in particular, through the insertion of Specific Planning Policy Requirement (SPPR) 3(B &amp;amp; C).  This SPPR requires adopted SDZ planning schemes to be reviewed by their respective development agencies to ensure that Government policy on building heights is appropriately articulated within such planning schemes.  Any alteration of approved planning schemes will require the undertaking of a review process that is provided for in law.</p>  <p>  The intention of the above policy requirement is to ensure that, on the one hand, planning authorities give practical effect to Government policy on building height in planning scheme areas, while at the same time allowing for effective public engagement in any significant policy shift in relation to heights to comply with Government policy and in view of the absence of third party appeal rights in relation to planning applications in SDZs. For this reason, it is not the intention that SPPR 3 would allow an immediate &lsquo;over-ride&rsquo; facility for the alteration of approved planning schemes without the undertaking of a review process that is provided for in law.  Rather, the implementation of SPPR 3, and its components at A, B and C, as an integrated package, is focused on securing strategic planning outcomes, while at the same time providing for proper public consultation.</p>  <p>  In determining planning policy and making planning decisions around appropriate building heights, the planning process has to strike a careful balance between enabling long-term and strategic development of relevant areas, while ensuring the highest standards of urban design, architectural quality and place-making outcomes. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that these guidelines are necessary and appropriate to give clear context and direction to the overall requirement to promote increased density and building height in appropriate locations within our urban centres.</p></reply>

Section 22 of the Act requires each local authority to make an allocation scheme determining the order of priority to be accorded in the allocation of dwellings to households qualified for social housing support and to households approved for a transfer, the allocation of which would, in the opinion of the authority, meet the accommodation needs and requirements of the households.  The making of such a scheme is a reserved function of a local authority.</p></reply>

The low rate of fixed interest associated with the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan provides first-time buyers with access to mortgage finance that they may not otherwise have been able to afford at a higher interest rate.</p>  <p>  To support prudential lending and consistency of treatment for borrowers, a Loan to Value ratio of 90% applies to the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan as per the Central Bank's prudential lending guidelines. Therefore, in order to avail of the loan, applicants must have a deposit equivalent to 10% of the market value of the property.</p>  <p>  Applicants must provide bank or similar statements (such as post office, credit union, etc.) for a 12-month period immediately prior to making an application, clearly showing a credible and consistent track record of savings. The cash savings should be no less than 3% of the market value of the property. Gifts are permissible up to 7% of the market value of the property, where their source is verified.</p>  <p>  Exceptions to the above can be made where an applicant/applicants can clearly demonstrate a consistent and credible record of savings or rent payment through their bank account which at a minimum is equal to:</p>  <p>  -  In the case of a fixed rate loan, the proposed monthly loan repayment or</p>  <p>  -  In the case of a variable rate loan, the proposed stress tested monthly loan repayment.</p>  <p>  Given the need to administer the loan in a financially prudent manner, in order to protect the financial position of both the borrower and local authorities, I have no plans to reduce these deposit requirements.</p></reply>

Section 22 of the 2009 Act requires all local authorities, as a reserved function, to make an allocation scheme determining the order of priority to be accorded in the allocation of dwellings to households qualified for social housing support and to households approved for a transfer, the allocation of which would, in the opinion of the authority, meet the accommodation needs and requirements of the households.</p>  <p>  However, my Department does collect annual statistics on the number of households on social housing waiting lists. Details on the number of households qualified for social housing support in each local authority area are provided in the statutory Summary of Social Housing Assessments (SSHA), which has been carried out on an annual basis since 2016. The summary is a count, on a specific date, of all households qualified for social housing support on local authority waiting lists whose housing need has not been met.</p>  <p>  The 2018 assessment shows that 71,858 households were assessed as qualified and being in need of social housing support. This represents a decrease of 13,941 households or 16.2% on the last assessment in June 2017. Indeed, since the Government's Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan was launched in 2016, the numbers have decreased from 91,600 to 71,858, a reduction of 22%. </p></reply>

The Circular also advised that they should not amend the rural housing local needs policies in their development plans until the revised Guidelines have issued. </p>  <p>  The National Planning Framework (the NPF) also provides an important context for the finalisation of the revisions to the 2005 Rural Housing Guidelines. National Policy Objective 15 of the NPF fully supports the concept of the sustainable development of rural areas by encouraging growth and arresting decline in areas that have experienced low population growth or decline in recent decades, while simultaneously indicating the need to manage certain areas around cities and towns that are under strong urban influence and under pressure from uncoordinated and ribbon-type development, in order to avoid over-development of those areas.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, National Policy Objective 37 of the NPF requires each local authority to carry out a Housing Need Demand Assessment (HNDA) in order to correlate and accurately align overall future housing requirements, as an evolution of their existing Housing Strategy requirements under Part V of the 2000 Act. This will assist local authorities in ensuring long-term strategic housing needs are met across all types, tenures and locations across their functional areas, both urban and rural. Accordingly, the NPF objectives are aligned with the approach already expected of planning authorities under the current 2005 Guidelines.  My Department intends to provide further guidance to local authorities later this year, to support their HNDA work as part of the review of their Development Plans. </p>  <p>  Taking account of the engagement with the European Commission regarding revisions to the 2005 Rural Housing Guidelines and subject to the completion of the ongoing deliberations by the working group, I will be in a position to finalise and issue to planning authorities revisions to the Guidelines that take account of the relevant European Court of Justice judgment.</p></reply>

Applications must be advanced in close cooperation with the relevant local authorities which are expected to take the lead with respect to potential World Heritage nominations in their administrative areas. This ensures the longterm involvement of a statutory body in preparing a site for inclusion on the Tentative List. Officials of my Department are also available to assist and advise interested parties.</p>  <p>  The process of readying a site for eventual UNESCO World Heritage nomination encompasses the involvement of the community at large and a wide range of stakeholders. Of critical importance when deciding whether a site should be included on the Tentative List is whether it is capable of demonstrating Outstanding Universal Value. This means that the site must possess cultural and/or natural significance which is so exceptional as to transcend national boundaries and to be of global importance for present and future generations. As such, the permanent protection of this heritage is of the highest importance to the international community as a whole. This characteristic would be rigorously assessed by an expert committee for any site under consideration for the Tentative List.</p>  <p>  Twenty-two candidate sites were put forward for inclusion on the 2010 Tentative List with the majority coming from public bodies. In addition to the newly-nominated sites that were included in the 2010 List, certain other sites had their position on the previous Tentative List renewed. Others were not considered at that time to have demonstrated that they would meet the various criteria set by the World Heritage Committee. I will provide the Deputy with details of the 22 sites separately. </p>  <p>  My Department is currently in the process of managing the ten-year review of Ireland&rsquo;s Tentative List. In this respect, the local authorities associated with each site on the current Tentative List have been invited to review the readiness of their communities and sites to proceed to World Heritage nomination. My Department is tasked with deciding whether or not sites are likely to meet the criteria for World Heritage nomination. It will do so at the end of the review period in June 2020, and with the benefit of additional information provided by the relevant local authorities in the meantime. </p></reply>

The Review concluded that Ireland could more effectively achieve conservation of threatened raised bog habitat through focused protection and restoration of a reconfigured network.  This reconfigured network entails:</p>  <p> 1. The cessation of turf-cutting on 36 existing natural heritage areas, which will remain designated - this includes 7 sites to be divided, with part to be conserved and part de-designated;</p>  <p> 2. The complete de-designation of 46 natural heritage areas - including the relevant areas of the 7 sites to be divided - where it has been judged that their conservation potential is expected to be marginal and/or that restoration would be prohibitively expensive for the conservation benefits achieved.  These sites include the site referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s Question. Domestic turf-cutting may continue on these sites, while larger scale or commercial turf cutting will continue to be regulated through other consent systems; and</p>  <p> 3. The designation as natural heritage areas of 25 currently undesignated raised bogs, which are in public ownership or where there is reduced turf cutting pressure. These sites are to be proposed for designation to make up for the loss of habitat within the natural heritage area sites where turf cutting is to continue.</p>  <p>  The Wildlife (Amendment) Bill 2016, to give effect to the outcome of the 2014 Review, was presented to the D&aacute;il on 21 July 2016 and was passed by that House on 13 December 2018.</p>  <p>  The Bill, as passed by the D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, provides for me, as the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht to complete the 2014 Review of Raised Bog Natural Heritage Area Network and to conduct a review or reviews of blanket bog natural heritage areas, at his or her discretion. </p>  <p>  Section 4 of the Bill proposes to amend the Wildlife (Amendment) Act 2000 by the insertion of a new section 18A after section 18 of that Act. Within section 4 of the Bill, section 18A(6) states that where I as the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht make an order to amend or revoke a natural heritage area order which designated land as a natural heritage area, that I will place an advertisement in at least one local newspaper to inform the public of the making of the order and cause a copy of the order to be sent to (i) defined owners or occupiers of land (ii) defined holders of valid prospecting or exploration licences and (iii) various Ministers of the Government and various public authorities. </p>  <p>  The Wildlife (Amendment) Bill 2016 has completed Committee Stage in the Seanad &Eacute;ireann and is scheduled for Report Stage in that House.</p></reply>
