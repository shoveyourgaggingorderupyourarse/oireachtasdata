    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-06-19a.10.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019061900068#WRB00400"><p>It is a longstanding practice of the Minister for Finance not to comment in advance of the Budget on any tax matters that might be the subject of Budget decisions. Having said that, the Deputy will be aware that the Climate Action Plan 2019, published on Monday last, provided a commitment to assess a Carbon Tax trajectory of at least &euro;80 per tonne by 2030, having regard to considerations on the social and economic impacts.  </p><p>The carbon tax is currently set at &euro;20 per tonne of CO2 emitted.  As such, carbon commodities with a heavier carbon content have a higher carbon tax charge.  The carbon tax (VAT inclusive) for commonly used commodities is as follows:</p><p><table><tr><th>Petrol </th><th>5.64 cent per litre</th></tr><tr><td>Diesel</td><td>6.56 cent per litre</td></tr><tr><td>Coal</td><td>&euro;2.40 per 40 kilo bag</td></tr><tr><td>Peat</td><td>52 cents per 12.5 Kilo bale</td></tr><tr><td>Kerosene</td><td>5.76 cent per litre</td></tr></table></p><p>Carbon tax receipts in 2018 were &euro;431 million. Carbon tax receipts are remitted to the Exchequer.  Hypothecation is not a feature of the Irish tax system in general as it reduces the flexibility of the Government to prioritise and allocate funds as necessary at a particular time, constraining expenditure decisions and potentially distorting the allocation of resources, which can result in reduced value for money and sub-optimal outcomes.</p><p>Nevertheless, the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Climate Action recommended that hypothecation of carbon tax revenues be considered and to this end my Department launched a public consultation on the options for use of revenues raised from increases in the carbon tax. The options include use of revenue to address fuel poverty as well as a so called &ldquo;tax and dividend&rdquo; scheme. The consultation is open until the 28 June 2019 and can be accessed on the Department's website. The feedback from the consultation will help to inform future carbon tax policy options.  </p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, there are existing schemes in place which help those who may be in fuel poverty. These include the National Fuel Allowance and the provision of home insulation grants and free upgrades from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland. Consideration of all options relating to carbon tax policy, including possible ring-fencing of revenue for specific purposes is ongoing and will be reviewed by the Tax Strategy Group in July.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-06-19a.13.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019061900068#WRB00700"><p>As part of its Annual Report for 2018, NAMA recently revised its projected surplus to be returned to the State to &euro;4 billion. The realisation of this surplus depends on the success of NAMA&rsquo;s ongoing deleveraging and completion of its Dublin Docklands SDZ and residential funding programmes.</p>  <p>  Surplus funds may only be returned to the Central Fund once NAMA's debt has been redeemed in full, which is expected to be in 2020. Any NAMA surplus paid, while Exchequer positive, will not impact the general government balance, in line with Eurostat rules. It will be a decision for the Government as to how any surplus returned by NAMA will be utilised within the framework of the fiscal rules at that time. The intention has always been to use such receipts from the resolution of the financial sector crisis to pay down our national debt and reduce our debt servicing costs. </p>  <p>  As the expected date for NAMA&rsquo;s redemption of its debt approaches, there is a possibility that a small number of loans may not be resolved by 2021 due to ongoing litigation that is largely outside NAMA&rsquo;s control. In addition, there is a possibility that NAMA may also be left with a small residual loan portfolio where best value for the State may not be achieved through sale or disposal before the end of 2021. Such assets are currently expected to represent less than 1% of NAMA&rsquo;s original portfolio.</p>  <p>  Active consideration is underway regarding NAMA&rsquo;s end of life strategy and the maximisation of the return of any surplus to the State in respect of these remaining assets. These considerations will be examined in my forthcoming Section 227 Review into NAMA&rsquo;s achievement of its objectives which is due to be finalised shortly. I intend to use the publication of this review to make a decision as to how to best wind down NAMA in the context of the need to ensure that the State extracts maximum value from any residual assets remaining after 2020/2021.</p></reply>

Whilst at both political and departmental level there has been considerable engagement with the different business stakeholders including for instance play centres, representatives, the  owners of childcare facilities have not been in touch directly with my Department nor the Cost of Insurance of Insurance Working Group for a meeting to discuss insurance problems that they may be encountering.  </p>  <p>  Unfortunately, there is no single policy or legislative &ldquo;silver bullet&rdquo; to immediately stem or reverse these trends, either in the case of individual types of businesses such as childcare operators or businesses that run outdoor activities, or for businesses generally.  This is because there are many constraints faced by the Government in trying to address this issue in particular the fact that for constitutional reasons, it cannot direct the courts as to the award levels that should be applied and for legal reasons it cannot direct insurance companies as to the as to the price or the level of cover to be provided to consumers or businesses as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on the risks they are willing to accept.  </p>  <p>  I consider it therefore important that the Cost of Insurance Working Group (CIWG) continues to implement the 33 recommendations from the 2017 Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance and the 15 recommendations from the 2018 Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance. This is necessary in order to ensure that the necessary reforms, in particular with regard to bringing the levels of damages awarded in this country more in line with those awarded in other jurisdictions, through the development of new Personal Injury Judicial Guidelines following the enactment of the Judicial Council Bill.  I am hopeful that the cumulative effects of the completion of the two Reports&rsquo; recommendations will include increased stability in the pricing of insurance for businesses and a more competitive insurance market.</p>  <p>  Finally, I believe that the CIWG&rsquo;s reforms are already having a significant impact with regard to private motor insurance (CSO figures from May 2019 show that the price of motor insurance is now 24.5% lower than the July 2016 peak).  The Government is determined to continue working to ensure that these positive pricing trends can be extended to other forms of insurance, including those relevant to businesses.  </p></reply>

    <ques id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-06-19a.20.q" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019061900068#WRB01700"><p><i>36.</i> To ask the Minister for Finance if the code of conduct on mortgage arrears of the Central Bank will be placed on a legislative basis in order that it can be admitted in court proceedings; and if he will make a statement on the matter. <b>[25523/19]</b></p></ques>
    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-06-19a.21.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019061900068#WRB01800"><p>As I have mentioned on many occasions, the Central Bank Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (the CCMA) is a statutory code issued under Section 117 of the Central Bank Act 1989. It clearly states in the CCMA that its provisions are legally binding on regulated entities, and the Central Bank has the power to administer sanctions on regulated entities for a contravention of the CCMA under Part IIIC of the Central Bank Act 1942.</p><p>In the judgment of the Supreme Court in May 2015 in Irish Life and Permanent plc v Dunne, the Court held that a breach of the moratorium provision in the CCMA would be fatal to a lender&rsquo;s legal entitlement to possession because allowing an application for possession where there was a breach of the moratorium provision of the CCMA would, in effect, be tantamount to a court acting in aid of the actions of a lender which were unlawful. However, with respect to the other provisions of the CCMA, the judge held that there was nothing in section 117 of the Central Bank Act 1989 or the CCMA itself suggesting that the courts are required to assess in detail the compliance or otherwise by a regulated entity. </p><p>In relation to matters that can be taken into account during court proceedings, the Department of Justice &amp;amp; Equality's <b>Land and Conveyancing Law Reform (Amendment) Bill 2019 </b>addresses this issue.  The Bill&rsquo;s key objective is to provide further protections for homeowners in mortgage arrears who are facing the risk of repossession proceedings in respect of their homes.  It extends the scope of the Land and Conveyancing Act 2013 to cases where an insolvency solution to a borrower&rsquo;s mortgage arrears is not, for whatever reason, available. </p><p>The Bill is scheduled for Committee Stage this week. </p><p>The measures provided for in the Bill will prove to be an important addition to the suite of Government measures to protect those in mortgage arrears who are facing the prospect of court proceedings for repossessions of their homes.  It is also important to acknowledge that the Bill received widespread support last month, when Second Stage was taken.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-06-19a.25.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019061900068#WRB02200"><p>The Deputy will be aware that the reduction in the level of non-performing loans, or NPLs, across European banks is a major priority for the banking regulator, the SSM. The Irish banks have made huge progress in this regard since the height of the crisis. According to the Central Bank of Ireland, the average NPL ratio of the domestic Irish banks was 8.5 % in December 2018, falling from 13.8% a year earlier and from greater than 30% at peak in 2013. In volume terms, NPLs in the domestic Irish banks have now fallen by &euro;67.3 billion, or 88%, from peak in 2013. A major contributor to this has been the almost 127,000 mortgage restructures that are currently in place. </p>  <p>  Despite this progress, the NPL ratios at the Irish banks remain at an elevated level and are above the European average of under 4% and further work is required by the banks to address this. </p>  <p>  It is important to reiterate that the protections in place for all borrowers before a sale remain unchanged. For example, Start Mortgages and Pepper, the firms who were involved in the Glas and Glenbeigh loan sales transacted by PTSB in 2018, are both regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland. When dealing with borrowers, these firms are required to comply with the Consumer Protection Code and the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears. Furthermore, assurances have been given that the terms of a restructure agreed before these sales took place will continue to be honoured.</p>  <p>  In addition, in 2018 I asked the Central Bank to carry out a review of the CCMA to ensure it remains as effective as possible. The result of this review was published last October and it is encouraging to note that the key findings included confirmation that for borrowers who engaged with the process, the CCMA is working effectively as it is intended in the context of the sale of loans by regulated lenders.</p>  <p>  Finally, I wish to highlight that I cannot stop loan sales, even by the banks in which the State has a shareholding. These decisions are the responsibility of the Board and management of the banks which must be run on an independent and commercial basis. The banks&rsquo; independence is protected by Relationship Frameworks, which are legally binding documents that I cannot change unilaterally.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-06-19a.28.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019061900068#WRB02500"><p>Given that the UK represents one of the largest net contributors to the EU budget, Brexit is likely to have a significant impact on the contributions of all Member States, including Ireland&rsquo;s. The exact impact will dependent on the nature of the final agreement between the EU and the UK regarding its involvement with the EU budget post-Brexit. </p>  <p>  Under the Withdrawal Agreement between the EU and UK, the UK had agreed to continue to pay into the EU budget for the remaining years of the current MFF, as if it was still a member. This would result in no additional impact on Ireland&rsquo;s contributions or receipts up to the end of the current Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) in December 2020.</p>  <p>  However, if that Withdrawal Agreement is not concluded and there is a no-deal Brexit, the impacts on the EU budget will need to be clarified. Under this scenario the UK would need to clarify its intentions regarding whether it still intended to continue making payments towards the current MFF. </p>  <p>  The European Commission has proposed a number of legislative proposals to prepare for the UK's withdrawal. The EU-level measures are summarised in the European Commission&rsquo;s fourth Brexit Preparedness Communication of 10 April 2019 and includes a measure for the 2019 EU budget, which establishes a legal basis for the UK to continue to both make payments into the EU budget and to access receipts from it for the year 2019. This framework seeks to minimise any unnecessary disruption for beneficiaries of EU spending programmes at the time of withdrawal. </p>  <p>  If the UK decided not to continue with EU budget payments, then both the Commission and Member States would need to consider the most appropriate way forward. However, the gap would need to be mitigated by either increased contributions from other Member States, reductions in EU funding programmes, or a combination of both. </p>  <p>  My Department monitors and analyses the potential impact of Brexit on our EU budget contributions on an ongoing basis. This analysis is based on the best information and data available at the time in question. As a result, for Budget 2020, my Department will be updating its forecasts in the run up to Budget day.</p>  <p>  It should be noted, that the Commission&rsquo;s proposal for the next MFF 2021-2027 (published, May 2018) is based on the UK no longer contributing to the EU budget, and as such, incorporates the impact of Brexit.</p>  <p>   As you can appreciate, I don't want to engage in speculation, given the sensitivity around Brexit.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-06-19a.31.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019061900068#WRB02800"><p>At the outset, I would like to put on record that I share the same concern as the Deputy in relation to the recent reporting of the large profits of insurers for 2017 at a time when many small businesses are struggling to get cover in the first place, or to get it at a reasonable price.  I consider the current position unacceptable and I have made this very clear to Insurance Ireland when I met them recently.  I believe they need to show a greater willingness to broaden their risk horizons and to begin to price their products in a way which recognises the general progress being made to address the cost of insurance problem.</p>  <p>  It is important to acknowledge however that this is a difficult issue to resolve for any Government because of the constraints it faces in particular the fact that for constitutional reasons, it cannot direct the courts as to the award levels that should be applied and for legal reasons it cannot direct insurance companies as to the pricing level which they should apply in respect of businesses seeking insurance.</p>  <p>  That said however through the work of the Cost of Insurance Working Group, significant progress has been made in beginning to transform the landscape within which insurers operate. This is reflected in the fact that with regard to private motor insurance (CSO figures from May 2019 show that the price of motor insurance is now 24.5% lower than the July 2016 peak) and I am determined to continue working to ensure that these positive pricing trends can be extended to other forms of insurance, including those relevant in this case.</p>  <p>  In relation to your specific query about considering the establishment of a State regulated insurance company, it is important to be aware that any such company would be required to comply with the same prudential rules as private companies, thereby meaning that the cost of that insurance would still have to reflect the risk involved. My concern therefore with such a proposal is that it would simply compound the existing &lsquo;cherry picking&rsquo; of risk within the market by insurers. This in turn could ultimately decrease competition in the  market over the longer term, as some insurers may stop insuring particular risks completely if there is a view that a State company is willing to insure these risks instead, particularly those lines of business that are considered to be unprofitable. </p>  <p>  In addition, there is no reason to believe that the State would be any better at managing this risk than private insurance companies, and as a result there potentially could be a large financial exposure to the State if significant losses were incurred.</p>  <p>  In view of these issues, I am not convinced that State intervention of the type proposed would be a solution to the current problem regarding the cost or availability of insurance.  Instead, I think that we need to continue to implement the recommendations of both reports of the Cost of Insurance Working Group (CIWG).</p></reply>

The Central Bank does not make the decision on what is impacted or not, this is the responsibility of the lender. However, the Central Bank reviews and challenges the lender, where appropriate, on its conclusion. </p>  <p>  Where affected customers have complained to their lender and remain dissatisfied with the outcome of the complaint, and do not accept the findings of the Appeals Panel, they also retain the option to bring a complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman  or FSPO. The FSPO presents customers with a means of resolving their complaint in an independent, fair and transparent manner that takes account of their unique personal circumstances, through an informal dispute resolution process or formal investigation. </p>  <p>  As noted in the Central Bank Tracker Mortgage Examination Redress and Compensation penultimate Update, which was published in February 2019, the Examination has now been completed at the majority of lenders.  In the case of the remaining lenders, supervision work continues, as the Central Bank must ensure that the work carried out by lenders is sufficiently rigorous and thorough to have addressed satisfactorily any remaining issues affecting groups of customers and to ensure that all eligible groups of customers are included for redress and compensation. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Central Bank Governor noted in his opening statement when he appeared before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach on 26 March this year that a total of &euro;665 million has so far been provided to impacted customers. This figure includes &euro;47 million for redress and compensation to impacted customers identified outside of the industry wide examination.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank&rsquo;s priority at all times throughout the Examination has been to make sure that all affected groups of customers have been identified and remediated.  The Government supports the work carried out by the Central Bank and I have been advised by the Bank that a final update on the Tracker Mortgage Examination will be published in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

The banks&rsquo; independence is protected by Relationship Frameworks which are legally binding documents that cannot be changed unilaterally. These frameworks, which are publicly available, were insisted upon by the European Commission to protect competition in the Irish market. </p>  <p>  However this Government has firmly supported the work of the Central Bank of Ireland to ensure that customers receive fair treatment from the financial institutions involved. As the Deputy will be aware, the industry wide Tracker Mortgage Examination review is the largest, complex and most significant supervisory review in the history of the Central Bank of Ireland in respect to its consumer protection mandate. It has revealed the unacceptable damage that misconduct can cause to consumers up to and including the loss of their homes and properties in some cases. To this end there has been &euro;665 million of redress and compensation issued to customers at end February 2019.</p>  <p>  To further support the work and power of the regulator, I am bringing forward the Central Bank (amendment) Bill which will introduce an advanced Senior Executive Accountability Regime (SEAR) which will, in tandem with new enhancements to the fitness and probity regime, help prevent something like the mortgage tracker issue happening again. </p>  <p>  The Central Bank has intervened on prevailing rate issues in line with its regulatory engagement via the Examination. This intervention is aligned with the Central Bank&rsquo;s functions as part of the Examination to rigorously test and challenge, from a systemic perspective at the macro level, the position adopted by lenders to try and achieve the best result for all customers within a group. </p>  <p>  The AIB prevailing rate customers have, directly as a result of the Central Bank&rsquo;s intervention, been admitted to the Examination and will receive a compensation payment as well as an offer of the current prevailing rate, as opposed to the prevailing rate at the time their fixed rate expired.  By securing their admission to the Examination, the Central Bank has ensured that those customers have the opportunity to utilise to the full extent, the Examination&rsquo;s appeals processes. Should they be dissatisfied with any aspect of their redress and compensation offer and can pursue their case based on their own unique circumstances with the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman. </p>  <p>  The Central Bank examined AIB&rsquo;s model to determine the then prevailing rate and concluded that based on the information then available, that it was reasonable. In relation to the contractual interpretation of the term &ldquo;prevailing rate&rdquo; the Central Bank formed the view at the time that at a macro level, it could not mount a legal challenge on behalf of all customers in the relevant group, that a rate other than the then prevailing rate should be offered.</p></reply>

Extensive restrictions are in place and these are not simply confined to a handful of senior bankers whose pay is restricted by the &euro;500,000 pay cap (excluding a standard pension contribution). These affect c.23,000 workers across the three banks in which the State has a shareholding. The policy dictates that variable pay including bonuses and any other fringe benefits including the likes of health insurance and childcare cannot be paid to any staff members from the most junior lowest paid staff to the most senior ranks.</p>  <p>  A new regulatory framework has been put in place since the financial crisis across the EU, the economy has returned to near full employment, the remaining banks are profitable again &ndash; and in the case of AIB and BOI sustainably so. The State remains the largest shareholder in AIB, BOI and PTSB but following the successful IPO of AIB in June 2017 all three banks are also now on an equal footing with listings on the main market of the Irish and London stock exchanges.  </p>  <p>  The skill set required in the banking sector is evolving with the greatest demand for staff now in areas such as the digital economy, risk management, legal and compliance. These skills are in demand right across the economy and so the banks are competing for this talent against companies who have more flexible and attractive remuneration structures. Brexit has only made this problem more acute.</p>  <p>  In the senior ranks of the banks the substantial disparity in pay levels versus other Irish listed companies or peer banks in Europe is stark and introduces an obvious retention risk particularly in AIB and Bank of Ireland. I also need to be advised if this retention risk and a lack of alignment between the interests of executives and shareholders, undermines the Government's objective of recovering the State&rsquo;s full investment in the banks.  </p>  <p>  As a result I undertook last year to carry out a review of Government bank remuneration policy to determine if it remains fit for purpose.  My department held a full open EU public procurement to select a suitably qualified external consultant to assist it in completing this review. The specialist advisory division of International Firm Korn Ferry was subsequently appointed.</p>  <p>  Engagement with a broad set of relevant stakeholders was an important part of the process. Stakeholders engaged with by Korn Ferry and my department included the major institutional investors in the banks, proxy advisory firms, the Financial Services Union (FSU), the chairs of the remuneration committee in each of the banks and representatives of the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) in Frankfurt.</p>  <p>  I felt it was also important to get the views of the Central Bank on this matter. I note the response from the Governor of the Central Bank in this regard which is available on the Central Bank's website. I have now received the report and once I have considered it, my intention is to publish it in due course.</p></reply>

These risks are being managed by building-up our fiscal capacity through broadening our tax base, debt reduction, targeting improvement in the general government balance, and establishing the Rainy Day Fund. </p>  <p>  The tax base has been broadened by a series of measures, most recently by extending the standard rate of VAT to the tourism sector. These policies will help improve the resilience of the public finances to shocks to various sectors of the economy.</p>  <p>  Separately, our debt as a percentage of GDP has almost halved from a peak of around 120 per cent in 2012 and continues on a downward trajectory. However, our debt burden remains elevated when measured as a share of modified GNI. Accordingly, this Government has committed to further utilising resources realised from the resolution of the financial crisis towards reducing this burden.</p>  <p>  A small Exchequer cash surplus was achieved last year, the first underlying surplus since 2006. A general government balance of 0.0 per cent of GDP was also achieved in 2018. A surplus of 0.2 per cent is targeted for this year, improving to 0.4 per cent in 2020 under current assumptions.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Rainy Day Fund will be established this year with an initial capitalisation of &euro;1.5 billion from the Irish Strategic Investment Fund. Some of the historically high levels of corporation tax will be set aside for this fund, with an annual contribution of &euro;0.5 billion budgeted. From the perspective of the sustainability of the public finances, this means the risk of permanently increasing expenditure on the basis of transient receipts is reduced. </p>  <p>  The potential impact of an external shock is being mitigated by focusing on competitiveness-oriented policies. Capital expenditure has been prioritised to address the bottlenecks to growth which emerged during the recovery, such as the need for more residential development and public infrastructure investment. Total capital expenditure is set to more than double from &euro;4.2 to &euro;8.6 billion between 2016 and 2021. Such sustained levels of investment will increase our capital stock, improve the long-term growth potential in the economy and help build resilience to external shocks.</p>  <p>  The Summer Economic Statement, to be published later this month, will set out the Government&rsquo;s overall economic and budgetary strategy and establish the parameters for the forthcoming Budget, particularly in the context of the increase probability being assigned to a disorderly Brexit.</p></reply>

Consequently, following the publication of its Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance in 2017, the Cost of Insurance Working Group undertook an examination of the employer liability and public liability insurance sectors.  This second phase culminated in the publication in January 2018 of the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance.  I believe there has been significant progress already in the implementation of the two reports, including the following:    </p>  <p>  - the establishment of the Personal Injuries Commission, and its subsequent recommendations relating to addressing award levels for soft tissue injuries &ndash; this has provided the objective evidence we need to be able to address award levels;</p>  <p>  - the establishment of the National Claims Information Database in the Central Bank to increase transparency around the future cost of private motor insurance; the Central Bank is currently reviewing the possibility of expanding is scope to cover business insurance;</p>  <p>  - reforms to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board through the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (Amendment) Act 2019;</p>  <p>  - amendments to Sections 8 and 14 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 to make it easier for businesses and insurers to challenge cases where fraud or exaggeration is suspected;</p>  <p>  - the reform of the Insurance Compensation Fund to provide certainty to policyholders and insurers; and,</p>  <p>  - various reforms of how fraud is reported to and dealt with by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including increased co-ordination with the insurance industry, as well as the launch recently of Operation Coatee, a co-ordinated operation to tackle insurance fraud.   </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that both Reports contained Action Plans with timeframes for the implementation of Actions associated with the Recommendations.   I would note that this timeframe expired at the end of 2018 with regard to the Motor Report and is due to expire at the end of 2019 with regard to the Employer and Public Liability Report.  I would like to assure the Deputy that the Cost of Insurance Working Group will continue to focus on implementing the outstanding recommendations in both reports and it is hoped that this can be achieved by the end of this year. </p>  <p>  In this regard, I consider that bringing the levels of damages awarded in this country more in line with those awarded in other jurisdictions is undoubtedly the single most essential challenge which must be overcome if there is to be a sustainable reduction in insurance costs. Work is progressing as a matter of priority on the Judicial Council Bill, and it is due to complete Report and Final Stages in the Seanad this week, prior to being submitted to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann shortly thereafter.  I would hope that we can collectively work together to ensure that the Judicial Council Bill is enacted by the summer. </p>  <p>  Alongside this, the Law Reform Commission commenced its work to undertake a detailed analysis of the possibility of developing constitutionally sound legislation to delimit or cap the amounts of damages which a court may award in respect of some or all categories of personal injuries, as part of its Fifth Programme of Law Reform.  As everybody in this House will be aware, this is a complex task and appropriate consideration has to be given to the constitutional implications of such an exercise. </p>  <p>  In conclusion, I believe that the reforms implemented to date are having a significant impact with regard to private motor insurance (CSO figures from May 2019 show that the price of motor insurance is now 24.5% lower than the July 2016 peak).  The Government is determined to continue working to ensure that these positive pricing trends can be extended to other forms of insurance, including those relevant to businesses.</p></reply>

That is a net increase of 5,000 above the target employment level set for the previous strategy, IFS2020. The targeted increase in employment set out in IFS2020 was 10,000.</p>  <p>  The target of an increase of 5,000 people in employment in international financial services reflects two key factors.</p>  <p>  First, Ireland is at a different position in the economic cycle and, with the country close to full employment, setting jobs targets is somewhat contradictory. </p>  <p>  Second, and more importantly, the impacts of technology on the employment in the financial services sector are also potentially transformative and this will put existing employment figures under considerable pressure. The Expert Group on Future Skills Needs reported that financial services is one of two sectors in the Irish economy which is not expected to employ more people in 2023 than in it did 2018.</p>  <p>  While Ireland for Finance has an overall target for employment growth, it is also important that the strategy sets the aim of seeking to ensure that the posts located in Ireland will be high quality, well paid, and &lsquo;sticky&rsquo; &ndash; that is, less likely to be outsourced or easily transferable. Higher value posts are also less likely to be affected by increased levels of automation in the sector.</p>  <p>  A number of additional indicators of success have been selected to run concurrently with the jobs target. These include: trends in employment in international financial services; regional growth; new and specialised sub-sectors; high-level posts that will reflect a move up the value chain; the breadth of skills and sub-sectors; and the depth of specialised financial services available in Ireland.</p></reply>

Revenue has advised that this position is unchanged.  </p>  <p>  The flat rate expenses regime is a concessionary practice operated by Revenue where both specific commonality of expenditure exists across an employment category and the statutory requirement for the tax deduction as set out in section 114 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 is satisfied. To qualify for a deduction under that section, an expense must be &ldquo;wholly, exclusively and necessarily&rdquo; incurred in the performance of the duties of the employment and paid by the employee.  The purpose of the flat rate expenses regime is to simplify tax administration for both taxpayers and Revenue by making it easier for large groups of employees working in the same sector to avail of their entitlement to tax relief in respect of allowable expenses incurred in the performance of their employment duties. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware from my previous replies to questions on this matter that I am aware of Revenue&rsquo;s programme of work in this area.  Furthermore, the Deputy will be aware that the administration of the tax code is exclusively a matter for Revenue who are independent in the performance of their functions.  Any changes in practice to the flat rate expenses regime are therefore a matter for Revenue, but I understand that any withdrawal of the practice can only take place if Revenue are satisfied that there is no longer a legally valid basis to give the concession, after engagement with the relevant representative body acting on behalf of the various categories of workers.</p>  <p>  As I have said on previous occasions, there has been no change to the general rule set out in legislation so all employees retain their statutory right to claim a deduction under section 114 TCA for any valid expenses incurred wholly, exclusively and necessarily in the performance of the duties of their employment, to the extent which the expenses are not reimbursed from any source.  So while certain employees may no longer claim a deduction on a universal &ldquo;flat rate&rdquo; basis, they may still be able to still claim a deduction on a specific &ldquo;vouched basis&rdquo;.</p></reply>

This is why the Government is committed to increasing the supply of all types of housing including social, affordable and private. Institutional investors represent one aspect of the housing market and have a role in increasing supply, particularly the supply of urban apartments.</p>  <p>  The Deputy  should be aware that a Department of Finance staff paper on institutional investment in the housing market, published in February 2019, found that property funds, real estate firms and REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) account for a relatively small proportion of housing transactions. In 2017, the latest year for which official data is available, such firms purchased a net 1 per cent of transacted units. However, it is clear the number of transactions from such investors is increasing.  </p>  <p>  The National Planning Framework (NPF) identified greater apartment construction as a policy objective. Approximately 12 per cent of the national housing stock is in apartments, in comparison to many European countries where it is normal for 40-60 per cent of households to live in apartments.  Given Ireland&rsquo;s population growth, a movement towards smaller average household size and greater mobility in the labour market, apartments will need to become a more prevalent form of housing, particularly in urban areas. Many institutional investors specialise in providing such accommodation.  However, as Rebuilding Ireland makes clear, professional landlord investment can only be one aspect of a multi-pronged response to addressing current issues in the market.</p>  <p>  Introducing regulation of the investment activity of institutional investors to limit or exclude them from housing, if it is possible to do, would be likely to have the major unintended consequence of reducing supply.</p></reply>

This work plan was endorsed by G20 Finance Ministers on 9 June and work will continue over the next 18 months with a view to reaching final agreement by end 2020.   </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the work plan remains on a "without prejudice" basis and that a lot of work remains to be done before we have a sustainable agreement.  </p>  <p>  I have been very clear that further change to the international tax framework is necessary to ensure that we reach a stable global consensus for how and where companies should be taxed.  A certain, stable, and globally agreed international tax framework is vital to facilitate cross border trade and investment.</p>  <p>  When I look at the proposals currently being discussed at OECD I believe that proposals examining the issue of where companies generate their value and whether new concepts of value creation need to be recognised, might provide a basis upon which a sustainable agreement could be found at the OECD.</p>  <p>  However, proposals to introduce a minimum effective tax rate remains problematic, not least because of a lack of clarity as to what it is the proposal is trying to achieve.</p>  <p>  Ireland is supportive of measures to limit companies&rsquo; capacity to engage in aggressive tax planning. Artificial profit-shifting for tax purposes poses a real challenge and must continue to be addressed. However, I do not support measures which have as their core objective the end of legitimate and fair tax competition.</p>  <p>  The benefits of tax competition have long been recognised by the OECD and others, as long as this competition is fair.</p>  <p>  I believe that fair tax competition is a legitimate tool for small peripheral countries to balance against size, geographical location or resource advantages other countries enjoy, and this is supported by a wealth of economic research.</p>  <p>  Ireland is positively engaged in the discussions at OECD and remains open to solutions which respect our right to compete fairly and which respect the legitimacy of Ireland&rsquo;s longstanding 12.5% corporate tax rate.</p></reply>

A fiscal vulnerability exists in the form of an exposure of the public finances to fluctuations in corporation tax receipts, which last year were at their highest ever share of Exchequer revenues at 18.7 percent of overall tax receipts. By way of context VAT and Income Tax receipts accounted for approximately 64 percent of our overall tax receipts. </p>  <p>  In recent years, I have taken steps to broaden our corporation tax base, including through the introduction of the 80 per cent cap on capital allowances for intangible assets in Budget 2018 and the introduction of a broader Exit Tax regime in Budget 2019.  Measures have also been introduced in recent years which will ensure a continued broadening of the overall tax base. These include the introduction of the Universal Social Charge, the Local Property Tax and the sugar-sweetened drinks tax. Further measures that I have taken which will enhance the tax base include the increase in the VAT rate, for tourism related goods and services, from the 9 per cent rate to the 13.5 per cent rate in Budget 2019. For 2019 all of these measures are projected to raise revenues equivalent to approximately 1.5 percent of GDP or 5.7 percent of overall general government revenue. </p>  <p>  Further steps which I have taken include an increase in the commercial (non-residential) Stamp Duty rate from 2 per cent to 6 per cent in Budget 2018 and an increase in the betting duty levy from 1 per cent to 2 percent in Budget 2019. I have also removed some tax reliefs, such as the Home Renovation Incentive and the Start your own Business Relief, and continued a roll-out of enhanced taxation compliance measures. However, I would note that further potential for base broadening exists, particularly in the environmental area where important policy priorities exist.</p>  <p>  The ongoing systematic review of tax expenditures, taken in line with my Department&rsquo;s Tax Expenditure Guidelines, will assist in this process, through identifying deadweight, resource misallocation and assessing if tax reliefs still meet their initial policy objectives. This will also provide a &lsquo;health check&rsquo; as to whether they accord with the OECD tax hierarchy in terms of their impact upon economic growth.  </p>  <p>  My Department will shortly publish a paper to highlight some of these in-built vulnerabilities to our tax revenues and to quantify where possible, the impact of a shock to our corporation tax receipts. Potential solutions to this are presented in order to prompt a policy discussion around how best to mitigate against this emerging over-reliance. It is my intention to give consideration to these, and possibly other, suggestions with a view to making recommendations to Government in the autumn.</p></reply>

The extension includes giving the UK flexibility to leave before that date should the Withdrawal Agreement be ratified.  The European Council decision made clear that the Withdrawal Agreement, including the backstop, cannot be re-negotiated and that any unilateral commitments by the UK Government should be compatible with the letter and the spirit of the Withdrawal Agreement. We welcome these important assertions.  The European Council also agreed that should the UK&rsquo;s position on the EU-UK future relationship evolve, the EU is prepared to reconsider the political declaration on the future relationship.</p>  <p>  The Government remains focused on the ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement as the best way to ensure an orderly withdrawal of the UK from the EU and to fully protect the Good Friday Agreement. The decision of the European Council provides the UK with more time, until 31 October, to ensure an orderly withdrawal. However, the risk of a no deal Brexit remains. The preparations for all possible scenarios, that have been taking place since before the Brexit referendum, are therefore continuing. Brexit in all scenarios will have negative consequences and as a Government we are determined to be as ready as we can be. </p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s Contingency Action Plan, published on 19 December 2018, sets out comprehensive, cross-Government preparations that have been taking place over the last three years. This work continues at both a national and EU level. Last week, on 12th June, the Commission issued its fifth Contingency Communication which updates and reinforces the necessary no deal Brexit preparedness measures at EU level. </p>  <p>  The Government has been taking key decisions to advance the implementation of our Brexit preparations. The Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Act, was signed into law by the President on 17 March 2019. The Act complements legal measures at EU level and focuses on measures protecting our citizens and supporting the economy, enterprise and jobs, particularly in key economic sectors.  The Act is primarily intended for a no deal scenario, and most of the Act will not be commenced should the Withdrawal agreement be ratified. The legislation which I proposed in the areas of Taxation and Financial Services is an important part of the whole of Government response to Brexit, as it will ensure continuity of access for business and citizens in relation to certain taxation reliefs and allowances, as well as enabling insurance undertakings to continue to fulfil contractual obligations to their Irish customers, in a no deal scenario.  </p>  <p>  The Government has also taken important steps to prepare our economy, including through dedicated measures announced in Budgets 2017, 2018 and 2019, supported by long-term planning through the National Development Plan and the National Planning Framework which will provide significant investment in Ireland&rsquo;s public capital infrastructure. </p>  <p>  As Minister for Finance, my objective is to protect the economic and financial interests of the State and to support the work of the Revenue Commissioners so as to minimise the Brexit disruption to trade, to the greatest extent possible. My Department is working within the whole-of-Government approach and is coordinating closely with its agencies who are developing and implementing plans and measures to protect our economy. </p>  <p>  The Central Bank has statutory responsibility for financial stability and has been focused on Brexit since before the UK referendum. The Central Bank has been working closely with financial services firms to ensure that they have contingency plans in place for end March 2019, and they are now using the extended deadline to further prepare to cope with the possible effects of Brexit, with as little disruption for consumers as possible.  In relation to funding the State, the NTMA&rsquo;s strategy continues to take account of the market dislocation risks posed by Brexit. The Exchequer&rsquo;s funding position is strong. </p>  <p>  Within Revenue, there is a very significant program of work that has been ongoing in terms of ICT, staffing, and trader engagement. Additional physical capacity is in place at ports and airports to apply checks and controls, in a no deal scenario. This work will ensure that the Revenue Commissioners are prepared to facilitate the efficient movement of legitimate trade to the maximum extent possible in a no deal scenario.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that my Department and its relevant agencies are continuing to work to ensure that they are as prepared as possible to limit the inevitable disruption to consumers and trade, post Brexit.  </p>  <p>  As a Government we will continue to strongly encourage businesses and citizens to do the same. For instance, businesses that trade with the UK should apply now to the Revenue Commissioners for their customs number (EORI). The Government website gov.ie/Brexit is an important resource in this regard and contains information on a range of Brexit supports and advice, as well as an overview of the institutions offering financial assistance to businesses such as the SBCI, Microfinance Ireland, Intertrade Ireland and Enterprise Ireland.</p></reply>

This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance (Solvency II directive).</p>  <p>  The core strategy for addressing areas at risk from flooding is the OPW Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management ("CFRAM") Programme which focusses on 300 Areas for Further Assessment identified as being at potentially significant risk of flooding. The proposed feasible measures are outlined in Flood Risk Management Plans which sets out current flood relief schemes, including 118 proposed schemes that can protect a further 11,500 properties. </p>  <p>  The Government believes that its existing policy in relation to flooding, which is focused on the development of a sustainable, planned and risk-based approach, is the best way forward. This commitment is underpinned by the OPW and Local Authorities capital investment programme, and complemented by a Memorandum of Understanding between the OPW and Insurance Ireland which provides for the exchange of data in relation to completed flood defence schemes.  </p>  <p>  This arrangement has led to a greater availability of flood cover in previously higher risk areas. For instance, the Insurance Ireland survey in March 2019 of approximately 87% of the property insurance market in Ireland,  indicates that of the completed defence schemes, 95% of policies in areas benefitting from permanent flood defences include flood cover, while 74% of policies in areas benefitting from demountable defences include flood cover. In addition, it should be noted that an Insurance Ireland/OPW working group shares relevant data on completed flood defence schemes and a sub-group has been established to explore the technical arrangements that may allow for the further sharing of data.</p>  <p>  In relation to demountable defences my Department is continuing to examine how to increase the level of cover in areas with demountable defences. One of the outcomes of these discussions is that the insurance industry has now acknowledged that they accept that the demountable defences meet the desired &lsquo;1:100 year&rsquo; standard. However, while demountable defences are effective when correctly deployed they are dependent on human intervention which increases the risk of failure. This is a difficult and complex issue to resolve but every effort being made to get a more responsive approach from the insurance industry on this matter.</p></reply>

The objective of the proposal is to ensure that policyholders are informed as soon as possible after a claim against their policy is lodged and informed after a claim is settled. In addition, the proposal will seek to require insurers to engage with the policyholder to ensure that the policyholder&rsquo;s views can be taken into consideration.</p>  <p>  This proposal originates from Recommendation 8 of the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance. A corresponding recommendation was then included in the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance (Rec 10) as this issue is generally far more pertinent to businesses and other liability insurance policyholders rather than individual motorists. </p>  <p>  The Department engaged with Insurance Ireland to seek voluntary agreement of this proposal through a protocol. Unfortunately, no such agreement could be reached on a non-legislative basis.</p>  <p>  As a result, it is proposed to include this legislative proposal within the Consumer Insurance Contracts Bill 2017, a Private Members&rsquo; Bill introduced by Sinn F&eacute;in which is based on a 2015 Law Reform Commission Report.  The Government provided support in principle for the objectives of this Bill at Second Stage and noted the intention of the Minister for Finance to submit substantive amendments should the Bill reach Committee Stage.  </p>  <p>   On 27 May 2019 Government approval was given to enable the drafting of committee stage amendments. As part of this approval process the Office of the Attorney General expressed the view that they wish to obtain specialist independent legal advice on this Bill to avoid any unforeseen consequences.</p>  <p>  I understand that the Clerk of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and Taoiseach has written to my Department to signal that the Committee has decided to consider the Bill at Committee Stage the week beginning 8th July.  The Office of the Attorney General is currently working on the Government's Committee Stage amendments.  However as this is a Private Members&rsquo; Bill, the timing of the legislative steps are not within the control of the Government.</p></reply>

However, there is scope for a possible broadening of the concept of value creation that recognises that some value may arise from scale, from brands or from access to markets.</p>  <p>  Any change should be moderate and based, to the greatest extent possible, on existing transfer pricing rules which are deeply embedded in the international tax framework. The bulk of profits must remain taxable in exporting countries under the existing corporate tax framework. This can help to ensure that such countries are not disproportionately impacted. Any proposal which would disproportionately benefit large countries at the expense of smaller ones is not sustainable. Proposals which are focused on providing certainty into the medium term for governments and for business are much more likely to be acceptable to the international community.</p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to engage positively in the discussions at OECD and remains open to solutions which respect our right to compete fairly and which respect the legitimacy of Ireland&rsquo;s longstanding 12.5% corporate tax rate.</p></reply>

In very broad terms, Pillar One is examining where profits of multinationals are allocated and examining mechanisms for potentially amending existing approaches. Pillar Two is examining the concept of minimum effective taxation.</p>  <p>  The work on both Pillars is at a very early stage and the OECD work programme provides a framework for detailed work to begin in the OECD's technical working parties.  The discussions on both Pillars are not yet formulated as draft proposals which can be fully analysed by countries at this stage. </p>  <p>  The proposals on the table under Pillar One are, as yet, quite diverse and there is no clarity on what might ultimately be agreed. While clearly a change in how profits are taxed in different jurisdictions would result in a shift in profits being allocated from one location to another, upward and downward adjustments in revenue won&rsquo;t become clear until technical work advances.</p>  <p>  As regards Pillar Two, the work programme will detail some of the potential mechanics of how a minimum taxation proposal may operate but there is not sufficient detail at this stage to estimate the impact of any eventual proposal on corporation tax receipts.</p>  <p>  In the circumstances, it is not possible to calculate the impact on corporation tax receipts of implementing the proposals as they are currently drafted. Officials in my Department and Revenue will be actively engaged in the work at OECD, including the estimation of the impact of the options as they emerge in more detail.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that on 23 May, I delivered a speech on this important topic at the Harvard Kennedy School and Irish Tax Institute Global Tax Policy Conference where I signalled that change is coming in the international tax rules as a result of the work now underway at the OECD to find a globally agreed solution to the challenges in relation to the taxation of an increasingly digitalised international economy.</p>  <p>  In that speech, I outlined my belief that it might be possible to find a globally acceptable agreement within the broad Pillar One proposals that provides certainty. I also set out the principles that would need to be observed in order for the OECD process to result in an agreed outcome. Those principles include aligning taxing rights with value creation, respecting the long established international corporate tax framework as well as the primary taxing rights of exporting countries and not disproportionately benefitting large countries at the expense of smaller ones.</p>  <p>  As I have outlined, a minimum effective tax proposal had not, until recently, been part of the discussions at the OECD on addressing the tax challenges of digitalisation and I remain to be convinced of the validity and appropriateness of this aspect of the work.</p>  <p>  Nevertheless, Ireland is positively engaged in the discussions at the OECD and I remain open to solutions which respect our right to compete fairly and which respect the legitimacy of Ireland&rsquo;s longstanding 12.5% corporate tax rate.  In all of these discussions my key priority will be to ensure that as this important work advances, Ireland&rsquo;s interests are central to the process of forming that globally agreed consensus.</p>  <p>  Within those parameters, if the outcome of this work can, in these changing times, provide tax certainty for governments and for business, it will be very worthwhile.</p></reply>

In 2018, the General Government balance returned to a surplus for the first time in over a decade &ndash; a significant achievement. This followed a number of years of primary budget surpluses. Furthermore, the European Commission have stated that Ireland continues to be compliant with the fiscal rules. For this year and 2020, further surpluses of 0.2 and 0.4 per cent (of GDP) are anticipated. </p><p>However, while very substantial progress has been made in recent years, we cannot become complacent. The headline debt ratio continues to improve but it remains flattered by developments in nominal GDP. Partly for these reasons, my officials will shortly publish two related pieces of work on fiscal vulnerabilities and public debt. These reports confirm that more needs to be done to bring the debt burden down to lower levels.</p><p>It is imperative that we continue to implement prudent budgetary policy in &lsquo;good times&rsquo; so that policy can deliver counter-cyclical support in the event of a downturn. Such policies are also warranted by the unusually elevated set of international risks facing the Irish economy at present, particularly relating to Brexit. The external environment has also weakened in recent months with a less benign economic outlook. </p><p>Taking recent fiscal and macroeconomic data together, the overall performance of the economy remains robust, best encapsulated by exceptional labour market data. The unemployment rate is well below 5 per cent (down from 16 per cent in 2012) helped by strong and broad based employment gains, which are transforming income and living standards in Ireland. Significant progress has also been made in recent years in improving Ireland's competitiveness. The 2019 IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook ranked Ireland as the 2<sup>nd</sup>most competitive country in the EU and the 7<sup>th</sup>most competitive in the world.</p></reply>

In addition, Revenue and the UK Revenue and Customs undertook a joint initiative to introduce a new marker for use in marked fuels, which came into operation from April 2015. Revenue have also conducted random National Sampling Programmes in the years 2016 to 2019, to assess the extent of fuel laundering. The industry view is that the actions taken have been successful in curtailing fuel fraud and the results of Revenue&rsquo;s sampling programmes support this view.  </p>  <p>  Revenue acts against all aspects of the illegal tobacco trade, and uses a combination of risk analysis, profiling and intelligence, and risk-based screening of cargo, vehicles, baggage and postal packages to intercept illicit products. Action after importation includes checks at retail outlets, markets and private and commercial premises. </p>  <p>  Revenue and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na collaborate closely in acting against fuel and tobacco crime, and also cooperate closely with their counterparts in Northern Ireland, in the framework of the North-South Joint Agency Task Force. This cooperation plays a key role in targeting the organised crime groups responsible for much of this criminality, who operate across jurisdictions. Recent successes include the detection of an illegal cigarette factory in Jenkinstown, Co. Louth, in March 2018, as well as the detection of a second cigarette factory in Knockbridge, Co. Louth, in March 2019.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that Revenue&rsquo;s work against fuel fraud and the illicit tobacco trade has achieved a considerable level of success. For my part, I will fully consider any additional proposals for legislative change that may be brought forward by Revenue which would enhance its capacity to deal effectively with fraud and criminality in these areas.</p></reply>

Where the main purpose of the fund is to invest in Irish property, this also falls into the regime regardless of the level of property held. Where an IREF makes an actual distribution or on the redemption of units in the IREF, non-resident investors will be subject to a withholding tax of 20%. Certain investors such as pension funds, life assurance companies, charities and credit unions are exempt from the withholding tax as this is the norm for such bodies across the tax acts.</p>  <p>  The Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) framework was introduced in 2013, to facilitate long-term, risk-diversified, collective investment in rental property. The rules relating to REITs in Ireland are found in Part 25A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. In order to be a REIT, a company must be listed on the main market of an EU stock exchange within three years of forming, and it must be widely held. Irish REITs are collective investment vehicles which invest in Irish property. As such, their income and gains from Irish property are not taxed within the REIT but are instead taxed in the hands of the investor when distributed. REITs must distribute at least 85% of their property profits to their shareholders each year. A REIT is subject to corporation tax on any income or gains arising from any other business (i.e. non-property business) that it carries on.  </p>  <p>  Dividend withholding tax at 20% must be applied to all distributions from REITs, other than distributions to certain limited classes of investors such as pension funds and charities as they are more generally exempt from tax. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied with the tax regimes applicable to REITs and IREFs, however given the important implications which developments in the property market can have for the economy, my Department actively monitors developments in this sector on an ongoing basis. As part of the 2018 Finance Act process I committed to conduct a review of REITs, IREFs and section 110 companies as they invest in the Irish property market. Officials in my Department are currently preparing this report, which is to be presented to the Tax Strategy Group in July.</p></reply>

In keeping with established practice, I will issue a formal response to the Report in due course.</p>  <p>  The Council&rsquo;s assessment of the primary budget balance highlights concerns over the risks of reliance on elevated corporation tax receipts and unplanned increases in Government expenditure.</p>  <p>  As I have stated on numerous occasions, the Government is acutely aware of the importance of not committing to unsustainable permanent expenditure increases financed by transient revenue increases. To that end, we have committed to putting aside some of the excess corporation tax receipts for the Rainy Day Fund, to build up our fiscal buffers for the uncertain economic times ahead. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, my Department has prepared a Fiscal Vulnerabilities Scoping Paper, to be published shortly, which outlines a number of possible policy approaches to countering the risks of reliance on volatile tax revenues.

The overall objective is to encourage the Member States to increase their growth potential by continuing to improve their economies and further strengthening their economic resilience.</p>  <p>  In this regard I welcome the publication of the European Commission&rsquo;s Country Specific Recommendations for Ireland. While one of these recommendations calls on Ireland to continue to take action on addressing aggressive tax planning, it is notable that Commissioner Moscovici has publicly acknowledged that we are on the right track and encouraged us to continue in this direction. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s actions in recent years have demonstrated our clear commitment to taking action to address aggressive tax planning. Ireland&rsquo;s Corporation Tax Roadmap, which was published last September, set out a clear range of actions which Ireland is taking on corporate tax reform. Significant actions have already been taken on foot on the Roadmap including the introduction of Controlled Foreign Company rules, amendments to Ireland&rsquo;s exit tax rules, and the prompt ratification of the BEPS Multilateral Instrument. Further actions will be taken in Finance Bill 2019 including the amendment of Ireland&rsquo;s transfer pricing rules and the introduction of anti-hybrid rules. </p>  <p>  As a very open economy which serves as a key European base for a significant number of non-EU headquartered multinational companies, it is to be fully expected that Ireland would have a higher percentage of outbound royalty payments than other Member States.  Concerns about outbound payments are justified in circumstances where the relevant profits should in fact be taxed in the EU or where the profits are ultimately being untaxed (either in the recipient or parent jurisdiction).  It is my belief that neither of these concerns should arise in respect of outbound payments from Ireland. </p>  <p>  The international consensus is that profits should be taxed where the &lsquo;DEMPE&rsquo; functions occur. In this regard, Member States have the ability to tax the profits attributable to those functions within their jurisdiction under the international corporation tax framework.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the overwhelming majority of the outbound payments made from Ireland are made by companies which are ultimately owned by companies resident and taxable in the United States. It is my understanding that reforms introduced by the US in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2017 should make it impossible for any such royalties to avoid tax in the US even if they are not paid to the US directly and are not taxed in the recipient jurisdiction.  </p>  <p>  For these reasons I believe that the actions set out in the Roadmap are appropriate with regard to addressing aggressive tax planning but, as always, I will continue to keep the situation under review and shall act accordingly as circumstances demand.</p></reply>

Within his independent regulatory discretion, the Registrar acts to support the prudential soundness of individual credit unions, to maintain sector stability, and to protect the savings of credit union members. </p>  <p>  Since 2004 the amount of the Industry funding levy payable by each credit union has been capped at a rate of 0.01% of total assets. </p>  <p>  Consultation Paper 95 &lsquo;Joint Public Consultation Paper - Department of Finance and the Central Bank of Ireland - Funding the Cost of Financial Regulation&rsquo; (CP95) was published in 2015 and set out proposals to move from partial industry funding of financial regulation towards full industry funding, noting the proposal set out in an earlier consultation conducted by the Central Bank (CP61 &lsquo;Consultation on Impact Based Levies and Other Levy Related Matters&rsquo;) to move credit unions to fund 50% of the cost of regulating the credit union sector.  </p>  <p>  The Central Bank indicated, in its Funding Strategy and 2018 Guide to the Industry Funding Levy, that it intended to seek my approval to increase the proportion of financial regulation costs to be recovered from credit unions on a phased basis setting out an initial target of 50% to be reached by 2021.</p>  <p>  In response to the Central Bank's request I recommended that credit union contributions should not increase beyond the 50% target until:</p>  <p>  1. The levy trajectory has reached the planned 50% rate, at which time the impact on the viability of the sector will be better understood</p>  <p>  2. A public consultation regarding increasing the levy rate for credit unions beyond 50% is undertaken, which would include a regulatory impact assessment of such a change on the sector.</p>  <p>  In contrast to this recovery rates in 2018 for all other industry categories ranged from 65% to 100% and  the Central Bank intends to increase all to 100% funding over the next number of years.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy might also wish to note, that the Department of Finance, in collaboration with the Central Bank, is currently preparing a public consultation paper on potential changes to the Credit Institutions Resolution Fund Levy, which is expected to reduce materially from 2020. This consultation, which will be published on the Department of Finance website very shortly, will be open to all persons and I would strongly encourage all stakeholders to submit feedback.</p>  <p>  It is also important to note that as Minister for Finance I have reduced the Stabilisation Scheme Levy materially and that since 2017 no further levies have been charged by the Credit Union Restructuring Board (ReBo).</p></reply>

The SES will set out the broad parameters for macroeconomic growth and the fiscal outlook as well as the constraints facing the economy over the medium term. </p>  <p>  The Government is currently targeting a headline surplus of 0.4 per cent of GDP next year. Since the publication of the Stability Programme Update (SPU) 2019 in April, risks to the economy have intensified, most obviously the increasing possibility of a disorderly Brexit in October. As such, the SES is being prepared on a two-track basis; one scenario assuming an orderly exit, and one assuming a disorderly exit.</p>  <p>  The impact of the two scenarios on the public finances will be set out in the SES.  </p>  <p>  However, I would also point out that, leaving aside Brexit, the economy is on the verge of overheating.  Budgetary policy must, therefore, be framed in the context of potential overheating on the one hand, and the possibility of a disorderly exit of the UK from the EU on the other hand.</p></reply>

The recovery in the economy has provided the fiscal resources to restore pay scales to all public servants in an affordable and sustainable manner. </p>  <p>  Pay is being restored to members of the Defence Forces and other public servants in accordance with public sector pay agreements. The focus of these increases is weighted in favour of those on lower pay.</p>  <p>  Members of the Permanent Defence Force have received the pay increases due under the Lansdowne Road Agreement. In addition in 2017, following negotiations with PDFORRA, improved pay scales for general service recruits and privates, who joined the Permanent Defence Force post 1 January2013, were implemented.</p>  <p>  The Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020, provides for increases in pay ranging from 6.2% to 7.4% over the lifetime of the Agreement.

Further increases in pay are scheduled in 2019 and 2020.</p>  <p>  By the end of the current Public Service Pay agreement the pay scales of all public servants (including members of the Defence Forces), earning under &euro;70,000 per annum, will be restored to pre FEMPI levels. The restoration of the 5% reduction to allowances cut under FEMPI is also scheduled as part of that agreement.</p>  <p>  New entrants who joined the Defence Forces since 2011, may also benefit from the measures which will see interventions at points 4 and 8 of the pay scales for all such relevant new entrants to the public service.</p>  <p>  In accordance with the provisions of the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020, the Government has tasked the Public Service Pay Commission with conducting a more comprehensive examination of the specific recruitment and retention challenges in the Defence Sector.

The fact that the epicentre of the outbreak is in a conflict zone makes this an extremely difficult crisis to resolve. </p>  <p>  So far, Ireland has provided over &euro;2.6 million to UN and NGO partners both for outbreak control programmes in DRC and for preparedness efforts in Uganda.

To date, the EU has provided &euro;21.5 million to the UN, the Red Cross, and to NGOs for access to health care, prevention and control of infections, epidemiological surveillance, safe burials, contact tracing, logistics, and coordination. This includes new funding of &euro;3.5 million announced on 13 June to enable rapid detection and reaction to Ebola cases in Uganda and South Sudan.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department are liaising with US State Department, given the leading US role in the international response.</p>  <p>  Irish Embassies in Kampala and Dar es Salaam - which has responsibility for relations with DRC -  are liaising closely with local partners and donors, as well as with Irish citizens in the affected regions.

However, we believe that action against settlements must be both lawful and well-considered, since actions which are not fully thought-through risk ultimately being unwound, thereby undermining the cause they aim to support. </p>  <p>  In this case, the terms of the Resolution as adopted by the UN Human Rights Council were so broad that a list draw on up pursuant to it might well include businesses with only tenuous or inadvertent connections with settlements. Any ambiguity about could potentially lead to unfair and counter-productive outcomes.</p>  <p>  The EU members of the HRC therefore abstained in the vote on the Resolution. Despite these reservations, Ireland of course assured the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) that we would cooperate with any request for assistance in the task they had been assigned. </p>  <p>  In March 2019, the High Commissioner for Human Rights reaffirmed her commitment to discharging the mandate given her under Resolution 31/36 and explained that she needed more time to fully respond to the Council&rsquo;s request as the mandate was novel and complex.  Ireland notes the High Commissioner&rsquo;s commitment to discharge the mandate of the HRC resolution 31/36 in a legally, factually and methodological sound manner.</p>  <p>  Ireland has always sought to protect the independence of the Office of High Commissioner for Human Rights. We have not supported any efforts to delay or prevent publication of this database. Nor do we believe it would be appropriate to attempt to influence the High Commissioner&rsquo;s decision on when she considers the database ready for publication.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to the implementation of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, and in November 2017 published its National Plan on Business and Human Rights 2017-2020.  Implementation of this plan is a priority for the Government over the coming years, with the objective of promoting responsible business practice at home and abroad.</p></reply>

I currently have no plans to re-open the scheme which terminated in accordance with its sunset clause on 31 December 2018.</p>  <p>  Under my Department's Tax Expenditure Guidelines, the introduction of new tax incentive measures should only be considered in circumstances where there is a demonstrable market failure and where a tax based incentive is more efficient than a direct expenditure intervention. </p>  <p>  The HRI was introduced at a time when there was considerable loss of employment within the construction sector, with the aim of addressing this market failure by stimulating increased activity in the sector. In the current context of a growing economy and construction sector, the initial objectives of the scheme have been fulfilled, and this support is no longer needed in the terms in which it was originally envisaged.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore, in light of the current housing supply shortage, and the need to deliver 25,000 additional housing units per annum over the period 2017-2021, there is a risk that a reintroduction of the HRI could lead to increased competition for scarce resources within the construction sector, leading to upward pressure on construction costs and house prices. The potential for displacement of labour from work on new builds to work on home renovations would create a high opportunity cost of labour associated with HRI which was not present at the inception of the scheme.</p>  <p>  Revenue advise me that, as of 2 January 2019, the cost to the Exchequer of the HRI was c. &euro;105 million, with a further &euro;65 million worth of credits yet to be claimed in respect of the incentive. As the Deputy will appreciate, I must be mindful of the public finances and the many demands on the Exchequer. Tax reliefs, no matter how worthwhile in themselves, lead to a narrowing of the tax base.</p></reply>

Modified domestic demand, an underlying measure of growth in the economy, grew by 4.5 per cent for 2018 as a whole.</p>  <p>  One of the best barometers of the heath in the economy is the labour market.  The strong growth in employment over the last number of years has continued into this year, with total employment increasing by 81,200 (+3.7 per cent) in the year to Q1 2019. As a result, there are now more people working in Ireland than ever before. </p>  <p>  At the cornerstone of our recovery, has been the improvement in our competitiveness. Since 2008, the Central Bank&rsquo;s real harmonised competitiveness indicator has improved by approximately 22 per cent. The improvement in our competitiveness reflects the hard-won productivity gains made over the last number of years, alongside wage and price moderation. </p>  <p>  Importantly, the robust economic growth in recent years has not yet given rise to significant inflationary pressures. In the first four months of 2019, average annual inflation was just 1.1 per cent was recorded. </p>  <p>  On wage developments, while average annual earnings grew by over 3 per cent in 2018, this came on the back of a near decade of low or negative growth in earnings. The rise in labour income is a welcome development, however it needs to be monitored closely, as a significant acceleration in wages could undermine Ireland&rsquo;s relative competitiveness to other European countries.</p>  <p>  Over the medium term, the domestic economy is expected to act as the primary driver of growth. In this context, we must remain conscious of the potential upward pressure this will place on both prices and wages, that could give rise to a loss of competitiveness. </p></reply>

Although growth in our economy is expected to moderate over the coming years, it is still expected to compare very favourably to other EU countries. The 2019 IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook recently ranked Ireland as the 2nd most competitive country in the EU and the 7th most competitive country in the world, both of which are relative improvements on the 2017 rankings.</p>  <p>  As a barometer of how well our economy is performing, there is no story more positive than the one emanating from our labour market. The positive growth in employment seen over the last number of years has continued into 2019, as a result the unemployment rate has fallen from a peak of 16 per cent in early 2012 to 4.4 per cent in May 2019.  This compares favourably to an average unemployment rate of 6.4 per cent for the EU as a whole. </p>  <p>  Importantly, the robust economic growth in recent years has not yet given rise to significant inflationary pressures. For 2018 as a whole, average annual inflation of just 0.7 per cent was recorded, this compares favourably to the 1.7 per cent recorded across the EU. </p>  <p>  Over the medium term, the domestic economy is expected to act as the primary driver of growth. The baseline projections assume that some moderate overheating pressures will emerge, particularly in the context of the expected increase in housing output. However these pressures could be more significant than expected with the potential to generate imbalances over the coming years and impact on our competitiveness.</p>  <p>  As I outlined in the Stability Programme Update in April, our economy also faces a number of external risks which could undermine our competitiveness. These risks primarily relate to a more adverse-than-expected outcome from Brexit, a rise in protectionism and a disruption to world trade. There is also increasing evidence of a slowdown in global growth. </p>  <p>  As many of the risks we are facing are external and thus beyond our control, the best way we can mitigate against them is through prudent budgetary policy, careful management of the public finances and by focusing on competitiveness-oriented policies, particularly those that increase productivity.</p></reply>

Taxation is one of the areas which remains subject to the subsidiarity principle and therefore within the gift of national parliaments.  This means that Member States maintain powers in the area of taxation unless EU legislation has been agreed in a specific area. The principle of subsidiarity is guaranteed by Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union.</p>  <p>  This current system of deciding taxation matters at EU level has been the basis of decisions for tax proposals since the beginning of the European Union. Since 2015, Member States have unanimously agreed in excess of 20 different tax initiatives.</p>  <p>  While there has been discussions at EU level about changing the current voting system from unanimity to QMV (qualified majority voting), a considerable number of Member States have expressed support for retaining the current voting rules in taxation.  </p>  <p>  Ireland believes that the current unanimity-based voting procedure is the most appropriate voting system in the area of taxation.  Several Member States have made clear that their Governments do not support any proposed change to how tax decisions are made at European level. </p>  <p>  As EU partners, the United Kingdom and Ireland have traditionally shared similar views on the broader tax issue of harmonisation and on proposals such as the proposed directive for a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base.  While Brexit will result in the loss of an important ally on these matters, Ireland will not be isolated as a number of other countries have similar views to us. </p>  <p>  Brexit, in whatever form it takes, will have a significant impact on Ireland, and requires planning by Government, business and citizens, as well as at the EU level. Our planning at home and at the EU level for all possible outcomes will continue. The Department of Finance and other Government Departments and key Agencies have been preparing for Brexit for three years now &ndash; and we continue to do so, through extensive contingency planning and stakeholder engagement. Last week (on 12 June) the Commission issued its fifth Contingency Communication which updates and reinforces the necessary no deal Brexit preparedness measures at EU level. </p>  <p>  Whatever the outcome of Brexit, Ireland will remain in the EU with all the stability and certainty that membership brings, including access to the Single Market of over 500 million people.</p></reply>

Although growth rates have moderated from 2018, they still compare very favourably to other EU, and significant non-EU, trading partners.</p><p>As a barometer of how well our economy is performing, there is no story more positive than the one emanating from our labour market, where we saw full time employment growth of almost 3 per cent in 2018. More people are working in Ireland than ever before and the unemployment rate, at 4.4 per cent, is significantly lower than that of other Euro Area countries.</p><p>Growth in the Irish economy is expected to come from both modified domestic demand, which is set to increase by 4.0 per cent in 2019, and an expansion in Irish exports &ndash; which are set to grow by 5.2 per cent this year. Modified domestic demand excludes the volatile components of investment spending &ndash; giving a more accurate picture of the health of domestic economic activity.</p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s economic data compare favourably to those of our main trading partners &ndash; with growth, unemployment, and inflation performing better than the Euro Area and EU averages - as the data in Table 1 below illustrate. The European Commission Spring 2019 forecasts, published in May, show that the pace of expansion in the Euro Area, the EU and the US is expected to ease. For the Euro Area, the Commission is forecasting growth of 1.2 per cent this year, strengthening slightly to 1.5 per cent in 2020.  Growth in the US economy will slow but remain relatively strong at 2.4 per cent for 2019, easing further to 1.9 per cent in 2020. In common with Ireland, unemployment continues to fall in the EU and US, with the US labour market set to tighten further as it approaches full employment. In the UK, unemployment will remain stable as employment growth slows in the context of subdued GDP figures. </p><p>The comparatively low level of inflation in Ireland should help to maintain our competitiveness and protect real wage growth. The 2019 IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook recently ranked Ireland as the second most competitive country in the EU and the seventh most competitive country in the world. This should help our economy to continue to perform well internationally &ndash; notwithstanding a number of key global risks.</p><p>Table 1<table><tr><th></th><th>Real GDP </th><th></th><th></th><th>Inflation </th><th></th><th></th><th>Unemployment </th><th></th><th></th></tr><tr><td></td><td>2018 </td><td>2019 </td><td>2020 </td><td>2018</td><td>2019</td><td>2020</td><td>2018 </td><td>2019 </td><td>2020 </td></tr><tr><td>Ireland (SPU 2019 forecasts) </td><td>6.7 </td><td>3.9 </td><td>3.3 </td><td>0.7 </td><td>0.9 </td><td>1.1 </td><td>5.7 </td><td>5.4 </td><td>5.2 </td></tr><tr><td>UK </td><td>1.4 </td><td>1.3 </td><td>1.3 </td><td>2.5 </td><td>2.0 </td><td>2.1 </td><td>4.0 </td><td>4.1 </td><td>4.2 </td></tr><tr><td>Euro Area </td><td>1.9 </td><td>1.2 </td><td>1.5 </td><td>1.8 </td><td>1.4 </td><td>1.4 </td><td>8.2 </td><td>7.7 </td><td>7.3 </td></tr><tr><td>EU28 </td><td>2.0 </td><td>1.4 </td><td>1.6 </td><td>1.9 </td><td>1.6 </td><td>1.7 </td><td>6.8 </td><td>6.5 </td><td>6.2 </td></tr><tr><td>US </td><td>2.9 </td><td>2.4 </td><td>1.9 </td><td>2.4 </td><td>2.0 </td><td>2.0 </td><td>3.9 </td><td>3.8 </td><td>3.7 </td></tr></table></p><p><i>Source: European Commission Spring 2019 forecasts and Department of Finance SPU 2019 forecasts for Ireland</i></p></reply>

This interest rate varied considerably across countries, with the average for the euro area being 1.70%. A link to the publication is below:</p><p><i></i></p><p>The European Central Bank (ECB) sets monetary policy and official interest rates for the Eurozone as a whole and also plays a key role in the prudential supervision of European banks and the maintenance of the stability of the overall banking system in the context of the Single Supervisory Mechanism. It is a matter for each credit institution to set its own lending and deposit rates having regard to cost and competitive considerations and also to make its own lending decisions.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware, a number of factors contribute to the differential between Irish mortgage rates and those in other countries including the relatively large historical loss experience in the Irish market during the financial crisis and the related legacy issues of non-performing loans. In Ireland there is a relatively high level of non-performing loans in the banking system. Banks are required to make adequate provisions for such loans.</p><p>Banks are also required to hold an adequate level of capital against mortgage lending. These capital requirements are calculated with reference to historical loss and default rates. The high levels of mortgage default experienced by Irish banks in the aftermath of the financial crisis mean that Irish banks are required to hold relatively more capital for new mortgage lending than many of their European peers, in some cases substantially more capital.  </p><p>In addition to their capital requirements banks are also required to build up additional capital to meet regulatory capital buffers such as the countercyclical capital buffer which is intended to ensure banks can withstand future adverse economic shocks.</p><p>The impact of these capital requirements is reflected in the interest rates charged for mortgages in Ireland.  </p><p>Furthermore, the Irish banking system continues to hold a large amount of lower yielding tracker mortgages on their balance sheets and there is currently a high level of concentration in the market for new mortgage credit.  </p><p>As I have mentioned before, the Central Bank has introduced a number of changes to the Consumer Protection Code that are designed to help consumers make savings on their mortgage repayments; for example, provision 6.5 (g) of the Code now requires lenders at least annually to, <i>inter alia</i>, notify their variable interest (other than tracker) mortgage customers whether they can move to a cheaper interest rate as a result of a change in their loan to value interest rate band and, if the customer is permitted to move, to invite the borrower to contact the lender to discuss the matter.  If the consumer is not permitted to move to a lower loan to value band with a lower interest rate, the consumer is nevertheless to be notified that he/she may be able to avail of a lower loan to value interest rate band from another lender based on an up to-date valuation of the property.  It should also be noted that the Central Bank macro prudential loan to value and loan to income residential mortgage lending restrictions do not apply to switcher mortgages.

GDP is projected to expand by 3.9 per cent overall in 2019 and by 3.3 per cent in 2020. Growth at these levels ensures that Ireland is one of the fastest growing countries in Europe. </p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s strong economic performance has manifested itself in the labour market. The level of employment increased by 81,200, or 3.7 per cent, on average in the year to Q1 2019. As a result, there are now more people working in Ireland than ever before at 2.3 million.<b></b>Encouragingly<b>, </b>the vast majority of employment growth was in full time positions. Economic growth has also allowed the Government to run a budget surplus in 2018, the first in over a decade.</p><p>The positive economic conditions have resulted in strong wage growth, which in turn has fed through to more people being able to purchase a home for the first time. For example, there were over 37 per cent more first time buyer purchases in Q1 2019 than there were in Q1 2016.  Residential construction has increased during this time.</p><p>Notwithstanding these positive developments, the Government recognises that there are affordability constraints on first time buyers and has implemented a number of measures to assist, such as the Help to Buy Scheme and the Affordable Purchase Scheme. The best approach to improving affordability in the long term is to increase supply. The Government has put in place a number of significant initiatives to achieve this including a record allocation for housing provision to the Department of Housing Planning and Local Government in 2019, as well as the establishment of the Land Development Agency, Home Building Finance Ireland and changes to the tax system in the form of the vacant site levy.</p></reply>

The balance of risk is firmly tilted to the downside, both in the short-term and over the medium-term.</p><p>The Irish economy is in an unusual position at present, facing possible domestic overheating and capacity constraints on the one hand, and a slowdown in key export markets on the other. In addition to this, the UK&rsquo;s forthcoming exit from the EU is causing uncertainty in terms of Ireland&rsquo;s future trading relationship. </p><p>In March 2019, the Department of Finance and the ESRI published a comprehensive assessment of the potential impact of Brexit. This report shows that compared to a no Brexit baseline, the level of GDP in Ireland would be around 2.6 per cent lower in a &lsquo;deal&rsquo; scenario, and 5.0 per cent in a disorderly &lsquo;no deal&rsquo; scenario, ten years after Brexit. The report also estimates that, after ten years, Irish exports would be reduced by 4.6 per cent in a 'deal' scenario, and 8.3 per cent in a &lsquo;disorderly no deal&rsquo; scenario. </p><p>Other than Brexit, the main short-term risks relate to a sharper-than-assumed deterioration in the international environment and an escalation of trade protectionism. </p><p>Over the medium-term, the principal risks relate to potential overheating as the economy approaches full-employment, and changes in other jurisdictions that affect the competitiveness of Ireland&rsquo;s corporate tax regime. </p><p>The economy is in a good position to meet these challenges. Economic growth, which resumed early this decade, has been consistently among the highest in the EU for a number of years, notwithstanding reservations about the headline data. </p><p>The recovery is perhaps most clearly evident in the labour market. The unemployment rate has fallen to 4.4 per cent from the peak of 16 per cent in 2012. There are now more people at work in Ireland than ever before. </p><p>The headline budget deficit was eliminated last year for the first time in a decade. Mitigation measures have been prioritised by building up the resilience of the economy and the public finances, thus improving the capacity to deal with an adverse economic shock. Some &euro;1.5 billion has been set aside in a Rainy Day Fund. Our companies are being supported to prepare for Brexit, to diversify their markets and supply chains, to develop new skills and to explore new opportunities. </p><p>The Government will continue to work to strengthen the resilience of the economy, to maximise opportunities and to prepare our economy for the challenges ahead, including through the Ireland Connected Trade and Investment Strategy, the 10-year National Development Plan and Future Jobs Ireland 2019.</p><p><b>Table: macro-economic risk assessment matrix</b><table><tr><th>Risk </th><th>Likelihood </th><th>Impact and Transmission Channel </th></tr><tr><td>External </td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>External demand shock </td><td>Medium </td><td>High &ndash; the global economy has slowed and it is possible that the temporary slowdown becomes more prolonged. </td></tr><tr><td>Geopolitical factors </td><td>Medium </td><td>High &ndash; increased geopolitical uncertainty has the potential to disrupt growth in key regions and generate headwinds for output and employment in Ireland. </td></tr><tr><td>Disruption to world trade </td><td>Medium </td><td>High &ndash; the Irish economy is deeply embedded in the international economy and has benefitted enormously from globalisation, so that any increase in protectionism could potentially have a detrimental impact on living standards. </td></tr><tr><td>&ldquo;Hard-Brexit&rdquo; </td><td>Medium </td><td>High &ndash; An outcome to the continuing EU-UK negotiations which resulted in a WTO-type arrangement between the EU and UK would have a particularly detrimental impact on Irish-UK trade. </td></tr><tr><td>Domestic </td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Concentrated production base </td><td>Low </td><td>High &ndash; Ireland&rsquo;s production base is highly concentrated in a small number of high-tech sectors, with the result that output and employment are exposed to firm- and sector-specific shocks. </td></tr><tr><td>Loss of competitiveness </td><td>Medium</td><td>High &ndash; as a small and open economy, Ireland&rsquo;s business model is very much geared towards export-led growth, which, in turn, is sensitive to the evolution of cost competitiveness.</td></tr><tr><td>Housing supply pressures </td><td>High</td><td>Medium &ndash; supply constraints in the housing sector can adversely impact on competitiveness by inter alia restricting the mobility of labour.</td></tr><tr><td>Overheating economy </td><td>Medium </td><td>Medium &ndash; With the labour market approaching full employment, stronger than assumed growth could lead to overheating pressures.

Modified domestic demand, a measure of underlying economic activity in the domestic economy, increased by 4.5 per cent in 2018.   </p>  <p>  Despite the rapid rate of recovery, the main signs of overheating &ndash; for instance pay developments, credit growth, and inflation - do not yet suggest that significant overheating pressures have emerged.</p>  <p>  The labour market arguably provides the best barometer of the health of the economy at present.  The strong growth in employment over the last number of years has continued into this year, with total employment increasing by 81,200 (+3.7 per cent) in the year to Q1 2019. In parallel the unemployment rate has fallen from a peak of 16 per cent in early 2012 to 4.4 per cent in May 2019.  This rate of unemployment and the recent signs of a pick-up in earnings are consistent with an economy that is running close to full employment. Although these positive developments in the labour market are welcomed, we need to monitor these development closely as a significant acceleration in wages, would undermine Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness.</p>  <p>  For 2018 as a whole, Ireland&rsquo;s inflation averaged just 0.7 per cent, this compares to an average inflation rate of 1.9 per cent for the EU as a whole. The comparatively low level of inflation in Ireland should help to maintain our competitiveness and protect real wage growth. While price pressures have been seen in the housing market, these are more a function of structural imbalances between supply and demand, which we are actively seeking to alleviate, rather than evidence of over-heating.</p>  <p>  As in any healthy economy, the pick-up in credit growth has taken hold, albeit at a modest pace. However, since the financial crisis, a number of additional safeguards have been put in place to prevent the unsustainable build-up of credit, most notably the introduction of the macro-prudential regulations by the Central Bank. </p>  <p>  Over the medium term, with the domestic economy expected to drive growth, it is important that we remain cognisant of the potential upward pressure this will place on both prices and wages, which could give rise to a loss of competitiveness. Indeed, in order to prevent overheating pressures emerging we must focus on maintaining competitiveness-oriented policies, whilst avoiding pro-cyclical policy measures.  To this end, the Government will continue to implement budgetary policies designed to ensure economic stability and fiscal sustainability. This prudent approach to our public finances will help to mitigate against any future downturn in economy activity.</p></reply>

This will help deliver 10,000 new social housing homes in 2019 through a range of build and acquisition programmes.</p>  <p>  As Rebuilding Ireland progresses, each year will see the housing needs of more households met through direct build and less through the Housing Assistance Payment, with published targets for HAP decreasing from a peak of 17,000 additional units in 2018 to 10,000 in 2021. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, under Rebuilding Ireland, the Government is already providing significant capital allocations, through the local authorities, for the delivery of affordable housing:</p>  <p>  The Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF) was established in 2017 to provide offsite infrastructural support for private housing developments a portion of which will be offered at affordable prices. The Fund was originally &euro;200m, comprising an Exchequer allocation of &euro;150 million matched by a &euro;50 million contribution from participating local authorities, over the period 2017 - 2019. </p>  <p>  The Serviced Sites Fund is designed to get affordable home-building started quickly on local authority sites in the areas with the greatest affordability challenge. A total amount of &euro;310 million is available for the Serviced Site Fund (SSF) out to 2021, to fund key facilitating infrastructure, on public lands, to support the provision of affordable homes to purchase or rent. At a maximum grant of &euro;50,000 per affordable home, at least 6,200 affordable homes are being targeted under the Fund. The awarding of this funding is contingent on the local authority ensuring the delivery of affordable homes to rent or to buy from the site(s) without delay. The affordable homes from the sites funded under the Fund will be either affordable purchase under the 2009 Act or cost rental.</p>  <p>  Recognising that it is often those households renting in the main urban areas that face the greatest affordability challenge, the development of a viable cost rental sector is also a Government objective. A Cost Rental model is being developed by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, Housing Agency, relevant local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies in the context of a number of pilot cost rental projects at Enniskerry Road in Dun Laoghaire Rathdown and at St. Michael&rsquo;s Estate in Inchicore (Dublin City Council). These pilots may provide a useful template to develop further projects at scale across many local authorities.</p></reply>

The NDP seeks to reform how public investment is planned and delivered.  It sets out a strategic vision for Ireland&rsquo;s public capital infrastructure priorities over the next 10 years that is strictly aligned with the National Strategic Outcomes for Ireland&rsquo;s new spatial strategy contained in the NPF. </p><p>The plan signals a shift to a greater integration of regional investment plans, stronger co-ordination of sectorial strategies and more rigorous selection and appraisal of projects to secure value-for-money.  A suite of key reforms has been introduced to support the efficient implementation of Project Ireland 2040 and its objectives including:</p><p>- The establishment of a Construction Sector Group to ensure regular and open dialogue between Government and the construction sector; </p><p>- A Project Ireland 2040 Delivery Board consisting of Departmental Secretaries General that meets regularly to ensure effective leadership of the implementation process;</p><p>- The establishment of an Investment Projects and Programmes Office in my Department to coordinate reporting on the plan and to drive reforms, including strengthened business case and project appraisal;</p><p>- The publication of a Capital Projects tracker to inform citizens about projects in their areas and to give a greater overview to the construction sector; </p><p>- A Capability Review of public sector bodies is being undertaken by my Department to ensure that the State&rsquo;s delivery practices are of the highest standard; and </p><p>- As part of the ongoing reform of Ireland&rsquo;s capital management systems, the Office of Government Procurement is conducting a review of construction procurement strategy and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is reviewing the Public Spending Code. The purpose of these reviews is to strengthen the existing guidance to better align with the realities of project delivery and with a particular focus on improved financial appraisal, cost estimation and management.  </p><p>These reforms are designed to support public bodies as they work to achieve value for money and to maximise outcomes from investment in public capital infrastructure.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, projections for general government revenue and expenditure beyond 2023 have not yet been compiled.  However, Project Ireland 2040 does set out the national spending envelope up to 2027, allocated to each National Strategic Outcome to ensure that Project Ireland 2040 objectives can be pursued in the light of the expected funding allocation.</p></reply>

However, as the Deputy has noted, the move towards a more user-friendly system and the abolition of fees have seen a significant increase in the number of requests. There has been a 67% increase between 2014, the last year of operation for the operation for the previous legislation, and 2017.  It is expected that the Information Commissioner's next annual report will show that the number of requests in 2018 exceeded the 33,979 received by civil and public sector organisations in 2017 as part of a consistent upward trend.  This continuing increase in demand may be seen both as a measure of the legislation's success and a significant challenge for public bodies.</p>  <p>  Against this backdrop, the Central Policy Unit for Freedom of Information at my Department has continued to work closely with stakeholders throughout the civil and public service with a view towards improving FOI practice.  Our aim is  to ensure that requesters' objectives are met by the most efficient possible means, while building capacity both in terms of technical knowledge, but also an appreciation of the broader significance of this legislation for the business of their organisations.  In addition, the Central Policy Unit liaises closely with the Office of the Information Commissioner as well as members of the public, providing guidance and advice on making the most of the FOI system through its help-desk service.</p>  <p>  The Central Policy Unit is currently at an advanced stage of the tender process for a revised FOI training framework.  Over 9,000 participants have received training under the previous framework. This new initiative aims to build on that success in the initial implementation of the 2014 Act, providing public servants with the practical skills and expert technical knowledge necessary to ensure more effective and efficient operation of the FOI system into the future.</p></reply>

Schools may also appeal a decision, where the school considers that the NCSE, in applying Department policy, has not allocated the appropriate level of SNA support to the school to meet the special educational and/or care needs of the children concerned.</p>  <p>  Where a school has received its allocation of SNA support for 2019/20, but wishes new enrolments or assessments to be considered, which were not taken into account when the initial allocation was made, they may continue to make applications to the NCSE.  </p>  <p>The closing date for receipt of appeals in regard to SNA allocations is Friday 27 September 2019.</p>  <p>  As this question relates to a particular school, I have referred the question to the NCSE for their direct reply.

The level of provision now available should enable pupils to make progress in keeping with their needs and abilities and to move consecutively through the different class levels in the school in keeping with their peers.</p>  <p>  In accordance with the terms of the circular, a principal teacher should consult with the learning support teacher, class teacher and parents of a pupil and if all parties conclude that the pupil would benefit educationally by repeating a class, the pupil may be retained. However, a record outlining the educational basis for the decision to retain a pupil in a class for a second year should be kept for any pupil retained. In addition, there should be a clear programme outlined for such a pupil that records precisely what new approach will be used for her/him and what its expected benefit will be. These records should be retained within the school and should be brought to the attention of the Inspector. A pupil should not be retained for longer than one year in a primary school.</p>  <p>  Circular 32/03 recognises that a student may be allowed to repeat a year provided there is an educational basis for it, and there is a clear programme for the pupil to follow.

This continuing investment is intended to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can be mobile, visible and responsive on the roads and in the community to prevent and tackle crime.  </p><p>The Deputy may also wish to be aware that a total of &euro;10 million has been made available for the purchase and fit-out of Garda vehicles in 2019.  I understand from the Garda authorities that this allocation will be used for purchase and fit-out of over 300 new vehicles for operational use this year. </p><p>As the Deputy will appreciate, in accordance with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 as amended, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for managing and controlling the administration and business of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Further, the allocation of Garda resources is a matter for the Commissioner, in light of identified operational demands. This includes responsibility for the allocation of Garda vehicles among the various Garda divisions.  As Minister, I have no role in these matters. I am assured, however, that Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure their optimum use.</p><p>The Garda authorities advise that the following table outlines the Galway Divisional Fleet by District from 2014 to 14 June 2019.</p><p><table><tr><th>1 Jan - 14 June

In general, the location of projects is linked to local needs and the levels of youth crime. The existing network of GYDPs has developed organically over three decades, and I am committed to ensuring that it continues to develop as resources become available so that every young person has access to these very valuable services, and that they are delivered to the highest standard possible.</p><p>The continued support and development of these services is of high importance to my Department. Recently the Action Research Project (ARP) was launched by my Department in partnership with the University of Limerick. </p><p>The ARP, supported by the Research Evidence into Policy Programmes and Practice project (REPPP) in the University of Limerick, involves 15 selected Garda Youth Diversion Projects. The intention is to move beyond the testimonial and anecdotal evidence we have that projects work well and provide a good service, to capture precisely what specific interventions work best, document this evidence, and roll out learning across all the projects over a period of years. The actions will include:</p><p>- examination of what makes for a successful relationship between a young participant and a Youth Justice Worker (success being understood as facilitation of real change in the young person&rsquo;s attitudes and life that would not otherwise happen);</p><p>- articulating the contribution that a GYDP makes in tackling crime in a community; and</p><p>- assessment of the contribution that &lsquo;up-stream&rsquo; agencies and interventions can make to crime reduction and making appropriate recommendations.</p><p>Furthermore, I am chairing an expert Steering Group to guide the development of a new Youth Justice Strategy. One of the areas the group is examining is diversion from the Justice System. This will include looking at  how we can enhance the Garda Youth Diversion Programme and the GYDPs which act to support it. </p><p>All of this work will help to further develop and enhance, over time and as resources allow, the approach to the location of new projects, with the objective of ensuring that the GYDP service is available in all areas of the State.</p><p><table><tr><th>GARDA

They are also published online at <i></i>.  All youth crime cases are required to be sent to the Garda Diversion Office for consideration and the statistics for each year, broken down by Garda District, are set out in the annual report for that year.  Figures for 2018 are not available yet, but will be available when the 2018 report is published later this year.  The 2019 statistics and report will be available in the course of 2020. </p><p>The Deputy will appreciate that crime prevention and investigation, including in relation to the involvement of children in crime, are operational matters for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the first instance. My Department is committed to supporting them in this regard.That being said, I am committed to tackling youth crime and my department is taking a number of different steps to address the number of youth offences being committed. </p><p>An important initiative in that regard is the <b>&quot;</b>Greentown&quot; project, a research project led by the REPPP Project (Research Evidence into Policy, Programmes and Practice) at the School of Law in the University of Limerick (UL). The REPPP project is a strategic research partnership with UL which is supported by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, and also by my own Department. Its specific focus is on examining the recruitment by criminal networks of children in Ireland and to make recommendations for interventions to disrupt this. </p><p>In the absence of international models of intervention that could be readily deployed, the original Greentown report (December 2016) recommended the design of a programme to include interventions with children and their families to help them withstand the influence of criminal networks. This new &quot;Greentown Programme&quot; has been designed with the input of leading international expertise on crime and criminal networks, together with Irish scientific, policy and practice expertise in child protection and welfare, drugs and community development. </p><p>I understand that it is intended to commence a trial of the Greentown Programme approach, on a pilot basis, during 2019. </p><p>More generally, I am currently developing a new Youth Justice Strategy with the assistance of an interdepartmental and interagency steering group. The new Strategy will address the full range of issues relevant to youth justice, including how best to tackle the serious issues raised in the Deputy's Question. </p><p>A key issue here is how to ensure an integrated approach across all agencies, but in particular the relevant child welfare programmes, Garda Youth Diversion Projects and schools, to ensure a sustained and holistic response and that integrated services are provided to respond to the situation of children at risk, tailored to the individual child in the context of the specific family and the specific community and the issues they face. The new Youth Justice Strategy will be published in draft form for a further round of public consultation before the end of this year and will be finalised early in 2020. </p><p>My Department also provides funding through the Irish Youth Justice Service (IYJS) to support the operation of 106 Garda Youth Diversion Projects (GYDPs). These projects are community based multi-agency crime prevention initiatives which primarily seek to divert young people who have become involved in crime/anti-social behaviour. </p><p>For 2019, IYJS has a renewed emphasis on preventative work by GYDPs, looking at the child in the context of the specific family and the specific community. This includes family support work and working with children aged 8 to 11. The Department also supports pilot projects, to help develop better approaches in areas such as engagement with hard-to-reach or more challenging children, as well as mentoring initiatives.</p></reply>

I expect a draft report with options for reform to be submitted to me in the coming weeks, with a view to my bringing proposals for legislative change to Government in the autumn.</p>  <p>  The Review is already addressing all the issues raised in submissions made to it, including those that featured in a recent campaign by the print media. These include:</p>  <p>  - whether changes should be made to the respective roles of the judge and the jury in High Court defamation cases, in particular in relation to the question of damages; and- whether any change should be made to the level or type of damages which may be awarded in defamation cases, or to the factors to be taken into account in making that determination.</p>  <p>  It is important that the Defamation Act operates in practice to ensure that where damages are awarded for defamation, they are fair and proportionate. The objective set for the defamation review was to ensure that our defamation law strikes the right balance between protecting an individual&rsquo;s good name and privacy, and protecting the right to freedom of expression, taking account of the vital role in our democracy played by a free and independent press.</p></reply>

In doing so, the IDA has targeted both new-name investors and increased investment from companies already located here. This approach has contributed to record results in recent years and should lead to further investment and job creation in the years ahead. </p>  <p>  The Agency has also restructured its global footprint in response to Brexit, with the UK now being treated as a distinct market. The IDA's staff are working hard as well to avail of new investment opportunities from non-traditional target markets. The Agency&rsquo;s efforts in this context have already yielded positive results, with over 70 Brexit-related investments and 5,000 associated jobs won to date.</p>  <p>  Our efforts to win more FDI will be helped, post-Brexit, by our continued status as an attractive destination for overseas firms. Ireland&rsquo;s membership of the European Union ensures that companies considering an investment here will gain barrier-free access to the EU market.

However, as part of the National Contract for Consultants negotiated in 2008, some consultants holding specific contracts are entitled to engage in private outpatient practice outside of their public commitment and this commitment must be conducted on site, that is, in the hospital they are contracted with. As a result, private outpatient clinics may be held on the public hospital campus but these clinics must be held outside contracted hours.  The new children's hospital is obliged to provide such facilities for consultants holding such contracts.  The proposal is for consultants to pay a fee for use of the rooms and other operational costs. </p>  <p>  The Report of the Independent Review Group established to examine private activity in public hospitals has been received and is being examined in my Department. It is a comprehensive examination of private activity in public hospitals and contains a small number of recommendations.

There are currently 29 Irish people in receipt of ex-gratia monthly payments from my Department and all are now in their late 50s. </p>  <p>  The German monthly payments are made by the Contergan Foundation, which is established under German legislation.  From 01 August 2013, the Foundation substantially increased its monthly payments to thalidomide survivors, including Irish survivors.  Both the German payments and the Irish ex-gratia payments made to the survivors are exempt from tax, including DIRT and are not reckonable as means for the purpose of Social Welfare payments. The rate of payment is related to the survivors' level of thalidomide related injury.</p>  <p>  In addition to the initial lump sum and the  monthly payments for life, the supports provided to each Irish survivor include a medical card on an administrative basis regardless of means, provision of appliances, artificial limbs,  equipment, housing adaptations, and access to a full range of primary care, hospital and personal social services. There is a designated senior manager in the Health Service Executive to act as a liaison with regard to the ongoing health and personal social service needs of Irish survivors.   </p>  <p>  The Contergan Foundation has confirmed that since 2013, it is accepting applications from individuals for compensation for thalidomide related injury.  It is open to any Irish person to apply to the Foundation for assessment of their disability as being attributable to thalidomide.  Any Irish person who establishes that their injury is attributable to thalidomide, will be offered appropriate supports by the Irish Government commensurate with those currently provided to Irish thalidomide survivors, outlined above.</p>  <p>  Work is underway in the Department to bring forward Heads of a Bill to provide on a statutory basis for health and personal social services for the Irish survivors of thalidomide.</p></reply>

This was the culmination of the work of the National Steering Group established in 2017, which included representation from stakeholder groups including the Neurological Alliance of Ireland. </p><p>The focus of the Neuro-Rehabilitation Strategy is on achieving best outcomes for people, by providing safe, high quality, person-centred care at the lowest appropriate level of complexity. This must be integrated across the care pathway and provided as close to home as possible or in specialist centres, where necessary.</p><p>The framework will guide the reconfiguration and development of neuro-rehabilitation structures and services at national and local level, through a 10-step Framework. </p><p>It proposes the formation of Managed Clinical Rehabilitation Networks (MCRNs), with the set-up of one demonstration MCRN suggested as the first step. </p><p>The ultimate goal of this approach is to put in place a national framework of acute, inpatient and specialist community services.</p><p>The Managed Clinical Rehabilitation Network (MCRN) model acknowledges that different service users need different input and different levels of expertise and specialisation at different stages in their rehabilitation journey.</p><p>The critical point of this model is that, although service users may need to access different services as they progress, the transition between services should be facilitated by appropriate communication and sharing of information between services so that they progress in a seamless continuum of care through the different stages:</p><p>- Acute hospital;</p><p>- Complex specialist rehabilitation services;</p><p>- Post-acute specialist inpatient rehabilitation services;</p><p>- Community based specialist rehabilitation services;</p><p>- Primary care; and </p><p>- Voluntary organisations.</p><p>This National Implementation Framework is evidence-based and informed by population needs. It addresses the continuum of care for those in need of neurological rehabilitation services. It describes the requirement for a whole system approach and provides the blueprint for how we should deliver care and services for those who suffer from neurological conditions who require individualised, goal focused rehabilitation</p><p>The implementation framework covers an initial period from 2019 into 2021. However, it is recognised that continued investment in and development of neuro-rehabilitation services will need to be prioritised beyond the three-year implementation period of this Implementation Framework.</p><p>As this a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy.</p></reply>

Energy efficient investments will be among the items under consideration for inclusion as new investment measures under future Rural Development Programmes. </p>  <p>  The current TAMS II Schemes provide grant aid for a number of investments specifically aimed at improving energy efficiency and developing a targeted and precise approach focusing on environmental dividends, efficiency and growth in the farming sector. Eligible energy efficiency investments include Plate coolers, Heat Transfer Units and Internal Ice Builders for the Dairy Sector.</p>  <p>  The Pigs and Poultry Scheme and the Young Farmer Capital Investment Scheme provide grant aid for biomass boilers, electrical heat pads, energy efficient LED lighting, indirect heating systems, solar panels for water heating and electricity production, ventilation fans and control systems, insulation for doors, roofs and walls, air source heat pumps and heat recovery units.</p>  <p>  LED Lighting uses a fraction of the electricity consumed by conventional lighting. The current specifications for the TAMS Scheme include LED for lighting in all new farm structures. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the availability of Solar Panels has recently been extended to all sectors which, together with the measures detailed above, will make a significant contribution to help ensure that the agriculture sector plays its part in Ireland&rsquo;s transition to a low-carbon economy and society as outlined in the All-of-Government Plan to tackle Climate Disruption launched earlier this week.</p></reply>

Based on the following statistics, however, there is clear evidence of an increase in organic production. </p>  <p>  In 2010, there was 52,370 hectares of land  under organic production. There is currently 72,000 hectares approximately under organic production.</p>  <p>  From a dairy perspective, there were 27 organic dairy herds in 2012 compared to 45 organic dairy herds in 2018. In 2012, there was 41,000 organic cattle approximately compared to 59,000 organic cattle approximately in 2016.  </p>  <p>  With regard to sheep production, organic sheep represented 1.3% of total sheep production in Ireland in 2012 compared to 1.9% of total sheep production in 2016. In 2016, there was 2,304 hectares under organic cereal and pulse production. This figure increased to 2,426 hectares in 2017.  </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Organic Strategy Group recommended a renewed focus on developing sector specific statistics. As a consequence, a value chain analysis to be carried out by Teagasc is one of the sector specific actions within the new Organic Strategy launched in January, 2019.</p>  <p>  The suite of supports currently available, which have contributed to the growth of the Organic Sector include the Organic Farming Scheme, the TAMS Organic Capital Investment Scheme and the Organic Processor Investment Grant Scheme.</p></reply>

The AMBER areas represent the target areas for the proposed State led Intervention under the NBP.    This intervention is the subject of the procurement process to engage a company to build, operate and maintain the NBP State intervention network. I recently brought a recommendation to Government to confer Preferred Bidder status on Granahan McCourt, the remaining bidder in the NBP procurement process and Government agreed to this. </p>  <p>  The Government Decision of 7 May 2019 means that it is intended to award the State Intervention contract to the Bidder. This award is subject to contract close, including finalisation of financial and legal documents. Deployment of the NBP State Intervention network will commence shortly that. </p>  <p>  The Bidder has indicated that the NBP State intervention will take an estimated 7 years from the beginning of deployment.</p>  <p>  A deployment plan will be made available by the Bidder once the contract is signed. In the first year of roll out, the Bidder will deploy approximately 300 Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) across all counties. It is anticipated that between 7 and 23 BCPs will be deployed in each county. BCPs will provide a community based high speed broadband service, enhancing online participation and allowing for the establishment of digital work hubs in these locations. </p>  <p>  The Bidder is aiming to pass 133,000 premises at the end of the second year, with 70-100,000 passed each year thereafter until roll out is completed.</p></reply>

The deployment of the National Broadband Plan network is currently to provide access to high speed broadband to circa 540,000 premises across the State. The relevant premises are identified by Eircode and are represented as AMBER on my Department&rsquo;s High Speed Broadband Map. It is open to the Department within the NBP contract to increase or decrease the scope of the contract post-contract award where it is considered necessary to do so, for example to ensure on-going compliance with State Aid rules.</p>  <p>  The National Broadband Plan procurement process was run on a technology neutral basis and sought to elicit the best technical solution from participating bidders to address the market failure identified and deliver on the minimum technical specifications set down in the tender documents. In line with State Aid Guidelines, the solution proposed by the successful Bidder was based on the maximum reuse of existing infrastructure to the greatest extent possible, which under the final tender provided involves deployment of new fibre cable over existing eir poles and through existing eir ducts, as well as some new build where no existing infrastructure exists. </p>  <p>  The solution proposed at final tender was subject to a robust evaluation and was found to have met all the requirements set out since 2016. </p>  <p>  The network design put forward at final tender met and in some areas exceeded the minimum technical specifications set down in the tender requirements, including the requirement to provide concrete commitments around how the network will be future proofed to meet end user demand over at least the next 25 years. It was a critical part of the assessment that any network design and technical solution put forward by any Bidder provided the necessary assurance and confidence that this could be achieved over the medium to long term. These commitments are also contractually binding on the Bidder.</p></reply>

This can take some time in the case of IP applications, where additional medical evidence has been submitted in support of the appeal. In 2018, 322 cases were reviewed by a Deciding Officer in the appellant's favour, which meant that a full appeal was not required. Where the original decision is confirmed, a submission is prepared to explain the Deciding Officer's decisions and this submission is forwarded to the Social Welfare Appeals Office. This timeframe for this process can range from one week where no additional medical information is submitted with the appeal to up to a number of months for more complex cases where detailed additional medical information is received.</p>  <p>  At all times every effort is made to complete reviews and ensure, where necessary, that appeals proceed as quickly as possible. </p>  <p>  Anyone experiencing financial difficulties while awaiting a decision on a review or an appeal of any social welfare payment should contact their local Intreo Centre and enquire as to their entitlement to a payment under the Department's Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) scheme.</p>  <p>  The processing time of appeal outcomes is kept under continuous review and additional staff have been assigned to this work. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This included improved funding for on-site wastewater treatment systems (more commonly known as septic tanks).</p>  <p>  The composition of the new multi-annual programme is based on recommendations from the Working Group that I established in April 2018 to conduct a review of investment needs and rural water services.</p>  <p>  The new funding scheme for septic tanks will replace the grant which was brought into operation by the Domestic Waste Water Treatment System (Financial Assistance) Regulations 2013.  Under certain conditions, households can receive a grant to assist them in carrying out remediation, repair or upgrading works to, or replacement of, their individual domestic wastewater treatment system.</p>  <p>  In developing the necessary regulatory and administrative changes to underpin the revised grants scheme, my Department has over recent months consulted and met with key stakeholders, including the County and City Management Association, the Local Authority Waters and Communities Office and the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>  <p>  Work is at an advanced stage of development for the funding scheme. I expect that the process will be completed in the coming weeks when the necessary regulations dealing with the financial assistance arrangements and related administrative matters are put in place. This will enable a circular letter, terms and conditions, guidance and application form to issue to local authorities shortly thereafter.</p></reply>

While all publicly funded construction projects must comply with the Government&rsquo;s Capital Works Management Framework (CWMF), the objectives of which are to ensure cost certainty, value for money and financial accountability, my Department has streamlined the nine stages of review in the Framework, to just four for social housing construction projects.</p>  <p>  My Department   engages continuously with local authorities, including through the City and County Management Association (CCMA), on the various work processes associated with the delivery of housing projects, in line with Rebuilding Ireland commitments.  A review carried out jointly between my Department and the CCMA identified more precise target timelines for developing new social housing construction projects, including an overall target of 59 weeks from an initial proposal being brought forward, to placing the construction contract and starting on site.  This timeline compares favourably with private sector construction projects.</p>  <p>  The bulk of this time is assigned to the completion of essential local authority work in project design, developing costings and specifications, undertaking planning through the Part 8 process and the procurement of contractors; the time allotted to my Department for funding approvals is a small portion of the overall time involved.  In addition, projects are advanced in such a way as to allow other work to continue during the approval stages. </p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s engagement with the CCMA and with individual local authorities has also seen improvements around single-stage project approvals for smaller scale projects and in relation to rapid build projects. Communications on construction proposals have also been enhanced through quarterly technical meetings, which are held between individual local authorities and my Department.  Constructive input has been received from local authorities in identifying and implementing these process improvements and in working with my Department through the quarterly meetings, and in other fora, to review progress in respect of social housing projects and to clear any blockages as swiftly as possible. </p>  <p>  These arrangements demonstrate the Government's commitment to the accelerated delivery of new housing. My Department has no interest in unnecessarily prolonging the time involved in these approvals, other than to ensure compliance with Government-wide rules for capital project oversight.  We will continue to work with local authorities to ensure that projects are progressed efficiently, while also delivering high quality design and good value for money, in sustainable communities.</p></reply>

From time to time such properties may come onto the open market, may be bequeathed to the State or may be offered to it free of cost. In addition, lands surrounding or in proximity to heritage properties or national monuments in State care (i.e. incorporating the setting of the structure) often reside in private ownership. In certain cases, improved protection of the property or monument, or access to same, would be possible if the State was to acquire such additional lands. In all cases the Department would need to examine the potential acquisition carefully, taking into account the conservation needs of the property and Value for Money principles. </p>  <p>  My Department, in cooperation with the Office of Public Works, is, however, only in a position to acquire, maintain, conserve and present to the public a very limited number of properties and monuments such as that mentioned by the Deputy. While I am supportive of efforts to identify suitable future uses to safeguard historic buildings, crucial to their future is the identification of a viable use or uses with sufficient income to ensure their survival.  </p>  <p>  The national monuments in State care already number some one thousand sites at over 760 locations right across the country and these command considerable resource commitments in terms of both funding and personnel allocation.
