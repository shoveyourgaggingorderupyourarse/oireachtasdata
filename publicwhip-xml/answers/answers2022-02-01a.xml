This is reflected in the Programme for Government, which states that this Government will develop inclusive and age appropriate curricula for Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE) and Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) across primary and post-primary schools, including an inclusive programme on LGBTI+ relationships and making appropriate legislative changes, if necessary. </p>  <p>  SPHE is a mandatory curriculum subject in all primary schools and in post-primary Junior Cycle. RSE is required at all levels, from primary through to Senior Cycle. </p>  <p>  All schools are required to have an RSE policy that is developed in consultation with the school community, including school management, parents, teachers and students as appropriate. The school&rsquo;s programme for Relationship and Sexuality Education is developed and taught in the context of the school&rsquo;s RSE policy.  Schools are required to teach all aspects of the RSE programme, including family planning, sexually transmitted infections and sexual orientation. It is important to note that the ethos of the school should never preclude learners from acquiring the knowledge about these issues.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, following a review of RSE in schools across all stages of education the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) established two development groups, one for primary and one for post-primary, to oversee development work in this area.  </p>  <p>  The immediate focus of the NCCA work has been on creating support materials for teachers for publication online as part of an Interim Guidance Toolkit. The toolkit's purpose is to support effective teaching and learning of SPHE/RSE linked to the current curriculum and to provide guidance on how SPE/RSE may be approached in a comprehensive way that meets the needs of young people today.   The toolkits are available online and are being used by schools.</p>  <p>  These toolkits will be expanded during 2022 to include further age and stage appropriate guidance for teachers on how to address the important and sensitive topics within the SPHE classroom. </p>  <p>  In tandem with this work, preparation for the broader redeveloping and updating of the SPHE curriculum has begun. Updated curricula will be developed for Primary, Junior Cycle and Senior Cycle. It is expected that a revised Junior Cycle specification will be completed by the end of 2022, following a period of public consultation. Updated specifications for primary and senior cycle will follow immediately afterwards.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-02-01a.18.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020100065#WRD00500"><p>As the Deputy may be aware, for school planning purposes, my Department divides the country into 314 school planning areas and utilises a Geographical Information System to anticipate school place demand. Information from a range of sources, including Child Benefit data, school enrolment data and information on residential development activity is used for this purpose.  Additionally, Project Ireland 2040 population and housing targets inform my Department's projections of school place requirements.</p>  <p>  Having considered the projected requirements in each school planning area, my Department then makes an assessment of the existing capacity within that particular area and its ability to meet any increased demand.  </p>  <p>  Where data indicates that additional provision is required at primary or post primary level, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:</p>  <p>  &middot;Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,</p>  <p>  &middot;Extending the capacity of a school or schools,</p>  <p>  &middot;Provision of a new school or schools.</p>  <p>  My Department's projections of post primary school place requirements in East Cork show an anticipated continued growth in enrolments in the short- to medium-term. </p>  <p>  However, in response to projected future need and to enrolment pressures in the area, there has been significant capital investment by my Department at post primary schools in East Cork.  A new post primary school, Carrigtwohill Community College, was established in 2016.  A project to deliver a new, modern 1,000 pupil school building for that school is underway.  Additionally, an extension at St. Colman's Community College has been recently completed and a number of other large school building projects are also in train, delivering expanded capacity at St. Aloysius College, Midleton CBS, St. Mary's High School, Pobalscoil na Tr&iacute;on&oacute;ide in Youghal and Col&aacute;iste Mhuire in Cobh.</p>  <p>  While my Department is aware of increasing pressures and demand for additional school places in East Cork, it is important to note that where enrolment pressures arise, it may not be as a result of lack of accommodation but may be driven by the following factors:</p>  <p>  Duplication of applications &ndash; pupils have applied for a place to a number of schools in the area</p>  <p>  School of choice &ndash; pupils can&rsquo;t get a place in  their preferred school while there are places in other schools in the town/area</p>  <p>  Some towns/areas have single sex schools and while places are available in the school they are not available to all pupils</p>  <p>  External draw &ndash; pupils coming from outside the local area</p>  <p>  My Department is working to establish the true extent of any capacity issues through ongoing discussions with the relevant school authorities. In that context, similar to the process adopted in advance of the current academic year, my Department is engaging with patron bodies, including patrons of schools in East Cork areas, to identify particular capacity requirements for the forthcoming years which may necessitate further action to that already in train including, where required, the provision of modular accommodation solutions. </p>  <p>  I understand that principals of schools in the area have had a number of meetings to establish an overall picture of school place requirements for the next academic year.  My Department will continue to have close engagement with the relevant school patrons and authorities in order to monitor the situation and implement any solutions which may be required.</p>  <p>  Additionally, my Department will continue to work to advance the planned and current projects in East Cork and to ensure sufficient places for both mainstream provision and for pupils with special education requirements both for the coming academic year and into the future.</p></reply>

The outcome of which was that many allowances were no longer payable to many new public service entrants including &ldquo;new entrant&rdquo; teachers. </p>  <p>  Circular 8 of 2013 outlines the effect of this review on teachers. In common with a number of job-role based allowances, sanction for payment to new beneficiaries of the Island allowance was withdrawn from 1st February 2012 under the terms of the Circular. Furthermore, if a teacher was eligible for receipt of the allowance prior to 1st February 2012 and subsequently left that job role on a voluntary basis, their entitlement to the allowance ceases from the date of the move and they cannot re-gain entitlement.</p>  <p>  Additional amendments to teacher terms and conditions, including pay and allowances, may be achieved through engagement and collective bargaining agreements between the Government and the public service unions. </p>  <p>  My colleague, the Minister for Rural and Community Development is overseeing the development of an Islands policy with the aim of providing a coordinated Departmental response to address the socio-economic and structural needs of island communities.  In that context my Department is contributing to the process with the aim of supporting effective delivery of education on the islands.   </p></reply>

This significant investment allows us to move forward with certainty on our ambitious plans and deliver high quality building projects, with a real focus on sustainability, for school communities across Ireland.</p><p>The key drivers of capital investment in the schools sector are as follows:</p><p>demographic change, </p><p>alignment with housing provision and national planning at school planning area level, </p><p>construction costs,</p><p>catch-up to address legacy of underinvestment; and </p><p>climate action objectives including deep energy retrofit. </p><p>My Department has a large pipeline of projects for delivery under the school building programme. The main elements of this pipeline currently involve in excess of 1,200 school building projects for delivery under the Department&rsquo;s Large Scale and Additional Accommodation Scheme. These projects are currently in progress across the various stages of planning, design, tender and construction . </p><p>There are currently in excess of 250 school building projects at construction (on site) with a continuous stream of other projects at or near the tendering stage. Most of which are expected to be either under construction or completed in the period up to 2025 and are being progressed as quickly as possible.</p><p>This investment will build on the good progress being made on adding capacity to cater for demographic changes and provision for children with special educational needs. This investment will also facilitate an increased focus on the modernisation of existing school stock and help transition the school system for an era of net zero carbon by 2050.</p><p>During the period 2018 to 2021 691 school building projects were completed under the Large Scale Capital Programme (LSCP) and the Additional School Accommodation Scheme (ASA).  These projects delivered in excess of 64,000 school places. </p><p>It is anticipated that 150 to 200 school building projects will be completed annually during the 2022 to 2025 period.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-02-01a.27.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020100065#WRD01400"><p>I wish to assure the Deputy that the provision of appropriate accommodation for pupils with special edcuation needs is an absolute priority for Minister Madigan and myself.  This is in two respects: firstly in ensuring that there is sufficient provision for pupils with special education needs and secondly in designing school accommodation that meets the needs of all users - students and staff - and enhances the learning experience.</p><p>In order to make accommodation provision to meet the needs of students with special education requirements, my Department has close engagement with the National Council for Special Education which has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide.  When the NCSE sanction a special class in a school, the school can apply to my Department for capital funding to re-configure existing spaces within the school building to accommodate the class or to construct additional accommodation.  Similarly, where special schools wish to expand provision, the school can apply to my Department for capital funding to accommodate additional placements.</p><p>The NCSE has additionally provided my Department with projections of future requirements for classes for students with special education requirements.  These are informing my Department's advance planning for special class accommodation.</p><p>This advance planning is building on the significant work to date in delivering additional classrooms for students with special education needs.  There are currently over 1,200 further school building projects in train which are expected to deliver circa 1,800 permanent special classrooms.</p><p>Such classrooms for pupils with special education needs are included as standard in the accommodation brief for new school buildings and major extension projects, unless local circumstances indicate that they will not be required. Typically, two classrooms for pupils with special education needs are provided in new primary schools and four classrooms are provided in new 1,000 pupil post primary schools, with pro-rata provision for schools of other sizes.  The overall accommodation suite for students with special education needs would also generally include ancillary accommodation such as a Central Activities Space, Multi Activity Room and Quiet Spaces as well as an outdoor Secure Play Area and Sensory Garden. </p><p>In addition to the specific accommodation provision for students with special education needs, the principles of universal design are embedded in all of my Department's technical guidance for school building projects, for the benefit of all school building users.  A suite of such Technical Guidance Documents is published on my Department's website at <i>www.gov.ie</i>. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-02-01a.30.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1472" speakername="Josepha Madigan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020100065#WRD01700"><p>Enabling children with special educational needs to receive an education is a priority for this Government.  </p><p>This year, my Department will spend in excess of &euro;2 Billion, or over 25% of the Department&rsquo;s budget on providing a wide range of schemes and supports for children with special educational needs. </p><p>This includes additional teaching and care supports. </p><p>As a result, the number of special education teachers, special needs assistants and special class and school places are at unprecedented levels. </p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide. </p><p>Throughout 2020 and 2021, my Department and the NCSE have worked closely on a more streamlined and joined up planning process which has ensured a targeted approach to meet demand for special needs placements ahead of each new school-year </p><p>I am satisfied that this more joined up approach is delivering. Through this intensive intervention, we have seen an additional 301 special classes, providing over 1,800 new places, opened nationwide for the 2021/22 school-year. </p><p>I also acknowledge that notwithstanding the extent of this investment, there are some parts of the country where increases in population and other issues have led to concerns regarding a shortage of school places.</p><p>NCSE has well established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents and seeks to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special class placements. </p><p>In terms of the area specifically referenced by the Deputy, I can confirm that there are currently 35 special classes in the Dublin Mid-West area of which 28 are at primary level and 7 at post primary level. 4 of these classes have been established in the current school year. These special classes provide 211 placements for students with special educational needs. </p><p>I can also confirm that the NCSE is aware of an identified need for additional special classes for students with autism in primary and post-primary schools in the Dublin area generally. Work has been underway with stakeholders for a number of years to meet the demand for places.</p><p>We are always grateful to those schools that have responded, and continue to respond positively to meet the educational needs of children in their communities.</p><p>NCSE is continuing to engage with schools in Dublin regarding the establishment of additional special classes for 2022/23 and beyond. There are specific plans in place to open additional special classes and every support will be made available to progress their opening in the shortest possible timeframe with a particular focus on September next. </p><p>It is of course open to any school to engage with the NCSE to establish a special class. </p><p>I want to reassure the Deputy that my Department will continue to support the NCSE and schools through the provision of the necessary funding and capital investment to ensure all children are successful in accessing an education. </p></reply>

It was decided that priority would be given to the development of a training programme for SNAs who may not have had a recent opportunity to access a training programme tailored to their role.</p><p>The first national training programme for SNAs is now in place and it aims to enhance the knowledge, skills and expertise of SNAs whose work is central to the inclusion of students with additional care and complex needs in school life. The programme is fully funded by my Department and delivered at no cost to the SNA.</p><p>There are 3,500 places available on the online programme over 4 years.  Each phase of the programme has been fully subscribed to date. 500 have completed the programme and a new cohort of 1,000 commenced the programme last September.</p><p>As this is the first programme, it is appropriate to take the time to review outcomes and this will inform the future approach to ongoing training and professional development of SNAs. Part of that consideration will include accreditation.</p><p>Raising the minimum qualification for appointment as a special needs assistant has been raised by the FORSA union and has been referred to the Workplace Relations Commission.  My Department is engaging in that process.</p><p>The recruitment and appointment of Special Needs Assistants is a matter for each individual school authority. In addition, the actual requirements for a post will vary depending on the specific needs of the children and the school to which the SNA is to be appointed. My Department does not believe that the existing minimum qualifications has impacted on the calibre of person appointed and it is also the case that people with experience and/or higher qualifications than the minimum are often the successful candidate in competitions held by schools.</p><p>However, having considered the claim and, in particular, the period of time since they were set, my Department is open to reviewing the entry requirements for SNAs. My Department has also agreed to a review of the SNA contract which was agreed as part of the Building Momentum national pay agreement.My Department is prioritising the contract review and this will be followed by a review of the entry qualifications.</p><p>II am satisfied that the approach outlined fully recognises the important place of SNAs in our schools.  The forthcoming review of the SNA contract along with the new training programme for SNAs that is now in place will help to enhance the experience of children with special needs in our schools.</p></reply>

Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE) is required at all levels, from primary through to Senior Cycle. Topics covered at post-primary include: sexual harassment; healthy and unhealthy relationships; consent; domestic gender-based and sexual violence; dating violence and rape.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to the development of inclusive and age appropriate curricula for RSE and SPHE.</p>  <p>  Following a review of RSE in schools across all stages of education the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) established two development groups, one for primary and one for post-primary, to oversee development work in this area.  </p>  <p>  The immediate focus of the NCCA work has been on creating support materials for teachers as part of an online Interim Guidance Toolkit. The toolkit will support effective teaching and learning of SPHE/RSE linked to the current curriculum and provide guidance on how SPHE/RSE may be approached in a comprehensive way that meets the needs of young people today.  There are resources to help teachers in teaching about rights and responsibilities in relationships, how to recognise healthy, unhealthy and abusive relationship, how to interact safely and respectfully the influence of the media on young people's understanding and expectations, sexual consent and assertive communication.</p>  <p>  In tandem with this work, preparation for the broader redeveloping and updating of the SPHE curriculum has begun. Updated curricula will be developed for Primary, Junior Cycle and Senior Cycle.  </p>  <p>  Consent education will be included within the learning outcomes for RSE, across all levels, based on the principle that consent is a core dimension of all healthy interpersonal relationships.</p>  <p>  Secondly, I have announced a review of the 2013 Action Plan on Bullying action plan and procedures on bullying.  This review will take account of developments and relevant research since the action plan and procedures were published and will specifically consider areas such as cyber bullying and gender identity bullying and sexual harassment. </p>  <p>  The review will also give detailed consideration to the recommendations contained in the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science Report on School Bullying and the Impact on Mental Health which was published in August 2021.</p>  <p>  The review will involve significant consultation and collaboration across my Department, with other Government Departments and Bodies including the Ombudsman for Children, and will also involve consultation with a broad range of education stakeholders, including parents and students.</p></reply>

Updated guidance for schools on Practical Steps for the Deployment of Good Ventilation Practices in Schools was provided at the end of May following the work of an expert group that carefully considered the role of ventilation in managing COVID-19. The updated guidance for schools is also fully in line with the most recent guidance on non-healthcare building ventilation during COVID-19, published by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre November 2021.    </p>  <p>  To provide additional support in the context of Covid-19 the payment of a minor works grant totalling &euro;45m for primary schools and special schools, plus a once-off Covid-19 minor works funding of &euro;17m for post-primary schools, was issued in December 2021. All recognised schools in the free scheme have received their grants.    </p>  <p>  Given that each school setting is different, individual schools are best placed to decide how best to use this funding to address their particular needs. Specialist advice/assistance of a Chartered Engineer or Registered Architect is an important source of support for schools.  This will help ensure that appropriate solutions are being put in place to address ventilation issues including advice on whether a HEPA Air Cleaner Unit is required to deal with a poorly ventilated room.  There is no one solution that fits all scenarios, each application requires bespoke analysis and selection of the appropriate unit(s) matched to the specific room size and volume.   </p>  <p>  Air cleaning devices are not a substitute for good ventilation but can be considered pending the completion of interventions/works where poor ventilation persists. This is line with the Expert Group recommendations. Air filtration does not negate the need for natural ventilation and opening windows as required. Furthermore Mike Ryan of the World Health Organisation&rsquo;s Health Emergencies Programme has advised that schools not rely solely on air filters.   </p>  <p>  In the case where a school has difficulty engaging a Chartered Engineer or Registered  Architect the Department can assist, with a dedicated ventilation team  available to support school principals in this regard.  Schools that identify inadequate ventilation in a room can utilise their minor work grant or apply for emergency works grant assistance to address ventilation enhancements where the minor work grant does not cover the full cost of the works required.   </p>  <p>  To date 19 schools have applied for additional funding under the emergency works scheme to assist with ventilation. Of these, 12 have been approved, 2 were returned to the school to review the scope of the application, 2 were incorrectly classified as ventilation related and assessed separately, 2 were rejected as the application form was not fully completed and 1 is currently being assessed by a member of the Department&rsquo;s technical team.

Where a school employs a staff member to support those functions those staff are employees of individual schools and responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school.</p>  <p>  The Department with school management bodies have been engaging with F&oacute;rsa on a claim on terms and conditions for grant-funded school secretaries and caretakers.  On the 27th of October 2020, under the auspices of the WRC, an understanding was agreed on a pathway to progress the issues. Several key strands were identified, and a phased approach is being taken to the development of proposals. </p>  <p>  Following intensive discussions at the WRC on 13th September 2021, there was significant progress in this dispute. Subject to agreement on all elements of the claim, the Department has offered to move School Secretaries&rsquo; pay rates to a scale which is aligned with the Clerical Officer Grade III pay scale on a pro rata basis according to a secretary&rsquo;s current working pattern. The Department has also offered to improve the conditions for School Secretaries with regard to sick leave, annual leave and maternity provisions for this cohort of staff.</p>  <p>  Further dialogue has taken place between the parties on these issues since 13 September with the aim of reaching an overall agreement. The talks continue, most recently at a meeting at the WRC on 26 January; the parties are to meet again next month, following reflection on the matters discussed at that meeting.</p>  <p>  I welcome the continued engagement between the parties and I encourage all stakeholders to focus on finalising an agreement.   </p></reply>

It is expected that the enrolment pressures in North Dublin, and in other areas will reduce in the short-term as such planned additional capacity comes on stream and as demographic demand moves past its peak.  In terms of projects, there has been significant investment under the Major Capital Programme in the North Dublin area in recent years. Bremore ET, Balbriggan has a new school building for 1,000 pupils completed in 2018. Col&aacute;iste Glor na Mara, also in Balbriggan was completed in 2019 and also has accommodation for 1,000 pupils. In addition there are 13 other major projects at post primary level in the North Dublin area, including at Belmayne, Malahide, Portmarnock, Swords, Dublin 15 and Rush which are at various stages of the design and build process, and will greatly contribute to the supply of school places in the area.</p><p>Additionally, the Capital Programme also provides for devolved funding for additional classrooms, including accommodation for pupils with special educational needs, if required, for schools where an additional enrolment need has been identified.  </p><p>Included among additional accommodation projects are Dominican College, Drumcondra, Col&aacute;iste Dh&uacute;laigh, Coolock and Santa Sabina Dominican College, Sutton. Clonturk Community College has been approved a significant amount of modular accommodation to cater for their needs. St. Aidan&rsquo;s, Whitehall has also been approved for a significant project, which has been devolved to the school authorities for delivery. My Department is also engaging with school authorities at Castleknock Community College and Luttrelstown Community College in order to consider their accommodation needs. </p></reply>

Updated guidance for schools on Practical Steps for the Deployment of Good Ventilation Practices in Schools was provided at the end of May following the work of an expert group that carefully considered the role of ventilation in managing COVID-19. The updated guidance for schools is also fully in line with the most recent guidance on non-healthcare building ventilation during COVID-19, published by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre November 2021.    </p>  <p>  To provide additional support in the context of Covid-19 the payment of a minor works grant totalling &euro;45m for primary schools and special schools, plus a once-off Covid-19 minor works funding of &euro;17m for post-primary schools, was issued in December 2021. All recognised schools in the free scheme have received their grants.    </p>  <p>  Given that each school setting is different, individual schools are best placed to decide how best to use this funding to address their particular needs. Specialist advice/assistance of a Chartered Engineer or Registered Architect is an important source of support for schools.  This will help ensure that appropriate solutions are being put in place to address ventilation issues including advice on whether a HEPA Air Cleaner Unit is required to deal with a poorly ventilated room.  There is no one solution that fits all scenarios, each application requires bespoke analysis and selection of the appropriate unit(s) matched to the specific room size and volume. The requirement for air cleaners in schools will depend on advices provided to schools by their Architect/Engineer. As part of contingency planning, the Department has put arrangements in place for a small reserve of air cleaners to facilitate quick deployment to any primary or post-primary school which has an immediate need and has been unsuccessful in sourcing locally.    </p>  <p>  Air cleaning devices are not a substitute for good ventilation but can be considered pending the completion of interventions/works where poor ventilation persists. This is line with the Expert Group recommendations. Air filtration does not negate the need for natural ventilation and opening windows as required. Furthermore Mike Ryan of the World Health Organisation&rsquo;s Health Emergencies Programme has advised that schools not rely solely on air filters.   </p>  <p>  In the case where a school has difficulty engaging a Chartered Engineer or Registered  Architect the Department can assist, with a dedicated ventilation team  available to support school principals in this regard.  Schools that identify inadequate ventilation in a room can utilise their minor work grant or apply for emergency works grant assistance to address ventilation enhancements where the minor work grant does not cover the full cost of the works required.   </p></reply>

The Schools Reconfiguration process, along with approaches such as the patronage divesting process, voluntary reassignments of patronage under Section 8 of the Education Act 1998 and the patronage process for new schools, which includes consideration of parental preferences for different types of school patron, will contribute to the achievement of this target.  In recent years there has been progress towards increasing the numbers of multi-denominational primary schools with the vast majority of new primary schools established to cater for demographic demand in the last decade having a multi-denominational ethos.</p>  <p>  The Schools Reconfiguration for Diversity process, supporting transfers of schools to multi-denominational patrons in response to the wishes of local families, has been developed in order to accelerate the delivery of multi-denominational schools across the country.  This Reconfiguration process involves the transfer of existing live schools as opposed to the amalgamation and/or closure model of the patronage divesting process.</p>  <p>  The &ldquo;Early Movers&rdquo; provision of the schools reconfiguration process enables school communities that have already decided to seek a transfer of patronage to engage with their school patron on the matter. A patron may transfer patronage under section 8 of the Education Act 1998.  A number of patronage changes have taken place in recent years in this context, resulting in the provision of an additional 11 multi-denominational Community National Schools (three of which already had a multi-denominational ethos). In addition in 2021, an Irish-medium gaelscoil transferred patronage from its Catholic patron to An Foras P&aacute;tr&uacute;nachta. This school now offers parents of junior infants the choice of undertaking an Ethics and Morality Programme or a Catholic Programme.</p>  <p>  In September 2022 another planned primary school patronage transfer, from Catholic patronage to the local Education and Training Board, to become a multi-denominational Community National School is expected to take place. </p>  <p>  The Department of Education has been engaging with representatives of the Irish Episcopal Conference (Catholic bishops) as the majority patron of schools nationwide with a view to developing an agreed approach to the next phase of the reconfiguration process.</p>  <p>  School communities who wish to explore the potential to transfer patronage should contact their school patron in the first instance.</p></reply>

My Department&rsquo;s approach to supporting wellbeing and mental health of young people is set out in its Wellbeing Policy Statement and Framework for Practice first published in 2018 and refreshed in 2019.  The approach proposed is a whole school and preventative approach which has multiple components that include providing children and young people with opportunities to:</p>  <p>-  build core social and emotional skills and competencies</p>  <p>-  experience supportive relationships within the school setting</p>  <p>-  be part of a school environment and culture that feels both physically and psychologically safe, in which they feel a sense of belonging and connectedness, that their voice is heard, and they feel supported</p>  <p>  Embedded in the whole-school approach is the recognition that members of the school community may have different needs at different times and that a continuum of support in relation to wellbeing should be made available.</p>  <p>  A broad range of supports, resources and professional learning opportunities are being provided to support schools to promote and support wellbeing and resilience by the Department&rsquo;s support services.  The services support schools to provide strong universal support at the level of whole school and classroom, more targeted support for some children and young people who may be at risk, and more individualised support for those with greatest need.  </p>  <p>  Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) which is mandatory in primary schools and up to Junior Cycle provides specific opportunities to enable a young person to understand himself or herself, to develop healthy relationships and to establish and maintain healthy patterns of behaviour.</p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) provides educational psychological support to all primary and post-primary schools. This involves direct support in the event of a critical incident, access to national and regional support and development work to build school capacity to support students, access to a NEPS psychologist for responses to queries arising, and access to individual pupil casework where there is need via a NEPS psychologist.</p>  <p>  NEPS, in common with many other psychological services and best international practice, has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. </p>  <p>  The NEPS Support and Development service, reaching an estimated 25,000 teachers annually, is an applied psychological service for school staff to help build their capability to respond to the wellbeing, academic, social and emotional needs of all students, and particularly those who are experiencing barriers to their wellbeing, learning, inclusion and participation. Professional learning activities to support children/young people with social/emotional/mental health difficulties and to promote positive wellbeing in school include:</p>  <p>FRIENDS: Training teachers in the delivery of the FRIENDS programmes (&lsquo;Fun Friends&rsquo;, &lsquo;Friends for Life&rsquo; and &lsquo;My Friends Youth&rsquo;), which are evidence-based anxiety prevention and resilience building programmes, which foster self-concept and a sense of school belonging using Cognitive Behavioural Therapeutically-informed approaches. Friends programmes help students to develop resilience by teaching them effective strategies to cope with, problem solve and manage all kinds of emotional distress, including worry, stress, change and anxiety. The Incredible Years Teacher Classroom Management programme is an evidence-based programme that equips teachers to manage their classrooms effectively to prevent and reduce behavioural problems while promoting children&rsquo;s wellbeing and emotional and social competence. Since Covid-19 the training has been adapted to online format which increases accessibility for teachers. </p>  <p>  NEPS has developed a range of workshops on the promotion of wellbeing and resilience in schools which include upskilling school staff on the use and implementation of therapeutically-informed approaches in schools.  These include trauma-informed approaches, approaches based on the principles of cognitive behaviour therapy, and attachment-aware approaches. The approaches outlined in the workshops are based on research findings, on the experience of experts in their fields and on the experience of practicing psychologists working in schools. The workshops will be available to build the capability of school staff in both primary and post-primary settings, including for school leaders, teachers and SNAs. </p>  <p>  Post primary schools have recently received a copy of new Student Support Team Guidelines.  A Student Support Team is a student-focused mechanism put in place by a school in order to co-ordinate the support available for students in the school and to facilitate links to the community and other non-school support services. NEPS provides support to post primary schools in the setting up or review of Student Support Teams.  </p>  <p>  Also at post primary level, counselling is a key part of the role of the Guidance Counsellor, offered on an individual or group basis as part of a developmental learning process, at moments of personal crisis but also at key transition points. The Guidance Counsellor also identifies and supports the referral of students to external counselling agencies and professionals, as required. Each post primary school currently receives an allocation in respect of guidance provision, calculated by reference to the approved enrolment.  </p>  <p>  Wellbeing resources and supports for Leaving Certificate students are also available.</p>  <p>  My Department has built strong links with the Department of Health and both Departments are exploring ways to improve supports for young people, including around increased awareness, promoting help-seeking behaviour and sign-posting to the wide range of available services.  </p></reply>

Following on from this meeting, I met with the members of the advisory group on a bilateral basis and also had further engagement with each of them thereafter.  I have listened carefully to what each of these stakeholders has had to say and examined each of their points. </p>  <p>  Following consideration of this matter by Government today, I announced the decision: to operate an examinations  approach for Leaving Certificate in 2022, with significant further adjustments to the examinations; and to provide students with a commitment that the overall results of Leaving Certificate 2022 will not be lower than in 2021. As the Deputy may be aware, it would not have been possible to run Accredited Grades in the same manner as last year, as Junior Cycle data was unavailable for 25% of our students. </p>  <p>  The further extensive changes I have announced to the examination papers, over and above those announced in August 2021, mean that candidates: have greater choice in the papers; have less questions to answer; and still have the same amount of time as in a normal year to complete the examination. For example, in mathematics on each paper, instead of having to answer all ten questions, candidates will only have to answer six.</p>  <p>  This is in addition to previously announced changes, such as the running of the Leaving Certificate Oral Examinations and Music Practical over the first week of the Easter Break. </p>  <p>  Timeframes for certain assessment elements of the Leaving Certificate Applied examinations have also been pushed out. Schools were also reminded of the flexibilities regarding the dates for completion and authentication of examination Coursework.</p>  <p>  I have also confirmed that Junior Cycle examinations will take place this summer. Adjustments to the assessment arrangements for Junior Cycle were published in August 2021 and provide for more teaching time in schools. They include a reduction in the number of Classroom Based Assessments to be completed, the removal of the requirement to complete Assessment Tasks, and adjustments to the requirements in coursework and practical performance tests.</p>  <p>  I believe that the decision announced will provide Leaving Certificate students of 2022 with an opportunity for their learning and attainment at the end of their post-primary education to be assessed, and will enable them to progress to the next stage of their lives. It also provides the certainty and clarity in this matter that had been requested by schools and parents.</p></reply>

In addition Leaving Certificate Computer Science has been available nationally as of September 2020. The NCCA is seeking to ensure that the development of the new specifications for Leaving Certificate Physics, Chemistry and Biology will address the need to widen the appeal of the subjects in order to meet the targets of the STEM Education Policy Statement and re-balance gender uptakes.</p>  <p>   An advisory group, set up by my Department, has developed a set of recommendations in relation to Gender Balance in STEM in order to ensure improving gender balance, equity and inclusion for our young people. The implementation of the policy statement is already seeing favourable increases in relation to the numbers of schools offering STEM subjects other than mathematics and science. For example girls only schools offering more STEM subjects have increased from 55.7% to 63.3% between 2019 and 2020. The publication and implementation of the gender balance in STEM recommendations will ensure further improvements in the uptake of STEM subjects at post primary level. </p>  <p>  It is of utmost importance to provide our young people and their families with awareness of STEM education, the opportunities that exists and to ensure that they can see themselves in these STEM careers. Some of my Department&rsquo;s work in this area includes ongoing support of informal STEM education such as IWish, BT Young Scientist and Technology, Scifest and my Department&rsquo;s new partnership with Science Blast. Other work includes an ongoing STEM awareness campaign in conjunction with Science Foundation Ireland. </p>  <p>  Development of the second STEM Education implementation plan is underway which will guide implementation from 2022-2026. A public consultation has taken place from 17th December 2021 to 26th January 2022 with further consultations with education partners and stakeholders planned in the coming weeks. The new implementation plan will incorporate monitoring and review of the existing implementation plan and will allow actions to be revised and developed in line with identified needs. In addition to the priorities identified through this consultation the implementation plan will also be informed by the Gender balance in STEM recommendations and STEM and the Arts recommendations which are being developed at present.</p></reply>

These measures have worked very effectively to prevent and control Covid-19 in schools and to protect students, their parents and school staff. Public Health have confirmed that there is no change to infection prevention and control measures in place in schools at this time, but that they will be reviewed by mid-term in February</p>  <p>  The Covid-19 capitation grant continues to be the mechanism through which funding will be provided for school costs related to the implementation of infection prevention and control measures. More than &euro;158 million of additional capitation funding has been made available to primary and post primary schools to provide for cleaning, PPE and hand hygiene, enhanced supervision and employment of an aide for the school year 2020/21. The Department of Education has committed to ensuring that the full range of measures necessary to allow schools operate safely in the Covid-19 environment will continue to be available for the 2021/22 school year and has provided a further &euro;109 million to date for Terms 1 and 2 of the 2021/22 school year.  </p>  <p>  At primary level, additional management resources for principal release days were provided for Principals and Deputy Principals. Teacher Supply panels were also expanded to cover the majority of primary schools nationwide, with an additional 200 teaching posts added following a review resulting in approximately 680 teaching posts on these panels available to provide substitute cover in schools. </p>  <p>  At post primary level over 1000 teaching posts were provided to support social distancing within classrooms, to provide for enhanced supervision arrangements in order to manage and prevent congregation of large groups of students and ensure the careful movement in a socially distant manner to classes for specialist subjects where it is neither practical nor possible to remain in the classroom. This funding also included additional posts for guidance provision.</p>  <p>  Antigen tests are also made available to children in a primary school pod by the Department of Health and the HSE, where a child in the pod is a confirmed case of COVID-19. The tests will be sent to the children&rsquo;s parents.</p>  <p>  Parents and Guardians of a primary school child, who is a confirmed case of COVID-19 following a PCR test, are asked to inform their school&rsquo;s principal. The school principal will then inform the parents of other children in the pod of a confirmed case. No personal details of the child will be shared. These parents will be provided with the option to receive free antigen tests for their child, which they will be able to order for delivery to their home.   </p>  <p>  Managing ventilation is just one of a suite of public health measures in place to keep our schools safe. Updated guidance for schools on Practical Steps for the Deployment of Good Ventilation Practices in Schools was provided at the end of May following the work of an expert group that carefully considered the role of ventilation in managing COVID-19. The updated guidance for schools is also fully in line with the most recent guidance on non-healthcare building ventilation during COVID-19, published by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre November 2021.  </p>  <p>  To provide additional support in the context of Covid-19 the payment of a minor works grant totalling &euro;45m for primary schools and special schools, plus a once-off Covid-19 minor works funding of &euro;17m for post-primary schools, was issued in December 2021.  </p>  <p>  Given that each school setting is different, individual schools are best placed to decide how best to use this funding to address their particular needs. Specialist advice/assistance of a Chartered Engineer or Registered Architect is an important source of support for schools.  This will help ensure that appropriate solutions are being put in place to address ventilation issues including advice on whether a HEPA Air Cleaner Unit is required to deal with a poorly ventilated room.  There is no one solution that fits all scenarios, each application requires bespoke analysis and selection of the appropriate unit(s) matched to the specific room size and volume. </p></reply>

There is no one solution that fits all scenarios, each application requires bespoke analysis and selection of the appropriate unit(s) matched to the specific room size and volume. The requirement for air cleaners in schools will depend on advices provided to schools by their Architect/Engineer. As part of contingency planning, the Department has put arrangements in place for a small reserve of air cleaners to facilitate quick deployment to any primary or post-primary school which has an immediate need and has been unsuccessful in sourcing locally. </p>  <p>  Air cleaning devices are not a substitute for good ventilation but can be considered pending the completion of interventions/works where poor ventilation persists. This is line with the Expert Group recommendations. Air filtration does not negate the need for natural ventilation and opening windows as required. Furthermore Mike Ryan of the World Health Organization&rsquo;s Health Emergencies Programme has advised that schools not rely solely on air filters.</p>  <p>  In the case where a school has difficulty engaging a Chartered Engineer or Registered  Architect the Department can assist, with a dedicated ventilation team  available to support school principals in this regard.  Schools that identify inadequate ventilation in a room can utilise their minor work grant or apply for emergency works grant assistance to address ventilation enhancements where the minor work grant does not cover the full cost of the works required.</p></reply>

Following on from this meeting, I met with the members of the advisory group on a bilateral basis and also had further engagement with each of them thereafter.  I have listened carefully to what each of these stakeholders has had to say and examined each of their points. </p>  <p>  My Department and the SEC have sought, through various measures, to take account of the disruption to learning experienced by students. These include adjustments to the assessment arrangements for the 2022 examinations that were announced in August 2021. The adjustments were designed to take account both of the disruption to learning experienced by students in the early part of 2021, as well as providing for some possible further disruption in 2021/22.</p>  <p>  Under revised arrangements put in place for the completion of Junior Cycle Classroom Based Assessments (CBAs) for students who are in 3rd year, each student must now complete a minimum of one CBA in each subject, instead of the usual two. The latest date for completion of CBA1 for most subjects was extended into the 2021/22 school year.  Students will not be required to complete Assessment Tasks for the relevant subjects.  </p>  <p>  These changes to the national assessment arrangements were made with due regard for the principles of equity, fairness and integrity, as these principles apply to assessment and examinations. The changes provide reassurance to students, their parents/guardians, teachers and schools. The assessment arrangements also provide progression opportunities for students who intend to pursue paths outside of school after Junior Cycle, such as those who may enter apprenticeships.</p>  <p>  It is also planned that the Junior Cycle Music practical performance test and the Home Economics practical test will take place during school time as normal.</p>  <p>  I am continuing to engage with stakeholders on all matters relating to the examinations. At the meeting of the Advisory Group last Thursday week a number of updates were received from group members, including reports of emerging and final results from surveys that members had conducted. It was agreed that the members of the group would reflect on the contributions made at the meeting, and that engagement would continue between myself and the various stakeholders on a bilateral basis. This engagement has been continuing since late last week, over the weekend and into this week, with a view to reaching an appropriate solution which responds to the concerns and issues that have been raised. A further meeting of the Advisory Group will be held and I am working towards a decision in relation to the examinations being made as soon as reasonably practicable.</p></reply>

At the pre-planning meeting for the interim accommodation currently on the site, the Local Authority made it clear that the planning application for the permanent accommodation must be cognisant of the overall development plans by the landowner for their wider land holding.

A planning application was recently submitted for the additional interim accommodation which the school will require for the 2022/23 academic year.</p>  <p>  A decision by the Local Authority on the planning application for the further interim accommodation for 2022/23 must be secured before planning can be submitted for the school's permanent accommodation.

I am aware that it is a key objective of the Department of Further and Higher Education to ensure that there is access into either further or higher education for each person who wishes to pursue educational options at third-level. </p>  <p>  In regard to the Leaving Certificate, I would draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to the fact that the Leaving Certificate&rsquo;s primary function is to provide students with evidence of their learning in senior cycle at post-primary level. It may facilitate entry to higher education by being used by the Higher Education Institutions for that purpose, it is also used by other students to pursue other options such as training, apprenticeships and employment.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that between 2016 and 2020 the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) undertook an extensive review of Senior Cycle programmes and vocational pathways. The NCCA&rsquo;s Advisory Report on the Senior Cycle has been submitted to my Department for consideration. The review involved a very broad range of research, consultations and communications with a wide range of stakeholders, including the union referred to by the Deputy, on all aspects of review and redevelopment over a number of phases over the period of the review.</p>  <p>  The Advisory Report maps out an ambitious programme of work, which would enable the development and construction of the components that would make up a Framework for Senior Cycle and will involve further ongoing stakeholder engagement and consultation. This will also mean changes for the Leaving Certificate itself, and under the work of Senior Cycle Reform we will seek to capture the full range of skills and aptitudes of students.</p>  <p>  I am aware of the desire in the education community and more generally that the NCCA Advisory Report be published but we must first complete our consideration of the Report. I am currently focusing on what the implementation of the Report would involve and what we can do to best ensure the further evolution of Senior Cycle. My officials and I have been considering the Report carefully, with a view to delivering a Senior Cycle programme that meets the needs of the students of today and the future, and the Report will be published once those considerations are complete.  </p></reply>

These actions focus on support for schools, teacher training, research and awareness raising and aim to ensure that all forms of bullying, including cyberbullying, are addressed. </p>  <p>  As part of the implementation of the Action Plan anti-bullying procedures for all primary and post primary schools, which include a specific reference to cyberbullying, were published at the beginning of the 2013/14 school year. The procedures are designed to give direction and guidance to school authorities and school personnel in preventing and tackling school-based bullying behaviour amongst its pupils and in dealing with any negative impact within school of bullying behaviour that occurs elsewhere. They include specific requirements in relation to the use of prevention and education strategies and the consistent investigation, follow up and recording of bullying behaviour.</p>  <p>  My Department provides extensive training and curricular supports through the Social Personal Health Education (SPHE) curriculum The Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) and The Webwise Programme to assist schools in the development of policies and practices on the safe use of the internet and on the prevention of bullying including cyber-bullying.</p>  <p>  On the 19th January I provided an update to Cabinet on the measures to tackle and prevent bullying in schools including progress in relation to anti-bullying work currently being delivered by my Department and the commencement of a review of both the 2013 Action Plan on Bullying and the 2013 Anti-bullying procedures for Primary and Post-Primary schools. This review will take account of developments and relevant research since the action plan and procedures were published in 2013 and will specifically consider areas such as cyber bullying, gender identity bullying and sexual harassment. </p>  <p>  The review will also give detailed consideration to the recommendations contained in the Oireachtas Joint Committee Report on School Bullying and the Impact on Mental Health. </p>  <p>  It will involve significant consultation and collaboration across my Department, with other Government Departments and Bodies including the Ombudsman for Children, and will also involve consultation with a broad range of education stakeholders, including parents and students. </p>  <p>  The Steering Committee for the review consists of senior officials from within my Department, including the Inspectorate and the National Educational Psychological Service, the National Parents Council Primary, National Parents Council Post-Primary, Irish Second Level Students Union, the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, the National Anti-bullying Research Centre in DCU and other external experts and representatives of advocacy organisations.  </p></reply>

Following on from this meeting, I met with the members of the advisory group on a bilateral basis and also had further engagement with each of them thereafter.  I have listened carefully to what each of these stakeholders has had to say and examined each of their points. </p>  <p>  Following consideration of this matter by Government today, I announced the decision: to operate an examinations  approach for Leaving Certificate in 2022, with significant further adjustments to the examinations; and to provide students with a commitment that the overall results of Leaving Certificate 2022 will not be lower than in 2021. As the Deputy may be aware, it would not have been possible to run Accredited Grades in the same manner as last year, as Junior Cycle data was unavailable for 25% of our students. </p>  <p>  The further extensive changes I have announced to the examination papers, over and above those announced in August 2021, mean that candidates: have greater choice in the papers; have less questions to answer; and still have the same amount of time as in a normal year to complete the examination. For example, in mathematics on each paper, instead of having to answer all ten questions, candidates will only have to answer six.</p>  <p>  This is in addition to previously announced changes, such as the running of the Leaving Certificate Oral Examinations and Music Practical over the first week of the Easter Break. </p>  <p>  Timeframes for certain assessment elements of the Leaving Certificate Applied examinations have also been pushed out. Schools were also reminded of the flexibilities regarding the dates for completion and authentication of examination Coursework.</p>  <p>  I have also confirmed that Junior Cycle examinations will take place this summer. Adjustments to the assessment arrangements for Junior Cycle were published in August 2021 and provide for more teaching time in schools. They include a reduction in the number of Classroom Based Assessments to be completed, the removal of the requirement to complete Assessment Tasks, and adjustments to the requirements in coursework and practical performance tests.</p>  <p>  I believe that the decision announced will provide Leaving Certificate students of 2022 with an opportunity for their learning and attainment at the end of their post-primary education to be assessed, and will enable them to progress to the next stage of their lives. It also provides the certainty and clarity in this matter that had been requested by schools and parents.</p>  <p>  Planning for the 2023 examinations starts immediately after the 2022 examinations. I will be considering with the State Examinations Commission the issue of the marking and grading arrangements for 2023 at that stage.  </p></reply>

My Department provides a range of specialist education, psychological and care supports for schools in line with the needs of each school.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware my Department opened the school in question this year in recognition of the significant demand for special school places in the local area. The establishment and opening of the school helped to ensure that children who required a special school place could access one, with priority in admissions given to those students who did not have a special school place previously. </p>  <p>  The ground floor areas were completely renovated to provide classrooms with associated Assisted Use WCs and Quiet Spaces, staff and admin areas and support spaces to enable the school start up in September 2021. The layout was developed by the Department in consultation with the school and is based on optimising the space available. A sensory room has been provided as part of the extensive development undertaken at the school and external secure play area was also provided.</p>  <p>  Special schools generally cater for children with the most complex needs.  Accordingly, these schools have enhanced staffing levels with greatly reduced pupil/teacher and SNA staffing allocations.  </p>  <p>  On an ongoing basis, special schools also have access to the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) advisory support service which advises on children with the most complex needs, including behavioural needs.</p>  <p>  Special schools in a start-up situation are targeted for specific support.  Care is taken in the planning of these schools and the provision of specialist training and support.  A bespoke package of CPD and professional learning for the staff of this new school is currently taking place with inputs from my Department, the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) and the relevant agencies including the NCSE.  This school will also continue to be supported by NEPS.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that my Department and the NCSE will continue to prioritise this school for support.</p></reply>

The refined DEIS ID model is an objective, statistics based process, based on school enrolment data and data available from Census 2016 under the HP Deprivation Index. It is important to note that there is no application process for the DEIS programme and all schools will be considered under the refined DEIS model when it is applied. </p>  <p>  In advance of the implementation of the refined DEIS identification model, there will be further engagement with relevant stakeholders. The purpose is to ensure that, as far as possible, the refined DEIS identification model can provide an objective and independent means of identifying schools serving high concentrations of pupils at risk of educational disadvantage and also to ensure there is a full understanding of the refined model and its potential application. </p></reply>

Updated guidance for schools on Practical Steps for the Deployment of Good Ventilation Practices in Schools was provided at the end of May following the work of an expert group that carefully considered the role of ventilation in managing COVID-19. The updated guidance for schools is also fully in line with the most recent guidance on non-healthcare building ventilation during COVID-19, published by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre November 2021. </p><p>To provide additional support in the context of Covid-19 the payment of a minor works grant totalling &euro;45m for primary schools and special schools, plus a once-off Covid-19 minor works funding of &euro;17m for post-primary schools, was issued in December 2021. All recognised schools in the free scheme have received their grants, a table of funding by county is provided below.</p><p>Given that each school setting is different, individual schools are best placed to decide how best to use this funding to address their particular needs. Specialist advice/assistance of a Chartered Engineer or Registered Architect is an important source of support for schools.  This will help ensure that appropriate solutions are being put in place to address ventilation issues including advice on whether a HEPA Air Cleaner Unit is required to deal with a poorly ventilated room.  There is no one solution that fits all scenarios, each application requires bespoke analysis and selection of the appropriate unit(s) matched to the specific room size and volume. </p><p>Air cleaning devices are not a substitute for good ventilation but can be considered pending the completion of interventions/works where poor ventilation persists. This is line with the Expert Group recommendations. Air filtration does not negate the need for natural ventilation and opening windows as required. Furthermore Mike Ryan of the World Health Organization&rsquo;s Health Emergencies Programme has advised that schools not rely solely on air filters.</p><p>In the case where a school has difficulty engaging a Chartered Engineer or Registered Architect the Department can assist, with a dedicated ventilation team  available to support school principals in this regard.  Schools that identify inadequate ventilation in a room can utilise their minor work grant or apply for emergency works grant assistance to address ventilation enhancements where the minor work grant does not cover the full cost of the works required.</p><p>To date 19 schools have applied for additional funding under the emergency works scheme to assist with ventilation. Of these, 12 have been approved, 2 were returned to the school to review the scope of the application, 2 were incorrectly classified as ventilation related and assessed separately, 2 were rejected as the application form was not fully completed and 1 is currently being assessed by a member of the Department&rsquo;s technical team. None of the 12 approved identified a need for an air filter. <table>    <tr>       <th><div>County</div></th>       <th><div>Total (&euro;)</div></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Carlow</td>       <td>0.88m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cavan</td>       <td>1.23m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Clare</td>       <td>1.75m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork</td>       <td>6.97m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Donegal</td>       <td>2.74m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin</td>       <td>12.91m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway</td>       <td>4.04m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerry</td>       <td>2.30m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare</td>       <td>2.58m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilkenny</td>       <td>1.46m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Laois</td>       <td>1.11m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Leitrim</td>       <td>0.56m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick</td>       <td>2.56m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Longford</td>       <td>0.71m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth</td>       <td>1.63m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mayo</td>       <td>2.41m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Meath</td>       <td>2.45m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Monaghan</td>       <td>1.00m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Offaly</td>       <td>1.14m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Roscommon</td>       <td>1.20m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Sligo</td>       <td>1.08m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Tipperary</td>       <td>2.58m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Waterford</td>       <td>1.52m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Westmeath</td>       <td>1.34m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wexford</td>       <td>2.00m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wicklow</td>       <td>1.85m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total</td>       <td>62m</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

It promotes the concept of citizenship and social justice with children and respects them as young citizens.  The concept of Citizenship and Global Citizenship is integrated into the primary SPHE curriculum. </p><p>Aspects of a number of curricula at Post-primary level would reference the European Union.  Examples include: Junior Cycle CSPE, Business Studies, Visual Art and Leaving Certificate English, Agricultural Science, Geography and Politics and Society. </p><p>The framework for Junior Cycle includes &ldquo;values what it means to be an active citizen, with rights and responsibilities in local and wider contexts&rdquo; as one of its 24 Statements of Learning.  Learning experiences associated with this Statement of Learning would result in students learning how government and politics work in Ireland and elsewhere, including Europe, enabling students to develop an understanding that as citizens we all have rights and responsibilities who can contribute to building a better world within their local communities and in the wider world. </p><p>The Leaving Certificate Politics and Society curriculum includes a strand on Power and Decision making at national and European level and another on Human Rights and Responsibilities in Europe and the wider world.  </p><p>The Professional Development Support Services also help to raise awareness of the European Union through Continuous Professional Development (CPD), workshops, seminars etc provided to teachers in terms of the relevant curriculum areas.  For example, teachers are supported in demonstrating an understanding of, and the links between: the EU, sovereignty, intergovernmentalism and supranationalism.  The Support Services and teachers alike reference the European Union as a lens through which to examine a variety of the learning outcomes, topics and key concepts.  Current and emerging topics such as Brexit, immigration, democratic representation, sustainability and the &ldquo;othering&rdquo; of parts of our community are all examined through the European Union.  Scoilnet.ie, the Department&rsquo;s portal for teachers and schools hosts many resources in relation to the European Union.  Scoilnet also engages with the EU Commission office in Dublin to promote awareness of Ireland's engagement with the EU. </p><p>In addition to the raising of awareness through the curriculum and the supports provided to teachers, there are a number of programmes with which schools can engage with learning about the European Union.  </p><p>The Blue Star programme,<b></b>funded by the Department of Foreign Affairs and supported by the Department of Education, allows primary school pupils to learn about our rich European heritage, diverse European cultures and languages, and the importance of the European Union today. The programme involves  teachers and pupils carrying out projects and creative activities related to the History, Geography, Culture and Institutions of the EU.<i></i>In 2021 nearly 240 schools took part from all 26 counties. Over the last ten years, more than 1,000 schools have taken part in this programme, which is managed by European Movement Ireland. </p><p>At post primary level, the European Parliament office in Ireland runs the European Parliament Ambassador school programme (Ambassador School Programme | Youth Outreach | European Parliament Liaison Office in Ireland (europa.eu)) which aims to raise awareness about European Parliamentary democracy and European citizenship values. </p><p>Finally, the Career for EU Strategy, approved by the Government in May 2021, will also help raise awareness of the European Union.  The existing EU Jobs campaign will be expanded, including increased promotion and outreach to second level students in Ireland, including native Irish speakers and those who speak another EU language in the home.  It is expected that it will encourage EU career opportunities and promote the learning of European languages at second level in conjunction with the Department of Education&rsquo;s Languages Connect Strategy.</p></reply>

The register is maintained by Tusla Alternative Education Assessment and Registration service. </p>  <p>  With regard to alternative education in &ldquo;out-of-school&rdquo; services, these are generally a provision of education, for children who have become disengaged from, or are unable to complete, mainstream education. This provision is an alternative option within the education system, when all other supports, options and pathways have been tried and have not proved successful. My Department provides funding for a small number of alternative education settings which provide education for the small number of young people who do not complete mainstream education.</p>  <p>  These settings vary in structure and design but provide an important service for a small cohort of students. Students are often referred to these settings from a range of sources including the Education Welfare Service. Under Action 88 of the DEIS Plan my Department has undertaken a review of out-of-school education provision. This review was carried out by a Working Group chaired by my Department and comprised of representatives from stakeholders including the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Tusla, Solas, Education and Training Boards Ireland and the National Educational Psychological Service. This review has been informed through the use of questionnaires, submissions from stakeholders and a public consultation process, including consultation with students. </p>  <p>  I expect to soon be in a position to publish the report of the review and it is envisaged that the report will inform future policy in this area.</p></reply>

It is facilitating research on a range of typical retrofit options, which will have been tried and tested. It is providing valuable development information for a solution driven delivery strategy which will be founded on a solid evidence base that has proven the robustness and scalability of renewable solutions within the schools&rsquo; sector. </p>  <p>  The longer-term outcome of the pathfinder will be to create an accurate and scalable model for energy efficient retrofits of schools across Ireland. The deep energy retrofit programme for schools built prior to 2008 is due to be rolled out as included in the National Development Plan.</p>  <p>  The pathfinder programme has retrofitted 41 schools across Ireland to date with work on an additional 9 schools added in 2021 underway. 2022 sees six additional schools undergoing deep retrofit to a Building Energy Rating (BER) of B with renewable heating systems. Each school undergoes a comprehensive assessment to ensure that the measures are suitable for that school and will deliver value to both the school and learnings for the national retrofit programme.</p></reply>

Where a school employs a staff member to support those functions those staff are employees of individual schools and responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school.</p>  <p>  The Department with school management bodies have been engaging with F&oacute;rsa on a claim on terms and conditions for grant-funded school secretaries and caretakers.  On the 27th of October 2020, under the auspices of the WRC, an understanding was agreed on a pathway to progress the issues. Several key strands were identified, and a phased approach is being taken to the development of proposals. </p>  <p>  Following intensive discussions at the WRC on 13th September 2021, there was significant progress in this dispute. Subject to agreement on all elements of the claim, the Department has offered to move School Secretaries&rsquo; pay rates to a scale which is aligned with the Clerical Officer Grade III pay scale on a pro rata basis according to a secretary&rsquo;s current working pattern. The Department has also offered to improve the conditions for School Secretaries with regard to sick leave, annual leave and maternity provisions for this cohort of staff.</p>  <p>  Further dialogue has taken place between the parties on these issues since 13 September with the aim of reaching an overall agreement. The talks continue, most recently at a meeting at the WRC on 26 January; the parties are to meet again next month, following reflection on the matters discussed at that meeting.</p>  <p>  I welcome the continued engagement between the parties and I encourage all stakeholders to focus on finalising an agreement.</p></reply>

Successful and repeatable results are then incorporated into all new school designs and refurbishments. The Departments policy is supported by a strong research programme with fifty three research projects at various stages including the energy website <i>www.energyineducation.ie</i>, which is a joint partnership with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI).</p><p>In the interest of sustainability, it is critical that renewable applications are properly suited to the schools needs so as to reduce energy costs and carbon and not just applied for the sake of having renewables. It is also critical that we minimise the demand for energy before we invest in renewable energy applications. This has been assisted in previous years with the wall and attic insulation programme and the water conservation programme.</p><p>My Department and the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications established a jointly funded pathfinder programme with the SEAI, testing and demonstrating energy efficiency and decarbonisation retrofit approaches.

Typically savings of between 5 to 10% are identified through low and no cost measures, while some schools participating have identified potential savings of up to 15 % or more.</p><p>Furthermore my Department provides capitation funding to all recognised schools in the Free Education Scheme. The main grant is the capitation grant to cater for day to day running costs including heating costs.</p><p>My Department has also ensured that centrally negotiated rates are available to schools for electricity and bulk heating fuels. These rates are available through existing frameworks sourced by the Office of Government Procurement (OGP). OGP has run competitions specifically for Schools at a national level and the Schools Procurement Unit and the Department has communicated with schools and school management bodies informing them of the options available to them through these national arrangements.

This is reflected in the Programme for Government, which states that this Government will develop inclusive and age appropriate curricula for Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE) and Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) across primary and post-primary schools, including an inclusive programme on LGBTI+ relationships and making appropriate legislative changes, if necessary. </p>  <p>  SPHE is a mandatory curriculum subject in all primary schools and in post-primary Junior Cycle. RSE is required at all levels, from primary through to Senior Cycle. </p>  <p>  All schools are required to have an RSE policy that is developed in consultation with the school community, including school management, parents, teachers and students as appropriate. The school&rsquo;s programme for Relationship and Sexuality Education is developed and taught in the context of the school&rsquo;s RSE policy.  Schools are required to teach all aspects of the RSE programme, including family planning, sexually transmitted infections and sexual orientation. It is important to note that the ethos of the school should never preclude learners from acquiring the knowledge about these issues.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, following a review of RSE in schools across all stages of education the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) established two development groups, one for primary and one for post-primary, to oversee development work in this area. </p>  <p>  The immediate focus of the NCCA work has been on creating support materials for teachers for publication online as part of an Interim Guidance Toolkit. The toolkit's purpose is to support effective teaching and learning of SPHE/RSE linked to the current curriculum and to provide guidance on how SPE/RSE may be approached in a comprehensive way that meets the needs of young people today.  The toolkits are available online and are being used by schools.</p>  <p>  These toolkits will be expanded during 2022 to include further age and stage appropriate guidance for teachers on how to address the important and sensitive topics within the SPHE classroom. </p>  <p>  In tandem with this work, preparation for the broader redeveloping and updating of the SPHE curriculum has begun. Updated curricula will be developed for Primary, Junior Cycle and Senior Cycle. It is expected that a revised Junior Cycle specification will be completed by the end of 2022, following a period of public consultation. Updated specifications for primary and senior cycle will follow immediately afterwards.</p></reply>

This arrangement is in place for current school year pending completion of the full review of the School Transport Scheme.  </p>  <p>  Children who are not eligible for school transport may apply for transport on a concessionary basis only and are offered seats where capacity exists after all eligible children have been catered for.</p>  <p>  My Department commenced a review of the School Transport Scheme in February 2021. The review is being conducted with a view to examining the current scheme, its broader effectiveness and sustainability, and to ensure that it serves students and their families adequately.</p>  <p>  Following commencement of this review the Steering Group presented me with an initial interim report on eligibility with an examination of issues for mainstream pupils relating to the nearest and next nearest school.  Following consideration of this report, I approved the extension of temporary alleviation measures in the current school year for transport for post-primary students who are otherwise eligible for school transport but are attending their second nearest school and have applied and paid on time.  </p>  <p>  Wider considerations relating to operation of the scheme are now taking place in the next phase of the review which is currently underway.  The Steering Group will continue to report to me on an interim basis as the review progresses. While work on the review has been impacted somewhat by the ongoing challenges of the pandemic, efforts are continuing to complete the review as close as possible to the previously announced timeline which is end of Q1 2022. </p></reply>

The toolkit will support effective teaching and learning of SPHE/RSE linked to the current curriculum and provide guidance on how SPHE/RSE may be approached in a comprehensive way that meets the needs of young people today.  There are resources to help teachers in teaching about rights and responsibilities in relationships, how to recognise healthy, unhealthy and abusive relationship, how to interact safely and respectfully the influence of the media on young people's understanding and expectations, sexual consent and assertive communication.</p><p>In tandem with this work, preparation for the broader redeveloping and updating of the SPHE curriculum has begun. Updated curricula will be developed for Primary, Junior Cycle and Senior Cycle.  </p><p>Consent education will be included within the learning outcomes for RSE, across all levels, based on the principle that consent is a core dimension of all healthy interpersonal relationships.</p><p>Secondly, I have announced a review of the 2013 Action Plan on Bullying action plan and procedures on bullying.

In the 2021/22 academic year there are 884 schools in the DEIS Programme - 687 Primary and 197 Post Primary, serving over 180,000 pupils. This represents approximately 20% of the overall school population. The total Department spend on DEIS in 2021 is over &euro;150 million, which includes over &euro;26 million for the School Completion Programme (SCP). </p>  <p>  Budget 2022 has allocated the largest-ever increase in funding for the DEIS programme, providing for an additional allocation of &euro;18 million in 2022 (&euro;32 million over a full year) which will enable an expansion in 2022 of the DEIS programme to further schools. This means that by 2023 the Irish Government will target over &euro;180 million at addressing educational disadvantage through the DEIS programme, an increase of 20% on the 2021 allocation.</p>  <p>  All DEIS Schools are required to develop three-year action plans for improvement under the DEIS themes of: Attendance, Retention, Literacy &amp;amp; Numeracy, Supporting Educational Transitions, Partnership with parents and others and, (in the case of post-primary schools), Examination Attainment. Schools are expected to regularly monitor their progress and make necessary adjustments in light of experience. </p>  <p>  Tusla Education Support Service (TESS) has three strands namely the Statutory Educational Welfare Service (EWS) and the two school support services the Home School Community Liaison Scheme (HSCL) and the School Completion Programme (SCP). TESS is a key support to the schools participating in the DEIS programme. The three TESS strands work together collaboratively with schools, families and other relevant services to achieve the best educational outcomes for children and young people. All three strands share the same national outcomes:  improved attendance, participation and retention.</p>  <p>  The latest Retention Report published by my Department measures the percentage of students who entered the first year of post-primary school in 2014 and who completed Leaving Certificate in 2019, or 2020 (for those who availed of transition year). The Report shows that 91.5% of the students who entered first year of post primary school in 2014 completed their Leaving Certificate in 2019 or 2020, while 97.6% sat the Junior Certificate examination in 2017 or 2018. </p>  <p>  Schools participating in the DEIS programme have seen retention rates to Leaving Certificate improve since the introduction of DEIS - from 68.2% for the 2001 entry cohort to 84.8% for the 2014 entry cohort. The gap in retention rates between DEIS and non-DEIS schools has narrowed from a gap of 16.8% for the 2001 entry cohort to 8.6% for the 2014 entry cohort.</p>  <p>  In 2020, and again in 2021, all DEIS schools were provided with the opportunity to run a summer programme as a response to the challenges faced by schools due to school closures under Covid 19. Schools were asked to identify those students at greatest risk of educational disadvantage to participate in the programme.  </p>  <p>  In addition, in September last, I announced a Covid Learning and Support Scheme (CLASS) to help schools mitigate the adverse impacts of Covid-19 on student learning loss and wellbeing arising from the periods of school closures in 2020 and 2021.  Provision is being made for up to &euro;52 million in extra teaching hours for schools during the current school year. Under the programme, a block of additional teaching hours is being provided to each recognised school.  Enhanced allocations are provided under CLASS for DEIS schools. DEIS Schools may use the additional teaching hours in accordance with the needs of their students. This will enable DEIS schools to identify students most at risk of learning loss arising from the recent disrupted school experience and put in place specific targeted teaching supports to meet these students&rsquo; needs. </p></reply>

In similar fashion to 2020 and 2021, this work has been assisted by an advisory group of key stakeholders.</p>  <p>  In recent weeks, I have attended a meeting with the Advisory Group on State Examinations, which has representatives of students, parents, teachers, school managerial bodies, the further and higher education sector, and the State Examinations Commission. Following on from this meeting, I met with the members of the advisory group on a bilateral basis and also had further engagement with each of them thereafter.  I have listened carefully to what each of these stakeholders has had to say and examined each of their points. </p>  <p>  Following consideration of this matter by Government , I announced today the decision: to operate an examinations approach for Leaving Certificate in 2022, with significant further adjustments to the examinations; and to provide students with a commitment that the overall results of Leaving Certificate 2022 will not be lower than in 2021. As the Deputy may be aware, it would not have been possible to run Accredited Grades in the same manner as last year, as Junior Cycle data was unavailable for 25% of our students. </p>  <p>  The further extensive changes I have announced to the examination papers, over and above those announced in August 2021, mean that candidates: have greater choice in the papers; have less questions to answer; and still have the same amount of time as in a normal year to complete the examination. For example, in mathematics on each paper, instead of having to answer all ten questions, candidates will only have to answer six.</p>  <p>  This is in addition to previously announced changes, such as the running of the Leaving Certificate Oral Examinations and Music Practical over the first week of the Easter Break. </p>  <p>  Timeframes for certain assessment elements of the Leaving Certificate Applied examinations have also been pushed out. Schools were also reminded of the flexibilities regarding the dates for completion and authentication of examination Coursework.</p>  <p>  For certain specified categories of students who are unable to sit their examinations in June there will be an alternative sitting of the Leaving Certificate examinations. This will be provided for students who, due to serious illness, close family bereavement, or for Covid-related reasons based on public health advice, are unable to sit one or more papers in the first sitting of the examinations. There will be strict eligibility criteria applying to this contingency sitting, to be developed by the State Examinations Commission.</p>  <p>  I believe that the decision I announced today will provide Leaving Certificate students of 2022 with an opportunity for their learning and attainment at the end of their post-primary education to be assessed, and will enable them to progress to the next stage of their lives.

This allows the Department to direct capital investment to areas of most need. Generally, where a new school is identified as the optimum solution, such new school provision (primary and post-primary) is co-educational in nature. Co-educational schools provide greater flexibility than single sex schools in terms of meeting demographic and school accommodation requirements in an area. Single-sex provision may, however, be made if there is an identified imbalance between the capacities of single-sex schools in the area.  </p>  <p>  With respect to school building projects generally, replacement school buildings for existing schools, other major building projects and smaller scale Additional School Accommodation scheme projects are approved on the basis of the accommodation need and single-sex schools are not excluded from such provision.  </p></reply>

In the 2021/22 academic year there are 884 schools in the DEIS Programme - 687 Primary and 197 Post Primary, serving over 180,000 pupils. This represents approximately 20% of the overall school population. The total Department spend on DEIS in 2021 was over &euro;150 million, which includes over &euro;26 million for the School Completion Programme (SCP). </p><p>Budget 2022 has allocated the largest-ever increase in funding for the DEIS programme, providing for an additional allocation of &euro;18 million in 2022 (&euro;32 million over a full year) which will enable an expansion in 2022 of the DEIS programme to further schools. This means that by 2023 the Irish Government will target over &euro;180 million at addressing educational disadvantage through the DEIS programme, an increase of 20% on the 2021 allocation.</p><p>The full list of supports provided to DEIS schools is available at: <i>www.gov.ie/en/policy-information/4018ea-deis-delivering-equality-of-opportunity-in-schools/#supports-to-deis-schools</i>.</p><p>A number of supports were provided by my Department since March 2020 to help DEIS schools mitigate the adverse impacts of Covid-19 on student learning loss and wellbeing arising from the periods of school closures in 2020 and 2021 and to support students most at risk of educational disadvantage.</p><p>During the Covid-19 pandemic my Department issued extensive guidance material to assist schools and teachers with the continuity of learning. This guidance was developed in consultation with all relevant stakeholders including teachers, parents and learners.  The guidance included provision to support the continuity of teaching and learning in response to the Covid-19 restrictions for those learners unable to engage with online learning.  </p><p>The DEIS grant for the 2020/21 school year was paid ahead of schedule to all DEIS schools to help support students who were most at risk of educational disadvantage during the Covid-19 school closures. Schools were able to use this grant funding, if required, to support existing programmes to ensure continuity of learning, particularly for those most at risk. </p><p>In 2020, and again in 2021, all DEIS schools were provided with the opportunity to run a summer programme as a response to the challenges faced by schools due to school closures under Covid 19. Schools were asked to identify those students at greatest risk of educational disadvantage to participate in the programme.  </p><p>In September last, I announced a Covid Learning and Support Scheme (CLASS) to help schools mitigate the adverse impacts of Covid-19 on student learning loss and wellbeing arising from the periods of school closures in 2020 and 2021.  Provision is being made for up to &euro;52 million in extra teaching hours for schools during the current school year. Under the programme, a block of additional teaching hours is being provided to each recognised school.  Enhanced allocations are provided under CLASS for DEIS schools. DEIS Schools may use the additional teaching hours in accordance with the needs of their students. This will enable DEIS schools to identify students most at risk of learning loss arising from the recent disrupted school experience and put in place specific targeted teaching supports to meet these students&rsquo; needs.  </p><p>Under the Digital Strategy for Schools 2015-2020 funding of &euro;210m issued to all recognised primary and post-primary schools, with a 10% weighting applied to schools in the DEIS programme, that is, those with concentrated levels of disadvantage. This included &euro;100m that issued in 2020 to support schools in the continuity of teaching and learning during the pandemic. Schools were advised that this funding could be used to support learners through the provision of devices on loan, for example.</p><p>&euro;50m issued in 2021, to continue to support schools to manage requirements arising owing to the pandemic during COVID-19 as well as the ongoing embedding of the use of digital technologies in teaching and learning.  The funding can be used within schools to support learners who were impacted during the period of disruption and change caused by the pandemic. In instances where social distancing means classes may need to be dispersed to other spaces in the school, the funding can be used to provide digital equipment to allow for delivery of lessons and online learning. Schools can also use the funding to support remote or blended learning should it be necessary for a class or group, or high risk individual where isolation is necessary for a limited period.</p><p>It should also be noted that this funding will be a key enabler of my Department&rsquo;s new Digital Strategy for Schools which is under development currently. Consultation on the new Strategy has now concluded, and involved an open call for submission, questionnaires to principals, teachers, parents and students, and focus groups involving key stakeholders including those from the charity sector, to inform the new Strategy.</p><p>My Department secured &euro;50m in funding under the National Recovery and Resilience Plan and that funding issued to schools in December 2021. Under the terms of the Scheme, funding issued directly to all recognised primary, special and post-primary schools in the free education schemes in 2021. Under the scheme schools are required to target the funding to support for pupils and student at risk of educational disadvantage arising from the digital divide. Schools in the DEIS programme received twice the allocation on the basis of the known level of concentrated disadvantage in DEIS schools.</p><p>My Department also received funding under Ireland&rsquo;s National Recovery and Resilience Plan for a project to provide all remaining primary schools with high speed broadband connectivity by end 2022/early 2023. This project will supplement delivery of high speed broadband alongside delivery under the National Broadband Plan and commercial provision through the Schools Broadband Programme. This will ensure parity of access to appropriate broadband across all schools in the country. </p><p>In terms of measures to further support online digital learning, extensive support and advice for teachers and schools to provide remote learning is available through the Professional Development Service for Teachers and its Technology in Education team. The Department funded Scoilnet portal which contains a wealth of curriculum tagged resources that can be used by teachers, students and parents to support the use of digital in teaching and learning. </p></reply>

Information from a range of sources, including Child Benefit data, school enrolment data and information on residential development activity is used for this purpose.  Additionally, Project Ireland 2040 population and housing targets inform my Department's projections of school place requirements.</p>  <p>  Having considered the projected requirements in each school planning area, my Department then makes an assessment of the existing capacity within that particular area and its ability to meet any increased demand.  </p>  <p>  Where data indicates that additional provision is required at primary or post primary level, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:</p>  <p>  -  Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,</p>  <p>  -  Extending the capacity of a school or schools,</p>  <p>  -  Provision of a new school or schools.</p>  <p>  My Department's projections of post primary school place requirements in East Cork show some continued growth in enrolments in the short- to medium-term across most areas, with most growth anticipated in the Midleton_Carrigtwohill school planning area. </p>  <p>  However, in response to projected future need and to enrolment pressures in the area, there has been significant capital investment by my Department at post primary schools in East Cork.  A new post primary school, Carrigtwohill Community College, was established in 2016.  A project to deliver a new, modern 1,000 pupil school building for that school is underway.  Additionally, an extension at St. Colman's Community College, Midleton has been recently completed and a number of other large school building projects are also in train, delivering expanded capacity at St. Aloysius' College in Carrigtwohill, Midleton CBS, St. Mary's High School in Midleton, Pobalscoil na Tr&iacute;on&oacute;ide in Youghal, Col&aacute;iste an Phiarsaigh in Glanmire and Col&aacute;iste Mhuire in Cobh.</p>  <p>  While my Department is aware of increasing pressures and demand for additional school places in East Cork, it is important to note that where enrolment pressures arise, it may not be as a result of lack of accommodation but may be driven by the following factors:</p>  <p>  -  Duplication of applications &ndash; pupils have applied for a place to a number of schools in the area</p>  <p>  -  School of choice &ndash; pupils can&rsquo;t get a place in  their preferred school while there are places in other schools in the town/area</p>  <p>  -  Some towns/areas have single sex schools and while places are available in the school they are not available to all pupils</p>  <p>  -  External draw &ndash; pupils coming from outside the local area</p>  <p>  My Department is working to establish the true extent of any capacity issues through ongoing discussions with the relevant school authorities. In that context, similar to the process adopted in advance of the current academic year, my Department is engaging with patron bodies, including patrons of schools in East Cork areas, to identify particular capacity requirements for the forthcoming years which may necessitate further action to that already in train including, where required, the provision of modular accommodation solutions. </p>  <p>  Additionally, my Department will continue to work to advance the planned and current projects in East Cork and to ensure sufficient places for both mainstream provision and for pupils with special education requirements both for the coming academic year and into the future.</p>  <p>  Given medium- to long-term projected demographic trends, it is not currently anticipated that there will be a requirement for a further new post primary school in the area, nevertheless, my Department will continue to monitor the situation.</p></reply>

Where a school employs a staff member to support those functions those staff are employees of individual schools and responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school.</p>  <p>  The Department with school management bodies have been engaging with F&oacute;rsa on a claim on terms and conditions for grant-funded school secretaries and caretakers.  On the 27th of October 2020, under the auspices of the WRC, an understanding was agreed on a pathway to progress the issues. Several key strands were identified, and a phased approach is being taken to the development of proposals. </p>  <p>  Following intensive discussions at the WRC on 13th September 2021, there was significant progress in this dispute. Subject to agreement on all elements of the claim, the Department has offered to move School Secretaries&rsquo; pay rates to a scale which is aligned with the Clerical Officer Grade III pay scale on a pro rata basis according to a secretary&rsquo;s current working pattern. The Department has also offered to improve the conditions for School Secretaries with regard to sick leave, annual leave and maternity provisions for this cohort of staff.</p>  <p>  Further dialogue has taken place between the parties on these issues since 13 September with the aim of reaching an overall agreement. The talks continue, most recently at a meeting at the WRC on 26 January; the parties are to meet again next month, following reflection on the matters discussed at that meeting.</p>  <p>  I welcome the continued engagement between the parties and I encourage all stakeholders to focus on finalising an agreement.</p></reply>

This new investment is required to meet the needs of students with special educational needs enrolled in mainstream classes; students to be enrolled in new special classes and new special school places and the needs of new and developing schools.  There are predetermined levels of teaching and SNA support for both special classes and special schools. </p>  <p>  A new model for allocating special education teachers in respect of students with special needs enrolled in mainstream classes was introduced in 2017.  The Special Education Teacher allocation process provides a single unified allocation for special educational support teaching needs to each school, based on each school&rsquo;s educational profile.  The profile of each school takes account of enrolments and a number of other factors that are considered to be indicative of the level of need in each school. There is a commitment to update profiles on a regular basis with the last update being for the 2019/20 school.  </p>  <p>  In addition, there is a provision for schools to seek additionality through the Exceptional Needs Review process if there is a significant change in their level of need in between profile updates. </p>  <p>  The allocation of the additional teaching support for students with special educational needs in mainstream classes is a matter for each school and guidelines have been provided in this regard.</p>  <p>  In relation to SNA support for students in mainstream classes, schools receive an allocation based on overall care need in the school.  It is then a matter for each school to allocate this resource following the principle that those with greatest need should receive the most support.</p>  <p>  There is also provision for schools to seek additionality in respect of the SNA allocation where circumstances have changed significantly.</p></reply>

In the 2021/22 academic year there are 884 schools in the DEIS Programme - 687 Primary and 197 Post Primary, serving over 180,000 pupils. This represents approximately 20% of the overall school population. The total Department spend on DEIS in 2021 was over &euro;150 million, which includes over &euro;26 million for the School Completion Programme (SCP). The DEIS programme provides for smaller class sizes and other supports including additional teaching posts, Home School Community Liaison Coordinators, DEIS grants, enhanced book grants, curriculum supports and priority access to Continuing Professional Development. </p><p>Budget 2022 has allocated the largest-ever increase in funding for the DEIS programme, providing for an additional allocation of &euro;18 million in 2022 (&euro;32 million over a full year) which will enable an expansion in 2022 of the DEIS programme to further schools. This means that by 2023 the Irish Government will target over &euro;180 million at addressing educational disadvantage through the DEIS programme, an increase of 20% on the 2021 allocation.</p><p>All DEIS Schools are supported to develop action plans for improvement under the DEIS themes. Transitions is a key theme in DEIS schools&rsquo; planning processes and is part of the school self-evaluation (SSE) process. All DEIS schools were invited to a virtual Shared Learning Day organised by my Department in April 2021 on the theme of, &lsquo;Adapting and Managing Successful Transitions for Students&rsquo;. It was an opportunity for DEIS schools to listen to experiences of successful transition from early years to primary, through post-primary and onto further and higher education to inform their own planning processes. The entire event is available to view at <i>www.gov.ie/en/publication/c5643-resources-for-deis-schools/</i>.</p><p>The Higher Education Authority (HEA) Student Record System (SRS) data shows that in 2019/20 academic year, 10% of new entrants came from DEIS Schools.  There is already extensive engagement between Higher Education Institutes (HEIs) and DEIS schools. In an analysis carried out by the HEA at the start of the 2021, 98% of post-primary DEIS schools had links or engagement with a HEI.  </p><p>My Department works closely with the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science on tackling educational disadvantage and encouraging transitions to higher education. Initiatives under the Department of  Further and Higher Education,  Research, Innovation and Science include the following: </p><p>-  Funding is provided to seven Special Disadvantage Initiatives located in areas of socio-economic disadvantage in Dublin and Limerick cities. These projects specifically target children and young people in primary and post primary DEIS schools who are generally at risk of not reaching their full academic potential. They also seek to direct further targeted activities at children and young people who demonstrate high academic potential but may be at risk of not progressing to further or higher education for a variety of reasons. </p><p>-  Engagement with DEIS schools also features in Strand 3 of the Programme for Access to Higher Education (PATH). PATH 3 supports HEI capacity in developing regional and community partnership strategies (including with DEIS schools) for increasing access to higher education by specified groups. A number of projects approved under PATH 3 include engagement with local DEIS schools.  Similarly, a number of projects supported under Strand 1 of PATH, which is committed to increasing the diversity of initial teacher education for new entrants, involve engagement with DEIS schools. For example, several Centres collaborate with DEIS schools in mentoring programmes to improve the reach of access to higher education and in particular, access to initial teacher education. The PATH 2 bursaries, now with three tiers of support, take a wider range of indicators into consideration and students from DEIS schools can feature among the recipients.  </p><p>-  Work on the development of the next National Access Plan (NAP) 2022 - 2026 is currently underway. Additional funding of &euro;5m in 2022 was approved to support the development of the new National Access Plan which aims to be more student centred, targeting specific under-represented groups and a move beyond the singular focus on access to higher education with a strong focus on pathways.  Entry to higher education for students attending DEIS schools will be included as a Key Performance Indicator (KPI) in the new Plan.</p></reply>

The current development of draft specifications for Leaving Certificate Irish is part of the ongoing cycle of curriculum review and redevelopment.</p>  <p>  Draft L1 and L2 curriculum specifications have been developed by the NCCA. The L1 specification is aimed at students in Irish medium schools including native speakers and the L2 specification is aimed at students in English medium schools where Irish is taught as a second language. It is intended that schools participating in the Gaeltacht recognition scheme will be required to provide at least the L1 specification and English medium schools will have the option of providing the L1 and/or the L2 depending on the needs of students.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the NCCA opened the consultation process in February 2021 and, in response to stakeholder concerns and requests, extended the closing date to the end of November 2021. To support stakeholder participation, the NCCA employed a wide range of consultation tools including an online survey, bilateral and focus group meetings and written submissions. </p>  <p>  The consultation generated significant interest and a high volume of responses.  The NCCA has commenced a detailed analysis and consideration of all the feedback received. To support this process, the NCCA recently awarded a tender to the National University of Ireland, Galway (NUIG) to analyse responses. It is anticipated that a draft report on the consultation will be available for consideration before the end of this academic year. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible to pre-empt the findings of this very important consultation process. The outcomes will, in due course, inform future decisions on curriculum provision for Leaving Certificate Irish and any supports that may be provided. </p></reply>

In that context, similar to the process adopted in advance of the current academic year, my Department is engaging with patron bodies, including those of schools in Mulhuddart/Tyrrelstown Dublin 15, to identify particular capacity requirements for the forthcoming year(s) which may necessitate further action to that already in train.</p><p>Under Project Ireland 2040, my Department continues to make progress to increase the infrastructural capacity in the schools sector, in order to meet demographic and other demands.  It is expected that the enrolment pressures in this, and other areas will reduce in the short-term as such planned additional capacity comes on stream and as demographic demand moves past its peak. </p><p>The Capital Programme details the school projects that are being progressed under Project Ireland 2040. The current status of large-scale projects being delivered under Project Ireland 2040, including projects in the school planning areas in question, may be viewed on my Department's website at, www.gov.ie and this information is updated regularly. In addition, a list of large-scale projects completed from 2010 to date may also be viewed on the website.</p><p>The Capital Programme also provides for devolved funding for additional classrooms, including accommodation for pupils with special educational needs, if required, for schools where an additional enrolment need has been identified or where an additional teacher has been appointed.  Details of schools listed on this programme (the Additional Accommodation Scheme) can be found on my Department's website at <i>www.gov.ie</i>and this information is also updated regularly.</p><p>I can confirm that, to date, my Department has not received an application for capital funding for additional accommodation from the school in question. However, my officials will continue to engage with the school patron, as with all patrons, in relation to any requirement for additional accommodation at the school. </p></reply>

This was acknowledged in the Comprehensive Review of the Special Needs Assistant Scheme (SNAs) published by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) in 2018. </p>  <p>  The Review made a number of recommendations regarding SNAs including referencing the training needs of SNAs.  In this regard, the NCSE recommended that a new national training programme at Level 5 of the National Qualification Framework be developed for existing SNAs who do not have the requisite level of training and for new SNAs on appointment.  The NCSE also recommended that training tailored to the specific complex needs of some students being cared for by SNAs would also be provided. </p>  <p>  The policy advice has been considered by the Department. It was decided that priority should be given to the development of a training programme for SNAs who may not have had a recent opportunity to access a training programme tailored to their role.  The new first national training course for SNAs provided by UCD now in place aims to enhance the knowledge, skills and expertise of SNAs whose work is central to the inclusion of students with additional care and complex needs in school life. The programme is fully funded by the Department and delivered at no cost to the SNA. </p>  <p>  This is the first national training programme for SNAs employed in schools and is tailored to their needs.  As this is the first programme, it is appropriate to take the time to review outcomes which will inform the future approach to ongoing training and professional development of SNAs. Part of that consideration will include accreditation.</p>  <p>  Raising the minimum qualification for appointment as a special needs assistant has been referred to the Workplace Relations Commission and the Department has been engaging in that process. </p>  <p>  The recruitment and appointment of Special Needs Assistants is a matter for the individual school authority and the Department's circular 36/2020 and 51/2019 sets out the current educational requirements for appointment as a Special Needs Assistant (SNA). In addition, the actual requirements for a post will vary depending on the specific needs of the children and the school to which the SNA is to be appointed. The Department does not believe that the existing minimum qualifications has impacted on the calibre of person appointed and it is also the case that people with experience and/or higher qualifications than the minimum are often the successful candidate in competitions held by schools.</p>  <p>  However, having considered the claim and, in particular, the period of time since they were set, the Department is open to reviewing the position. However, the Department is not yet in a position to indicate when that review might take place but is of the view that the forthcoming review of the SNA contract proposed as part of the Building Momentum national pay agreement should be carried out and implemented first.</p></reply>

With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level.</p>  <p>  There is currently one primary school on Inishbofin with a total enrolment of 14 pupils for the 2021/22 academic year (provisional data).  </p>  <p>  The Department of Education will continue to be represented on the Inter-Departmental Committee for the Development of the Islands led by the Department of Rural and Community Development.</p></reply>

This work is being led by the Department of the Taoiseach, and its joint sponsors the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform and supported by a broader Inter-departmental Working Group. A second phase of consultation and research on the Framework, as committed to in the first report, commenced in October and is now coming to an end. </p><p>A follow up report is currently being prepared and will be submitted to Government in the coming months informed by the second phase of consultation and the ongoing research.</p><p>There has been close collaboration with the CSO in identifying relevant indicators in the First Report, and developing an interactive version of this dashboard which was launched in October 2021. The dashboard &ndash; called the Well-being Information Hub &ndash; allows investigation of the 34 chosen indicators over time and Ireland&rsquo;s relative performance compared to other countries. Each indicator is disaggregated to explore inequality across groups. The cohorts chosen for disaggregation are based on existing research, consultation across Government and with experts in the field, and data availability. </p><p>Further material on the Framework is available at <i>www.gov.ie/wellbeing-framework</i>. </p></reply>

The proposal is targeted and pragmatic and aims at ensuring that governments can resort to compulsory licences, including to export to countries with no or limited manufacturing capacities, in the most effective manner adapted to the circumstances of a pandemic.  </p>  <p>  The EU is of the view that there is no single solution and that a multi-pronged approach is needed and that discussions should concentrate on how the Intellectual Property system can contribute towards increasing the manufacturing capacity and the equitable access to vaccines around the world.</p>  <p>  Despite the postponement of the WTO Ministerial Conference, WTO members will continue to engage in a solution-oriented manner to find an outcome on how the WTO can contribute to an effective response to any pandemic, not just the current one.</p>  <p>  Ireland will engage with the European Commission and other member states on the EU position for the WTO discussions including discussions on how the flexibilities within the TRIPS Agreement can contribute towards increasing the manufacturing capacity and the equitable access to vaccines around the world.</p>  <p>  The global production of COVID vaccines is increasing rapidly, with more than 11 billion vaccine doses produced by the end of 2021.  This figure is predicted to rise to 18-19 billion doses by mid-2022. The EU considers that the COVAX Facility is the mechanism that is best placed to ensure that high-income countries finance the vaccines and support the developing countries to secure their share of global supply.  COVAX has so far shipped over 1 billion COVID-19 vaccines to 144 countries. </p>  <p>  Team Europe has committed 200 million doses to reach low and middle-income countries by the end of this year, mainly through the COVAX initiative and is investing &euro;1 billion to ramp up mRNA production capacity in Africa.</p>  <p>  The Irish Government has committed to donate up to five million vaccine doses.  To date, 2.9 million dose offers have been formally accepted, primarily via the COVAX facility. Of the accepted offers, 1,511,500 have already been delivered to Uganda, Nigeria, Indonesia and Ghana.  </p>  <p>  The WHO recently stated that it sees a very positive outlook for supply of vaccines for 2022, that this is predicated on the continuation of dose sharing and manufacturers honouring deals brokered under COVAX, and that unequal distribution, rather than supply, could compromise global access to vaccines.</p></reply>

In particular, the LEOs offer Feasibility Grants, which help start-up companies or individual entrepreneurs with the cost of researching their proposed business or new business idea to see if it could be viable and sustainable, and Priming Grants, which aim to help with the associated costs of start-up. </p><p>However, it should be noted that the LEOs do not provide direct grant-aid to areas such as retail, personal services, local professional services, or local building services, as it may give rise to the displacement of existing businesses. </p><p>The LEOs provide a wide range of high-quality business and management development programmes that are tailored to meet specific business requirements. Whether it is starting a business or growing a business there is something suitable for anyone exploring self-employment as an option. </p><p>Any person considering starting a business should enquire about the LEO&rsquo;s Start Your Own Business Programme. The objective of this programme is to assist clients in assessing their business idea, its viability and helps them decide if they should proceed or take a step back. The programme covers topics such as Starting up / getting started, Identifying, understanding, and researching your target market, Developing your Business Plan amongst other vital areas of interest to a new business. </p><p>I would also suggest seeking the advice of a LEO Business Mentor; the Mentor programme is open to both new and existing businesses located within the LEO region and is designed to match up the knowledge, skills, insights and entrepreneurial capability of experienced business practitioners with small business owner/ managers who need practical and strategic one to one advice and guidance. The mentor contributes independent, informed observation and advice to aid decision making. </p><p>Mentors can also advise on finance options available to entrepreneurs and can assist with applications and referrals to Micro-Finance Ireland, which provides vital support to eligible microenterprises by lending to businesses that cannot obtain loans from other commercial lenders and who do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by commercial lenders. It offers loan funding, including Start-up Loans, from &euro;5,000 to &euro;25,000. </p><p>The above supports along with a host of others can also be found on the supportingsmes.gov.ie website. This is a cross-governmental guide to help small businesses know which of the over 170 Government supports could fit their business. </p><p>By completing the questionnaire, a small business will, in one location:</p><p>- be able to find out which of the over 170 Government business supports from 27 different Government  Departments, Agencies and Initiatives are available.</p><p>- be able to get information on the range of Government supports for accessing credit. </p><p>- be given contact details for their nearest Local Enterprise Office.</p><p>- be able to download filtered results into a document for their further use.</p><p>The Department of Social Protection offers the Back to Work Enterprise Allowance scheme, which encourages people currently receiving certain social welfare payments to become self-employed. The scheme is a payment made by the Department of Social Protection to people aged under 66, who are in receipt of a qualifying social welfare payment 3 out of the last 5 years. Participants in the Back to Work Enterprise Allowance scheme can keep a percentage of their social welfare payment for up to 2 years. </p><p>The Department of Social Protection also offer the Short-Term Enterprise Allowance scheme, which supports those who have lost their job and want to start their own business. The Short-Term Enterprise Allowance is paid instead of your Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit for a maximum of 9 months and ends when your entitlement to Jobseeker's Benefit ends.</p></reply>

It is clear that the Statement needs revision to align enterprise policy with the programme for government renewable energy and climate targets. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to work closely with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications and engage with stakeholders such as Eirgrid, the CRU, IDA Ireland and the data centre sector in developing this revised Statement.  It will set out the existing policy context, and any additional measures required to ensure that the demand for data centre development can be managed prudently to drive the decarbonisation of our electricity system and deliver regional economic opportunities. </p>  <p>  Regulatory measures to manage the impact of demand growth from the technology sector on our electricity system, such as through connection policy or sustainability reporting, may also be required though they are independent of enterprise policy. We will need to ensure that new electricity demands, and the growth of existing demand, are sustainable and use our infrastructure efficiently. The transformation of our electricity and wider energy system, will require innovative and world leading technological and operational solutions on both the supply and demand sides of our energy markets.</p>  <p>  The role of data centres in our economy should be assessed in the context of the total economic value they provide, and not as an isolated economic activity. The important economic and societal role of data services such as video calls, streaming services, and other remote work technology became ever more apparent during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Data centres securely store and manage the data which keeps much of our information-based economy and society moving. These investments underpin the digital economy in which data is the key asset. </p></reply>

This was a landmark legislative project which was the result of many years of detailed and comprehensive work. The Act which was commenced in May 2015 consolidated, simplified and reformed company law to provide a modern framework for all companies regardless of the type of business being operated. The Act strikes a balance between simplifying the day to day running of a business, maintaining the necessary protections for those dealing with companies, such as creditors and investors, and putting in place an effective corporate governance regime to ensure compliance. </p>  <p>  In particular, Part 4 deals with corporate governance and provides for the duties and responsibilities of directors and other officers as regards their appointment, their proceedings in regard to the company and its members and the ways in which the activities of the company on a day-to-day basis are conducted. Part 5 contains the duties of directors and other officers of the company which prior to the 2014 Act were to be found in the common law and in various statutory provisions.  Part 6 contains provisions regarding the accounting records to be kept by companies, the financial statements to be prepared by them, the periodic returns to be made to the Registrar of Companies, and the auditing of financial statements. Part 27, inserted in 2018, sets out the rules for the conduct of statutory auditors and audit firms as required by EU law.</p>  <p>  Broader governance duties and best practices also arise in other areas for which my Department has responsibility for. Indeed, other Departments can have a role especially in respect to sectoral matters. Examples in relation to my Department might include consumer rights, employment rights, occupational health and safety, etc. I would be happy to answer any further questions that the Deputy may have in relation to specific areas under my Department&rsquo;s remit.</p></reply>

The Local Enterprise Office can offer direct grant aid to microenterprises (10 employees or fewer) in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sectors which, over time, have the potential to develop into strong export entities and all schemes and grants can be availed of by any business that meets the relevant eligibility criteria.</p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices offer Feasibility Grants to help start-up companies or individual entrepreneurs with the cost of researching their proposed business idea to ascertain its viability and sustainability and Priming Grants, which aim to help with the associated costs of start-up. </p>  <p>  However, it should be noted that the Local Enterprise Offices do not provide direct grant-aid to areas such as retail, personal services, local professional services or local building services, as it may give rise to the displacement of existing businesses. </p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices provide a wide range of high-quality business and management development programmes that are tailored to meet specific business requirements. Whether it is starting a business or growing a business there is something suitable for anyone exploring self-employment as an option. </p>  <p>  In particular, I would encourage any person starting a business to enquire about the Start Your Own Business Programme. The objective is to assist clients in assessing their business idea, its viability and helps them decide if they should proceed or take a step back. The programme covers topics such as Starting up / getting started, Identifying, understanding, and researching your target market, Developing your Business Plan amongst other vital areas of interest to a new business. </p>  <p>  I would also suggest seeking the advice of a LEO Business Mentor; the Mentor programme is open to both new and existing businesses located within the Local Enterprise Office region and is designed to match up the knowledge, skills, insights and entrepreneurial capability of experienced business practitioners with small business owner/ managers who need practical and strategic one to one advice and guidance. The mentor contributes independent, informed observation and advice to aid decision making. </p>  <p>  Mentors can also advise on finance options available to entrepreneurs and can assist with applications and referrals to Micro-Finance Ireland, which provides vital support to eligible microenterprises by lending to businesses that cannot obtain loans from other commercial lenders and who do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by commercial lenders. It offers loan funding, including Start-up Loans, from &euro;5,000 to &euro;25,000. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Department of Social Protection offers the Back to Work Enterprise Allowance scheme. This scheme encourages people currently receiving certain social welfare payments to become self-employed. The Back to Work Enterprise Allowance scheme is a payment made by the Department of Social Protection to people aged under 66. You can qualify for the Back to Work Enterprise Allowance if you are qualifying from Illness Benefit and are in receipt of a qualifying social welfare payment 3 out of the last 5 years. If you take part in the Back to Work Enterprise Allowance scheme you can keep a percentage of your social welfare payment for up to 2 years.</p></reply>

PIAB is an administrative body that assesses claims based on the personal injuries guidelines and only where both parties, namely the claimant and respondent, consent to an assessment. PIAB does not investigate the circumstances of claims nor address the issue of liability or fraud.</p>  <p>  Under the PIAB process a respondent has 90 days to carry out an appropriate examination of the facts relating to a claim before deciding whether to proceed with the PIAB process or not.  By proceeding with the PIAB process, the respondent would have considered the claimant&rsquo;s case and satisfied itself of the merits or otherwise of it.  Where liability is an issue, or the circumstances of a claim are disputed, the respondent, generally an insurer, will refuse an assessment by PIAB. In those circumstances PIAB will release the case and provide an authorisation to a claimant to proceed to litigation if they so wish.   </p>  <p>  Cases that proceed to Court are subject to the Civil Liability and Courts Act, 2004.  Section 14 of the Act provides that any party to a personal injuries action who has falsely sworn an affidavit is guilty of an offence; Sections 25 and 26 address the matter of false evidence and fraudulent actions and Section 29 sets out the penalties for persons found guilty of such acts, including fines of up to &euro;100,000 and/or up to 10 years in prison.</p>  <p>  The investigation of fraud is a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Any individual or company who believes that they are the victim of a fraud should report it to the Garda&iacute;.  PIAB co-operate fully with any requests for information from the Garda&iacute;.</p>  <p>A range of actions to mitigate insurance fraud are being implemented through the Government&rsquo;s &lsquo;Action Plan for Insurance Reform&rsquo;. Actions already achieved include the signing into law on the 21st of June 2021 of the Criminal Justice (Perjury and Related Offences) Act 2021. This Act provides for considerable penalties against those who commit the offence of perjury and related offences. The establishment of the specialised Insurance Fraud Coordination Office within the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (GNECB) is also significant and provides for a more coordinated approach to the reporting of cases from the insurance industry.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-02-01a.444.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1479" speakername="Ossian Smyth" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020100072#WRL02600"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 210 to 214, inclusive, together.  </p><p>The National Broadband Plan (NBP) is a Government policy initiative that is being achieved through a combination of accelerated commercial investment by telecoms operators, and a State intervention. </p><p>Information regarding the NBP is available on the Department&rsquo;s website at www.broadband.gov.ie.  As a State intervention, the NBP must comply with the requirements of the European Commission&rsquo;s State Aid Guidelines (SAG) on the application of the State aid rules to broadband networks.  The SAG requires, amongst other things, that Member States carry out a detailed mapping exercise and public consultation process to identify, as far as reasonably possible, those areas where intervention is required. </p><p>Since 2013, the Department has engaged in an extensive Mapping Process to map broadband availability across Ireland, in order to identify which geographic areas already have or will have access to Next Generation Access (NGA) broadband services, i.e. a broadband service delivering at least 30Mbps download speeds and which areas required intervention from the State.  Extensive information has been published at every stage of the overall NBP process, including each iteration of the NBP Map and extensive information on the Mapping Process and the development of the NBP Map itself. This information can be found at www.broadband.gov.ie.</p><p>The mapping process included a number of public consultations conducted over a six year period from 2013 to 2019.  The most recent public consultation was in November 2019, which aimed to finalise the NBP Map in advance of signing the NBP contract. This public consultation confirmed the existing and planned coverage of NGA broadband services across Ireland. It relied on the most up to date information available, shared by commercial operators, of their existing and planned broadband services. The Department undertook an analysis of this information and determined where NGA broadband services existed and where it was planned. For example, in some cases, certain operators claimed they were already delivering NGA broadband services whereas the Department determined that, in fact, they were not. </p><p>The content of the operator submissions broadly included details of the operator&rsquo;s network design, technology solution, coverage area of the operator&rsquo;s network, the location and number of sites etc as well as their plans for future deployments if available.  </p><p>Certain operator submissions claimed that NGA broadband services were already in place across the vast majority of rural Ireland and that there was no need for any State intervention in most rural areas, whereas other operators recognised the deficit in NGA broadband services and supported the State&rsquo;s planned intervention.</p><p>Since 2013 and in line with SAG recommendations, the Department has consulted with ComReg on the NBP mapping at every stage of the process. The Department and ComReg established an NBP Expert Group, to have engagement on the key issues and areas relevant to the NBP Intervention, including the Mapping Process.  </p><p>In 2019 consistent with ComReg&rsquo;s role on the NBP Expert Group, ComReg was provided with copies of all operators submissions to the 2019 consultation. These comprised of 29 operator submissions and one group submission representing 28 fixed wireless operators. ComReg supported by their own advisors provided a number of observations on the analysis and draft findings, which were then taken into account when arriving at the conclusion of the Mapping process.</p><p>Each operator was subsequently informed of the outcome of the analysis and the conclusion as to whether their existing and/or planned coverage was accepted as delivering NGA broadband services or not.  The NBP Map was then updated and republished with the most up to date information. The NBP Map can be fou<i>nd at www.broadban</i>d.gov.ie.</p><p>Copies of these operator submissions are already published on my Department&rsquo;s website in the Consultation Submission section of the 2019 Mapping Consultation page at www.gov.ie/en/consultation/61fcf-consultation-on-conclusion-of-the-nbp-mapping-exercise-for-the-intervention-area/.</p><p>In addition, the overall findings and conclusion of the 2019 NBP Mapping Consultation Summary of Findings Report, can be found in the Update 17 December 2019 &ndash; Summary of Findings section of the 2019 Mapping Consultation page at .</p><p>ComReg overall expert opinion is also already published on both ComReg&rsquo;s and the Department&rsquo;s website and can be found in the Update 17 December 2019 &ndash; Summary of Findings section of the 2019 Mapping Consultation page at www.gov.ie/en/consultation/61fcf-consultation-on-conclusion-of-the-nbp-mapping-exercise-for-the-intervention-area/.</p></reply>

Given the significant progress that has been made since then in improving our ambient air monitoring programme, the extension of low smoke zones, and specific Programme for Government commitments to improve the quality of our air, a review of the previous strategy has been required.  </p>  <p>  This has enabled us to incorporate the findings of the public consultation on a new solid fuel regulation for Ireland and capture the positive impacts that the measures provided for in the Climate Action Plan 2021 will have on the quality of our air. The Strategy will also outline how we will enhance and protect the air we breathe, and set out a pathway, based on a comprehensive cross-Government programme of policies and measures, that will tackle all sources of air pollution.</p>  <p>  I intend to launch a public consultation on this Strategy in the coming weeks, and precise timelines will be announced in due course.</p></reply>

The Commissioner has made an important contribution to the Government's overall just transition response in the Midlands region, helping to facilitate dialogue, and bringing forward concerns from affected communities, residents, workers, and businesses. I have received the Commissioner&rsquo;s fourth progress report and I intend to publish it shortly. The Government has responded to the recommendations contained in the Commissioner&rsquo;s earlier reports through the Midlands Implementation Plan, published as part of the Government&rsquo;s Climate Action Plan 2021.</p><p>The Government has committed, through the 2021 Climate Action Plan, to establishing a statutory Just Transition Commission, with the general scheme of legislation to establish the Commission to be completed by the end of this year. The Climate Action Plan sets out that the purpose of this Commission will be to provide strategic advice to Government, integrating its role with existing governance and engagement structures, on how Government policy can further a just transition. </p><p>I intend to progress and develop proposals on the mandate of the statutory Just Transition Commission during the course of 2022 in advance of preparing the general scheme of legislation. In this context, and building on the work that he has undertaken to date in relation to the Midlands region, I intend that Mr. Mulvey will continue to support me in an advisory capacity on the development of policy to underpin the proposed statutory Just Transition Commission  . </p></reply>

The Just Transition Fund seeks to address the adverse effects of the climate transition by supporting the most affected territories and workers concerned and to promote a balanced socio-economic transition.    Ireland must prepare a Territorial Just Transition Plan and accompanying programme, for approval by the European Commission, in order to secure access to its allocation of &euro;84.5 million under the EU Just Transition Fund. This plan and programme will set out Ireland&rsquo;s proposed investment priorities as well as targeted sectors and regions. I have appointed the Eastern and Midland Regional Assembly (EMRA) as managing authority for the fund, and my Department and the EMRA are jointly developing the Territorial Just Transition Plan and Programme. </p>  <p>  I launched a public consultation on a draft of the Territorial Just Transition Plan on 20 December and this will remain open until 14 February. The draft plan provisionally identifies East Galway, North Tipperary, Longford, Laois, Offaly, Westmeath, West Kildare and Roscommon as the functional territory to be targeted for investment under the plan. </p>  <p>  Feedback on the draft plan is being gathered through an online survey as well as through online workshops open to interested stakeholders. A dedicated workshop is also planned to gather the views of young people aged 16-24 who are living, working, or studying in the wider Midlands region. The online survey seeks views on the impact of the climate transition, the development needs of the wider Midlands region, and comments on the draft Territorial Just Transition Plan. My Department and the EMRA have also held dedicated briefing sessions, respectively, for members of the Oireachtas and for members and staff of relevant Local Authorities from the identified counties.</p>  <p>  The responses to the public consultation will be used to further develop and finalise the draft Territorial Just Transition Plan before it is agreed by the Government and submitted, together with the EU Just Transition Fund programme, to the European Commission for approval during the course of 2022.</p></reply>

The Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021, significantly strengthens the statutory framework for governance of the climate challenge. The new framework ensures delivery of successive Climate Action Plans and Long-term Climate Strategies, supported by a system of carbon budgeting and sectoral targets with appropriate oversight by Government, the Oireachtas and a new Climate Change Advisory Council. Under the 2021 Act, Ministers will have to give an account of their performance in relation to their sectoral targets and actions before an Oireachtas Committee each year. This framework replaces the previous ATS process.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the changes introduced by the 2021 Act, I intend to publish an ATS for 2020. This ATS will set out information on developments in respect of 2019, as was required under the 2015 Act before it was amended.

The Act also provides for a 51% reduction in greenhouse gases by 2030, compared to 2018 levels, and puts in place a rigorous governance structure, including a requirement for Government to prepare a National Long Term Climate Action Strategy at least once every five-years.</p>  <p>  As we finalise Ireland&rsquo;s LTS, we will ensure that the ambition aligns with our recently legislated for climate targets, as well as making a strong contribution to the overall EU ambition of achieving climate neutrality no later than 2050 and achieving an interim reduction in overall EU greenhouse gas emissions of 55% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels. Similarly, the LTS will support our commitment to the international objective of limiting global warming to 1.5&deg;c relative to pre-industrial levels, as established under the Paris Climate Accords and recently reaffirmed in the Glasgow Climate Pact.</p>  <p>  Ireland, as one of several Member States still to submit its Long-term Climate Strategy, has continued to engage with the European Commission on this issue, and has fully appraised the Commission of the approach as set out above.</p></reply>

More recently, the ESRI carried out an analysis of the number of households at risk of experiencing energy poverty. This showed that the share of households needing to spend more than 10% of their income on their energy needs was 17.5% in 2020. The Survey on Income and Living Conditions indicates that the proportion of people who report that they are unable to afford to keep the home adequately warm, had fallen from 9% in 2015 to 3.4% in 2020.</p><p>A review of the implementation of the Strategy to Combat Energy Poverty will be completed in the coming months and will inform next steps in relation to the development of a new strategy. Measures to support those least able to afford to retrofit their homes have also be included in the new National Residential Retrofit Plan, published as part of the Climate Action Plan last November.</p><p>A range of schemes to assist low-income households with energy costs are also available from the Department of Social Protection. Budget 2022 has provided for a &euro;5 increase to the Fuel Allowance to &euro;33 per week, or &euro;924 per year, as well as an extension of the eligibility criteria for the payment.</p><p>Protections are also in place for customers falling into arrears on their energy bills. Under the supplier led voluntary Energy Engage Code, suppliers will not disconnect a customer who is engaging with them. Suppliers must also provide every opportunity to customers to avoid disconnection and must identify customers at risk of disconnection and encourage them to engage as early as possible.</p><p>A scheme to credit all domestic electricity account holders with &euro;100 in 2022 was approved by Government in December 2021. This payment is one of a suite of measures to mitigate the effects of the recent significant rises in electricity prices, which includes support through the social protection system. Approximately 2.1 million domestic electricity account holders will benefit from the scheme for a one-off, exceptional payment to their electricity accounts. The scheme will apply to all domestic accounts, including pay as you go customers.</p></reply>

CAP21 also set out an ambitious National Retrofit Plan detailing how the targets to retrofit 500,000 dwellings and to deploy 600,000 heat pump installations, in both new and existing dwellings, would be met. The National Retrofit Plan estimates that, between 2019 and 2025, almost 185,000 home energy upgrades will be delivered with over 83,000 to a B2/cost optimal level. When the emissions savings from the non-B2 upgrades are included, this is the equivalent of 120,000 B2 upgrades over the period. As a result, there will a need to deliver, on average, approximately 75,000 B2-equivalent home upgrades per year from 2026 to 2030 to achieve the overall target of 500,000 by 2030. My Department has not separately modelled the emissions savings associated with less ambitious building energy ratings.</p><p>A significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from the residential sector resulting from the National Retrofit Plan is not likely to be seen until the latter half of the decade, as numbers of dwellings retrofitted increase as set out above.</p><p>Aside from reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, residential retrofit brings additional benefits, including reduced energy costs, improved comfort and health, less dependency on fossil fuels, and improvements in indoor and outdoor air quality.</p><p>CAP21 contains a range of measures and targets across all sectors of the economy, including targets for increased renewable electricity generation, increased in sustainable mobility, and for the built environment in general. Other targets in the built environment sector include:</p> <blockquote> 	Strengthening the existing Nearly Zero Energy Building (NZEB) requirements for new dwellings to effectively ban fossil fuels in new dwellings;<br /><br />Ramp-up of zero emissions heat in commercial building; and <br /><br />Increased targets for the roll-out of district heating. </blockquote>  <p>Reaching the targets set out in our Climate Action Plans and reducing our greenhouse gas emissions will only be achieved by all sectors of the economy and society working together to reach our common goal.</p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from local authorities' own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.</p>  <p>  The primary focus for capital investment under the regional and local road grant programme continues to be the maintenance and renewal of the regional and local road network, targeted safety/minor schemes together with the implementation of a number of the larger regional and local road projects under the Strategic Grant category which were included in the original National Development Plan and which are now at construction stage. Some limited provision is being made in the capital budget for the appraisal of a pipeline of upgrade projects. This is intended to cover the appraisal of projects for future development, if possible.   </p>  <p>  Any road improvement projects proposed by local authorities for consideration for funding are assessed by the Department on a case-by-case basis. All projects put forward by local authorities for consideration must comply with the requirements of the Public Spending Code and my Department's Capital Appraisal Framework.</p>  <p>  The revised Public Spending Code requires a Strategic Assessment Report (SAR) for all projects with an estimated expenditure of &euro;10 million or more. The SAR is now a key deliverable at the first decision stage in the project appraisal process. Following the completion of a SAR by Carlow County Council concerning options in relation to a potential Southern Relief Road, the Council has recently been given clearance to proceed to prepare a Preliminary Business Case.</p>  <p>  As regards Kilkenny, there has been some engagement between Kilkenny County Council and my Department in relation to a proposed Kilkenny Northern Ring Road Extension. The Department advised the Council, early in 2021, of the Public Spending Code project appraisal requirements for any proposed transport scheme, including the need for the preparation of a SAR. There has not been any further contact from the Council regarding this proposed scheme.</p></reply>

My Department is engaging with relevant stakeholders to inform this work and it is envisaged that the strategy will be published for consultation in early 2022.</p><p>Preparations are underway to establish an Office of Low Emission Vehicles. This Office will play an important role in our transition to zero emission vehicles.

My Department is reviewing the Scheme at present to ensure that it is as effective as possible in driving the decarbonisation effort. </p><p>The Department is working closely with a number of key stakeholders, including Local Government, to ensure electric vehicle charging infrastructure stays ahead of demand. This includes developing appropriate guidance for local authorities in line with the Programme for Government which will ensure we can continue to expand our national charging network through the supports for on street chargers.</p><p>I am also aware that a report was published by the CCMA on the provision of guidance to local authorities on the provision of charging infrastructure. The document is available for viewing online at <i>www.lgma.ie/en/publications/general-publications/local-authority-electrification-of-fleet-and-ev-charging-guidance.pdf</i>.</p><p>&euro;10 million was committed from the Climate Action Fund (CAF) to support ESB investment in the charging network and this has leveraged a further &euro;10 million investment from ESB.

It was necessary to prioritise projects for funding in a manner which seeks to achieve key outcomes in line with the NDP. Resulting from this, while a large majority of the projects under the NDP were issued a funding allocation in 2022, TII were unable to provide an allocation for the N24 Waterford to Cahir and N25 Waterford to Glenmore projects.

Key to this is a radical shift to sustainable mobility. This includes a 2025 target metric of 125,000 additional public transport and active travel journeys per day, increasing to 500,000 by 2030.  Achieving this target, along with reducing ICE car kilometres by 10%, is estimated to deliver c. 1.4 MtCO2eq. abatement.</p>  <p>  The increased number of daily sustainable journeys will be achieved by ramping up investment to provide more attractive active travel and public transport options to promote modal shift away from car dependence. In addition, the reduced use of fossil-fueled cars over that time will be achieved through various demand management and behavioural change measures. Daily journeys on public transport are estimated to increase from 12% to 21% by 2030. My Department will also continue to review and refine measures to deliver additional abatement in a fair and equitable manner.</p>  <p>  However, the modelling used for CAP21 transport measures does not estimate the carbon emissions in the manner the Deputy has requested. There are any number of variables at play in estimating carbon impacts from modal shift including journey distance, profile of car use, urban or rural journey location amongst other factors. </p>  <p>  I have, therefore, referred the Deputy's question to the NTA to provide a direct update on what analysis the model can provide in terms of modal shift and carbon reduction impacts. Please advise my private office if you do not receive a response within ten working days.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-02-01a.642.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020100075#WRO03500"><p>Revenue&rsquo;s role in relation to the supply of taxable solid fuels in the State lies in the collection of Solid Fuel Carbon Tax (SFCT) and VAT.</p>  <p>  Solid fuel (coal and peat) is liable to excise duty in this jurisdiction in the form of Solid Fuel Carbon Tax (SFCT), which is a national excise that applies at different rates to four categories of solid fuel: coal, peat briquettes, milled peat and other peat. Liability to SFCT arises when solid fuel is first supplied in the State for use as a fuel. SFCT is payable by a taxable person who makes that first supply of solid fuel in the State. An SFCT return is required one month after the end of the two-month accounting period in which the supply is made.</p>  <p>  Coal and peat are not &ldquo;excisable&rdquo; products. This means that coal and peat are not covered by the EU Control and Movement regime for excisable products (e.g. alcohol, tobacco) so, under EU rules, Revenue cannot impose any barriers to their movement into the State from other Member States or Northern Ireland. The movement of solid fuel into the State from Northern Ireland (or from anywhere in the EU) does not generate a liability to SFCT nor does the physical presence of solid fuel in the State. It is not until solid fuel is first supplied within the State that SFCT becomes liable. Therefore, there is no smuggling offence, in terms of evasion of SFCT, attaching to coal coming into the State from Northern Ireland. No Revenue offence arises where coal or other solid fuels are brought into the State or placed on the market here. Even if controls were possible, a person transporting solid fuel from Northern Ireland could claim that SFCT will be accounted for in due course if relevant first supplies of the transported solid fuel are later made in the State. </p>  <p>  SFCT is not an import duty and does not become due until a first supply is made in the State. Every supplier who intends to make a first supply of liable solid fuel in the State must register with Revenue for the purposes of the tax. Where a solid fuel supplier based in the State sources some or all of their solid fuel supplies from outside the State, they will be accountable for SFCT when they make first supplies in the State and must register with Revenue to account for and pay SFCT. Where a supplier based outside the State delivers solid fuel into the State to a private individual, they must register with Revenue and pay the tax. This means that suppliers from outside the State, including Northern Ireland, who take orders for delivery to private individuals in the State are liable for SFCT and must register with Revenue. Similarly, courier companies who advertise on websites of solid fuel suppliers based in other jurisdictions offering to supply and deliver solid fuel direct to consumers in the State are liable for SFCT and must register with Revenue. It is important to note that where an individual personally purchases solid fuel outside the State and accompanies that solid fuel into the State, they do not have an SFCT liability provided the fuel is for their own private use. However, if that individual, instead of using the solid fuel themselves, supplies it to another person in the State, they will have made a first supply and will be liable to pay SFCT and must register with Revenue accordingly.</p>  <p>  With regard to VAT, under the terms of the Protocol on Ireland / Northern Ireland, transactions involving the movement of goods (not services) between Ireland and Northern Ireland in either direction continue to be treated as intra-Community transactions and subject to EU VAT rules. These rules apply to business to business (B2B) supplies of goods to / from Northern Ireland to taxable persons in Ireland and other EU Member States. The goods, including fuel products, are supplied at the zero rate of VAT and the taxable person in receipt of those goods self-accounts for VAT on a reverse-charge basis and, if applicable, takes a simultaneous VAT deduction in their next VAT return. The onward distribution and sale of a fuel product to a consumer in the State is subject to the normal VAT rules and the Irish supplier is liable to account for VAT, at the reduced rate of 13.5%, on the supply. The consideration for a supply of goods or services is defined in EU VAT law and consists of everything which the supplier is entitled to receive in return for goods or services supplied including taxes, duties, levies and charges, excluding the VAT itself. Therefore, VAT is chargeable on the solid fuel carbon tax element of fuel products.</p>  <p>  Where a business in Northern Ireland sells goods and arranges the transport of those goods to a consumer in Ireland, such sales of fuel products are referred to as intra-Community distance sales. Intra-Community distance sales of fuel products from Northern Ireland to a consumer in a Member State are subject to VAT in the destination Member State, which would be Ireland if the consumer is based in this State. In such cases, the supplier of those goods is required to register, subject to a threshold, in the State and account for VAT on those supplies.</p>  <p>  VAT and SFCT are self-assessed taxes and compliance with the law is enforced using the full range of compliance interventions and enforcement provisions for self-assessed taxes. Compliance interventions and audits are undertaken on a risk-assessed basis. Liable fuel suppliers must register with Revenue and file relevant VAT and SFCT returns and pay any tax due by the due dates. Where suppliers do not submit returns by the due date, Revenue will issue an estimate of the tax(es) due. The estimate is the amount of tax that Revenue will pursue if a supplier does not complete and file their return. If a taxpayer fails to pay the amount due, including any debt for which an estimate has issued, Revenue may refer the debt for enforcement action. This can include sheriff enforcement, civil proceedings through the courts or attachment of third parties.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy asks about the enforcement of the new environmental standards on solid fuel which are due to come into force in September 2022. This is separate to taxation matters.  I understand that laws relating to national standards for solid fuel come under the ambit of the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communication and are enforced through the local authorities operating under those laws. I am advised that Revenue does not have a role in relation to these environmental enforcement matters. While Revenue cannot impose any obstacles to the free movement of solid fuels into the State from other Member States and Northern Ireland, I understand that such imports are open to challenge by Local Authorities if the fuel does not meet environmental standards in this State. The same environmental standards apply to all solid fuel regardless of how they have been placed on the market in Ireland, including through online sales or other forms of advertising. </p></reply>

As the Deputy is aware, we have established the Cabinet Committee Sub-Group on Insurance Reform, chaired by the T&aacute;naiste, which is overseeing the implementation of the Action Plan for Insurance Reform. This ambitious plan sets out 66 actions to help bring down the cost of insurance; introduce more competition into the market; prevent fraud, thus benefitting consumers, the business community and voluntary organisations.</p>  <p>  A significant achievement of the Action Plan is the establishment of the Office to Promote Competition in the Insurance Market. This Office, which is chaired by Minister of State Fleming, operates within the Department of Finance. Its aims are to help expand the risk appetite of existing insurers and explore opportunities for new market entrants in order to increase the availability of insurance. In relation to this, the Office is working with IDA Ireland to help leverage the ongoing insurance reforms with the aim of targeting new entrants to the Irish market or encouraging current incumbents to expand into underserved areas. Since its establishment, the Office has held over 60 meetings with a wide range of stakeholders including insurance companies, voluntary groups and representative bodies on issues surrounding competition. Minister Fleming also recently met with the CEOs of the major insurance providers in Ireland, and they have confirmed that they are passing on savings achieved as a result of Government reforms to customers. </p>  <p>  Through initiatives such as the Action Plan, this Government is committed to securing a more sustainable and competitive market through deepening and widening the supply of insurance in Ireland. In this regard, it is my intention to continue working with my Government colleagues to ensure the timely implementation of the Action Plan, which will bring benefits to the wider economy and society. </p></reply>

Further development of SME lending in a controlled manner could also assist credit unions in growing and diversifying their loan book. Further, in November five credit unions were announced as participants in the &euro;330m Brexit Impact Loan Scheme (BILS). The BILS is a successor to the Brexit Loan Scheme and provides low-cost loans of &euro;25,000 to &euro;1.5m to eligible Brexit-impacted businesses. While its predecessor had been available through participating banks, the BILS will now also be available through participating credit unions, ensuring wider accessibility of the scheme.</p><p>In total, SME lending has grown 6.9% year on year to end September 2021.</p><p>Access to Finance for Retrofit </p><p>The Government significantly increased the funding available to support retrofit in Budget 2022.

Parts or accessories are also liable to VAT at the standard rate. There is no provision under existing VAT law that would make it possible to apply a reduced rate or zero rate to the supply of such products. Under the EU VAT Directive, Member States may retain the zero rate on goods and services which were in place on 1 January 1991, but cannot extend the zero rate to new goods and services. As such a zero rate cannot presently be applied to defibrillators. </p>  <p>  The EU Commission published a proposal on the reform of VAT rates in January 2018 which would allow Member States more flexibility in how they apply VAT rates. The compromise text agreed at ECOFIN in December has been amended significantly in comparison to the original proposal so the EU Parliament will once again be consulted for their opinion. </p>  <p>  Once the Parliament has issued its opinion on the proposal, the Council will formally adopt the directive.

However, it is important to note that neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can direct the pricing or provision of insurance products, as this is a commercial matter which individual companies assess on a case-by-case basis. This position is reinforced by the EU Single Market framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive).</p><p>Notwithstanding this, my officials contacted Insurance Ireland, the representative body for the insurance industry, to seek further information on this specific matter.  While unable to discuss the underwriting criteria of individual members, it has advised that in general, a material change in the use of a vehicle may lead to a different premium being applied. Insurance Ireland stated that this can reflect different risk classifications, and that customers should discuss the matter with their insurance provider. </p><p>According to Insurance Ireland, its members in the main fully acknowledge the important role their CFR customers play and generally do not apply a loading to a private motor policy for these cohorts of volunteers, provided they are not receiving a payment for this service. However, I understand from Insurance Ireland that the approach taken by each insurer is on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration, for example, the amount of driving experience an individual has, whether any advance driver training has been undertaken, the age and condition of the vehicle, etc.</p><p>Finally, it is understood from Insurance Ireland that while this generally applies for normal use of the vehicle, any non-standard use of the vehicle, for example, an actual mountain rescue that involves driving off-road, would not fall under this general rule, and should be discussed directly with the individual insurer.</p><p>In conclusion, it may be useful for the Deputy to know that Insurance Ireland operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to insurance. This can be contacted at<i>feedback@insuranceireland.eu</i>.</p></reply>

In order to qualify for relief, the applicant must hold a Primary Medical Certificate issued by the relevant Senior Area Medical Officer (SAMO) or a Board Medical Certificate issued by the Disabled Driver Medical Board of Appeal. To qualify for a Primary Medical Certificate an applicant must be permanently and severely disabled, and satisfy at least one of the six medical criteria. </p>  <p>  I have no role in relation to the granting or refusal of PMCs and the HSE and the Medical Board of Appeal must be independent in their clinical determinations.</p>  <p>  The current medical criteria were included in the Finance Act 2020, by way of amendment to Section 92 of the Finance Act 1989. This amendment arises from legal advice in light of the June 2020 Supreme Court judgement that the medical criteria in secondary legislation was not deemed to be invalid, nevertheless it was found to be inconsistent with the mandate provided in Section 92 of the Finance Act 1989 (primary legislation).</p>  <p>  In light of the resignations of the board members from the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, Department of Finance officials are working with the Department of Health and the Public Appointments Service in terms of seeking expressions of interest from medical practitioners to participate in the Board. It is hoped to move this process along as quickly as possible to then appoint five members, so that appeals can recommence as early as possible.</p>  <p>  Requests for appeal hearings can be sent to the DDMBA secretary based in the National Rehabilitation Hospital. New appeal hearing dates will be issued once the new Board is in place. Assessments for the primary medical certificate, by the HSE, are continuing to take place. </p></reply>

It is a voluntary tool aimed primarily for use by financial services firms and large companies.</p>  <p>  In December 2021, the European Commission shared with Member States a draft Delegated Act under the Taxonomy, which would see certain natural gas and nuclear investments deemed sustainable during a transition period if they meet a range of conditions.  Following the receipt of observations from Member States, the European Commission is deliberating as to what approach to take.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will know, Ireland&rsquo;s Climate Action Plan acknowledges that we will use natural gas as part of our energy mix, particularly as a base reserve to provide supply when renewables are unable to meet demand, which will help  provide consumers and businesses with the confidence to electrify. This is likely to be the case for other Member States as well. However, it does not necessarily follow that all activities necessary to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 should be included in the Taxonomy. </p>  <p>  in relation to the draft Delegated Act, Ireland has submitted observations to the Commission expressing doubt over whether their draft text takes the appropriate approach on natural gas, particularly with regard to emission limits, while recognising that natural gas will be necessary for the transition to net zero while providing energy security across European countries. </p>  <p>  We have encouraged the Commission to continue its plans to develop an extension to the Taxonomy beyond environmentally sustainable economic activities that would cover intermediate performance, which could be an appropriate way of reflecting the performance and impact of transitional activities.</p>  <p>  The generation of energy from nuclear power is statute-barred in Ireland and the Government has no plans to revisit this legislative prohibition.</p></reply>

Exemptions from VAT for certain activities in the public interest are set out in Chapter 2 of Title IX of the Directive. These provisions are transposed into Irish legislation in Part 1, Schedule 1, VAT Consolidation Act 2010. Paragraph 2(5) of Schedule 1 provides for an exemption in respect of the supply of professional dental services.</p>  <p>  The exemption from VAT in respect of dental services is not dependent on the legal form of the taxable person supplying the service. It is the nature of the service that informs the VAT treatment. The legislation which transposes Article 132 of the Directive, and Revenue&rsquo;s interpretation of the legislation, ensures that the exemption from VAT to the supply of dental services is applied consistently and in a manner which is not dependent on the legal form of the person supplying the service. In accordance with the Directive and CJEU jurisprudence the VAT exemption applies to dental services provided by a clinic, a principal dentist, or by an associate dentist, where those services are provided to a patient.</p>  <p>  Where a principal dentist receives consideration in respect of fee sharing arrangements and the nature of services consists of the supply of facilities for the carrying on of a dental practice, Revenue views this as a taxable supply of services within the scope of VAT. The final consumer in this fee sharing arrangement is not a patient availing of a supply of dental services to which the exemption applies.</p>  <p>  Revenue has been clear at all times regarding the VAT treatment of dental fee sharing arrangements and has outlined its position in correspondence and meetings with the Irish Dental Association.</p></reply>

Specifically that the expenses are wholly, exclusively and necessarily incurred in the performance of the duties of the office or employment by the employee concerned and that such expenses are not reimbursed by his or her employer. </p>  <p>  The FRE regime was established to apply a uniformity of approach to tax deductibility for expenses of large groups of employees and to facilitate ease of administration for both Revenue and employees. The expense should apply to all employees in a particular category and not be discretionary. I am advised by Revenue that it will consider FRE applications where a large number of employees incur broadly identical qualifying expenses, which are not reimbursed by their employer. The regime applies to employees across a wide range of trades and professions.</p>  <p>  Applications are generally made by the representative bodies in the employment sector concerned, and are considered by Revenue based on the specific commonality of expenses within the employment category and compliance with the strictly applied, statutory requirement for a tax deduction. The fact that social care workers are not included in the most recent FRE list is a result of an appropriate application not having been made to Revenue.  I am further advised by Revenue that should a submission be submitted from the representative body, outlining the expenses incurred by social care workers, which satisfy the legislative conditions,  it will be considered.</p>  <p>  Finally, all employees retain their statutory right to claim a deduction under section 114 of the TCA 1997, in respect of an expense incurred wholly, exclusively and necessarily in the performance of the duties of their employment, to the extent, which the expense is not reimbursed by the employer.  It should be noted  that PAYE workers can claim section 114 expenses by completing an Income Tax return at year end.

The credit is granted in the first instance to the primary claimant who may, if he or she so wishes, relinquish it for the year of assessment to a secondary claimant.</p><p>A single person, for the purposes of the SPCCC, is an individual who is not:<ol type="1"><li>jointly assessed to tax as a married person or civil partner;</li><li>living with his or her spouse or civil partner; or </li><li>cohabiting with a partner.</li></ol>A qualifying child includes a child born in the tax year, a child who was under the age of 18 at the start of the tax year, or a child who was over the age of 18 at the start of the tax year if he or she is either in full-time education or is permanently incapacitated by reason of mental or physical infirmity from maintaining themselves (having become so incapacitated before reaching the age of 21 or whilst in full-time education).  </p><p>Further information on the SPCCC is available in Tax and Duty Manual Part 15-01-41 which can be found at the following link: www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/tdm/income-tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax/part-15/15-01-41.pdf.</p><p>Where an individual is cohabiting with a partner, he or she will not therefore be entitled to the SPCCC. The Revenue office which deals with the individual&rsquo;s tax affairs will be able to assist in determining the full range of credits and reliefs which he or she may be entitled to claim, based on their personal circumstances.  Contact details for Revenue offices can also be found on the Revenue website at this link: www.revenue.ie/en/contact-us/index.aspx.</p><p>The arrangements and associated legislation for the purposes of payments or allowances under the remit of the Department of Social Protection in relation to married couples, civil partners and cohabiting couples are a matter for the Minister for Social Protection and her Department. </p><p>Finally, I might take this opportunity to make a general point in relation to the differences in the tax treatment for married couples or civil partners compared to a couple who is cohabiting. In situations where a couple is cohabiting, rather than married or in a civil partnership, each partner is treated for the purposes of income tax as a separate and unconnected individual. Because they are treated separately for tax purposes, credits, tax bands and reliefs cannot be transferred from one partner to the other.  </p><p>The basis for the current tax treatment of married couples derives from the Supreme Court decision in Murphy vs. Attorney General (1980). This decision was based on Article 41.3.1 of the Constitution where the State pledges to protect the institution of marriage. The decision held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple, both of whom are working, to pay more tax than two single people living together and having the same income. </p><p>To the extent that there are differences in the tax treatment of the different categories of couples, such differences arise from the objective of dealing with different types of circumstances while at the same time respecting the constitutional requirements to protect the institution of marriage. Cohabitants do not have the same legal rights and obligations as a married couple or couple in a civil partnership which is why they are not accorded similar tax treatment to couples who have a civil status that is recognised in law. Any change in the tax treatment of cohabiting couples can only be addressed in the broader context of future social and legal policy development in relation to such couples.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-02-01a.702.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020100076#WRP03500"><p>There have been significant and sustained increases in the prices of a broad range of commonly used goods and materials in the construction sector.  Commencing with steel and timber in the second half of 2020, inflationary pressures broadened out to impact a range of other commonly used materials throughout 2021. Not all materials are experiencing price increases but the breath of increases and the range of materials impacted has not been experienced in well over a decade.</p><p>It is important to note that not all projects are impacted to the same degree.  That will depend on whether the range of materials specified are subject to price increases in excess of the normal or anticipated level of inflation for that material, whether the contractor has agreed fixed prices with their suppliers in advance of the increases or whether the contractor was in a position to stockpile the necessary materials.</p><p>In addition to price inflation, there is a shortage of certain materials and longer delivery periods. These increases and shortages are predominantly associated with disruption to global supply chains from the onset of the pandemic, rising energy and transportation costs, Brexit trade disruption and increased demand driven by stimulus packages announced globally. It is not evident yet as to the duration of these market conditions, the potential for further volatility or price increases, or whether prices might return to prior levels.</p><p>Government policy (through Circular 33/06) requires all public works projects that are delivered under the Exchequer-funded element of the National Development Plan to be procured in accordance with the provisions laid down in the Capital Works Management Framework (CWMF).  Public works contracts are fixed price contracts, which are to be comprehensively defined prior to tender. The contractor prices for the risk of increases in the cost of labour, materials and certain changes in law for the periods specified.</p><p>Whilst the provisions contained in the public works contracts dealing with price inflation have operated to deal with inflationary pressures over the years since their introduction, the price movements experienced on construction materials over the past 12 months have arisen suddenly and with no warning. In response to this challenge, I announced a series of measures in November to address the risks posed. </p><p>The Office of Government Procurement (OGP) issued procurement guidance to assist public bodies in managing the challenges they face concluding &lsquo;live&rsquo; tenders in light of the significant price increases that have arisen since tenders were submitted. This guidance is aimed at contracting authorities who have invited or received tenders and covers the following situations:<ol type="1"><li>Where tenders have been received but a Contract is yet to be awarded,</li><li>Those live tenders where the deadline for receipt of tenders has not passed; and</li><li>Tenders that are yet to commence.</li></ol>With reference to future tenders, the OGP published interim amendments to the provisions in the public works contracts on 7 January 2022. Within certain parameters, these amendments will reduce the level of risk of extraordinary price inflation that contractors will have to bear, while also enabling the Exchequer to obtain cost reductions should exceptional price reductions occur during the course of the works.</p><p>The measures are designed to encourage confidence in the tender process and to mitigate against the over-provision for price inflation in tender prices.  This is achieved by addressing the risk of price inflation in the period between tender submission and award through the introduction of limited indexation of the tender price. The fixed price period has been reduced to 24 months from the date of contract award. Mutual cost recovery within the fixed price period is now permitted for material price changes in excess of 15%.</p><p>With respect to contracts that have been awarded prior to the introduction of these measures on 7 January 2022, the pre-existing provisions for inflation contained in the public works contracts published prior to that date continue to apply as these were the terms entered into by the parties. </p><p>Further amendments on price inflation will be developed for consultation with stakeholders in 2022, which will form part of the ongoing Capital Works Management Framework review.</p></reply>

Well-being is a multi-dimensional concept and it is intended that the monitoring and evaluation of the pilot will be aligned with the holistic approach to wellbeing dimensions set out in the Government&rsquo;s Well-being Framework for Ireland, which looks at 11 different wellbeing dimensions, including, for example, Mental and Physical Health, Community, Social Connection and Cultural Participation, Civic Engagement and Cultural Expression, Income and Wealth, and a measure of Subjective Wellbeing.</p>  <p>  I believe that this BIA will be a significant support for the wellbeing of those participating in the scheme and the collection of data on wellbeing indicators will provide the evidence base on this issue.</p></reply>

In addition, dredging campaigns within a busy local authority harbour or berthing pocket for fishing vessels within a local authority harbour would also be a matter for that Minister. </p><p>As the Minister of State with responsibility for Planning and Local Government my current responsibilities are not sector-specific and cover a wide range of development types including other dredging works which do not fall under the remit of the Minister of Agriculture, Food and Marine. </p><p>The Foreshore Act 1933, as amended, requires that a lease or licence must be obtained from the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government for the carrying out of works or placing structures or material on, or for the occupation of or removal of material from, State-owned foreshore, which represents the greater part of the foreshore. The Act provides for the issuing of licences or leases which are in the public interest and provides for the removal of any material within the foreshore and not more than thirty feet below the surface thereof</p><p>The Department&rsquo;s website (see: www.gov.ie/en/service/a5994-how-to-apply-for-foreshore-consent <i>) </i>provides guidance on how to apply for Foreshore Consent, the first step of which is to meet with Department officials to discuss the proposal. At this pre-application phase, applicants are advised to ensure they are aware of the relevant planning, environmental impact assessment and appropriate assessment rules, including public participation requirements where applicable.</p><p>The process times for foreshore licenses may vary from application to application depending on the nature of the works proposed, the complexity of the environmental reports to be considered and the nature of the engagement of the applicant with the process overall. </p><p>The enactment of the Marine Area Planning (MAP) Act in December 2021 has delivered a new legislative basis &ndash; allowing for the regulation of Ireland&rsquo;s maritime area usage outside the 12 nautical mile coastal zone for the first time. The comprehensive and coherent marine planning regime, laid out in the MAP Act, aims to streamline the application process making it more efficient. </p><p>The legislation provides for the establishment of the Maritime Area Regulatory Authority (MARA), a dedicated maritime area agency. This is a priority for government. This work is being led my Department and will be in place by Q1 2023. </p></reply>

These regulations provide for specified classes of houses to be excluded from sale, including those provided to local authorities under Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000.</p><p>The Part V provisions seek to promote social integration and secure mixed tenure, sustainable communities. Accordingly, Part V properties are excluded from the scheme to ensure the original policy goals of the legislation are not eroded over time and the properties remain available for people most in need of social housing support.</p><p>In line with commitments in <i>Housing for All, A New Housing Plan for Ireland</i>, I recently introduced changes to the Tenant Purchase Scheme. These included <i>inter alia </i>revising the minimum income criteria for applicants downwards from &euro;15,000 to &euro;12,500, thereby allowing older tenants in particular (whose only income might be the contributory or non-contributory State pension) to buy their homes if they have the means.</p></reply>

Whilst the original intention was that these properties would be sold on as affordable homes once demand increased to a level that would stimulate a sale, following the financial crash, developments in the housing market resulted in significantly reduced demand for affordable housing and a build-up of unsold affordable housing units in a number of localauthrity areas.</p><p>A data collection exercise in 2020 identified over 2,000 USAs across 19 local authorities with outstanding loans to the Housing Finance Agency (HFA).

The Housing Agency will take over testing, sampling and categorisation of homes on behalf of homeowners and local authorities and will thereafter recommend the appropriate remediation option and grant amount for each home. </p><p>- Alternative accommodation and storage costs are to be included, subject to a maximum of &euro;20,000.</p><p>- &euro;5,000 will be available for essential immediate repair works recommended by a building professional as part of the Building Condition Assessment process.</p><p>- In relation to works carried out under remediation options 2-5, a second grant option, will be available for such a home in the future if blockwork which was not removed as part of the initial remediation work subsequently proves defective in accordance with the IS:465 standard.</p><p>- A new independent appeals process will be introduced.</p><p>- The Scheme will be extended beyond the current scope of Principal Private Residences only, to also cover Residential Tenancies Board registered rental properties, subject to the introduction of a clawback mechanism upon re-sale within a set time period depending on the remediation option used.

An indicative rate of &euro;145 per square foot for the first 1,000 sq. foot with a sliding scale thereafter has been announced by my Department and this will be subject to review as required in line with construction cost changes. In the case of remediation options 2-5 a similar but necessarily different approach will be taken to inform the appropriate rate for blockwork removal and replacement following consultation with SCSI.</p><p>- A revised application process will be introduced which will only require the homeowner to submit an initial &lsquo;Building Condition Assessment&rsquo; at minimal cost recoupable on entry to the Scheme. The Housing Agency will take over testing, sampling and categorisation of homes on behalf of homeowners and local authorities and will thereafter recommend the appropriate remediation option and grant amount for each home. </p><p>- Alternative accommodation and storage costs are to be included, subject to a maximum of &euro;20,000.</p><p>- &euro;5,000 will be available for essential immediate repair works recommended by a building professional as part of the Building Condition Assessment process.</p><p>- In relation to works carried out under remediation options 2-5, a second grant option, will be available for such a home in the future if blockwork which was not removed as part of the initial remediation work subsequently proves defective in accordance with the IS:465 standard.</p><p>- A new independent appeals process will be introduced.</p><p>- The Scheme will be extended beyond the current scope of Principal Private Residences only, to also cover Residential Tenancies Board registered rental properties, subject to the introduction of a clawback mechanism upon re-sale within a set time period depending on the remediation option used. Opportunities for the State to acquire such rental properties for social housing purposes will also be examined.</p><p>Full details in relation to the changes announced are available at the following link;</p><p><i>www.gov.ie/en/press-release/e365e-minister-obrien-announces-enhancements-to-the-defective-concrete-block-scheme/</i>.</p><p>I aim to bring the required primary legislation to give effect to the enhanced scheme before the Oireachtas as soon as possible with Spring 2022 being the indicative target timeline.</p><p>In the immediate term I am making amendments to the Dwellings Damaged by the Use of Defective Concrete Blocks in Construction (Remediation) (Financial Assistance) Regulations 2020 which will allow for the recoupment of Engineer fees to homeowners who have applied for entry into the scheme.

It has been developed to ensure a consistent approach in how local authorities and service providers respond to the needs of those experiencing homelessness and to improve the quality of services provided. In general, the operation of these emergency accommodation facilities is contracted out by local authorities, under service level agreements, to NGOs involved in the delivery of homeless services.</p>  <p>  Standard 1.1 of the Framework aims to ensure that the rights and diversity of each service user are respected and promoted. A key feature of this includes ensuring that service users are treated with dignity and respect, their equality is promoted and the service respects their age, gender, sexual orientation, disability, family status, civil status, race, religious beliefs or as a member of the Travelling Community.</p>  <p>  My Department directly supports implementation of the National LGBTI+ Inclusion Strategy and an official from my Department who has responsibility for homelessness is a member of the Committee which reviews implementation of this Strategy.</p></reply>

Over 300,000 new homes will be built by the end of 2030, including a projected 90,000 social homes, 36,000 affordable purchase homes and 18,000 cost rental homes.</p>  <p>  The Plan is backed by historic levels of investment with in excess of &euro;20bn through the Exchequer, the Land Development Agency and the Housing Finance Agency over the next 5 years. This will provide the sector with the stability and certainty it needs.</p>  <p>Housing for All is a whole-of-Government Plan, encompassing numerous policy areas across the four pathways to a sustainable housing system. My Department is working in close collaboration with all relevant Government Departments, State Agencies and other stakeholders, with a strong focus on implementation and delivery.</p>  <p>  Good progress has been made since the plans publication in September 2021: of the 213 actions set out in Housing for All, a total of 123 have either been completed already or are being delivered on an ongoing basis.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the Government has committed to publishing a Housing for All progress report each quarter throughout the lifetime of the plan. These detail the progress made on all Housing for All actions and policy objectives that have a delivery timeline relevant to the publication. Ongoing actions will be reported on in the Q2 and Q4 reports of each year to ensure continued focus and delivery of all actions. </p>  <p>  The first of these progress reports, for Q3 2021, was published on 20 October 2021 and can be accessed at the following link: www.gov.ie/en/publication/44df1-housing-for-all-q3-2021-progress-report/.  </p>  <p>  The second progress report, for Q4 2021, was published on 26 January 2022 and can be accessed at the following link: www.gov.ie/en/publication/84e61-housing-for-all-q4-2021-progress-report/.  </p>  <p>  Future Housing for All quarterly progress reports will also be published on the dedicated Housing for All webpage which can be accessed at the following link: www.gov.ie/en/campaigns/dfc50-housing-for-all/.  </p></reply>

These operational reports are of sensitive content and my Department does not generally give out specific information with regard to herd populations and density on our lands as such information could be an incentive for wildlife crime (such as deer poaching). </p><p>Deer populations by their nature are mobile and have a home range that is not constrained by landownership boundaries. Where appropriate, and depending on the annual counts &ndash; or where it is evident that damage is being caused by deer to habitats, especially woodland, culls may need to be carried out to ensure that deer populations do not reach levels that would have negative ecological consequences. </p><p>While my Department licenses the hunting of deer, it does not own the deer population and is not responsible for their control on private lands or the wider countryside. The control of deer on private property is a matter for the relevant landowner. Landowners may apply to my Department for a permission under section 42 of the Wildlife Acts to cull deer where this is necessary outside the annual open seasons. These permissions offer a facility whereby a person can obtain a permit, on a case by case basis, to prevent serious damage caused by individual deer on specific lands. Permissions are only issued where there is evidence of such damage.</p><p>The NPWS actively manages deer herd on lands in its ownership. The culling of the deer herd is a regular and on-going management operation within our National Parks to ensure sustainable herd management. The table below illustrates actions in this regard over the period 2016-2021 with regard to Killarney National Park <table>    <tr>       <th>-</th>       <th><b>2016-17 season</b></th>       <th><b>2017-18 season</b></th>       <th><b>2018-19 season</b></th>       <th><b>2019-20 season</b></th>       <th><b>2020-21 season (10/11/21)</b></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><b>Killarney National Park</b></td>       <td>More than 240 animals were culled between 2015 and 2018</td>       <td>120</td>       <td>272  </td>       <td>264  </td>       <td>234</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

Although the National Land Register and its mapping base are fully digitised, and legal and spatial searches may be carried out through the landdirect.ie portal, the registration process itself remains paper-based because of  legislative provisions prohibiting the use of  digital signatures  in property transactions.  </p>  <p>  Levels of completion of applications for registration in 2020 and 2021 were at circa 90 per cent of those achieved pre-pandemic.  Notwithstanding this level of activity, there has been an accumulation of arrears in the period. </p>  <p>I recently approved the new PRA Statement of Strategy for 2022-2024, Resilience in a Changing Environment , which includes high-level objectives relating to the strategic management of case processing, the reduction of arrears in such casework, and customer&ndash;centric planning and delivery of services.</p>  <p>  The PRA has secured additional funding for 2022 to address business continuity and arrears reduction.  A new Arrears Clearance Programme has already been set in train, and cross organisational multi-disciplinary teams will be established to focus on the elimination of arrears.  This programme, underpinned by project management discipline, envisages a radical, structured approach to implementation, with an emphasis on data analysis, innovation and business process improvement.

It has been available nationwide from local authorities since 4 January 2022 for first-time buyers and fresh start applicants. The loan can be used both for new and second-hand properties, or to self-build. It is the successor to the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan (RIHL).</p><p>As part of the eligibility criteria for the Local Authority Home Loan, applicants must currently have a legal right to reside and work in the State and must be able to demonstrate that they are habitually resident in Ireland.  Furthermore, there are minimum periods of residence required; </p><p>- All Irish citizens are automatically legally resident. They will also need to be habitually resident in Ireland to be eligible for assessment. </p><p>- UK citizens will be regarded as being legally resident in Ireland. They will also need to be habitually resident in Ireland to be eligible for assessment. This accords with the Common Travel Area requirements. </p><p>- All EU/European Economic Area (EEA) citizens who are legally and habitually resident in the State will not be eligible to apply for a Local Authority Home Loan for the first three months of residence in the State. Thereafter, they will be eligible to apply if they are habitually resident in the State and meet the definition of &lsquo;worker&rsquo; in EU law or have been legally and habitually resident in the State for more than five years. </p><p>- Non-EEA applicants from any other countries must be legally and habitually resident in Ireland for a period of 5 years; or have leave to remain extending to potentially permit five years reckonable residence; or have indefinite leave to remain in the State.</p><p>In terms of a Stamp 4 visa,  not all holders of a Stamp 4 visa meet the criteria set out in relation to non-EEA applicants nor have the required period of residence. However, if the Stamp 4 visa holder does meet the criteria, they may be eligible to apply. The Department does not maintain records of refusals on grounds of residency.</p><p>The final decision on the Local Authority Home Loan applications is a matter for the relevant local authority. Decisions on all housing loan applications must be made in accordance with the Regulations establishing the scheme and the credit policy that underpins the scheme, in order to ensure prudence and consistency in approaches in the best interests of both borrowers and the lending local authority.</p><p>Further information on the scheme is available on the dedicated website: www.<i>localauthorityhomeloan.ie</i>. </p></reply>

This measure was aimed at facilitating the productive re-use of qualifying vacant commercial buildings as homes, while also facilitating urban renewal and the bringing on stream of increased housing supply. The original expiry date of the Regulations was 31 December 2021 which was subsequently extended to 25 February 2022 arising from the Covid-related shutdown of the planning system for 8 weeks during the period March to May 2020, which extended all planning timelines by 8 weeks. </p><p>The Government's plan for housing<i>Housing for All</i>commits to reviewing and extending the 2018 Regulations to the end of 2025. </p><p>Under section 262(4) of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, legislative proposals in relation to exempted development require the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas before they can be signed into law.

As of 31 January, the number of staff was over 760.  While this is slightly lower than the estimated number previously provided, as not all assignments which have been offered were accepted by applicants, significant numbers of staff will continue to be assigned to the Passport Service in the coming weeks and months with the goal of doubling staff numbers from June 2021 levels.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Passport Service is engaged in intensive training of new and existing staff to ensure that they have the resources to process the volume of complex applications anticipated this year.</p>  <p>  The additional staff that have been assigned and will continue to be recruited over the coming weeks will have a positive impact on processing times, particularly for first time passport applications.</p>  <p>  Despite pandemic-related disruptions, the Passport Service issued over 634,000 passports in 2021. Passport Service figures show that 45% of adult online renewal applications are processed in one working day, while 99% of child online renewal applications are issued within fifteen working days. </p>  <p>  When passport applicants do not provide all of the required documentation to the Passport Service, unfortunately, it can take much longer than the average processing time to process the application and issue a passport. There are currently 115,000 applications on hand with the Passport Service. Of these, 49,000 or 42% are incomplete applications. In these cases, the onus is on the applicants to submit required documentation to complete the application so that their passport can be issued. The experience of the Passport Service is that it can take weeks and sometimes months to receive the necessary documents after an applicant applies online.</p>  <p>  I urge citizens to check the validity of their passports before booking travel and to ensure that they apply online in plenty of time. The processing of an online renewal application is consistently up to four times faster than the processing time of a paper application. It is important for applicants to follow up on their online application by submitting any required additional documents to the Passport Service in a timely manner.</p></reply>

As a member of the UN Security Council, we are actively engaged in efforts to promote greater dialogue and political stability within Bosnia-Herzegovina as well as support for the Institutions established under the Dayton Peace Accords. Ireland also contributes a small number of PDF personnel to the important EUFOR Althea Mission whose mandate was renewed by the Security Council last October. </p>  <p>  Along with our EU and international Partners, Ireland shares the concerns regarding the growing polarisation and divisive actions being taken by certain parties within Bosnia-Herzegovina and which is manifest in the current refusal of the Republika Srpska authorities, led by President Dodik, to participate fully in the State Institutions. It is welcome that President Dodik has given some recent indications of his willingness for the Republika Srpska authorities to return to full participation in the Institutions. Pressure, however, will need to be maintained by the EU, US and international community to ensure that this commitment is now followed through. </p>  <p>  There is an obligation on all parties within Bosnia-Herzegovina to work actively to lower current political tensions within the country and to cooperate to advance work on the EU reform agenda which remains critical for advancing the country&rsquo;s political and economic fortunes. </p>  <p>  In this regard, Ireland fully support the efforts being undertaken by EU Special Representative Sattler and High Representative Christian Schmidt to get all the parties engaging in constructive dialogue on how to address the many challenges facing Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>  <p>  I would also call on all those who can, particularly among Bosnia-Herzegovina&rsquo;s neighbours and regional partners, to continue to exert influence and encourage dialogue to reduce current tensions.</p></reply>

The key priorities and objectives for this relationship are set out in the Government's United States and Canada Strategy 2019-2025. Under this strategy, we have reinforced our network of eight offices across the US, including opening a new Consulate General in Los Angelus in 2018 and the opening in summer 2022 of a new Consulate General in Miami.  </p>  <p>  We have a broad range of priorities in our relations with the United States including: high level political engagement, in particular in support of the peace process in Northern Ireland; economic promotion; and in support of our citizens and the broader Irish American diaspora. </p>  <p>  There is ongoing advocacy and engagement at every level with the US administration and political leaders. During his St. Patrick's Day virtual visit last year, the Taoiseach raised a number of priority issues directly with President Biden, including the need to identify immigration pathways. I also advocated strongly on a number of important issues, including on Brexit and Northern Ireland and on  immigration, at meetings on Capitol Hill on my most recent visit to Washington D.C. These high level engagements will continue as we maintain close relations with Members of the US Congress, and as we seek opportunities to deepen and strengthen our bilateral relations with President Biden's Administration.</p>  <p>  Our Embassy in Washington D.C. is actively engaged across the political spectrum in the US, meeting regularly with both Members of the House of Representatives and of the Senate on a bipartisan basis. The efforts of the Embassy have been instrumental in ensuring consistent priority and support at the highest political level to protect peace on the island. They also continue to work towards finding innovative solutions and immigration pathways to address the challenges faced by the undocumented Irish in the US. </p>  <p>  Through our Embassy in Washington, D.C., as well as our Consulates across the US, my Department works closely in support of Irish and Irish American groups across the United States. These include a wide breadth of organisations who support the Irish and Irish American communities in many ways. Engagement in support of our diaspora community in the US is a key platform for the delivery of our Diaspora Strategy 2020-2025. </p>  <p>  The Government continues to provide support and significant annual funding through the Government&rsquo;s Emigrant Support Programme to the US Coalition of Irish Immigration Centers, which provides support to Irish citizens, in particular to the undocumented Irish who are seeking to regularise their status. Last year, in response to the pandemic, a dedicated COVID-19 Response Fund for Irish Communities Abroad was set up to help these organisations meet the needs of those who are particularly vulnerable. In 2021, over &euro;4.2m was paid to diaspora organisations in the US for emigrant support and Covid-19 related projects. </p>  <p>  In relation to the named organisation, the Embassy in Washington DC and our network of Consulates, all work closely with this organisation, and are engaging actively with its membership. The Ambassador recently received an award from its Washington chapter in recognition of the Embassy&rsquo;s work in support of Irish America.  There is a longstanding history of cooperation with them on Irish issues. We will continue to support and engage with this organisation and other Irish community groups, to support the needs of Irish citizens and our diaspora community in the US.</p></reply>

Due to the complex nature of the Foreign Birth Registration process, the large increase in applications received following the Brexit vote in the UK, and the pause in the Service due to necessary Covid-19 restrictions, applicants should allow approximately 2 years from the receipt of supporting documentation for processing of Foreign Birth Registration applications at this time. Due to Covid-19 restrictions, and the subsequent reassignment of Foreign Birth Registration staff to assist in the provision of essential passport services, the Foreign Birth Registration Service was paused for nearly 15 months across the 2020-2021 period.</p>  <p>  The application referenced was registered on 16 July 2021, and is awaiting processing. All documentation received is being stored in a secure environment. Foreign Birth Registration staff continue to provide an emergency service for Foreign Birth Registration in cases of exceptional urgency, such as expectant parents, or stateless persons. Applicants who require an emergency service may contact the Passport Service directly.</p>  <p>  My Department is fully committed to the continued allocation of additional resources over the coming period to assist with the processing of the Foreign Birth Registration applications currently on hand and the high volume of new applications anticipated this year.</p></reply>

There are nine ships in the fleet, with L&Eacute; Eithne and L&Eacute; Orla currently in operational reserve while L&Eacute; Niamh has commenced a mid-life refit and upgrade programme.</p>  <p>  The White Paper on Defence sets out an ambitious programme of capital investment in the Naval Service. The Defence Equipment Development Plan (EDP) provides a comprehensive list of planned equipment projects which will be progressed over five years.

It is the intention that this new vessel will provide a flexible and adaptive capability for a wide range of maritime tasks.</p>  <p>  Following a public tender competition, Marine Advisors have been appointed to support the procurement of the MRV. Work on this project is underway and will inform a public tender competition in due course. The overall time estimated for the procurement and build stages on projects of this nature is generally expected to take between 4 to 6 years.</p></reply>

Equipment priorities for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service are being considered in the context of the lifetime of the White Paper on Defence as part of the capability development and Equipment Development Planning (EDP) process. Further additions to the Equipment Development Plan are currently under consideration.</p>  <p>  The Department of Defence has received a capital allocation under the National Development Plan of &euro;566m over the 2022-2025 timeframe. There are a number of defensive equipment acquisition and upgrade projects which will come to fruition during this period. In relation to air-based capability, alongside the recently acquired PC-12 aircraft delivery of two C295 Maritime Patrol Aircraft is expected in 2023.</p>  <p>  An inter Departmental Group was convened last year to examine options, in line with the Public Spending Code, for the future provision of an independent, international air transport service for use by the President and Government. The Learjet 45 is the primary aircraft providing this facility along with supplementary military transports and air ambulance services. This aircraft which has been in continuous operation since 2004 is now nearing the end of its natural life.</p>  <p>  The capability of the aircraft to carry out a broader utility role such as the deployment of an Emergency Civil Assistance Team is also being examined by the Group. However no decisions have yet been made in respect of the purchase of aircraft. As with all capital investment decisions costing over &euro;10 million, the requirements of the Public Spending Code would need to be met, covering the various steps required in assessing the viability of the proposal and those associated with relevant decision-making and potential subsequent public investment in any additional aircraft.</p>  <p>  The Group is chaired by my Department and also comprises representatives from the Departments of the Taoiseach, Public Expenditure and Reform, Transport and Foreign Affairs. </p>  <p>  The Group is expected to make a recommendation to Government later this year.  </p></reply>

These measures protect students/pupils, their parents and school staff and are very effective when adhered to.  </p>  <p>  Public Health continue to advise that the two most important actions to prevent the introduction and spread of Covid-19 (and other respiratory viruses), is by ensuring no-one with new onset symptoms attend school, and that all recommended infection prevention and control measures are in place in line with school Covid-19 response plans.  </p>  <p>  Public Health have also confirmed that there is no change to infection prevention and control measures in place in schools at this time, but that they will be reviewed by mid-term in February.

The State Examinations Commission, with my Department, has been progressing planning for these examinations, in consultation with the Advisory Group on Planning for the State Examinations. The group includes representatives of students, parents, teachers and school leaders, as well as the SEC, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, Higher Education and my Department.  </p>  <p>  My Department and the SEC have sought, through various measures, to take account of the disruption to learning experienced by Leaving Certificate 2022 students. These include adjustments to the assessment arrangements for the 2022 examinations that were announced in August 2021. The adjustments were designed to take account both of the disruption to learning experienced by students in the early part of 2021, as well as providing for some possible further disruption in 2021/22. </p>  <p>  Revised arrangements for Leaving Certificate Language Oral Examinations and the practical performance tests in Leaving Certificate Music were announced before Christmas. These examinations will take place outside of school time over the first week of the school Easter holidays, minimising the disruption to teaching and learning, as this change will limit teacher absence from schools.</p>  <p>  Timeframes for certain assessment elements of the Leaving Certificate Applied examinations have also been pushed out. Schools were also reminded of the flexibilities regarding the dates for completion and authentication of examination Coursework. </p>  <p>  An alternative set of Leaving Certificate examinations are also scheduled to be run this year, shortly after the conclusion of the main set of examinations, for students who are unable to sit the main set of examinations for various reasons, including Covid-19 illness, bereavement or serious illness.      </p>  <p>  I am continuing to engage with stakeholders on all matters relating to the examinations. At last Thursday&rsquo;s meeting of the Advisory Group a number of updates were received from group members, including reports of emerging and final results from surveys that members had conducted. All parties committed to continued engagement in the short period ahead, in order to provide clarity in relation to the examinations.</p>  <p>  It was agreed that the members of the group would reflect on the contributions made at the meeting, and that engagement would continue between myself and the various stakeholders on a bilateral and intensive basis. This engagement has been continuing since late last week, over the weekend and into this week, with a view to reaching an appropriate solution which responds to the concerns and issues that have been raised. A further meeting of the Advisory Group will be held and I am working towards a decision in relation to the examinations being made as soon as reasonably practicable.</p></reply>

The EPSEN Act 2004, is now in place for more than 17 years and there have been many significant changes and developments to policy relating to the education of children with special needs in that time.   </p>  <p>  The purpose of the review is to ensure that legislation on education for students with additional needs is up-to-date, fully operational, and reflective of the lived experiences of students and families.</p>  <p>  Initial steps have been taken by my Department in relation to this important review of legislation. Establishment of a Steering Group and Advisory Group to oversee the process is due to commence in the coming weeks. Open collaboration and consultation will be at the heart of the review and all stakeholders will be invited to engage with the process.</p>  <p>  There will be a formal consultation process as early as possible in this review and input at all stages from the Advisory Group, which will include representatives of key stakeholders, including parent and advocacy groups. Details shall be communicated as soon as possible in relation to these various stages of consultation and how submissions can be raised.  It is envisaged that the full review will be completed by early 2023.</p>  <p>   </p></reply>

I fully recognise that where parents have difficulties in securing an appropriate school placement for their child, particularly a child with special educational needs, it can be a stressful experience. My Department is working hard to ensure that there are sufficient school places, appropriate to the needs of all children, available on a timely basis nationwide.  </p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children with special educational needs and my Department works in close collaboration with the NCSE to ensure that the necessary provision is available. There are Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) located across the country and they have a specific remit in helping and supporting parents in accessing the education necessary for their children, including in identifying suitable school placements.  </p><p>The policy approach of the Department is that children with additional needs should receive their education in placements which are appropriate to their needs alongside their peers wherever possible unless such an approach would be inconsistent with the best interests of the individual child or other children in the school. This approach is consistent with the provisions of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act 2004.  </p><p>This policy is supported by significant investment by this Government.  This year, my Department will spend in excess of &euro;2 billion, or over 25% of the Department&rsquo;s budget on providing additional teaching and care supports for children with special educational needs. This includes funding for a wide range of schemes and supports including special classes, special school places, SNAs and teachers. </p><p>Only where it has been assessed that the child is unable to be supported in mainstream education, are special class placements or special school placements recommended and provided for.</p><p>Recognising some of the difficulties experienced by parents in securing appropriate school placements, my Department and the NCSE have worked closely on a more streamlined and joined up planning process which has ensured a targeted approach to meet demand for special education placements ahead of each new school year. This intensive intervention has seen an additional 301 special classes already opened nationwide for the 2021/22 school year. </p><p>There is currently a network of 357 special classes in Cork, including Cork City,  of which 309 are special classes for children with autism.Of the 309 special classes for children with autism, 228 are at primary level including 21 Early Intervention classes and 81 are at post primary level. A total of 45 new ASD special classes were established in Cork for the 2021/2022 school year.</p><p>Additional special school places have been created by the establishment of the new Carrigaline Community Special School and a planned increase in places in existing special schools for September next. The NCSE continues to work with special schools in Cork to increase the number of available places.</p><p>My Department is committed, through the NCSE and network of local SENOs, to continue to work with parents and schools to ensure that there are sufficient appropriate places for children with additional needs and to support all children to achieve their potential. </p><p>I can assure the Deputy that the local SENOs remain available to assist and advise parents. Parents may contact SENOs directly using the contact details available at: . </p></reply>

In the current school year over 121,400 children, including over 15,500 children with special educational needs, are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;289m in 2021. </p><p>Under the terms of the Primary School Transport Scheme children are eligible for transport where they reside not less than 3.2 kms from and are attending their nearest national school as determined by the Department/Bus &Eacute;ireann, having regard to ethos and language. </p><p>Children who are not eligible for school transport may apply for transport on a concessionary basis only and are offered seats where capacity exists after all eligible children have been catered for. </p><p>A minimum number of 10 eligible children residing in a distinct locality, as determined by Bus &Eacute;ireann, are required before consideration may be given to the establishment or retention of school transport services, provided this can be done within reasonable cost limits.</p><p>Families who wish to avail of school transport and have their eligibility status assessed should apply on-line in a timely manner to Bus &Eacute;ireann<b></b>on Bus &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s website at<b></b>www.buseireann.ie.  The portal for school transport applications for the 2022/23 is now open and all applications should be submitted by the closing date of 29 April 2022.</p><p>In cases where the Department is satisfied that the nearest school is full, eligibility for school transport will be determined based on the distance the pupil resides from their next nearest school having regard to ethos and language. Such requests are considered on a case by case basis following documentary evidence being submitted by the family. </p><p>If a family require further information in regard to the closest school being full they can contact School Transport Section of my Department. Information in this regard is available on my Department's website www.education.ie.</p><p>With regard to the school in question, Bus &Eacute;ireann has advised that to date there are no mainstream services operating to this school. </p><p>Bus &Eacute;ireann has advised that their Local Office has been in contact with the Principal of this school and explained the terms of the scheme. </p><p>For the 2021/22 school year, 1 mainstream concessionary application was recently made for transport to this school. </p><p>For the 2022/23 school year, 20 mainstream concessionary applications have been received and no mainstream eligible applications have been received to date for this school. </p><p>Any private transport arrangements made by families to this school are outside of the remit of the School Transport Scheme. </p></reply>

Given that these subjects are still challenging in terms of filling teaching vacancies, my Department is funding approximately 135 additional places on the programmes for the second intake of students, which commenced in January. In that regard, approximately 60 teachers recently commenced the physics upskilling programme in addition approximately 20 students currently in their final year of the programme.</p>  <p>  A number of measures have been taken by education partners which are aimed at matching teachers with teaching vacancies.  Turasabhaile, a service developed by the post-primary school management bodies and the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals, matches registered teachers, resident abroad with post-primary vacancies in schools in Ireland. </p>  <p>  The Irish Primary Principals&rsquo; Network is also developing a new central portal for the recruitment of teachers to long-term positions in both primary and post-primary schools. It is anticipated that this portal will be available to schools and teachers in the coming months.</p>  <p>  The various measures to support teacher supply are underpinned by the Teaching Transforms campaign, which promotes the teaching profession and encourages students to follow a career in teaching. The campaign uses digital, radio and video media, and is supported by a dedicated webpage, www.gov.ie/teachingtransforms.</p></reply>

Updated guidance for schools on Practical Steps for the Deployment of Good Ventilation Practices in Schools was provided at the end of May following the work of an expert group that carefully considered the role of ventilation in managing COVID-19. The updated guidance for schools is also fully in line with the most recent guidance on non-healthcare building ventilation during COVID-19, published by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre November 2021. </p>  <p>  To provide additional support in the context of Covid-19 the payment of a minor works grant totalling &euro;45m for primary schools and special schools, plus a once-off Covid-19 minor works funding of &euro;17m for post-primary schools, was issued in December 2021. All recognised schools in the free scheme have received their grants. </p>  <p>  Given that each school setting is different, individual schools are best placed to decide how best to use this funding to address their particular needs. Specialist advice/assistance of a Chartered Engineer or Registered Architect is an important source of support for schools.  This will help ensure that appropriate solutions are being put in place to address ventilation issues including advice on whether a HEPA Air Cleaner Unit is required to deal with a poorly ventilated room.  There is no one solution that fits all scenarios, each application requires bespoke analysis and selection of the appropriate unit(s) matched to the specific room size and volume. </p>  <p>  Air cleaning devices are not a substitute for good ventilation but can be considered pending the completion of interventions/works where poor ventilation persists. This is line with the Expert Group recommendations. Air filtration does not negate the need for natural ventilation and opening windows as required. Furthermore Mike Ryan of the World Health Organisation&rsquo;s Health Emergencies Programme has advised that schools not rely solely on air filters.</p>  <p>  In the case where a school has difficulty engaging a Chartered Engineer or Registered  Architect the Department can assist, with a dedicated ventilation team  available to support school principals in this regard.  Schools that identify inadequate ventilation in a room can utilise their minor work grant or apply for emergency works grant assistance to address ventilation enhancements where the minor work grant does not cover the full cost of the works required.</p>  <p>  To date 19 schools have applied for additional funding under the emergency works scheme to assist with ventilation. Of these, 12 have been approved, 2 were returned to the school to review the scope of the application, 2 were incorrectly classified as ventilation related and assessed separately, 2 were rejected as the application form was not fully completed and 1 is currently being assessed by a member of the Department&rsquo;s technical team. None of the 12 approved identified a need for an air filter.</p></reply>

The Webwise resources are available at www.webwise.ie. </p>  <p>  The Report on the Review of Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE) in primary and post-primary schools was published by the NCCA in December, 2019. The NCCA was asked to look at a number of specific issues in respect of RSE and the curriculum. These included but were not limited to consent; developments in relation to contraception; healthy positive, sexual expression and relationships; safe use of the Internet and social media and its effects on relationships and self-esteem; and LGBTQ+ matters.</p>  <p>  The immediate focus of the NCCA work has been on creating support materials for teachers for publication online as part of an Interim Guidance Toolkit. The toolkit's purpose is to support effective teaching and learning of SPHE/RSE linked to the current curriculum and to provide guidance on how SPE/RSE may be approached in a comprehensive way that meets the needs of young people today. These resources cover all topics including many of the topics that have been raised in the media during recent days as important for young people's education  - there are resources to help teachers in teaching about rights and responsibilities in relationships, how to recognise healthy, unhealthy and abusive relationship, how to interact safely and respectfully (both online and face-to-face), the influence of the media (including pornography) on young people's understanding and expectations, sexual consent and assertive communication.</p>  <p>  The NCCA Toolkits will be expanded during 2022 to include further age and stage appropriate guidance for teachers on how to address these and other related topics within the SPHE classroom. The Toolkit provides practical help designed to deepen teachers' understanding and skills so that they feel more confident in addressing important and sensitive topics.</p>  <p>  In tandem with this work, preparation for the broader redeveloping and updating of the SPHE curriculum has begun. Updated curricula will be developed for Primary, Junior Cycle and Senior Cycle.  It is expected that a revised Junior Cycle specification will be completed by the end of 2022, following a period of public consultation. Updated specifications for primary and senior cycle will follow immediately afterwards. </p>  <p>  On the 19th January, I provided an update to Cabinet on the measures to tackle and prevent bullying in schools including progress in relation to anti-bullying work currently being delivered by my Department and the commencement of a review of both the 2013 Action Plan on Bullying and the 2013 Anti-bullying procedures for Primary and Post-Primary schools. </p>  <p>  This review will take account of developments and relevant research since the action plan and procedures were published in 2013 and will specifically consider areas such as cyber bullying, gender identity bullying and sexual harassment. </p>  <p>  The review will also give detailed consideration to the recommendations contained in the Oireachtas Joint Committee Report on School Bullying and the Impact on Mental Health. </p>  <p>  It will involve significant consultation and collaboration across my Department, with other Government Departments and Bodies including the Ombudsman for Children, and will also involve consultation with a broad range of education stakeholders, including parents and students. </p></reply>

In addition to other schools, the school planning area includes a new 24 classroom multi denominational primary school with substantial current capacity for additional enrolments. </p>  <p>  The application from the school in question was assessed by my Department in this context and the school have been notified of the decision. </p></reply>

This patronage process is open to all patron bodies and prospective patrons. Parental preferences for each patron, from parents of children who reside in the school planning areas concerned, together with the extent of diversity currently available in these areas, are key to decisions in relation to the outcome of this process. </p><p>The Online Patronage Process System (OPPS) has been developed by the Department to provide objective information to all parents and guardians which will allow them to make an informed choice in expressing a preference for their preferred model of patronage for their child&rsquo;s education. </p><p>The patronage process for new schools is overseen by an external independent advisory group, the New Schools Establishment Group (NSEG). Following their consideration of the Department&rsquo;s assessment reports, the NSEG will submit a report with recommendations to the Minister for consideration and final decision. The assessment reports and the NSEG recommendations for all such patronage processes are available on the Department's website (<i>www.education.ie</i>) and gov.ie.</p><p>All school building projects are progressed through the preliminary and detailed design stages aligning to my Department's Design Team Procedures prior to proceeding to tender and construction. These stages ensure that all projects are designed against the twin benchmarks of quality and cost control. Under these procedures my Department engages with the Project Manger to ensure that high standards in respect of both benchmarks are met. My Department constantly endeavours to progress projects through the stages of architectural planning, tender and construction in the shortest timeframes possible consistent with ensuring high quality and cost effective design.</p><p>As with all school building projects, pre planning meetings are required with the Local Authority in advance of preparing a Planning Application. This is to ensure the highest probability of a successful planning application in the shortest time possible. A considerable amount of work is required following the pre-planning meeting to prepare a suitably detailed application. The Department must await a decision on planning from the local authority. A notification to grant planning can be received after 8 weeks, although there is a possibility for the Local Authority to request further information (RFI). There is always also the possibility of an An Bord Pleanala Appeal (ABP) and if this occurs it may add a further six to eight months or more to the final planning decision date.  If planning is delayed, the Department has to put contingency arrangements in place to support the operation of schools.  </p><p>It is not therefore, possible to provide an indicative timeframe for the progression of projects to tender, construction and completion stages until such time as the necessary statutory approvals have been secured.</p><p>Post Primary <table>    <tr>       <th>-</th>       <th></th>

They  also provide information on progress being made by schools to my Department.  In collaboration with schools, inspectors are also assisting with the identification of examples of innovative practice in the provision of high-quality immersion education. Due to the exceptional circumstances arising from the global pandemic, online advisory sessions have been provided to schools over the past 2 years. A combination of online and face-to-face advisory sessions will continue to be provided to schools in 2022. </p><p>My Department published an Inspectorate report on the Gaeltacht School Recognition Scheme in December 2018, which identified the key messages from advisory visits carried out by inspectors to Gaeltacht Schools under the Scheme. The report found that:</p><p>-  early-immersion education was being implemented in junior and senior infants in almost all primary schools participating in the Scheme</p><p>-  a wider range of subjects was being taught through the medium of Irish in post-primary schools</p><p>-  while there were challenges in post-primary schools in relation to the use of Irish as the language of communication amongst students, significant efforts were being made -  to address those challenges and progress was already being made.</p><p>A range of Guides have been issued to schools to promote the use of Irish in Gaeltacht schools and communities, including the following:</p><p>-  Guide for Gaeltacht Primary Schools: Indicators of Good Practice for Immersion Education (2020)</p><p>-  Guide for Gaeltacht Post-Primary Schools: Indicators of Good Practice for Immersion Education (2020)</p><p>-  A Guide for Gaeltacht Schools: Partnership with the Community in promoting the use of Irish (2021)</p><p>-  Guide for Gaeltacht Schools: Strengthening links between Primary Schools and Early Learning and Care (ELC) Settings (2021) </p><p>A three-year Research and Evaluation Study plan has been developed by the Gaeltacht Education Unit in collaboration with the Educational Research Centre (ERC) and the Inspectorate to evaluate the impact and outcomes of the Gaeltacht School Recognition Scheme in order to inform future policy and practice in schools. An initial Report on Case-study Schools participating in the Gaeltacht Recognition Scheme was published in September 2021. These case-studies, which were carried out in twelve primary schools and seven post-primary schools, provide a comprehensive insight into the schools&rsquo; own innovations and good practices, and on their learnings to date through their school self-evaluation practices.</p><p>The Report on Case-study Schools includes many positive findings in relation to:</p><p>-  the practice of boards of management, teachers, pupils and parents regarding the use of Irish</p><p>-  schools&rsquo; re-energised vision for the Irish language and Gaeltacht identity</p><p>-  the increased use and promotion of Irish language and culture in school communities </p><p>-  the effective implementation of early immersion in Irish in all case-study primary schools</p><p>-  the innovative strategies being implemented in a number of schools to extend the use of Irish</p><p>-  the use of digital technology as a teaching resource in certain instances.</p><p>The following areas were identified as requiring further development:</p><p>-  the use of Irish as the language of socialisation among students in some post-primary schools</p><p>-  better facilitation of the effective transition from na&iacute;onra&iacute; to Gaeltacht primary schools in some cases</p><p>-  the need to strengthen the involvement of parents and pupils/students in action-planning and school self-evaluation.</p><p>The Research and Evaluation study will continue during 2022/23. The ERC continues to conduct research on student attainment and on the views of parents, students, teachers and principals of participating schools. A report on these research findings will be published by my Department in 2022. </p></reply>

This represents an increase of over 20% in funding for the DEIS programme and will enable an expansion in 2022 to additional schools.</p>  <p>  This package follows an extensive body of work which has been under taken by the DEIS technical group in relation to the development of a model to identify the concentrated levels of disadvantage of schools. The refined DEIS ID model is an objective, statistics based process, based on school enrolment data and data available from Census 2016 under the HP Deprivation Index. It is important to note that there is no application process for the DEIS programme and all schools will be considered under the refined DEIS model when it is applied. </p>  <p>  During the process to refine the DEIS identification model, and as is general practice in the Department, my Department has consulted with education partners (school management and national parent representative bodies and unions) on the technical aspects of the refinement of the DEIS identification model. The purpose of this engagement is to ensure that, as far as possible, the refined DEIS identification model can provide an objective and independent means of identifying schools serving high concentrations of pupils at risk of educational disadvantage and also to ensure there is a full understanding of the refined model and its potential application. </p>  <p>  There will be further engagement with relevant stakeholders in advance of the implementation of the refined DEIS identification model.  </p></reply>

My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places in that area. </p>  <p>  Parents have the right to choose which school to apply to and where the school has places available the pupil should be admitted. However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available, a selection process will be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.  However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</p>  <p>  The act requires schools to clearly set out their selection criteria in their admission policies. Schools have discretion in relation to their admission criteria and how they are applied.  Some schools may apply a catchment area as one of their selection criteria.  The criteria to be applied by schools and the order of priority are a matter for the schools themselves.

Following on from this meeting, I met with the members of the advisory group on a bilateral basis and also had further engagement with each of them thereafter.  I have listened carefully to what each of these stakeholders has had to say and examined each of their points. </p><p>Following consideration of this matter by Government today, I announced the decision: to operate an examinations  approach for Leaving Certificate in 2022, with significant further adjustments to the examinations; and to provide students with a commitment that the overall results of Leaving Certificate 2022 will not be lower than in 2021. As the Deputy may be aware, it would not have been possible to run Accredited Grades in the same manner as last year, as Junior Cycle data was unavailable for 25% of our students. </p><p>The further extensive changes I have announced to the examination papers, over and above those announced in August 2021, mean that candidates: have greater choice in the papers; have less questions to answer; and still have the same amount of time as in a normal year to complete the examination. For example, in mathematics on each paper, instead of having to answer all ten questions, candidates will only have to answer six.</p><p>This is in addition to previously announced changes, such as the running of the Leaving Certificate Oral Examinations and Music Practical over the first week of the Easter Break. </p><p>Timeframes for certain assessment elements of the Leaving Certificate Applied examinations have also been pushed out. Schools were also reminded of the flexibilities regarding the dates for completion and authentication of examination Coursework.</p><p>I believe that the decision announced today will provide Leaving Certificate students of 2022 with an opportunity for their learning and attainment at the end of their post-primary education to be assessed, and will enable them to progress to the next stage of their lives. It also provides the certainty and clarity in this matter that had been requested by schools and parents.</p><p>Students who are unable to take their 2022 Leaving Certificate examinations in June due to serious illness, Covid-related illness based on public health advice at that time, or due to close family bereavement, will have access to an alternative sitting of the examinations. </p><p>The alternative set of examinations is intended to commence shortly following the first set of examinations.  There will be strict eligibility criteria applying to this alternative sitting, to be determined by the State Examinations Commission, having regard to the prevailing public health advice and with due regard for the principles of equity, fairness and integrity which govern all aspects of the examinations system.</p><p>The State Examinations Commission will shortly be issuing further details regarding the 2022 examinations.</p></reply>

Where a school employs a staff member to support those functions those staff are employees of individual schools and responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school.</p><p>The Department with school management bodies have been engaging with F&oacute;rsa on a claim on terms and conditions for grant-funded school secretaries and caretakers.  On the 27th of October 2020, under the auspices of the WRC, an understanding was agreed on a pathway to progress the issues. Several key strands were identified, and a phased approach is being taken to the development of proposals. </p><p>Following intensive discussions at the WRC on 13th September 2021, there was significant progress in this dispute. Subject to agreement on all elements of the claim, the Department has offered to move School Secretaries&rsquo; pay rates to a scale which is aligned with the Clerical Officer Grade III pay scale on a pro rata basis according to a secretary&rsquo;s current working pattern. The Department has also offered to improve the conditions for School Secretaries with regard to sick leave, annual leave and maternity provisions for this cohort of staff.</p><p>Further dialogue has taken place between the parties on these issues since 13 September with the aim of reaching an overall agreement. The talks continue, most recently at a meeting at the WRC on 26 January; the parties are to meet again next month, following reflection on the matters discussed at that meeting.</p><p>I welcome the continued engagement between the parties and I encourage all stakeholders to focus on finalising an agreement.</p></reply>

While the Department of Health has responsibility for these services in Ireland, my Department has an important role to support the wellbeing and positive mental health of all our young people. My Department&rsquo;s approach to supporting wellbeing and mental health of young people is set out in its Wellbeing Policy Statement and Framework for Practice first published in 2018 and refreshed in 2019.  The approach proposed is a whole school and preventative approach which has multiple components that include providing children and young people with opportunities to:</p><p>-  build core social and emotional skills and competencies</p><p>-  experience supportive relationships within the school setting</p><p>-  be part of a school environment and culture that feels both physically and psychologically safe, in which they feel a sense of belonging and connectedness, that their voice is heard, and they feel supported</p><p>Embedded in the whole-school approach is the recognition that members of the school community may have different needs at different times and that a continuum of support in relation to wellbeing should be made available. </p><p>My Department&rsquo;s National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) provides educational psychological support to all primary and post-primary schools. This involves direct support in the event of a critical incident, access to national and regional support and development work to build school capacity to support students, access to a NEPS psychologist for responses to queries arising, and access to individual pupil casework where there is need via a NEPS psychologist. NEPS works closely with the HSE and its agencies to ensure those who may require the provision of therapy or counselling are referred on the appropriate clinical services for intervention and support.</p><p>The NEPS Support and Development service, reaching an estimated 25,000 teachers annually, is an applied psychological service for school staff to help build their capability to respond to the wellbeing, academic, social and emotional needs of all students, and particularly those who are experiencing barriers to their wellbeing, learning, inclusion and participation. Professional learning activities to support children/young people with social/emotional/mental health difficulties and to promote positive wellbeing in school include the FRIENDS<b></b>programmes. These are evidence-based anxiety prevention and resilience building programmes, which foster self-concept and a sense of school belonging using Cognitive Behavioural Therapeutically-informed approaches. Friends programmes help students to develop resilience by teaching them effective strategies to cope with, problem solve and manage all kinds of emotional distress, including worry, stress, change and anxiety. The Incredible Years Teacher Classroom Management programme is an evidence-based programme that equips teachers to manage their classrooms effectively to prevent and reduce behavioural problems while promoting children&rsquo;s wellbeing and emotional and social competence. Since Covid-19 the training has been adapted to online format which increases accessibility for teachers.  </p><p>NEPS has developed a range of workshops on the promotion of wellbeing and resilience in schools which include upskilling school staff on the use and implementation of therapeutically-informed approaches in schools.  These include trauma-informed approaches, approaches based on the principles of cognitive behaviour therapy, and attachment-aware approaches. The approaches outlined in the workshops are based on research findings, on the experience of experts in their fields and on the experience of practicing psychologists working in schools. The workshops will be available to build the capability of school staff in both primary and post-primary settings, including for school leaders, teachers and SNAs. </p><p>My Department has built strong links with the Department of Health and both Departments are exploring ways to improve supports for young people, including around increased awareness, promoting help-seeking behaviour and sign-posting to the wide range of available services.  </p></reply>

A small undersupply is thereafter projected to 2038. The report notes that a level of oversupply may be necessary to maintain an overall balance in the system.</p><p>The Irish Primary Principals&rsquo; Network is developing a new central portal for the recruitment of teachers to long-term positions in both primary and post-primary schools.  It is anticipated that this portal will be available to schools and teachers in the coming months. </p><p>The various measures to support teacher supply are underpinned by the Teaching Transforms campaign, which promotes the teaching profession and encourages students to follow a career in teaching. The campaign uses digital, radio and video media, and is supported by a dedicated webpage, <i>www.gov.ie/teachingtransforms</i>.</p><p>A number of additional measures have been put in place to enhance substitute cover in the current school year.</p><p>A significant number of additional posts have been allocated to the primary substitute teacher supply panels in areas where significant challenges in sourcing substitution continue, bringing the total to 680 posts on 142 panels, covering approximately 2,700 schools.</p><p>The supply panels work alongside the existing methods of sourcing substitute teachers, such as Sub Seeker, the national substitution portal service operated by the Irish Primary Principals' Network, and schools can also make local arrangements to have their own regular substitutes to call on if needed. </p><p>Continuing professional development (CPD) at primary level where substitution is required has been suspended until after the February mid-term break. This measure has allowed for teachers on secondment to my Department&rsquo;s education support services to be available to provide substitute cover in schools through Sub Seeker.</p><p>Higher education institutions (HEIs) providing undergraduate programmes of primary and post-primary initial teacher education (ITE) have agreed to facilitate the release of 3rd and 4th year student teachers to support schools. To support this measure the Teaching Council has recently made regulations for the registration of these student teachers and is currently developing a system for their registration. </p><p>In addition, the HEIs providing professional master of education (PME) programmes have ensured flexibility in programme delivery to enhance the availability of PME students for substitute work. PME students have been advised to register with the Teaching Council and with Sub Seeker. </p><p>These measures are in addition to changes to the career break scheme, to permit teachers on career break to do unlimited substitution and changes to the job sharing scheme to permit job sharing teachers carry out substitute work on the days they are rostered off.</p><p>Primary schools with teaching principals have also been asked to cluster their allocations of principal release days to form a full-time fixed-term posts to minimise the requirement for substitute teachers.</p><p>The Department and its Inspectorate continue to provide support to schools where they continue to experience difficulties in sourcing sufficient substitute cover.</p></reply>

The current staffing arrangements at primary operates on the basis of 1 teacher for every 25 pupils which has resulted in the lowest pupil teacher ratio ever at primary school </p>  <p>  Budget 2022 further improved the staffing schedule by one point which will bring the staffing schedule to a new historical low of 1 teacher for every 24 pupils in September 2022. </p>  <p>  This builds on measures in previous budgets which has seen improvements in the overall allocation of teaching posts and specific targeted measures for small and isolated schools as well as primary schools on our islands.  </p>  <p>  In August 2021, I launched the Small Schools Clusters Action Research Project which is an innovative research project which aims to encourage small schools in a number of clusters to collaborate together and identify common challenges and trial innovative solutions. I hope the learning from this project will help inform the policy approach to supporting small schools. </p>  <p>  The package of funding agreed under the Roadmap for the Full Return to School was a combination of targeted supports to help schools manage Covid-19 related challenges The range of supports included the replacement of teachers and non-teaching staff unable to attend for work due to Covid-19, minor works grants to facilitate refurbishment and reconfiguration of school buildings, additional release days for principals and deputy principals at primary level, and enhanced cleaning regimes, PPE equipment, school transport costs and wellbeing supports. </p></reply>

The act increases the transparency and fairness of school admissions. It makes clear that every school must be welcoming of every young person regardless of their colour, their abilities or disabilities. Parents have the right to choose which school to apply to and where the school has places available the pupil should be admitted.</p>  <p>  However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available a selection process may be necessary and it may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in their school of first choice. </p>  <p>  All schools have drafted admission policies that were applied for the first time for enrolment in September 2021, which are published on individual school websites. The act requires schools to clearly set out their selection criteria in their admission policies. Schools and their Patrons have discretion in relation to their admission criteria and how they are applied, once it is non-discriminatory and fair.  It is an important feature of the act that schools can only make a decision on an application for admission that is based on the schools admission policy. </p></reply>

The package is generally available to people living in the State aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment or who satisfy a means test.  The package is also available to some people under the age of 66, who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.  My Department will spend approximately &euro;273 million this year on HHB. </p><p>In 2022 the estimated cost of the gas and electricity element of the package is &euro;203 million and will benefit over 476,000 households.  The gas and electricity element is paid at a rate of &euro;35 per month, 12 months of the year. </p><p>Any decision to increase the electricity and gas aspect of the package would have budgetary consequences and would have to be considered in the context of overall budget negotiations.  </p><p>The Government is committed to protect vulnerable households from energy poverty.  In light of ESRI research and the commitment to ensure that the carbon tax is progressive, the Government has committed to very significant increases in a targeted package of social protection supports in Budget 2022.  These supports were selected to counteract the impact of the increased carbon tax on low-income households.  The specific measures are:</p><p>- An increase to the Qualified Child Payment of &euro;2 per week for children under 12 and &euro;3 per week for children over 12.</p><p>- An increase in the Living Alone Allowance of &euro;3 per week.</p><p>- An increase to the Fuel Allowance of &euro;5 per week.</p><p>- An increase in the income threshold for Working Family Payment of &euro;10 per week  <b>.</b></p><p>Analysis undertaken estimates that the net impact of the combined measures is progressive.  Households in the bottom four income deciles will see all of the cost of the carbon tax increase offset, with the bottom three deciles being better off as a result of these measures.</p><p>As well as increasing the weekly rate of fuel allowance with immediate effect, we also made a number of reforms to the fuel allowance scheme in Budget 2022, including:</p><p>- Increasing the weekly means threshold by &euro;20 to &euro;120, representing a 20% increase and enabling more people to qualify for this support.</p><p>- The qualifying period for Jobseeker&rsquo;s and Supplementary Welfare Allowance recipients was reduced from 15 to 12 months with effect from September 2022, again enabling more people to qualify for the support.</p><p>The recently announced Electricity Costs Emergency Benefit Payment is a key measure being developed by the Government to help mitigate the effects of the recent unprecedented rise in electricity prices.  The scheme, under the auspices of the Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications and supervised by the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities will be paid in addition to the gas and electricity element of the HHB package to qualifying households.  Approximately 2.1m households will benefit by &euro;100 each from the new scheme.  Primary and secondary legislation will be required and it is expected that payments will begin in Quarter 1 2022. </p><p>The Deputy will appreciate that provision of income support is only part of the answer in terms of addressing energy costs.  One of the best ways to tackle energy costs in the long term is to improve the energy efficiency of the dwelling through proper building and household insulation.  This is the responsibility of the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI).  The SEAI provides a range of schemes in this area including the Better Energy Homes scheme, the Better Energy Warmer Homes Scheme, the Better Energy Warmth &amp;amp; Wellbeing Pilot Scheme, the Deep Retrofit Pilot Scheme, Better Energy Communities and Free Energy Efficiency Upgrades (co-funded by the Irish Government and European Union and delivered by the SEAI).</p><p>Under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme, exceptional needs payments may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which customers are unable to meet out of their own resources, and this may include help towards the cost of utility bills.  Decisions on such payments are made on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>I trust that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The package is also available to some people under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments. </p>  <p>  The HHB scheme is an administrative, non-statutory scheme and is not governed by legislation.

The objective of the programme is to provide regular, nutritious food to children who are unable, due to lack of good quality food, to take full advantage of the education provided to them.  The programme is an important component of policies to encourage school attendance and extra educational achievement. </p><p>A budget of &euro;68.1 million has been provided for the scheme in 2022. </p><p>In recent years entry to the School Meals Scheme has been confined to DEIS schools in addition to schools identified as having levels of concentrated disadvantage that would benefit from access to the School Meals Programme.</p><p>Prior to the introduction of DEIS in 2005, all schools and organisations that were part of one of a number of Department of Education and Skills&rsquo; initiatives for disadvantaged schools were eligible to participate in the programme, including Breaking the Cycle, Giving Children an Even Break, the Disadvantaged Area Scheme, Home School Community Liaison and the School Completion Programme.  </p><p>These schools and organisations have continued to remain in the scheme since the introduction of DEIS in 2005 but their level of funding has been capped at the same rate year on year to allow for the concentration of the scheme on DEIS schools. </p><p>Funding under the School Meals Programme is normally confined to the academic year but an exception was made in recognition of Covid-19.  Funding under the school meals programme remained available to schools to allow them to provide food during school closures and over the holiday periods. </p><p>Furthermore, funding was made available to schools participating in the Department of Education&rsquo;s School Based Education Programme, which focusses on pupils with complex special educational needs and those at risk of education disadvantage over the summer months. </p><p>The school referred to by the Deputy participated in the Department of Education&rsquo;s School Based Education Programme last summer and received funding to cover the cost of food for the duration of that programme. </p><p>Previously, this school applied to join the school meals programme and was informed that no provision could be provided as it does not have designated DEIS status. </p><p>Budget 2022 has provided the Department of Education an allocation of &euro;18million for 2022 and &euro;32million for 2023 to extend the DEIS programme to further schools with the highest levels of disadvantage. This represents an increase of over 20% in funding for the DEIS programme and will enable an expansion in 2022 to additional schools. </p><p>This package follows an extensive body of work which has been under taken by the DEIS technical group in relation to the development of a model to identify the concentrated levels of disadvantage of schools. The refined DEIS ID model is an objective, statistics based process, based on school enrolment data and data available from Census 2016 under the HP Deprivation Index. It is important to note that there is no application process for the DEIS programme and all schools will be considered by the Department of Education under the refined DEIS model when it is applied.  </p><p>In advance of the implementation of the refined DEIS identification model, I am advised that there will be further engagement by the Department of Education with relevant stakeholders. The purpose is to ensure that, as far as possible, the refined DEIS identification model can provide an objective and independent means of identifying schools serving high concentrations of pupils at risk of educational disadvantage and also to ensure there is a full understanding of the refined model and its potential application.I trust that this clarifies the position for the Deputy. </p></reply>

The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household.</p>  <p>  A person in receipt of a Social Security Payment from a country covered by EU Regulations or a country with which Ireland has a Bilateral Social Security Agreement (of which there is an Irish equivalent payment) is eligible to apply for the fuel allowance payment on the same basis as Irish State pension recipients.  As with all other recipients of the fuel allowance, the person must satisfy a means test as well as all other qualifying conditions.  If a person is in receipt of a foreign pension other than a qualifying foreign pension as outlined above, then they will not be entitled to the fuel allowance payment.</p>  <p>  With regards to the UK Winter Fuel Payment, receiving this payment does not debar a person from receiving the Irish Fuel Allowance. The amount of UK Winter Fuel payment received is included when assessing a person&rsquo;s means for fuel allowance purposes and once the applicant satisfies all qualifying conditions the Irish Fuel Allowance can be paid.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

After the medical assessment, if a person's restriction regarding their capacity for work is rated as moderate, severe or profound, their payment continues at 50%, 75% or 100% of their previous rate, respectively.

The objective of the programme is to provide regular, nutritious food to children who are unable, due to lack of good quality food, to take full advantage of the education provided to them.  The programme is an important component of policies to encourage school attendance and extra educational achievement. </p>  <p>  A budget of &euro;68.1 million has been provided for the scheme in 2022. </p>  <p>  Funding under the school meals (local projects) scheme can be provided for breakfast, snack, lunch, dinner, hot meals and afterschool clubs and is based on a maximum rate per child per day, depending on the type of meal being provided e.g. &euro;1.40 per child per day where a cold lunch is being provided, &euro;1.90 per child per day where a dinner is being provided, and &euro;2.90 per child per day where school Meal  is being provided.  Funding for the dinner option provide a hot meal, but is different from the Hot Meals, in that they tend to be provided by schools with onsite cooking facilities whereas food for Hot School Meals option is cooked offsite and either delivered hot or reheated in the school.</p>  <p>  Following the publication of nutrition standards for school meals in 2017, an examination of CPI data showed that the overall trend since end 2012 has been a reduction in the price of the types of food generally supplied under the school meals scheme.  An examination of costs of the types of food to be supplied under the standards showed that the foods were generally affordable in the main supermarkets within the current rates, noting that suppliers would be achieving better value when purchasing in bulk. Principals are expected to manage the funding allocated to their school and seek value for money as well as managing absences from school.</p>  <p>  I am committed to continuing to grow the school meals programme and in particular the hot school meal element of the programme, building further on the significant extension announced as part of Budget 2022. In this regard, I have commissioned an evaluation of the school meals programme to be undertaken in 2022 to inform future policy decisions on the scheme.</p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</p></reply>

From January 2022, the rate of payment increased by &euro;3.20, from &euro;128.60 to &euro;131.80. I am satisfied that the increase maintains the proportionality of the value of the payment. Unlike those in receipt of standard Jobseeker's Allowance, a key feature of the PTJI scheme is that participants can retain their supplement no matter how much they earn from the part time employment.</p>  <p>  The PTJI provides a stepping stone to full time employment as participants must continue to be actively seeking full time work. While participants on PTJI are not required to engage with the Department&rsquo;s Activation process, they can, however, voluntary engage with local Intreo Employment Services Officers who provide advice on job searching and employment opportunities, and assistance in accessing other employment supports and services, including training and development opportunities.</p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies my position at this time.</p></reply>

The estimated full year cost of the scheme is over &euro;18.1 million. To receive the allowance a customer of my Department must be in receipt of a qualifying payment such as the State pension and also in receipt of the Living Alone Allowance and the Fuel Allowance and the scheme supports recipients by assisting with the cost of communications and/or home security solutions. </blockquote>  <p>The provision for Illness Benefit is paid only to people below State pension age, which is currently 66.

This is administered by this Department's Community Welfare Service and can be accessed by customers through their local Intreo Office.</p><p>While I fully understand that these are difficult and distressing times for many people, especially for the vulnerable and the elderly, any further economic measures can only be considered while taking account of the overall budgetary context and the availability of financial resources.</p><p>I trust this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The purpose of the service is to provide assistance and advice to jobseekers who are long-term unemployed.  Providers are paid based on performance and except for the initial registration fee, payments are only made when a client has achieved sustained employment that is verified by my Department.</p><p>The service works with the client to identify and provide intensive support to overcome barriers to employment.  Each person is assigned a personal advisor who assesses their skills, experience, challenges and work goals and agrees a &ldquo;personal progression plan&rdquo; that includes a schedule of activities, actions and job focused targets. Participants are provided with a range of development supports and may also be referred for further education and training opportunities.</p><p>The period of engagement with the service is 52 weeks, and during that time, the jobseeker avails of intensive support from a dedicated Personal Advisor (PA) and meets their advisor at least once every 20 days. If the jobseeker is successful in finding employment, the support of the PA continues for the remaining duration of the person&rsquo;s engagement with the service and for a period of at least six and possibly up to twelve months thereafter.</p><p>If the jobseeker obtains employment but it is not sustained, engagement with the PA will resume. The employment experience will be reviewed to build on progress, and to identify measures to sustain employment.  This may entail referral to training, education or other interventions appropriate to sustaining employment.</p><p>The overall performance of the contractors in assisting persons in gaining and sustaining employment is under continual review. My Department meets regularly with the contractors to review all aspects of the contract delivery including performance.</p><p>The current JobPath contracts were extended until the end of 2021. In December, in light of the continuing adverse impacts of Covid-19 and on foot of extending the period of consultation with the relevant stakeholders, it was agreed to extend all contracted employment services for the long term unemployed - the Local Employment Services, the Job Clubs (in Phase 2 areas) and JobPath - for a further twenty six weeks until the end of June 2022. This measure was taken in order to ensure that the public employment service has sufficient capacity to support those impacted by the pandemic with access to employment services.</p><p>While JobPath referrals will terminate at the end of June, there will be a run-off period to enable existing clients to complete their engagement with the service.</p><p>It is not intended to publish the individual payments to the JobPath companies as these are commercially sensitive and to do so would place the State at a disadvantage both in terms of the contracts currently in place and in future procurement processes.</p><p>The total of fees paid under the JobPath programme to date is &euro;287 million.  </p><p>2015 - &euro;1.2m; </p><p>2016 - &euro;25.2m; </p><p>2017 - &euro;57.4m; </p><p>2018 - &euro;71.7m </p><p>2019 - &euro;58.6m </p><p>2020 - &euro;36.2m </p><p>2021 - &euro;34m</p><p>2022 - &euro;2.7m (to date)</p><p>Total - &euro;287m</p><p>Please note this is gross expenditure and does not take into account the savings made in welfare payments for those who secured sustained employment.</p></reply>

There is a range of benefits available to people who make Pay Related Social Insurance (PRSI) contributions. Entitlement to such benefits is dependent on the individual's social insurance contribution record, the class of social insurance paid as well as satisfying other qualification criteria relevant to the scheme. A person who has an insufficient PRSI contribution record to qualify for a social insurance benefit/pension may apply for the appropriate means-tested social assistance scheme.</p><p>There has been an expansion of access to the range of social insurance benefits for self-employed social insurance contributors in recent years, which now includes:</p> <blockquote> 	Adoptive Benefit,<br /><br />Guardian's Payment (Contributory),<br /><br />Jobseeker's Benefit (Self-Employed),<br /><br />Maternity Benefit,<br /><br />Invalidity Pension,<br /><br />Parent's Benefit,<br /><br />Paternity Benefit,<br /><br />State Pension (Contributory),<br /><br />Treatment Benefit,<br /><br />Widows, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's (Contributory) Pension, and<br /><br />Partial Capacity Benefit (where in receipt of Invalidity Pension). </blockquote>  <p>The Partial Capacity Benefit (PCB) scheme has been designed to support people who are in receipt of Illness Benefit (for at least 26 weeks) or Invalidity Pension, as listed above, and who have retained some capacity for work and wish to return to employment.  Employees and Self-employed Persons not in receipt of Illness Benefit (for 26 weeks) or Invalidity Pension are not eligible for the scheme.</p><p>The Department regularly reviews its supports and payments schemes to ensure that they continue to meet their objectives. While any proposed changes have to be considered in an overall policy and budgetary context.</p></reply>

Its membership consists of the Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine; Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth; Education; Health; Rural and Community Development; and Social Protection. The Society of St. Vincent de Paul, Crosscare and the Children's Rights Alliance are also members of this group.</p>  <p>  The group met on four occasions in 2021, and is due to meet again in the coming weeks. The group has focused on two pieces of work to date. The first is a high-level mapping exercise of programmes, services and supports across Government that address food poverty and provide supports in this area.  Data gathering is complete, and my Department is assessing how the data can be further used and disseminated.</p>  <p>  The second piece of work is the development of a research proposal to analyse the prevalence of food poverty in three selected case study areas to identify the drivers of food poverty in each area and examine the range of service providers and actors relating to food poverty in each area. It should also identify any gaps and overlaps in service provision. The findings from this research should further inform the delivery of commitment 61 of the Roadmap for Social Inclusion.</p>  <p>  I thank the Deputy for his question and hope this clarifies the matter.</p></reply>

The Commission was an independent body comprised of knowledgeable and experienced academics, pension experts, members of civil society and representatives of workers and employers.  Once it completed its work and fulfilled its obligations, the Commission was dissolved. The Commission's Report was published on 7th October 2021. The report, Technical Sub-Committee's working papers and submissions made to the Pensions Commission are available on the website, pensionscommission.gov.ie.</p>  <p>  The Commission's Report is a comprehensive report that takes account of an assessment of various analyses of population, labour force and expenditure projections; an examination of international approaches; and responses to an extensive consultation process. It has unambiguously established that the current State Pension system is not sustainable into the future and that changes are needed, and it has set out a wide range of recommendations in this regard - including measures to increase Social Insurance Fund (PRSI) income.</p>  <p>  The report has been referred to the Joint Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands for its views. Separately, as set out in its terms of reference, the Commission on Taxation and Welfare is considering the report of the Pensions Commission in the context of its review of potential changes to the social insurance system.</p>  <p>  In the interests both of older people and of future generations of older people, the Government intends to consider the comprehensive and far reaching recommendations in the Pensions Commission&rsquo;s Report very carefully and holistically. My officials will continue to work over the coming months to examine each of the recommendations. They will consult across Government through the Cabinet Committee system. I think it is really important that we complete that work before reaching conclusions. I intend to bring a recommended response and implementation plan to Government by the end of March 2022.</p>  <p>  The State Pension is the bedrock of the pension system in Ireland.  It is extremely effective at ensuring that our pensioners do not experience poverty. This Government is committed to ensuring that this remains the case for current pensioners, those nearing State Pension age and today&rsquo;s young workers including those who are only starting their careers.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputies.</p></reply>

It provides important evidence of the additional costs that people with a disability face in their day-to-day lives. The Programme for Government contains a commitment to use research into the cost of disability to properly inform the direction of future policy.</p>  <p>  While the Department of Social Protection has primary responsibility in terms of supporting people into employment, including those with disabilities, my Department plays an important role in coordinating and delivering on actions within the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities (CES). The CES is a 10-year whole-of-government approach to support people with disabilities to enter and retain fair employment. The CES has been implemented to date through a series of action plans and my Department is leading on the development of the third and final CES Action Plan for the 2022-2024 period. The CES provides a critical framework through which action will be taken to address the additional costs that individuals with a disability in Ireland are faced with.</p>  <p>  Under the CES, my Department has funded the establishment of the &lsquo;Employers for Change&rsquo; service, an employer-focused information service provided by Open Doors Initiative through which employers are supported and encouraged to employ people with disabilities.

Core Funding is a major recommendation in the report of the Expert Group to develop a new funding model, <i>Partnership for the Public Good: A New Funding Model for ELC and SAC </i>available here: first5fundingmodel.gov.ie/report/.</p><p>The recommendations of the Expert Group are designed to deliver quality for children, affordability for parents, stability for providers, and support employers to improve pay and conditions for staff.</p><p>Core Funding will operate from September and will be worth up to &euro;69 million in 2022 and up to &euro;207 million in a full year from 2023 on.</p><p>The contractual requirement for fees to remain at or below September 2021 levels will apply to Transition Fund from May 2022.  It will continue apply from September 2022 for services in receipt Core Funding. The Transition Fund and Core Funding will be open to all services, subject to them agreeing to come into contract and these prevention of fee increases will apply for both schemes.</p><p>The sum paid to each service under the Transition Fund will depend on the service&rsquo;s capacity, location, and service type.</p><p>The calculation of the value of the new Core Funding stream to an individual provider will take account of their level of capacity including the number of children, the ages of children, and their hours of operation and will reflect the qualification levels of staff. By basing the core funding stream on capacity, providers will have a stable income source based on the service they deliver.</p><p>Since the announcements on Budget Day  last October, my Department has been communicating with stakeholders including providers and representative organisations through a number of mechanisms, including for example FAQs, available here: www.gov.ie/en/publication/b3e97-budget-2022-overview-and-faqs-for-early-learning-and-care-elc-and-school-age-childcare-sac-providers-and-parents/.  Detailed information on the new funding model is also available in the recommendations of the Expert Group report referenced above.</p><p>Additional communications will issue to the sector in the coming months to give further details on the new funding streams.</p><p>Budget 2022 also confirmed that ELC and SAC employers will continue to benefit from the exemption to the turnover rule for the EWSS until April 2022 in order to prevent the additional costs from public health measures being passed on to parents.</p><p>The EWSS has been available to employers in the sector since August 2020, with enhanced EWSS rates (from October 2020-January 2022) equalling &euro;34 million per month, covering on average 80% of payroll costs and 50% of total operating costs for providers, standard EWSS equalling &euro;22 million per month (from August 2020-October 2020 and for February 2022), covering on average 50% of payroll costs and 38% of total operating costs for providers and a new EWSS flat rate of &euro;100 that will apply from March-April  2022 amounting to &euro;11 million per month, covering on average, 25% staff costs or 11% total operating costs.</p><p>In advance of May 2022, given the level of investment being made available to the sector through EWSS, it is difficult to see any justification for an increase in fees at this time.</p><p>Where providers require further financial assistance in addition to current supports available, the Department operates a Covid-19 Impact Support Scheme. This is additional to the existing financial supports and is to support the sustainability of ELC and SAC services who may be left with short-term sustainability concerns due to lower attendance or higher costs arising from Covid-19. This scheme supports services to remain open without increasing their Registered Fees to parents or guardians.</p><p>‎‎Sustainability Funding also continues to be available to providers where there are sustainability difficulties and I have requested that providers would exhaust this route before considering increases in fees for parents. I encourage providers to contact their local City/County Childcare Committee if they require any further information or support: myccc.ie/.</p></reply>

Participation of children with disabilities in the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) universal pre-school programme in mainstream early learning and care services is supported by the Access and Inclusion Model (AIM), which is delivered by my Department. The key objective of AIM is to support early learning and care providers to deliver an inclusive preschool experience, ensuring that children with a disability can fully participate in the ECCE Programme, thereby reaping the benefits of quality preschool provision.</p><p>Your child and your child&rsquo;s pre-school can avail of universal and targeted supports from AIM. Some children may need more targeted supports to participate in the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) Programme.  More information on AIM is available at: <i>aim.gov.ie/ </i></p><p>There is an AIM Early Years Specialist available  to work with parents and pre-school providers to develop an inclusive learning environment for your child. Applying for AIM educational advice and mentoring is very simple.  The parent is advised to speak with their pre-school provider who will make an application for targeted supports in collaboration with the parent. The pre-school will submit this application to Better Start through the Early Years on line portal &lsquo;the HIVE&rsquo; on the parent&rsquo;s behalf.  Once reviewed, a Better Start Early Years Specialist will conduct a parent review to determine whether all other levels and supports have been considered and appropriately used, as well as obtain expert input from the HSE as necessary.  This process can take up to a maximum of 12 weeks, however, current processing times are much shorter than this.</p><p>Children who are ECCE eligible and are attending a specialist pre-school service can also seek AIM supports. These specialist pre-school services include autism-specific pre-school services provided by the Department of Education, which include:  </p><p>- 132 Early Intervention Classes attached to primary schools for autistic children aged three and over. </p><p>- A Home Tuition Scheme which provides funding towards 10 hours' tuition for children under 3 years of age and 20 hours per week for  children over 3 years of age who cannot secure a placement in an early intervention class. Subject to conditions, parents are free to use the grant to  engage tutors to deliver tuition in their home or pre-school  providers to deliver tuition in a group/pre-school setting. Such arrangements are essentially between the parents and the relevant  provider.</p><p>More information is available at: <i>www.gov.ie/en/organisation/department-of-education/.</i></p></reply>

On that basis, planning for the opening up of society, including the further education, higher education and research sector, has commenced.</p>  <p>  Arising from the announcement, institutions have been advised that there should be an ongoing and continuing emphasis on the promotion and use of individual responsibility and personal protective measures including hand washing, hand sanitizing, respiratory etiquette and use of masks in appropriate circumstances based on individual and sectoral risk assessments.  Institutions will highlight and encourage the importance of exercising individual responsibility in relation to personal protective measures to underpin the opportunities for increased onsite activity now presenting across the higher and further education and research system. Formal requirements for physical distancing in hospitality settings and in general have also been removed and institutions may proceed to plan for increased levels of activity on that basis.</p>  <p>  The Safe Return Plan supports this approach and continues to provide a comprehensive framework for institutions to plan for the provision of significant on-site activity and a broader student experience fully supported by public health authorities and has the requisite flexibility to allow institutions to adjust activities for greater levels of on-site activity. In this way, institutions can now take opportunities to expand and intensify on-site learning in the phased way that is envisaged and institutions have been advised that the framework should be utilised in a way that enables this. </p>  <p>  As part of the ongoing national strategy, staff and students should be aware of the importance of following public health guidance in relation to self-isolation for cases and restricted movements for close contacts. In line with that guidance, those experiencing symptoms should not attend their educational institution and should immediately self-isolate and arrange for testing. In addition, there will be a continued strong emphasis on maximizing the vaccination uptake for both primary and booster vaccines. Staff and students are encouraged to avail of primary and booster vaccinations given the critical importance of vaccinations in offering protection against infection and transmission of the virus.</p>  <p>  Each institution will adapt to the changes in the public health environment in a phased manner and arising from local consultation, and I have emphasized that clear communications by institutions will be key to alleviating any concerns that staff and students have. Collaboration and consideration, which have been a feature of the sector&rsquo;s response to the pandemic thus far, will continue to play a key role in ensuring that we can all work together to ensure that the further and higher education and research sector can continue to operate safely.</p></reply>

Student grant legislation was amended in 2020 to retain the status quo to allow maintenance grant funding for eligible students attending an approved undergraduate course in Northern Ireland/the UK to continue post-Brexit.</p><p>In general, an approved undergraduate course in this context is defined as a full-time undergraduate course of not less than two years duration pursued in a university or third level institution, which is maintained or assisted by recurrent grants from public funds in another EU Member State or the UK.  </p><p>The Student Grant Scheme does not extend to the payment of tuition fees to institutions outside the State, other than for exceptional provision in respect of postgraduate courses in Northern Ireland. This provision is consistent with the principles of the Good Friday Agreement and is intended to promote greater tolerance and understanding between both jurisdictions. </p><p>The draft Student Grant Scheme review was submitted to me in late December 2021.  Given the inter-connectivity between strategic student support issues and other reform priorities (e.g. the expansion of supports to part-time and blended learners as an enabler of lifelong learning or enhanced postgraduate supports as an enabler to equality, diversity and inclusion in the R&amp;amp;I system) it is now my intention to bring the report to Cabinet shortly alongside the Future Funding Model report. The extension of funding under the Student Grant Scheme to provide for both fees and maintenance grant assistance for undergraduate students in Northern Ireland is not part of the current review. </p><p>However, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education including approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in EU Member States and in non-EU countries. Further information on this tax relief is available from a student's local Tax office or from the Revenue Commissioners website <i>www.revenue.ie</i></p></reply>

My Department continues to support a range of programmes to upskill employees to meet the evolving needs of the economy.</p>  <p>  The Skills to Advance initiative was launched by SOLAS in 2018 and is delivered through the Education and Training Boards (ETBs).  It aims to equip employees with the skills to progress in their current job, or to take advantage of new job opportunities.  Targeting support for vulnerable groups in the workforce it also supports SMEs who need assistance to invest in and develop their workforce.    New initiatives in key areas such as leadership and management have been rolled along with sectoral initiatives for the Hospitality and Tourism sector to assist a sector greatly impacted by COVID-19.  During 2021, Skills to Advance expanded its offering to include developing Green Skills for SMEs. Collaboration with over 30 enterprise agencies is central to effective implementation of these new initiatives and ensures that the Skills to Advance initiative continues to be agile and responsive to changing skills needs.</p>  <p>  The Innovation through Collaboration Fund, introduced as part of the Skills to Advance initiative, provides ETBs with an opportunity to bid for additional funding to enable a major step-up in innovation in employee development supports and training opportunities for individuals and enterprise.  10 proposals were awarded some &euro;3.3m  under the 2019 Innovation through Collaboration Call across a range of sectors. A further 7 proposals were received under the 2021 Call and I understand that SOLAS expects to confirm the funded proposals shortly.</p>  <p>  The Skills for Work programme also continues to provide training opportunities to help employees deal with the basic skills demands of the workplace.  </p>  <p>  Within the Higher Education institutions, modular courses have been introduced. These courses are shorter, more focused and offered in a flexible manner, allowing people to gain important skills without taking a considerable period away from work. They represent a new route into lifelong learning, and provide upskilling and reskilling opportunities for those who need it, while ensuring that they remain close to the labour market. </p>  <p>  My Department also funds Skillnet Ireland, which provides a wide range of talent development and upskilling supports primarily though the core Skillnet Business Networks programme. </p>  <p>  Finally, eCollege is the SOLAS-funded online training facility providing a range of high quality interactive online learning courses in business, project management, information technology, graphic design, web design, digital marketing, software development and basic computer literacy.   eCollege courses have been temporarily made available free of charge as additional supports to those impacted by Covid-19.</p></reply>

As a result of this successful pilot, restricted mobile device use to conduct individual appointments with psychologists/chaplains is now implemented in all closed prisons across the estate where an outbreak occurs.</p>  <p>  The Prison Service also offers restricted mobile device use in-cell as an alternative modality to prisoners based in the National Violence Reduction Unit in order to engage with a Service psychologist.</p>  <p>  Funding has been made available in Budget 2022 to commence a trial scheme to introduce the use of mobile tablet devices for Integrated Sentence Management Coordinators to conduct prisoner interviews. The objective of this new project is to improve and increase direct prisoner contact time and enhance record keeping.</p>  <p>  Laptops are occasionally provided to prisoners to review evidence for an upcoming legal case, on a case by case basis and subject to the necessary approval. In addition, people in custody who are completing third level courses are provided with laptops, with Governor approval, so that they can continue to type up assignments and access course material while in their cells.  Similar to restricted mobile devices, laptops are provided on a temporary basis to the prisoners for as long as they are required.  </p>  <p>  I can further inform the Deputy that a dedicated prison specific in-cell TV channel is also available in each location, which is in addition to normal TV services.  This is a method of communicating information and specifically targeted content directly to prisoners in their cells.  It provides for instant universal messaging where an essential or urgent message can be broadcast from a single central source to every in-cell television across the estate in real time.  People in custody can access information from a diverse range of prisoner services such as healthcare, psychology, education, library, chaplaincy, Red Cross, Irish  Association for Social Inclusion Opportunities (IASIO) and Merchants Quay Ireland (MQI). </p>  <p>  It is also utilised to provide ongoing important Covid healthcare information and prison information and advice.  Making effective use of digital systems for teaching and learning has been identified as a key objective of the joint Irish Prison Service / Education and Training Boards Ireland Prison Education Strategy 2019 &ndash; 2022. </p>  <p>  The Prison Service is developing a Blended Learning Plan which will allow prisoners to continue their education through the viewing of educational courses using systems such as the in-cell TV channel.</p></reply>

It also draws upon relevant international human rights standards, in particular the preventive approach and standards set by the Optional Protocol to the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (OPCAT). </p></reply>

In addition, the issue of outdated alcohol licensing legislation was a key challenge identified by stakeholders in the published report of the Night-Time Economy Taskforce.</p>  <p>  I intend to modernise alcohol licensing laws through the proposed Sale of Alcohol Bill. The objective of the proposed Bill is to repeal the Licensing Acts 1833 to 2018 and the Registration of Clubs Acts 1904 to 2008 and to replace them with updated and streamlined provisions more suited to the 21st century. It is also the intention to repeal the Public Dance Hall Act 1935.</p>  <p>  I am very conscious of public concerns in relation to alcohol-related harm in our society, and the Bill is being developed in a way that takes account of those concerns regarding health, as well as the interests of consumers, communities and businesses.  </p>  <p>  With this in mind, on 25 November 2021, I launched a public consultation to seek the views of the public on the modernisation of Ireland&rsquo;s licencing laws. The consultation, which ran until 21 January 2022, looked at how best to update the existing laws governing the sale and regulation of alcohol in Ireland. Members of the public, academics, sectoral groups and representative organisations were invited to complete an online survey and/or make a written submission to my Department. There was a sizeable response to the consultation and I would like to thank all of those who engaged with this process. My Department is now reviewing the responses received to inform the further development of the Bill.</p></reply>

Furthermore, EEA and Swiss nationals are not required to register with immigration authorities.</p><p>Not all non-EEA nationals are visa required. A full list of visa required and non-visa required countries can be found on my Department's website at: <i>www.irishimmigration.ie/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Immigration-Service-Delivery-Visa-and-Non-Visa-Required-Countries.pdf . </i></p><p>All visa applications are automatically checked against the relevant databases. Applicants must declare any criminal convictions and any negative immigration history, such as visa refusals or deportations, in any country. My Department also carries out routine checks with other countries through our local visa office and mission network abroad, as required.</p><p>Furthermore, the granting of a visa does not guarantee entry into the State. Entry into the State, for both visa required and non-visa required nationals, is solely at the discretion of the Immigration Officer at the port of entry. The onus is on the individual to have all documentation relating to their reasons for entering Ireland ready for presentation to the Immigration Officer to gain entry. </p><p>Under the European Communities Free Movement of Persons Regulations 2015, I may make a removal order in respect of an EU national who represents a danger for public policy or public security if their conduct represents a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting one of the fundamental interests of society. If an EU national residing in Ireland is found guilty of a crime, including a violent crime, the Garda National Immigration Bureau will notify my Department. </p><p>However, if the person has resided in the State for more than 10 years or is under the age of 18 years, a removal order can only be made on imperative grounds of public security. The family and economic circumstances of the person are also assessed, the nature of their social and cultural integration in the State, the health of the person and their links with their country of origin, in deciding whether or not to make such an order. </p><p>For non-EU citizens residing in Ireland, each individual immigration case is assessed under the criteria set out in Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended). These criteria include the age of the person, their duration of residence in the State, the family and economic circumstances of the person, their character and conduct, including any criminal convictions and considerations of national security and public policy. The individual&rsquo;s &lsquo;character and conduct&rsquo; is assessed both within and (where relevant and ascertainable) outside the State.

Ireland ratified the Convention in November 2011 and the Government is fully committed to its implementation and Irish Government delegations have participated in the Conferences of States Parties.</p>  <p>  As part of the Convention, Member States are also party to its review mechanism. The UNCAC review mechanism is a peer review process that assists countries to effectively implement the Convention. The review mechanism is comprised of two review cycles.</p>  <p>  The first review cycle, which commenced in 2010, covered Chapters III on Criminalisation and Law Enforcement and IV on International Cooperation. Ireland completed the first cycle in 2014.</p>  <p>  The second review cycle, which commenced in 2016, covered Chapter II on Preventive Measures and Chapter V on Asset Recovery. As part of the evaluation process, an on-site visit by the evaluation team took place in Dublin from 26-28 June 2018. An executive summary of the evaluation was published in February 2019 highlighting Ireland's successes and good practices in relation to its implementation of the Convention, and also identifying areas for improvement. The finalisation of the full country report was delayed due to the impact of COVID-19 and was published in December 2021.</p>  <p>  Related to this particular recommendation, the report of the Review of Structures and Strategies to Prevent, Investigate and Penalise Economic Crime and Corruption was published on 3 December 2020. This review group was led by Mr James Hamilton and their recommendations focused primarily on legislative, structural and resourcing measures to enhance agency and multi-agency enforcement and prevention capacity in the criminal justice sphere.</p>  <p>  One of the issues which they considered was the establishment of a Corporate Crime Agency. Ultimately, the review group came to the conclusion that the establishment of a new Corporate Crime Agency would represent a duplication of efforts and an inefficient use of resources. However, they did recommend the development of a multi-annual national Strategy to Combat Economic Crime and Corruption, and accompanying Action Plan, and the establishment, on a permanent basis, of a cross-sectoral, partnership-based Advisory Council to advise the Government on strategic and policy responses to all forms of economic crime and corruption, as well as a forum of operational representatives.</p>  <p>  An implementation plan to progress the report&rsquo;s recommendations was published on 19 April 2021, detailing the exact actions to be taken across government and by State agencies. The Economic Crime and Corruption Forum was established in June 2021 and has met regularly since then. Work is underway to finalise the membership of the Advisory Council thereby enabling its full establishment in Q1 2022 and allowing work to begin on the development of the multi-annual national strategy for combatting economic crime and corruption. The establishment of the Forum and the Advisory Council will in effect fulfil this UNCAC recommendation.</p></reply>

This package would significantly reshape how AML regulation is structured, and includes a proposal for the creation of a single EU authority with responsibility for the area. If introduced, the package will, in turn, require substantial revisions to our national AML regime. However, as the negotiations on the package are ongoing, and the proposals may change significantly before they are finalised, it would be premature to speculate on what changes may be required.</p>  <p>  Responsibility for countering money laundering is shared across several Government Departments and other bodies, and affects many sectors of our economy.

This policy aims to promote respect, dignity, safety, and equality in the workplace.  Every employee has a right to work in an environment free of any form of bullying, harassment or sexual harassment and every employee has a duty to behave in an acceptable and respectful manner.</p>  <p>  I have been assured by the Director General of the Prison Service that all complaints raised under that policy are treated seriously, fairly and in the strictest confidence.  Furthermore, complaints which are upheld may be pursued by the HR Manager as a disciplinary issue, in accordance with the provisions of the Disciplinary Code. </p>  <p>  The Protected Disclosures Act was enacted in 2014 to allow employees to bring alleged wrongdoing to the attention of the appropriate authorities. The Irish Prison Service current Protected Disclosures Policy issued on 1 July 2018. It is aimed at supporting the Prison Service&rsquo;s values, ensuring employees can raise concerns about relevant wrongdoing which come to their attention in connection with their employment, without fear of penalisation. </p>  <p>  The policy further details the protections and supports available for staff who make protected disclosures and those involved in the investigation of a protected disclosure. The Irish Prison Service is a member of the Integrity At Work Programme, an initiative of Transparency International Ireland. Independent and confidential advice is available to workers (who have made or are considering making a disclosure) via Transparency International Ireland&rsquo;s speak up helpline.</p>  <p>  My Department and the Prison Service have engaged independent investigators to examine the majority of the disclosures and to report to the disclosers on the findings. There are dedicated units in my Department and in the Prison Service to liaise directly and in a confidential manner with disclosers. The Prison Service has provided training to staff on Protected Disclosures and Dignity at Work policies and procedures and it is planned that further training will be provided going forward.</p>  <p>  Employees of the Prison Service are encouraged to avail of the support services available.  These include the HR Governors and Staff Support Officers at the prison locations; the Employee Assistance Service at a national level and Inspire Workplaces which is a free confidential counselling service giving employees support on a range of personal and work-related issues.

The contract for this project was awarded in February 2019 with the construction element currently anticipated to be completed in the second quarter of this year.  This will be followed by the installation and commissioning of the various security and safety systems with the new facility expected to be operational in Q2/Q3 of this year. This timeline assumes no further impact on construction activity or supply chain issues due to the pandemic.</p>  <p>  The new women's prison will provide accommodation for 50 female prisoners and is a core element of the redevelopment project.</p>  <p>  The design concept for the new women's prison was influenced by best practice in prison design and similar rehabilitation facilities found in Scandinavia and it will have perimeter security features associated with medium level security, as it forms part of the overall prison site.</p>  <p>  The women's prison facility will differ in many respects to the current prison, having been designed around the principles of normalisation, progression and rehabilitation, underpinned by a therapeutic environment to support women in prison to reintegrate back into society on completion of their sentence.</p>  <p>  A mix of accommodation is being provided comprising bedrooms units, some apartment style units, a mother and baby unit with the accommodation based is around an external landscaped courtyard setting in keeping with the design principles on creating a safe therapeutic space and supportive regime. In addition, the new female prison will also provide improved facilities for families visiting. When commissioned the new facility will represent a sea change in the standard of accommodation and rehabilitative supports for female prisoners.</p>  <p>  The Prison Service is acutely aware of the importance of assisting prisoners to maintain close contact with their children while in custody. The Deputy will be aware that in order to protect the prison population from the risk of Covid, a number of infection control measures were introduced. Regrettably, this included the suspension of physical visits to prisoners for extended periods of time.  The Prison Service introduced a new video visit system to ensure that prisoners could continue to have visual contact with their families.</p>  <p>  Limerick Prison has a Tusla approved and award winning visitors area and the Prison Service work closely with care workers, the courts and Tusla to provide access visits where appropriate.   </p>  <p>  Among the commitments of the Probation Service/Irish Prison Service Women's joint strategy 2014-2016 was to improve outcomes for women offenders, including to explore the development of an open prison/open conditions for women assessed at a low risk of re-offending.  A Joint Probation Service/Irish Prison Service working group, when considering an open centre for women, recommended that a more practical and cost effective way to address the needs identified was to pursue a step down facility.  In this regard, the Probation and Prison Service worked collaboratively towards the identification of a suitable venue for a women's step down unit in Dublin, via a public procurement competition with the Office of Government Procurement.</p>  <p>  The vision of the Outlook Programme is to promote the rehabilitation and re-integration of women leaving prison and those who have accommodation needs requiring support in the community.  The Programme, which is managed by Focus Ireland, opened in May 2019, supports women serving sentences of imprisonment who pose a low risk to society to gradually re-integrate into the community.  The women the programme caters for are required to be drug free and have, in general, been convicted of one-off offences.  The Programme has capacity for 10 women.  8 spaces at the Outlook Programme at Stanhope Green and 2 apartments - the first apartment has been available since 7 July 2020 and another since 17 May 2021 and to date, 25 women have been supported by the project.</p>  <p>  The Abigail Centre is open since December 2014.  Two distinct organisations provide accommodation and other related services for women in the Centre.  NOVAS Initiatives provide supported temporary accommodation for 40 women in the main block of the building.  In a separate but connected unit, called T&uacute;s Nua, accommodation is provided for 15 women and is managed by De Paul Ireland.  T&uacute;s Nua work closely with the Prison and Probation Service to support women offenders to reintegrate into the community on their release from custody.  T&uacute;s Nua is funded by my Department through the Probation Service.</p>  <p>  Criminal Justice Housing First is a homeless assistance approach prioritising access to permanent housing for people experiencing homelessness.  Persons on community supervision, referred by the Probation Service, and persons in prison, are included within the broader national processes for Housing First.  A jointly commissioned three year pilot project, responding to the needs of 'harder to place' prisoners, was initiated in October 2020 in a partnership involving Dublin City Council, Probation Service, Irish Prison Service and my Department.  The plan strongly advocates that a cross departmental, cross sectoral approach to the needs of those with high support needs, including women who offend, harnessing the strengths of multiple agencies, is necessary to respond to the needs of this complex group, reduce the risk of homelessness and reduce the person's likelihood of re-offending.  Since the pilot programme commenced, 4 women prisoners have been accepted by Housing First.</p></reply>

However, the nature of the naturalisation process is such that, for a broad range of reasons, some cases will take longer than others to process.

They continue to enjoy arrangements held under the Common Travel Area (CTA), including the freedom to live in the State, following the UK's exit from the European Union. The CTA is comprised of the UK, the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man and Ireland. Within the CTA, Irish and British citizens can travel freely. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, where a UK citizen is the spouse of an Irish national, this does not automatically confer the rights granted under the EU Free Movement Directive (Directive 2004/38/EC). EU Free Movement provisions no longer apply to UK citizens from the end of the Transition Period under the Withdrawal Agreement on 31 December 2020. </p>  <p>  In order to acquire the rights of free movement under the Directive, a UK citizen married to an Irish national would need to apply for an EU Treaty Rights permission. The Directive applies to EEA nationals who move to another Member State or who live in a Member State other than their own and to the family members who accompany them or join them in the State (Article 3 of Directive 2004/38/EC).</p>  <p>  Exceptions can apply in cases such as:</p>  <p>&mdash; Where the non-EEA national family member has previously held a &ldquo;residence card of a family member of a Union citizen&rdquo; that has been issued by another Member State under Article 10 of the Directive and where they and their non-EEA family member have subsequently moved to Ireland, or</p>  <p>&mdash; Where the Irish citizen has exercised their right to free movement in another Member State prior to returning to Ireland and their non-EEA national family member accompanies them on return, having resided with the Irish citizen as a family member in that other Member State.</p></reply>

The applicant has an ongoing medical condition that prevents him/her from working at his/her occupation.<br /><br />2. This medical incapacity is likely to be permanent.<br /><br />3. Reasonable workplace accommodations (such as part-time working / redeployment) have been considered by management.<br /><br />4. Reasonable diagnostic and treatment options have been explored.</blockquote>The CMO must ensure the above criteria is met in the case of ill health retirement. The time it takes to secure treatment and assess its effectiveness can prolong the time required to conclude on the long term fitness of a member.</p><p>I am further advised that it is not possible to provide statistics of Garda members incapacitated but not yet &lsquo;ill health retired&rsquo; given the criteria above.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-02-01a.1585.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1502" speakername="Helen McEntee" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020100092#WRFF03100"><p>Diverting young people away from getting involved in criminal activity is a key priority for the Government and the exploitation of young people and children is a particular concern. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, while an adult may be prosecuted for a crime which has been committed by a child who has been incited to do so by the adult, there is currently no mechanism in law for explicitly recognising the damage done to the child. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to developing a law which would take account of this and penalise adults for the exploitation and harm done to the child in such cases. </p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that officials in my Department are already working to develop legislation in this regard. The General Scheme of the Criminal Justice (Exploitation of Children in the Commission of Offences) Bill was published in January 2021. The Bill underwent pre-legislative scrutiny in November 2021 and is currently being drafted by the Office of Parliamentary Counsel. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that this is a complex area as, in many cases, the adult in question is known to the child and may in some cases even be a family member, causing potential issues with regard to witness testimony.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, I published the new Youth Justice Strategy 2021-27 in April 2021 with Minister of State James Browne TD. This Strategy includes a commitment to develop the work of the Garda Youth Diversion Projects (GYDPs) to include targeted work with &lsquo;harder-to-reach&rsquo; young people. This includes young people heavily involved in crime and anti-social behaviour, for whom there are little supports and interventions available in practice, unless they are before the courts, in which case they may be under the supervision of the Probation Service. The Strategy also prioritises early intervention work, including with younger children who are assessed as being at serious risk. Both of these cohorts may include children at risk of recruitment by crime gangs.</p>  <p>  The development of this work within the GYDP network will be supported by the Research Evidence into Policy, Programmes and Practice (REPPP) project at the School of Law in the University of Limerick (UL).  The REPPP has led on the Greentown Project, which studied the influence of criminal networks on children in Ireland and a report was published in December 2016. The REPPP project is a strategic research partnership between UL and the Department of Justice.</p>  <p>  The Greentown Report identifies crime networks as a separate and plausible risk factor underlying criminal offending by certain children. It outlines how the influence of criminal networks increases the level of offending by a small number of children and entraps them in offending situations. </p>  <p>  The Greentown Report recommended the design of a programme to include interventions with children and their families to help them withstand the influence of criminal networks. The REPPP project team implemented a bespoke design process to produce a model for an Irish evidence-informed intervention programme. The Greentown programme has been designed with the input of leading international expertise on crime and criminal networks, together with Irish scientific, policy and practice expertise in child protection and welfare, drugs and community development.</p>  <p>  The Greentown programme, developed by the REPPP, commenced in two locations in 2020 and will run for three years. The learning from these trial sites will then be incorporated into mainstream GYDP practice. This specially designed intervention programme was developed with international expert advice, to tackle coercive control of children by criminal groups which entraps them in offending situations. Funds are already available for the initial trial sites from the Dormant Accounts Funds, with a total of &euro;4.2m allocated over three years. </p>  <p>  The implementation of the trial sites of the Greentown programme is part of the Strategic Objectives of the Youth Justice Strategy 2021-2027. This implementation process began with the establishment of the Governance and Strategy Group, and the Youth Justice Oversight Group. Both groups are chaired by my Department, which will provide oversight arrangements for Youth Justice Initiatives, including the Greentown pilots, to ensure that there is a cohesive response in practice to the needs of particular cohorts of children and particular communities.</p></reply>

While significant work continues to positively impact on waiting times and improve pathways to elective care, acute hospitals have been impacted by operational challenges arising from surges in cases related to the Delta and Omicron variants.</p>  <p>  As part of the response to this the HSE advised all Hospital Groups to take a series of immediate actions which included a period of prioritising unscheduled care, COVID care and urgent time sensitive work - in particular in Model 4 hospitals. Services are beginning to return to normal but elective procedures continue to be affected by staff absences due to Covid and emergency department pressures that are running above 2019 levels.</p>  <p>  The HSE has confirmed to the Department that patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health continues to work with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to identify ways to improve access to care, including through increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services, providing virtual clinics, and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Department of Health, the HSE and the NTPF are also working on a Multi Annual Waiting List Plan to bring waiting lists in line with Sl&aacute;intecare targets over the coming years. This process will be overseen by a Ministerial Taskforce, chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Health and includes representatives from the HSE and National Treatment Purchase Fund.</p>  <p>  For 2022 an additional allocation of &euro;250 million, comprised of &euro;200 million to the HSE and &euro;50 million to the National Treatment Purchase Fund has been provided in respect of work to reduce hospital and community waiting lists. The &euro;250 million will be used to fund additional activity in both the public and private sectors. The &euro;50 million additional funding provided to the NTPF brings its total allocation for 2022 to &euro;150 million, and as a consequence there will be a budget of &euro;350 million available to support vital initiatives to improve access to acute hospitals and community health services.</p>  <p>  The information requested by the Deputy is outlined in the attached document. </p>  <p>]</p></reply>

The payment of &euro;1,000 will not be subject to income tax, USC, or PRSI. The measure will be ring fenced to staff ordinarily onsite in COVID-19 exposed healthcare environments within the period between 1 March 2020 and 30 June 2021. </p>  <p>  Those public sector frontline healthcare workers eligible for the payment will be directly employed public health sector staff working in clinical settings. A pro-rata arrangement will apply for eligible part time staff / equivalents and supernumerary students who were required to perform training in clinical sites.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health will also introduce a measure for making a similar payment to staff in private sector nursing homes and hospices that were affected by Covid-19.</p>  <p>  I would like to assure the Deputy that work is underway to ensure fairness in the application of this measure as the Government intended. </p>  <p>  The Department and the HSE are currently engaging in finalising arrangements to give effect to the Government announcement concerning the Recognition Payment. Full particulars, eligibility and terms and conditions that apply to this payment shall be made available shortly. It is important that this measure is applied fairly as intended and I welcome the work that is ongoing to ensure this is so.</p>  <p>  There are many, many individuals in our country who did so much during the pandemic. I and the Government is sincerely grateful for this commitment but it is appropriate that these public sector frontline healthcare workers get particular recognition. They exposed themselves to particular COVID-19 risks that did not exist in other work environments or those working from home. I am also deeply appreciative of all those frontline workers who worked in our nursing homes and hospices during this pandemic and that they also get similar recognition.</p>  <p>  Outside of the above recognition, the Government also notes that some private healthcare companies have recognised the work of their employees during the pandemic. I would encourage private healthcare companies that have not already done so to consider appropriate measures to recognise their own frontline workers for their work during this most trying period.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-02-01a.1657.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020100093#WRGG04200"><p>Under the Health Act 1970, eligibility for a medical card is based primarily on means. The Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without undue hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself and his or her family, having regard to his or her overall financial position and reasonable expenditure.</p>  <p>  The issue of granting medical or GP visit cards based on having a particular disease or illness was previously examined in 2014 by the HSE Expert Panel on Medical Need and Medical Card Eligibility. The Group concluded that it was not feasible, desirable, nor ethically justifiable to list medical conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility. In following the Expert Group&rsquo;s advice, a person&rsquo;s means remains the main qualifier for a medical card.</p>  <p>  However, every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines. The HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income threshold where they face difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness. Social and medical issues are also considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services.   </p>  <p>  Furthermore, the HSE also has a system in place for the efficient provision of medical cards in response to emergency situations i.e. in circumstances where persons are in need of urgent ongoing medical care or are receiving end of life care.  In these cases, a medical card is issued within 24 hours of receipt of the required patient details and completed medical report by a healthcare professional.  Additionally, patients who have been certified by their treating Consultant as having  a prognosis of 24 months or less are also now eligible for a medical card without a means assessment.    </p>  <p>  Finally, it should be noted that since 2015 medical cards are awarded without the need of a financial assessment to all children under 18 years of age with a diagnosis of cancer, for a period of five years.   </p></reply>

At present all children up to and including the age of 5 are eligible for a GP visit card and therefore GP care without charges.</p>  <p>  The Health (General Practitioner Service and Alteration of Criteria for Eligibility) Act 2020 provides, amongst other things, for the phased expansion of GP care without fees to all children aged 12 years and under in three phases: to children aged 6 and 7; to children aged 8 and 9; and to children aged 10,11 and 12. Budget 2022 provides for the initial stage of this phased expansion, the provision of GP care without fees to all children aged 6 and 7 and my Department has commenced work to roll the service out this year.</p>  <p>  The specific date for commencing the expansion remains under consideration in light of COVID-19 and the additional pressures the expansion might place on general practice in that context and will require consultation with the IMO, representing General Practitioners. It is important to ensure that any additional pressures placed on general practice will not limit its capacity to meet the needs of all patients in the community.</p></reply>

The vision of Sl&aacute;intecare is to achieve a universal single-tier health and social care system, where everyone has equitable access to services based on need, and not ability to pay.</p>  <p>  General practice policies central to the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare are the reform of the GMS GP contract and the roll out of a Chronic Disease Management (CDM) programme for GMS patients, and the move towards universal access to GP services without charges on a phased basis. The key primary care policy supporting the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare is the development of the Enhanced Community Care programme.  </p>  <p>  The 2019 GP Agreement helps to modernise and reform the GMS scheme, expanding services for patients and making general practice a more attractive career option for doctors. As part of the agreement, the CDM programme for type 2 diabetes, asthma, COPD, and cardiovascular disease, commenced in 2020 and will be fully rolled out by 2023. The CDM programme aims to bring the care for chronic disease further into the community and reduce hospital attendance by patients with the four conditions.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Agreement includes a commitment to undertake a strategic review of GP services within the lifetime of the Agreement, to examine how best to ensure the provision of GP services in Ireland for the future.  The outcome of this review will inform future contractual changes, with preparatory work for the review having begun this year. </p>  <p>  A number of measures have been introduced in recent years to expand access to GP care without charges. For example, since 2015, all children under the age of 6 years and all persons aged 70 and over are now automatically eligible for a GP visit card and since 2018, all those in receipt of either a full or half-rate Carer's Allowance or Carer's Benefit are automatically eligible for a GP visit card. In addition, Budget 2022 provides for the initial stage of the planned expansion of GP care without fees to all children aged 12 years and under, the provision of GP care without fees to all children aged 6 and 7, and work has commenced to roll this service out in the course of 2022.</p>  <p>  The Enhanced Community Care (ECC) programme involves the development of new models of care and service delivery, maximising effectiveness and with integration as a core value as identified by Sl&aacute;intecare.  </p>  <p>  Service delivery will be re-orientated towards General Practice, primary care and community-based services with CHNs and Community Specialist Teams working in an integrated way with the National Ambulance Service and acute services to deliver end-to-end care, keeping people out of hospital and embracing a &lsquo;home first&rsquo; approach. The utilisation of eHealth forms a central part of the ECC programme and is key to supporting integration of services.  </p>  <p>  The ECC&rsquo;s various components can be summarised as encompassing six areas of action: </p>  <p>  - Establishing CHNs to provide the foundation and organisational structure through which an integrated care system is provided locally based on population need and size.  </p>  <p>  - Implementing integrated care programmes for older people and chronic disease management;  </p>  <p>  - Expanding workforce and infrastructure capacity in the community through targeted application of resources to a defined population.  The focus will be on implementing best practice models of care to demonstrate the delivery of specific outcomes and sustainable services, which can be scaled for full national implementation;  </p>  <p>  - Expanding the range of services available in the community; </p>  <p>  - Developing working arrangements for staff and contracted professionals to enable the delivery of expanded services; </p>  <p>  - Developing an enabling environment for joined-up community working including ICT, data, clinical governance, patient safety and quality operating frameworks and systems.</p>  <p>  These policy aims clearly align with the principles set out in the Sl&aacute;intecare report, as well as with best practice principles enunciated internationally by WHO among others. </p></reply>

The analysis took account of current levels of demand and capacity, demographic and non-demographic factors that will drive future demand, and the potential impact that key system reforms can have on capacity needs.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Projections of Expenditure for Primary, Community and Long-Term Care in Ireland, 2019&ndash;2035, based on the Hippocrates Model</i>&rdquo; (July 2021) a research paper from the ESRI funded by the Department of Health, projects expenditure for most primary, community, and long-term health and social care services in Ireland for the years 2019&ndash;2035.</p><p>General Practitioners play an important role in the primary care system. Specific to general practice, the HSE National Doctor and Training publication Medical Workforce Planning Future Demand for General Practitioners 2015-2025 noted that to meet the demand for GPs that may be required by 2025, the State would require significant increases to the annual intake for GP postgraduate specialist training.</p><p>There has been a significant increase in the number of GPs entering training in recent years, up from 120 in 2009 to 233 in 2021, with large increases made in recent years. Further increases are expected following the transfer of responsibility for training from the HSE to the Irish College of General Practitioners. </p><p>The Government has undertaken several other measures to increase the attractiveness of general practice to prospective GPs. Under the 2019 GP Agreement investment in general practice is set to increase by approximately 40% (&euro;210 million) between 2019 and 2023, providing for significant increases in capitation fees for participating GPs. Improvements to maternity and paternity leave arrangements have also been made, and supports introduced for rural practices and practices in areas of urban deprivation. </p><p>The 2019 GP Agreement also includes a commitment to undertake a strategic review of GP services within the lifetime of the Agreement, to examine how best to ensure the provision of GP services in Ireland for the future.

Extending GP care without charges to all citizens who do not currently hold a medical card or GP visit card would encompass a further 2.92 million people approximately. It is not possible to definitively calculate the cost of universal GP care without charges given the wide range of payments and variables that have to be accounted for.</p><p>Such a calculation would require a complex and detailed modelling exercise to account for a range of demographic changes, future projections of service demands and variation in the number of GPs and the allowances that could be paid. </p><p>Additionally, the fees payable to GPs could only be determined following agreement with the IMO on the scope and content of the general practitioner service to be provided, as well as on the future of the various other supports provided to general practice.  However, the 2019 IGEES paper &quot;Costing Framework for the Expansion of GP Care&quot; provides a cost estimate for universal free GP care and is available from igees.gov.ie/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Costing-Framework-for-the-Expansion-of-GP-Care.pdf.</p><p>Over the last number of years, several pieces of detailed policy analysis have been undertaken to assess<b></b>various aspects of<b></b>expanding eligibility for near or full universal access to primary care and other care sectors and the associated additional costs for the Exchequer.  These include the Expert Group Report on Resource Allocation and Financing of the Irish Health System (2010), the White Paper on Universal Health Insurance and Associated Costs (2015) the Committee on the Future of Healthcare Sl&aacute;intecare Report (2018) and Universal GP Care in Ireland: Potential Cost Implications (2018).</p></reply>

However, the companies holding the authorisations/licences have not marketed the products in Ireland to date, and the HPRA cannot compel a company to market a medicinal product. </p>  <p>  To be considered for a license in Ireland, the company marketing the product would need to make an application to the HPRA.  After a thorough evaluation of all the supporting evidence, and if the benefits of the product outweigh the known and potential risks, a license may be issued.</p>  <p>  Where a medicine is not authorised in Ireland, a licensed wholesaler may import it if it has been prescribed by a doctor for a patient under his/her care, on his/her direct responsibility, and to meet the specific needs of a patient. The decision to prescribe or not prescribe any treatment for an individual patient is a decision for the treating clinician, in consultation with their patient. </p>  <p>  The responsibility for the clinical use of unlicensed medicines lies with the prescriber. In accordance with the Medical Council&rsquo;s Guide to Professional Conduct and Ethics, medical practitioners must ensure as far as possible that any treatment, medication or therapy prescribed for a patient is safe, evidence-based and in the patient&rsquo;s best interests.

The infection is known to be endemic in certain locations and in these areas the GPs are very familiar with the most typical presentation which is a rash, often with a bull&rsquo;s eye appearance. </p>  <p>  The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) is Ireland's specialist agency for the surveillance of communicable diseases. The HPSC is part of the Health Service Executive (HSE) and works in partnership with health service providers to provide the best possible information for the control and prevention of infectious diseases. The HPSC produces fact sheets for the general public on infectious diseases. The fact sheet on Lyme disease can be found here: www.hpsc.ie/az/vectorborne/lymedisease/factsheet/</p>  <p>  My Department considers all requests for meetings that it receives and has previously met with groups that advocate for people who live with Lyme disease. My Department will continue to engage with stakeholders on this issue.</p></reply>

The committee's recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation. It makes recommendations on vaccination policy to my Department. The NIAC continues to revise recommendations to allow for the introduction of new vaccines in Ireland and to keep abreast of changes in the patterns of disease. Therefore, the immunisation schedule will continue to be amended over time.</p>  <p>  In 2009, the NIAC recommended HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccination for all 12 to 13 year old girls to reduce their risk of developing cervical cancer when they are adults. In September 2010, the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of secondary school.</p>  <p>  In June 2017, on foot of the NIAC&rsquo;s recommendation that the HPV vaccine should also be given to boys, my Department asked the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to undertake a health technology assessment (HTA) to establish the clinical and cost-effectiveness of extending the immunisation programme to include boys in the first year of secondary school.</p>  <p>  The HIQA completed the HTA in December 2018, recommending that the HPV immunisation programme be extended to include boys. A policy decision was made to extend the HPV immunisation programme to include boys, starting in September 2019, with the introduction of a 9-valent HPV vaccine.</p>  <p>  The ages at which vaccines are recommended in the immunisation schedule are chosen by the NIAC in order to give each child the best possible protection against vaccine preventable diseases. As the HPV vaccine is preventative it is intended to be administered, if possible, before a person becomes sexually active, that is, before a person is first exposed to HPV infection.</p>  <p>  Therefore, the gender-neutral HPV vaccination programme targets all girls and boys in first year of secondary school to provide maximum coverage. All vaccines administered through the School Immunisation Programme are provided free of charge.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to be guided by NIAC's recommendations on any emerging evidence on this issue in the future.</p>  <p>  Anyone not in 1st year of secondary school or age equivalent in special schools or home schooled during the 2020/2021 school year who wishes to get the HPV vaccine, must go to their GP or sexual health clinic and pay privately for the vaccine and its administration. This applies to everyone whether or not they have a medical card/GP visit card, as it is outside of the HPV immunisation programme.</p>  <p>  I have asked my officials to request the National Immunisation Advisory Committee consider the clinical effectiveness of providing the HPV vaccine to:</p>  <p>  - girls and boys in secondary school who were eligible to receive HPV vaccine in 1st year but who did not receive it; and</p>  <p>  - women up to the age of 25 years who have left secondary school and who did not receive the vaccine when eligible.</p>  <p>  If NIAC conclude that there is sufficient evidence to support providing the HPV vaccine to one or both groups, HIQA will undertake a cost-effectiveness assessment on that basis.</p></reply>

The payment of &euro;1,000 will not be subject to income tax, USC, or PRSI. The measure will be ring fenced to staff ordinarily onsite in COVID-19 exposed healthcare environments within the period between 1 March 2020 and 30 June 2021. </p>  <p>  Those public sector frontline healthcare workers eligible for the payment will be directly employed public health sector staff working in clinical settings. A pro-rata arrangement will apply for eligible part time staff / equivalents and supernumerary students who were required to perform training in clinical sites.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health will also introduce a measure for making a similar payment to staff in private sector nursing homes and hospices that were affected by Covid-19.</p>  <p>  I would like to assure the Deputy that work is underway to ensure fairness in the application of this measure as the Government intended. </p>  <p>  The Department and the HSE are currently engaging in finalising arrangements to give effect to the Government announcement concerning the Recognition Payment. Full particulars, eligibility and terms and conditions that apply to this payment shall be made available shortly. It is important that this measure is applied fairly as intended and I welcome the work that is ongoing to ensure this is so.</p>  <p>  There are many, many individuals in our country who did so much during the pandemic. I and the Government is sincerely grateful for this commitment but it is appropriate that these public sector frontline healthcare workers get particular recognition. They exposed themselves to particular COVID-19 risks that did not exist in other work environments or those working from home. I am also deeply appreciative of all those frontline workers who worked in our nursing homes and hospices during this pandemic and that they also get similar recognition.</p>  <p>  Outside of the above recognition, the Government also notes that some private healthcare companies have recognised the work of their employees during the pandemic. I would encourage private healthcare companies that have not already done so to consider appropriate measures to recognise their own frontline workers for their work during this most trying period.</p></reply>

The HSE now has IHIs assigned for the majority of individuals with a PPSN. The challenge now is to deploy these IHIs across the multitude of patient record systems and databases across the wider health system and to assign an IHI to each patient record within those systems. During the pandemic, where it was essential for public health to track and trace individual cases of Covid, the IHI was allocated to records on the national Covid Track &amp;amp; Trace (CTT) system. The national Covid Vaccination System (Covax) also assigned unique IHIs to vaccination records and this was vital when trying to link records between dose 1, 2 and booster. The IHI also facilitated the generation of unique EU Digital Covid Certificates (DCCs) as required under EU regulation. The IHI was also useful in matching between databases for individuals who had a positive PCR test and subsequently required a recovery certificate. The process of self-registration for vaccination, collection of PPSN and verification of identity as people arrived at mass vaccination centres made it possible to allocate IHIs more easily with approximately 97% of those who provided a PPNS, matched directly to their IHI. Plans to deploy the IHI to GP practice systems and hospital patient administration systems were delayed slightly whilst Covid took precedence, but that work will recommence as the impacts of the pandemic reduce and the health system returns to business as usual. </p></reply>

More than 95% of those presenting for urgent care at Connolly are able to go home after treatment and waiting lists for general paediatrics significantly reduced within a year of opening.</p>  <p>  Despite delays, the new children&rsquo;s hospital building at St James&rsquo;s is really taking shape. The fa&ccedil;ade is almost complete, with the building largely weathertight, and the internal fit out of all clinical areas is now underway. </p>  <p>  However, this remains a very complex project with over 40,000 activities detailed in the contractor&rsquo;s programme to complete the over 6,000 rooms/spaces in the new hospital.</p>  <p>  The NPHDB has advised that BAM&rsquo;s own schedule suggests substantial completion of the project could be achieved by December 2023 which would mean the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital (NCH) at St James&rsquo;s could open in the second half of 2024, after the necessary commissioning period. This is approximately one year beyond that originally expected under the contract.</p>  <p>  A period of operational commissioning was always required beyond the substantial completion date- the date which the main contractor would hand the site back to the NPHDB and then to Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland. Work is ongoing to determine if some of that commissioning activity timeline can be reduced or conducted in parallel with substantial completion, where it is safe and appropriate to do so. Work on commissioning and an opening plan is ongoing.</p>  <p>  The NPHDB and the contractor are working to do everything they can to ensure that this new substantial completion date and opening can be met. There remain external risks which the NCH is not immune to and are beyond the control of the Development Board and the contractor to the timeline, arising from Brexit, the global pandemic, global supply chain difficulties and shortages of construction raw materials. However, BAM, as a Tier 1 construction company, has global reach into supply chains and is doing its best to mitigate those risks. Nonetheless, these external risks make speculation and more definitive forecasting unwise.</p></reply>

The &ldquo;Elective Hospitals Oversight Group&rdquo;, under the joint governance of the Health Service Executive, Department of Health and Sl&aacute;intecare, has been guiding the development of the elective hospital proposals, following the process outlined in the updated Public Spending Code, setting out the value for money requirements for the evaluation, planning, and management of large public investment projects.</p>  <p>  In December 2021 the Government agreed, subject to the necessary approvals and requirements under the Public Spending Code being met, a new National Elective Ambulatory Care Strategy. This new strategy aims to change the way in which day case, scheduled procedures, surgeries, scans and outpatient services can be better arranged to ensure greater capacity in the future and help to address waiting lists. The development of additional capacity will be provided through dedicated, standalone Elective Hospitals in Cork, Galway and Dublin.</p>  <p>  The elective care scope of service will be developed in two phases commencing with day cases, diagnostics, and outpatients and then by in-patient treatment. On this basis, the Elective Care Centres (ECCs) will be designed to provide sufficient capacity to facilitate future phases, including some elective in patient capacity, thereby providing a sustainable and strategic response to cater for the highly dynamic landscape of healthcare policy and practice. </p>  <p>  Individual Preliminary Business Cases for each location are at an advanced stage of development. and will be subject to technical review by the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. Pending favourable review(s) under the Public Spending Code, that further memoranda for Government would then be brought forward to progress this proposal for Cork, Galway and Dublin.</p>  <p>  The Preliminary Business Cases, if approved, will be published in line with the Public Spending Code.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-02-01a.1875.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020100097#WRLL02100"><p>It is recognised that waiting times for scheduled appointments and procedures have been affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. While significant work continues to positively impact on waiting times and improve pathways to elective care, acute hospitals have been impacted by operational challenges arising from surges in cases related to the Delta and Omicron variants.</p><p>As part of the response to this the HSE advised all Hospital Groups to take a series of immediate actions which included a period of prioritising unscheduled care, COVID care and urgent time sensitive work - in particular in Model 4 hospitals. Services are beginning to return to normal but elective procedures continue to be affected by staff absences due to Covid and emergency department pressures that are running above 2019 levels.</p><p>The HSE has confirmed to the Department that patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p><p>The Department of Health continues to work with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to identify ways to improve access to care, including through increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services, providing virtual clinics, and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.</p><p>In recent years, my Department has worked with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to improve access for patients waiting for high volume procedures, including cataracts. Ophthalmology services are provided throughout all hospital groups in the country, with cataract removal one of the key procedures carried out as part of this specialty.</p><p>A key development in improving access to Ophthalmology services was the opening of a stand-alone high-volume consultant-led cataract theatre by the University of Limerick Hospital Group in Nenagh Hospital in 2018, with the intention that it would facilitate patients from surrounding geographical areas to avail of their treatment there. The impact of such initiatives can be seen in the reduction in the waiting times to access cataract procedures since 2018. At the end of December 2021 there were 4,614 patients waiting for a cataract procedure compared to 6,440 in December 2018. </p><p>In addition, the Department of Health, the HSE and the NTPF are also working on a Multi Annual Waiting List Plan to bring waiting lists in line with Sl&aacute;intecare targets over the coming years. This process will be overseen by a Ministerial Taskforce, chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Health and includes representatives from the HSE and National Treatment Purchase Fund.</p><p>For 2022 an additional allocation of &euro;250 million, comprised of &euro;200 million to the HSE and &euro;50 million to the National Treatment Purchase Fund has been provided in respect of work to reduce hospital and community waiting lists. The &euro;250 million will be used to fund additional activity in both the public and private sectors. The &euro;50 million additional funding provided to the NTPF brings its total allocation for 2022 to &euro;150 million, and as a consequence there will be a budget of &euro;350 million available to support vital initiatives to improve access to acute hospitals and community health services.</p><p>The information requested by the Deputy, concerning the cataract waiting list, is outlined in the attached document.</p><p>Cataracts Waiting List Dec-21 <table>    <tr>       <th>3 Months</th>       <th>6 Months</th>       <th>9 Months</th>       <th>12 Months</th>       <th>18 Months</th>       <th>Total</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>1,852</td>       <td>906</td>       <td>602</td>       <td>423</td>       <td>233</td>       <td>4,614</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

The Department of Health contributed to and shaped the development of the Strategy through its representation at Pharmaceutical Committee meetings, the Directors of Pharmaceutical Policy meetings and in workshops hosted virtually by the Commission during its genesis.</p>  <p>  The strategy is now at an implementation stage and a wide spectrum of actions covering different policy areas have been identified to contribute to its realisation. The Pharmaceutical Committee will be a key mechanism to drive the execution of a number of actions in the coming years. My officials participate in meetings of this committee. These actions include amongst others, attention to issues around unmet medical needs, affordability of medicines for patients and health systems&rsquo; sustainability, a sound and flexible regulatory system, access to medicines, antimicrobial resistance, providing a fertile environment for Europe&rsquo;s industry, enabling innovation and digital transformation, enhancing Europe&rsquo;s crisis response mechanisms and securing supply of medicines and avoiding shortages.</p>  <p>  The Commission has recently launched a study to support the evaluation and impact assessment for the revision of the EU general pharmaceutical legislation, one of the key identified actions required to implement the Strategy.  It is expected that the outcome of this study will provide data, analysis and evidence to the Commission to evaluate the effects of the comprehensive revision of the general pharmaceutical legislation adopted in 2004, and to assess the impacts of possible future changes to the legislative framework. </p>  <p>Ireland continues to watch and participate with interest in, the progression of the work activities underpinning the evolution of the aims of Pharmaceutical Strategy for Europe, and wishes to acknowledge the ongoing work being done by the Commission to date on this initiative.</p></reply>

The maximum payment is applicable at a panel size of 1,200 or more patients; payments made to panels less than 1,200 are made on a pro-rata basis. The subsidy rate applies to those staff employed on a full-time basis and for staff not employed on a full-time basis payment is made on a pro-rata basis. Group practices may also qualify for a subsidy to employ a practice manager.</p><p>GP&rsquo;s in partnerships or group practices may aggregate their panels when making an application for a subsidy. However, partnership and group practices do not qualify for a subsidy in respect of more than one practice secretary and/or practice nurse per contracting GP in the practice.</p><p>In addition, GPs working in rural areas who meet the qualifying criteria will also qualify for the rural support allowance, and the 2019 GP Agreement provides for increased support for participating practices in disadvantaged urban areas.</p><p>The practice staff subsidy rates are set out below. <table>    <tr>       <th>Subsidy</th>       <th>Cost</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Nursing subsidy (per year) &ndash; 1 year&rsquo;s experience</td>       <td>&euro;30,945.86</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Nursing subsidy (per year) &ndash; 2 years&rsquo; experience</td>       <td>&euro;32,665.07</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Nursing subsidy (per year) &ndash; 3 years&rsquo; experience</td>       <td>&euro;34,384.29</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Nursing subsidy (per year) &ndash; 4 or more years&rsquo; experience</td>       <td>&euro;37,822.72</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Secretarial subsidy (per year) &ndash; 1 year&rsquo;s experience</td>       <td>&euro;20,630.57</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Secretarial subsidy (per year) &ndash; 2 years&rsquo; experience</td>       <td>&euro;22,349.80</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Secretarial subsidy (per year) &ndash; 3 or more years&rsquo; experience</td>       <td>&euro;24,068.99</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Practice manager subsidy (per year) &ndash; based on first point of nursing subsidy</td>       <td>&euro;30,945.86</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

The Expert Group will also identify lessons from international best practice regarding reform and strengthening of other core public health functions, including the promotion of health and wellbeing, population health research and health intelligence and health service improvement.</p>  <p>   The Group will produce a final report, which will be submitted to me by mid-2022. </p>  <p>  The Group, which is chaired by Professor Hugh Brady, held its first meeting on 31 January. Membership of the Group is comprised of national and international experts with experience across a range of key domains, including public health, health protection, epidemiology, senior public health service leadership, change management, and risk and evidence communication. Further information on the Expert Group and details of its membership can be found online: www.gov.ie/en/press-release/8beb5-ministers-for-health-establish-the-public-health-reform-expert-advisory-group/ </p>  <p>  The independent COVID-19 Nursing Homes Expert Panel was established, on foot of a NPHET recommendation, to examine the complex issues surrounding the management of COVID-19 among this particularly vulnerable cohort in nursing homes. This Expert Panel report, published in August 2020, has added further to our knowledge and learning. This report clearly outlines the key protective measures that we must ensure are in place across our nursing homes. These actions are based on learning from our own and the international experience of COVID-19 to date.  In May 2021, HIQA and the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) jointly published an &ldquo;Analysis of factors associated with outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 in nursing homes in Ireland&rdquo;, delivering on recommendation 6.7 of the Expert Panel report, to further the learning from the pandemic. Further data analysis work and learning will also continue, in line with other recommendations of the Expert Panel and HIQA and the HPSC are developing a further update to this analysis. Work to progress the recommendations of the Expert Panel report, particularly those recommendations requiring a priority focus in the response to COVID-19, is ongoing across all of the health agencies and stakeholders. Continued learning and understanding of progression of the disease in Ireland is an integral part of those recommendations.</p>  <p>  More broadly, the Taoiseach has indicated that a comprehensive evaluation of how the country managed COVID-19 will provide an opportunity to learn lessons from our experiences in dealing with a pandemic over the past two years. This will help ensure that we are in a better and stronger position if another pandemic, or another similar type emergency, arrives.</p></reply>

It normally takes about 2 years to get through a breast screening round, it will now take approximately 3 years to get through this current screening round. Importantly this is still within international norms, as countries such as England only screen every 3 years. The programme is prioritising people who would have been delayed due to COVID-19. BreastCheck aim to return to screening women every 2 years as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  It is important to remember that screening is for healthy people without symptoms. If anyone becomes aware of symptoms, or if they have concerns or worries, they should contact their GP who will arrange appropriate follow-up care. It is important that every woman is breast aware. This means knowing what is normal for them so that if any unusual change occurs, they will recognise it. The National Screening Service and BreastCheck have useful information in relation to self-checking breasts on their website. </p>  <p>  The Government provided &euro;10 million additional funding to the HSE for Cancer Screening in 2021, many of the new developments being funded will help increase capacity and enable the management of screening service users with deferred appointments due to COVID-19. This includes three new mobile screening units for BreastCheck, one of which is now operational in Roscommon since October 2021. The other two mobiles are expected to arrive in the near future.</p>  <p>  Regarding extending the age of eligibility for BreastCheck, I am pleased to inform that, in line with commitments in the Programme for Government, BreastCheck are now implementing the commitment on age-extension so that all women aged between 50 to 69 years are invited for routine breast screening.  </p>  <p>  Future decisions about changes to our national screening programmes, including changes to the age range, will be made on the advice of our National Screening Advisory Committee (NSAC).  This independent expert group considers the evidence for changes in a robust and transparent manner. The Committee&rsquo;s role is to undertake an independent assessment of the evidence for screening for a particular condition against internationally accepted criteria and make recommendations to me accordingly. This ensures policy decisions are informed by the best available evidence and advice.  In this regard I am pleased to advise the NSAC recently held its first 'Annual Call' for submissions from the public on new screening programmes, or proposed changes to existing programmes. I look forward to updates and recommendations from the NSAC when they have concluded their consideration of the proposals received.</p>  <p>  Your query regarding BreastCheck activity is also a service matter and therefore has been referred to the HSE for direct reply to you with further details.</p></reply>

The guidance takes account of the significant changes to national public health measures in general, whilst also recognising the need for continued vigilance in healthcare settings, including Nursing homes due to the increased vulnerability of people receiving care and/or living in these settings. The guidance continues to recognise the importance of visiting and meaningful social contact for residents. This is a positive further step forward to a return to more normalised access and visiting for people living in nursing homes and their families.</p>  <p>  Key changes of note to the guidance are as follows:</p>  <p>  - The minimum level of visiting should normally be daily visits by up to 2 people at one time.</p>  <p>  - The introduction of a &ldquo;nominated support person&rdquo;, who should normally have regular and unrestricted access to the resident in the nursing home for whom they are nominated, except if that person is a specific risk to residents (e.g., is subject to self-isolation) or there is specific public health or infection prevention and control advice to limit visitors. This will be in addition to regular visiting. </p>  <p>  - Unless specifically advised by public health, at an early stage of outbreak, the nominated support person should continue to have access for some part of each day. If a resident does not have a nominated support person, visiting should generally not be less than 2 visits per week by one person during an outbreak. </p>  <p>  - Limitations on visiting should be justified by an up-to-date risk assessment and should be reassessed twice each week.</p>  <p>  - There should be no restrictions on movement of residents within the nursing home after going on outings or visits outside of the nursing home unless a significant exposure risk occurred during the outing.</p>  <p>  - There will no longer be a need for visitors to show immunity through vaccination or previous infection.</p>  <p>  - In line with established guidance, there remains no infection prevention and control requirement to restrict window visits. </p>  <p>  This revised visiting guidance is yet another significant step forward in the return to more normalised access and visiting for people living in nursing homes and their families. I expect that all nursing home providers will ensure that they facilitate visiting in line with this new guidance to the greatest extent possible.</p>  <p>  Visitors are reminded of their responsibilities with regard to self-checks for COVID-19 in advance of visits, and infection and prevention control and social interaction with others other than the resident they are visiting whilst in the nursing home.</p>  <p>  COVID-19 is a continuing risk, especially when community transmission is high. It is appropriate that the significant infection prevention and control and public health guidance remains in place for residential care settings. The State continues to provide substantial support to aid the ongoing management of COVID-19 in these settings.</p></reply>

In particular, I fully acknowledge that community optometrists have played a key role in responding to the health needs of the public during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>During COVID-19 optometrists have been responsive to the challenges presented and have developed guidelines and procedures to safely deliver patient care. I also recognise that optometrists have also played an important role in the delivery of the COVID-19 vaccination campaign. </p><p>The current contract with Optometrists dates back to 1999 and it is accepted that it is has not kept pace with developments that have taken place over the course of recent years including the recommendations from the 2017 Primary Care Eye Services Review Group Report, interdisciplinary collaboration and the skillset that optometrists have by virtue of their education and training.</p><p>I am fully committed to the development of community services which can facilitate expanded and more integrated provision of eye care in local communities. In this context, a contractual relationship between optometrists and the HSE which is modernised to emphasise a strengthened primary care system will be required.</p><p>However, any publicly funded service expansion should address unmet public healthcare needs, improve access to existing public health services or provide better value for money or patient outcomes. Accordingly, any measures to be considered must be evidence-based.</p><p>The HSE is continuing to prioritise the development of Primary Care Eye Teams in CHOs 6, 7 and 9 in 2022 with a view to extending these teams to other CHOs. A recent CHO9 initiative by the Community Paediatric Ophthalmology Service at the Grangegorman Primary Care Centre addressed waiting lists and enabled the training of the optometrist into expanded roles.</p><p>In 2022, the HSE will also advance the transfer of care for children aged 8+ years to local optometrists, thereby reducing waiting lists and enhancing access to primary eye care services. It is anticipated that it will be possible to bring the project to conclusion over a 6-to-9-month time frame in 2022.</p></reply>

The payment of &euro;1,000 will not be subject to income tax, USC, or PRSI. The measure will be ring fenced to staff ordinarily onsite in COVID-19 exposed healthcare environments within the period between 1 March 2020 and 30 June 2021. </p><p>Those public sector frontline healthcare workers eligible for the payment will be directly employed public health sector staff working in clinical settings. A pro-rata arrangement will apply for eligible part time staff / equivalents and supernumerary students who were required to perform training in clinical sites.</p><p>The Department of Health will also introduce a measure for making a similar payment to staff in private sector nursing homes and hospices that were affected by Covid-19.</p><p>I would like to assure the Deputy that work is underway to ensure fairness in the application of this measure as the Government intended. </p><p>The Department and the HSE are currently engaging in finalising arrangements to give effect to the Government announcement concerning the Recognition Payment. Full particulars, eligibility and terms and conditions that apply to this payment shall be made available shortly. It is important that this measure is applied fairly as intended and I welcome the work that is ongoing to ensure this is so.</p><p>There are many, many individuals in our country who did so much during the pandemic. I and the Government is sincerely grateful for this commitment but it is appropriate that these public sector frontline healthcare workers get particular recognition. They exposed themselves to particular COVID-19 risks that did not exist in other work environments or those working from home. I am also deeply appreciative of all those frontline workers who worked in our nursing homes and hospices during this pandemic and that they also get similar recognition.</p><p>Outside of the above recognition, the Government also notes that some private healthcare companies have recognised the work of their employees during the pandemic. I would encourage private healthcare companies that have not already done so to consider appropriate measures to recognise their own frontline workers for their work during this most trying period.</p></reply>

We are working to ensure patients across the country continue to have access to GP services and that general practice is sustainable in all areas into the future.</p>  <p>  GPs are self-employed practitioners and therefore may establish practices at a place of their own choosing. Under the GMS scheme, the HSE contracts GPs to provide medical services without charge to medical card and GP visit card holders. Where a vacancy arises in a practice with a GMS contract, the HSE becomes actively involved in the selection process to find a replacement GP. As of January, there are no GMS vacancies in County Laois.</p>  <p>  Several efforts to increase the number of practicing GPs have been undertaken in recent years. The number of entrants to GP training has increased from 120 in 2009 to 233 this year, with large increases made in recent years. Further increases are expected as responsibility for training has transferred from the HSE to the Irish College of General Practitioners. Changes have been made to the entry provisions to the GMS scheme to facilitate more flexible/shared GMS contracts, and to the retirement provisions for GPs under the GMS scheme. An enhanced supports package for rural GP practices was also introduced.</p>  <p>  Recent developments in relation to general practice, in particular the 2019 Agreement on Contractual Reform and Service Development, have helped to re-establish general practice in Ireland as an attractive career choice.  The additional investment, which will amount to &euro;210 million annually once the Agreement is fully implemented, provides for an increase in capitation fees, improved maternity and paternity arrangements as well as enhanced supports for rural practices. In addition, targeted on-going funding of &euro;2 million will be set aside to provide additional support to practices in deprived urban areas. The wider reforms in the health service will also help to provide an atmosphere in which the practice of medicine in Ireland will remain attractive. The additional investment in general practice provides a sound basis for ensuring that GPs have access to a credible and rewarding career path in Ireland.</p></reply>

The Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without undue hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself and his or her family, having regard to his or her overall financial position and reasonable expenditure. </p>  <p>  In that regard the HSE is also required to undertake periodic reviews of eligibility in order to ensure that a person continues to meet the qualifying criteria required to continue holding eligibility. Where any medical or GP visit card holder has a review process initiated, it should be noted that he/she will continue to retain their eligibility for the duration of the review process. </p>  <p>  Every effort is also made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to provide an eligibility assessment process that is responsive and sensitive to people&rsquo;s needs, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines. Social and medical issues are also considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services and to that end, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card where an applicant exceeds his or her income threshold.</p></reply>

The HSE has no role in assigning private patients to a GP practice.</p><p>The Government is aware of the workforce issues currently facing general practice, including the limited access to GP services in certain areas, and has implemented a number of measures to improve recruitment and retention in general practice.</p><p>These measures include an increase in investment in general practice by approximately 40% (&euro;210 million) between 2019 and 2023 under the terms of the 2019 GMS GP Agreement. The Agreement provides for increased support for GPs working in rural practices and for those working in disadvantaged urban areas, and for improvements to maternity and paternity leave arrangements. In addition, the number of GPs entering training has been increased steadily over the past number of years, rising from 120 in 2009 to 233 in 2021.  </p><p>These measures will see an increase in the number of GPs working in the State, improving access to GP services for patients throughout the country.</p></reply>

Dr Scally has agreed it is now timely to conduct a final progress review and is commencing this work in January 2022.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to advise that despite the impact of COVID-19 on our health services, CervicalCheck is currently up to date with invites for screening.  In addition, in 2021 there has been a significant uptake of cervical screening, ahead of their targets by 14%.  During Cervical Cancer Prevention Week (17 &ndash; 23 January), CervicalCheck promoted how women can reduce their risk of this disease and the steps they can take to look after their health.  CervicalCheck took this opportunity to highlight the importance of women over 50 accessing their services.  They are continuing to promote such throughout this year and are planning targeted media campaigns for specific age groups and geographical locations to encourage women to attend.   Further information can be found on the HSE website.</p>  <p>  Regarding the current recorded uptake rate for the first dose of the HPV vaccine, in the 2020/2021 academic year, is 76%. The current recorded uptake rate for the second dose of the HPV vaccine in this academic year is 65%. It should be noted that some areas are yet to input some, or all, of their data for both dose 1 and 2 so these figures are expected to increase. The roll-out of the 2021/2022 HPV vaccination programme is underway and its delivery remains a priority for the HSE. </p>  <p>  The HSE National Immunisation Office (NIO) promote HPV vaccine at key opportunities in order to achieve an increase in uptake rates.  For example, during Cervical Cancer Prevention Week the NIO actively utilised social media to promote the facts surrounding HPV vaccination.  In addition, when the immunisation school teams are offering the 2nd dose of HPV vaccine during this school term, the HSE will again support their work through campaigns using social and traditional media channels.</p>  <p>  It may be of interest that the HSE has begun working with stakeholders and academics in Australia to develop a model to set a target date to work towards cervical cancer elimination in Ireland. We are in a fortunate position in Ireland to aim for this type of cancer to become a rare disease due to the combination of HPV vaccination programme and the CervicalCheck screening programme.</p></reply>

This mandatory requirement for open disclosure will ensure that patients and their families receive appropriate timely information in relation to an incident that may have occurred in relation to their care. </p><p>The Patient Safety (Notifiable Patient Safety Incidents) Bill 2019 will also bring private hospitals within the remit of the Health Act 2007. The relevant provisions extend the remit of the Health Information and Quality Authority, allowing it to set standards for the operation of private hospitals, to monitor compliance with them and to undertake inspections and investigations as required. The Bill also contains provisions to support clinical audit within the health service.</p><p>The Bill was introduced into D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on the 12 December 2019 and passed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il at that time.  The Bill is a Programme for Government commitment and is expected to go to D&aacute;il Committee stage in the near future, after which it will be progressed to D&aacute;il Report Stage and through all Stages in the  Seanad.</p><p>The Patient Safety (Notifiable Patient Safety Incidents) Bill 2019 is part of the broader programme of legislative and policy initiatives to improve the ability of the health service to anticipate, identify, and respond to patient safety issues, and to improve the quality and safety of health services for patients. Creating a culture of open disclosure and learning from the things that go wrong is the bedrock of making services safer.</p><p>The Department of Health is committed to ensuring and supporting the central role that patients play in working with the public health service to develop health policy and in designing and reforming health services. Patient representatives participate on a number of committees and working groups across the Department of Health, the HSE and health agencies, and make a significant contribution to the strategic decision-making work of those committees and groups, including members of the 221+ Group as part of the CervicalCheck Steering Committee.</p><p>In developing the Patient Safety (Notifiable Patient Safety Incidents) Bill 2019, which builds on the Civil Liability Amendment Act (2017), my Department has taken part in extensive stakeholder engagements, including with Dr Gabriel Scally and members of the 221+ Group. The intention behind these engagements is to ensure that the lessons learned from users of our health and social services inform the provisions of the Bill. This includes additional provisions made following consideration of recommendations made by Dr Gabriel Scally. These provisions place specific obligations on health services providers and health practitioners to ensure that all relevant information is provided to the patient and their family in the course of making an open disclosure of a notifiable incident. </p></reply>

Please see the relevant press release here:</p>  <p>  www.gov.ie/en/press-release/b013c-government-publishes-the-cost-of-disability-research-report/</p>  <p>  The report suggests the need for a multi-faceted approach involving measures to support additional income, targeted grants, and better services or supports free of charge. The Government has referred the report to the National Disability Inclusion Strategy Steering Group (NDISSG), for its consideration and future monitoring of actions. The National Disability Inclusion Strategy (NDIS) is a whole-of-government strategy, chaired by the Minister for Disabilities, that brings together relevant departments and agencies to develop coordinated policy and action on improving the lives of persons with disabilities. Members of the NDISSG have been asked to look at the implications of the report for their own areas of service delivery and the Report will be further discussed at the next meeting of the Strategy&rsquo;s Steering Group.  </p>  <p>  This Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose, and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives. Our determination to improve services and supports for people with disabilities and their families is clear in our Programme for Government. The Health Budget 2022 provides an additional package of &euro;115m (including &euro;10m one-off Covid funding for specialist community-based disability services which are delivered or funded by the HSE, and builds on the &euro;100m funding allocated in 2021 to enhance these specialist disability services.   </p>  <p>  The Disability Capacity Review to 2032 sets out the Disability Social Care Demand and Capacity Requirements up to 2032.  This review has carefully drawn on best available evidence and information to estimate the scale of current outstanding need for HSE-funded disability services, and how the scale and shape of need is likely to evolve over the years to 2032. </p>  <p>  Work is underway on preparing an Action Plan for Disability Services 2022-2025, in line with the commitment in the Programme for Government to work towards implementing the Disability Capacity Review.</p></reply>

These supports are put in place with the aim of supporting the income of farming families and driving the sustainable development of the sector to ensure it`s long term ability to maintain competitiveness in an increasingly competitive global market. </p>  <p>  The cornerstone of this support is the basic payment under the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). Another support currently in place falls under the Dairy Beef Calf Programme, which includes specific supports for dairy farmers who wish to rear calves from their dairy herd. There is a proposal to maintain this support through the Dairy Beef Calf Welfare Scheme in the new CAP Strategic Plan. </p>  <p>  In addition, there are a range of schemes which dairy farmers can avail of under the incoming CAP Strategic Plan including the new agri-environmental scheme and the Organic Farming Schemes. Funding under Pillar II of CAP has been increased by over &euro;900m in order to roll out a host of new schemes that will financially reward farmers to continue to play a leadership role in tackling climate change and addressing biodiversity and water quality. The new agri-environmental scheme under Pillar II will pay up to a maximum of &euro;10,000/farmer. This will involve a move towards rewarding farmers for results-based outcomes, which will clearly contribute to overall environmental objectives.</p>  <p>  Small dairy farmers are encouraged and welcome to apply for many of these supports.</p></reply>

One option for growers for next year&rsquo;s crop will be to retain farm-saved seed from the 2021 crop to mitigate the supply issue to the extent possible in the short-term. Alternatively, seed of alternative varieties may be sourced from other Member States such as the Netherlands, Germany, France and Belgium. </p><p>My Department will offer as much support as trade regulations permit, but further expansion of the seed area must be industry-led. This expansion should be assisted in the coming years by the availability of seed of our main variety Rooster, whose Plant Breeder&rsquo;s Rights expired at the end of 2021.  </p><p>In addition, my Department actively supports the production of mini-tubers through the Tops Potato Centre in Raphoe, Co.

The establishment of the new Office requires primary legislation which my Department is progressing at present. </p><p>In April 2021, I signed Statutory Instrument No. 198 of 2021 transposing the UTP Directive directly into Irish law before the 1 May deadline for transposition. </p><p>In 2021, I also established the UTP Enforcement Authority in my Department on an interim basis pending the finalization of the primary legislation for the new Office. The Enforcement Authority has been assigned all the necessary legal powers to investigate complaints from suppliers, including primary producers, to carry out investigations on its own initiative, and to initiate legal proceedings for breaches of the UTPs defined in the Directive. It is open to suppliers to engage with the Enforcement Authority on any concerns they may have in relation to unfair trading practices. </p><p>With regard to the status of the plans for the establishment of the new Office of Food Ombudsman or equivalent, preparations for the General Scheme of the Bill for the primary legislation are well advanced, and I hope to bring a Memo to Government on this shortly.</p><p>Once the primary legislation is finalised and the new Office is established, the Enforcement Authority functions will transfer to the new Office in line with the commitment in the Programme for Government. The new Office will also carry out the function of price reporting and market analysis to provide for greater transparency in the sector. </p><p>With regard to the Head of the new Office, a recruitment process for this role will be commenced as soon as possible, in alignment with the legislative process.</p><p>I am confident that the new Office will bring increased transparency to the agri-food sector and that the increased availability of market information will strengthen the position of primary producers and other suppliers in the agricultural and food supply chain.</p></reply>

Currently prime beef cattle are slaughtered at an average of 27 months and this can be reduced to an average of 24 months over the course of the decade. </p>  <p>  This will require support for breeding improvements but also a critical engagement by the beef processing sector to encourage and support farmers to finish their animals earlier and my Department will continue to engage with stakeholders on this important matter. In addition, officials are currently working with the EPA to ensure that any progress is correctly accounted for in the GHG inventory.   </p>  <p>  It is intended to continue with a breeding programme in the next CAP which will build on the gains of both the Beef Data Genomics Programme (BDGP) and the BEEP schemes and help realise the additional gains identified by Teagasc and ICBF. The proposed Suckler Carbon Efficiency Scheme (SCES) will build on significant investments made to date under the Beef Data Genomics Programme (BDGP).</p>  <p>  Breeding programmes like the BDGP and the proposed SCEP will continue to play a crucial role in supporting breeding decisions which can help farmers to produce an animal of the required weight at a younger age, so that the improvements are fully reflected in the inventory.</p></reply>

The organisation has been granted an extension under the CSP up to 31 December 2022, with funding of &euro;108,132 supporting one manager and four full time equivalent positions.</p><p>Through the COVID-19 Stability Fund for Community and Voluntary Organisations, Charities and Social Enterprises, my Department also supported Comharchumann Forbartha &amp;amp; Fosta&iacute;ocht &Aacute;rainn Mh&oacute;r Teoranta with funding of &euro;19,586.  That fund is now closed and there are no plans at present for further rounds of the Stability Fund.</p><p>In 2019 Comharchumann Oile&aacute;n &Aacute;rainn Mh&oacute;r CTR received &euro;14,410 in Dormant Accounts funding under the Social Enterprise Capital grants Scheme. This was used to provide suitable wheelchair access and ramp/handrails to a building used by the organisation.</p><p>The LEADER programme is a key component of Irelands rural development programme which is co-funded by the EU and the Exchequer. LEADER is administered by the Department of Rural and Community Development. The programme is delivered by Local Action Groups (LAGs) across the country who are responsible for selecting and awarding LEADER funding, at a local level, to projects within their own geographical area. A feature of the LEADER programme is that it is based on a community-led local development, bottom-up approach to rural development.</p><p>The current programme is delivered on Arranmore Island by the Donegal Local Action Group (LAG) through its Implementing Partner, Comhar na nOile&aacute;n CTR.</p><p>The Donegal LAG is responsible for the delivery of the programme including approving project applications for funding and processing claims for payment once approved works are completed.</p><p>To date, the Donegal LAG has approved 15 projects on Arranmore Island which has a corresponding value in excess of &euro;250,000.</p></reply>

One of the key actions which the policy commits to in this regard is establishing a comprehensive and integrated network of 400 remote working hubs over the lifetime of the policy to 2025.  </p><p>An interdepartmental working group, chaired by the Secretary General of my Department was established in October 2020 to oversee the strategic development of this national hub network. The working group included representation from key Government Departments, State Agencies and relevant public bodies, namely the Department of Rural and Community Development, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Enterprise Ireland, IDA, &Uacute;daras na Gaeltachta and the Western Development Commission. </p><p>The first deliverable from the interdepartmental group was to publish a composite national map of remote working hubs across the country by the end of quarter one 2021. In May 2021 I launched the National Connected Hubs network together with the connectedhubs.ie platform. The National Hub Network Working Group initially identified and mapped over 400 remote working hubs. To date, approximately 180 hubs have joined the Connected Hubs platform, with this number rising on an ongoing basis. </p><p>The Connected Hubs platform offers a suite of booking and hub management applications to its members. It will also facilitate the sharing of innovation, experience and best practices across the community. These supports will serve to maximise benefit to member hubs, hub clients, employers, local communities and the wider economy.  </p><p>Last year, through the Connected Hubs funding stream, I awarded close to &euro;9 million in funding to over 100 successful applicants.  This allowed for the expansion of remote working infrastructure in digital hubs, including broadband connection points throughout the country.  My Department also continues to invest significantly in the development of remote working facilities across the country through schemes such as the Town and Village Renewal Scheme and the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund.</p><p>A Connected Hubs marketing campaign is currently in the final stages of development and will be launched in the coming weeks.  To date, our focus has been to develop a critical mass of hubs on the connecthubs.ie platform, but this will now shift to raising awareness of the network to relevant stakeholders, including SMEs, business owners and hub users. </p><p>The right to request remote work is part of the Government's vision to make remote working a permanent feature of Ireland&rsquo;s workforce in a way that can benefit all &ndash; economically, socially and environmentally.<i></i>This is consistent with the recognition attached to the importance of remote working within <i>Our Rural Future, </i>and<i></i>this new legislation will bring us one step closer to making remote working a lasting feature for Ireland&rsquo;s workforce. This is one of many measures the Government has introduced to incentivise remote working, including the right to disconnect and investment in remote working hubs. </p><p>The Government recognises that not all occupations, industries, or particular roles within an enterprise will be appropriate or suitable for remote working. The Right to Request Remote Working Bill will provide employees with a right to request remote work and will provide a legal framework around which requesting, approving or refusing such a request can be based. It will also provide legal clarity to employers on their obligations for dealing with such requests. The intention is to introduce a mechanism for employees to request remote working that is fair but does not place an undue burden on employers.</p><p>I am confident that the range of supports and initiatives being implemented across Government Departments will help to ensure that the benefits of remote working are available for workers and employers throughout Ireland.</p></reply>
