The Local Enterprise Offices continue to offer the very successful Trading Online Voucher Scheme which offers financial assistance in the form of a Voucher of up to &euro;2,500 in order to procure expert consultancy advice on trading on-line including website management and is delivered along with training and advice to help business trade online.</p>  <p>  My Department also funds, through Enterprise Ireland, the COVID-19 Online Retail Scheme in response to the COVID-19 crisis for companies which are indigenous retailers, employing 10 or more people, have an existing online presence (e.g. website or social media), and have a retail outlet through which they derive the majority of their revenue.</p>  <p>  185 retailers were funded under the Call One of the COVID-19 Online Retail Scheme, with a total of &euro;6.6 million awarded. 145 retailers were funded under Call Two the COVID-19 Online Retail Scheme, with a total of &euro;5.3m awarded. </p>  <p>  The Report of the SME Taskforce "SME and Entrepreneurship Growth Plan" which was published last month sets out a wide range of recommendations with long-term strategic relevance for SMEs and entrepreneurs. The recommendations in the Report include measures to support the digitalisation of small and medium businesses.   The Report's recommendations will be reviewed and taken forward, as appropriate, by a Ministerial-led SME and Entrepreneurship Implementation Group over the coming months, including those related to the uptake of competitive digital transformation schemes.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-02-17a.26.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021021700059#WRB00700"><p>Ireland remains committed to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the 2030 Agenda and a &lsquo;whole of Government&rsquo; approach to implementation continues, as set out in the &lsquo;Sustainable Development Goals National Implementation Plan 2018-2020&rsquo;. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government was developed with close consideration of Ireland&rsquo;s responsibilities under the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and their centrepiece 17 goals.  The programme provides specific reference to delivering on objectives in line with the SDGs in many areas.</p>  <p>  The Department of Environment, Climate and Communications (DECC) will lead the development of Ireland&rsquo;s second SDG National Implementation Plan in 2021. Both the SDG interdepartmental governance structure and the SDG Stakeholder Forum with key input from civil society and relevant sectors will support this work in ensuring Ireland upholds its SDG responsibilities. </p>  <p>  Monitoring and reporting is a key part of ensuring Ireland continues its progress towards targets set out under the Sustainable Development Goals. Monitoring progress through the Central Statistics Office (CSO) SDG GeoHive and regular updating of the Policy Map Matrix of the Goals will help ensure that Ireland upholds its responsibilities under the Sustainable Development Goals. This monitoring will also allow for more coherent implementation of the Goals. </p>  <p>  Specifically, in relation to labour exploitation, the Department of Foreign Affairs is the lead Department on target 8.7 under the UN Sustainable Development Goals which aims to take immediate and effective measures to eradicate forced labour, including child labour - as set out under the Sustainable Development Goals National Implementation Plan 2018-2020. </p>  <p>  In 2017, the National Plan on Business and Human Rights was launched to give effect to the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. The National Plan, overseen by the Department of Foreign Affairs, aims to promote responsible business practices at home and overseas, including in developing countries, by all Irish business enterprises. This first national plan contains a range of actions, which are being implemented across government. Through the term of this plan Ireland has continued to engage with international partners through its annual participation in the UN Forum on Business and Human Rights. </p>  <p>  In the coming months, the Government will publish a toolkit for Irish companies to help guide them in discharging their responsibilities under the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. This will be a valuable resource for Irish business &ndash; providing information, guidance and a number of case studies provided by businesses that have embraced the UN Guiding Principles and can provide valuable learnings and advice.</p>  <p>  In the first half of 2021 there will be a preliminary review of the progress made in implementing the first National Plan. Later in the year, the Government will begin to develop the second iteration of the Plan.</p>  <p>  The second National Plan will be informed by the initiative underway in the European Commission to bring forward legislative proposals in the area of sustainable corporate governance. The Commission will propose changes to the EU regulatory framework on company law and corporate governance, to ensure that companies focus on long-term sustainable value creation, rather than short-term benefits. The aim is to help companies to better manage sustainability-related matters in their own operations and value chains as regards social and human rights, climate change, the environment, and so on.  We expect to see the detail of this proposal in Q2 this year.</p>  <p>  Safeguards in the areas of sustainable development and labour are further strengthened by Ireland&rsquo;s membership and engagement with the International Labour Organisation. In 2017, Ireland took up a Titulaire Seat on the Governing Body of the ILO for the first time. This will allow Ireland to further its input into international business and human rights through the ILO.</p>  <p>  From a Trade Policy perspective, Ireland supports the broader positive EU approach to sustainable development through efforts to ensure that there are strong and ambitious chapters on Trade and Sustainable Development (TSD) in Free Trade Agreements (FTAs), as part of the EU&rsquo;s value-based trade policy, that are consistent with international legal commitments and standards.  Furthermore, </p>  <p>  the EU&rsquo;s Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) also seeks to play a role in promoting the Sustainability agenda.  </p>  <p>  In addition, Ireland seeks to promote responsible business conduct through my Department&rsquo;s hosting of the National Contact Point for the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, which aim to encourage the positive contributions that multinational enterprises can make to economic, environmental and social progress and to minimise the difficulties to which their various operations may give rise.</p></reply>

I fully understand that despite making preparations in advance for Brexit, agreeing the full terms of the TCA so close to 1 January 2021 did not allow many sectors, including the bakery sector, to prepare for the implications arising under the specific Rules of Origin provisions of the Agreement.  This has led, in this case, to the imposition of tariffs on imports of particular flour from the UK given the level of non-UK/non-EU wheat input contained in that particular flour. </p>  <p>  At its simplest, the Rules of Origin are the premise upon which any Free Trade Agreement (FTA) seeks to confer the preferential tariff rates - zero in the case of the TCA - on the members of the Free Trade Area encompassed by the FTA, namely the UK and EU-27 in this instance.  Moreover, it is usual that Product Specific Rules of Origin will set out how much, if any, non-originating or Third Country inputs that is permitted before exceeding the relevant thresholds to enjoy the tariff preferences/benefits of the FTA.  In this case, an upper limit of 15% Third Country wheat input to UK exports of flour to the EU is allowable under the TCA and currently, the UK flour being imported by the sector contains 45% Canadian wheat which puts it outside of the scope for benefiting from the preferential tariff rates.  Pre-Brexit, the trade agreement between the EU and Canada addressed this issue but the UK is no longer a beneficiary of CETA and there is no three-way Free Trade Agreement between Canada, the UK and the EU.  Therefore, supply chain changes would be needed to fully benefit from the terms of the TCA. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, my Department and I are fully conscious of the potential employment and cost implications arising for the sector as the industry representatives have made clear, as well as possible price implications for consumers. I also recognise the competitive disadvantage that the sector faces in retaining UK market share when faced with competitors that are not affected by the tariffs given how the Irish sector's supply chains have been constructed over many years.  </p>  <p>  Officials in my Department and right across Government continue to work intensively to work through possible technical solutions to address issues arising for the sector from the conclusion of the TCA. In the case of the tariffs on flour, my officials have examined the issue with colleagues in Revenue to explore what technical solutions may be available within the terms of the TCA, including that of using Inward Processing relief. Such Inward Processing solutions can assist companies in terms of retaining UK market share, but I appreciate that it does not provide a complete solution for the issues presenting on the domestic market.  In that latter regard, I recently wrote to the Commission Executive Vice President and Trade Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis on the issue and raised the matter with him when we spoke last week.  I highlighted for the Commission the extent of the sector&rsquo;s reliance on the UK, with over 80% of the flour imported from the UK, a factor that is compounded by the lack of indigenous milling capacity on the island of Ireland.  Furthermore, given that the conclusion of the TCA in late December did not allow time for the sector to make the necessary adjustments in its supply chains, I have asked the Commission Services to examine the issue to consider any flexibilities that can be applied and I await the Commission's considered response.</p></reply>

I fully appreciate that it is one of the industries worst affected and for the longest and know that as we enter a second year of restrictions many in the sector must be fearing for their future.  I do hope that once the pandemic is over the wedding sector will have a number of good years with so many weddings postponed.  In the meantime, the Government wants to make sure as many businesses as possible survive to see that day.</p><p>The financial support the Government is providing businesses and workers affected by the pandemic is unprecedented.  Almost a million people of working age are now in receipt of weekly payments including the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP), Employment Wage Subsidy (EWSS) and Jobseekers Benefit or Allowance.  Support for business includes the weekly CRSS payment for businesses forced to close their doors to the public, reduced VAT rates, a commercial rates holiday, the Sustaining Enterprise Fund, the Tourism Business Continuity Scheme as well as low cost loans.</p><p>Budget 2021 provided a significant package of tax and expenditure measures to build the resilience of the economy and to help vulnerable but viable businesses across all sectors. Details of the wide range of supports available are on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>.</i></p><p>These measures are in addition to the &euro;7 billion July Stimulus of enterprise measures, which includes the Wage Subsidy Scheme extended through 2021, the Pandemic Unemployment Payment, grants, low-cost loans, write-off of commercial rates and deferred tax liabilities, all of which will help to improve cashflow amongst self-employed. We are providing for an extension of the tax warehousing scheme to include repayments of Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme funds owed by employers and preliminary tax obligations for adversely affected businesses.</p><p>As announced in the July Stimulus, the Enterprise Support Grant was extended to assist eligible self-employed, including sole traders, who exit the PUP or jobseekers schemes, to re-start their business. Further information is available at <i>www.gov.ie</i>.</p><p>On the 9th of December, following engagement with the Arts sector and other self-employed sectors my colleague Minister Heather Humphreys T.D., Minister for Social Protection, announced the doubling of the PUP threshold from the current &euro;480 over four weeks to &euro;960 over an eight-week period effective immediately. This measure is to assist those who are trying to restart their businesses and will allow self-employed people to take on intermittent jobs without losing their entitlement to the PUP.</p><p>The Government also announced the provision of support of &euro;50m for the live entertainment sector in Budget 2021. This will include measures for the commercial entertainment sector and will support live entertainment across the country. The 2021 supports for the live entertainment sector will be the subject of further consultation with stakeholders. It will also be informed by the pilot live performance scheme in 2020 which is being rolled out now.</p><p>The three main schemes, the CRSS, EWSS and PUP compare favourably with any other packages on offer in other countries.  The new scheme, announced this week, the COVID Business Aid Scheme (CBAS) will provide funding of up to &euro;8,000 for those businesses that are in receipt of a rates bill from their local authority. While the grant is modest, it will help smaller businesses in particular to cover these costs &ndash; rent, insurance, utilities, security. </p><p>The Government is very much open to proposals from the wedding sector as to how we can help further.  However, Government schemes to support businesses are generally designed to help meet fixed costs that cannot be avoided and it is not possible to provide compensation for loss of personal income or profits.</p><p>My colleagues, Minister Catherine Martin T.D., Minister for Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the Gaeltacht and Minister Charlie McConalogue, Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine may be able to provide more specific details on the events and hospitality industry and details on supports for the food sector respectively.</p></reply>

The lists are subject to twice yearly reviews which are evidence based and are guided by available research, a public consultation and input from the relevant policy Departments and the Economic Migration Inter-Departmental Group, chaired by the Department.  </p>  <p>  The pilot quota-based scheme introduced in May 2018 following consideration of a detailed business case submitted by the sector, provided a quota of 150 general employment permits for the occupation of Dairy Farm Assistant.  This pilot scheme has proved very successful for a range of employers in the sector and the quota of 150 employment permits is now exhausted and has not been extended.  Consideration of the submissions received to the current occupation list review is underway with the review scheduled to be finalised in early March. </p>  <p>  Last month, Minister of State Damien English TD, engaged with the Irish Farmers Association and Producers on matters relating to employment in the agri-food sector in Ireland. </p>  <p>  All permits granted are employer and employee specific and granted for the purposes of the employment stated on the permit.  Where a permit holder wishes to change employer a new application for an employment permit should be made.  As the quota of Dairy Farm Assistant is currently expired, at present no further general employment permits can issue for the role of Dairy Farm Assistant.  </p>  <p>  Applications for employment permits may be made by either the employer or the employee.  A range of information on submitting applications is available on the Department&rsquo;s website.  Arrangements made with an agency to submit an application on behalf of a party to an application are the responsibility of the applicant to the application. Employment permit legislation prohibits deductions in respect of employment permit application process from employee remuneration. </p>  <p>  If an employment is the first for which they have held an employment permit in Ireland, the permit holder is expected to remain in that employment for a period of twelve months before applying for a new employment permit.  After that period on their first employment, it is open to the permit holder to change employer, and/or employment provided they secure employment in an eligible occupation and subject to the terms and conditions of the application process. However, employment permit holders are permitted to change their employer within the first 12 months of their first employment in the State in circumstances, such as redundancy, or where circumstances (unforeseen at time of application) arise in the employment that fundamentally change the employment relationship. </p>  <p>  This stipulation strikes a reasonable balance between, on the one hand, the employer&rsquo;s expectations that the foreign national remain in his or her employment for a reasonable period of time given the costs involved in recruiting that foreign national from abroad, and, on the other hand, not unduly binding the foreign national to the employer.  </p>  <p>  In certain circumstances the non-EEA national may be entitled to a reactivation employment permit which isn't linked to the employment permit occupation lists. My Department should be notified of any change in circumstances. </p>  <p>  If the Deputy is referring to a particular situation, he can engage directly with officials in the Employment Permit Section who can go through the specific issues and advise on the appropriate course of action.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-02-17a.55.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021021700059#WRB03700"><p>First of all, I very much welcome the conclusion of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement negotiations and the creation of a new framework for the EU-UK relationship. There were several occasions during the long negotiation process where a no deal scenario was a possible outcome, so a deal that includes market access provisions, tariff-free and quota-free trade as well as provisions aimed at preventing unnecessary technical barriers and requirements, is very welcome.</p>  <p>  Having said that, the post Brexit trading environment does not allow for seamless trading that we previously enjoyed with the UK and businesses will inevitably face challenges as the framework underpinning the previous trading relationship with the UK has ended. Currently, we are seeing some short term impacts arising from new customs and SPS checks and controls and supply chains will in time adjust to their new arrangements and documentary requirements.</p>  <p>  We are just approaching the 7 week mark since the Agreement came into effect and it is still much too early to ascertain the medium to longer term effects the Agreement will have on the various sectors of the economy. </p>  <p>  In my reply - no. 135 on 17 December 2020 - to Deputy Richmond I set out the results of  earlier analysis carried out in 2018 and later in January 2020 on the likely impacts of Brexit on key sectors of the Irish economy. The analysis identified five sectors that account for 90% of the Brexit impact and are the Agri-Food, Pharma-Chemicals, Electrical Machinery, Wholesale &amp;amp; Retail, and Air Transport sectors.  Of these five sectors, the Agri-Food sector was shown to be the most impacted in both a trade deal or no-deal scenario.</p>  <p>  IDA Ireland has of course been actively seeking to realise opportunities arising from Brexit-related investment to Ireland. Two-thirds of the over 90 new Brexit-related investments to date are in financial services, reflecting Ireland&rsquo;s strength as a destination for activity in the sector. Ireland has also won Brexit-related investments in Life Sciences; Technology, Business &amp;amp; Consumer Services; &amp;amp; Engineering. These total new investments come with an associated jobs potential of 6,000. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to monitor and work with all sectors in the economy as they experience Brexit fallout while dealing in parallel with COVID-19.  On Brexit, we are actively engaging across Government with hauliers and logistics companies, shipping companies, retailers, and business stakeholders to manage the issues arising from the new trading relationship with the UK.</p>  <p>  I am committed to ensuring that the most impacted sectors of the economy will be given the State assistance they require. The proposal to allocate &euro;1 billion in the first tranche of the EU Brexit Adjustment Reserve to Ireland is welcome and is strong recognition for the fact that Ireland is one of the most impacted Member States by Brexit. The fund will be used to mitigate the worst impacts of Brexit for the most impacted sectors in the economy.</p></reply>

I fully appreciate that it is one of the industries worst affected and for the longest and know that as we enter a second year of restrictions many in the sector must be fearing for their future.  I do hope that once the pandemic is over the wedding sector will have a number of good years with so many weddings postponed.  In the meantime, the Government wants to make sure as many businesses as possible survive to see that day.</p><p>The financial support the Government is providing businesses and workers affected by the pandemic is unprecedented.  Almost a million people of working age are now in receipt of weekly payments including the Pandemic Unemployment Payment, Employment Wage Subsidy and Jobseekers Benefit or Allowance.  Support for business includes the weekly CRSS payment for businesses forced to close their doors to the public, reduced VAT rates, a commercial rates holiday, the Sustaining Enterprise Fund, the Tourism Business Continuity Scheme as well as low-cost loans.</p><p>Budget 2021 provided a significant package of tax and expenditure measures to build the resilience of the economy and to help vulnerable but viable businesses across all sectors. Details of the wide range of supports available are on my Department&rsquo;s website at<i>.</i></p><p>These measures are in addition to the &euro;7 billion July Stimulus of enterprise measures, which includes the Wage Subsidy Scheme extended through 2021, the Pandemic Unemployment Payment, grants, low-cost loans, write-off of commercial rates and deferred tax liabilities, all of which will help to improve cashflow amongst self-employed. We are providing for an extension of the tax warehousing scheme to include repayments of Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme funds owed by employers and preliminary tax obligations for adversely affected businesses.</p><p>As announced in the July Stimulus, the Enterprise Support Grant was extended to assist eligible self-employed, including sole traders, who exit the PUP or jobseekers schemes, to re-start their business. Further information is available at <i>www.gov.ie</i>.</p><p>On the 9th of December, following engagement with the Arts sector and other self-employed sectors my colleague Minister Heather Humphreys T.D., Minister for Social Protection, announced the doubling of the PUP threshold from the current &euro;480 over four weeks to &euro;960 over an eight-week period effective immediately. This measure is to assist those who are trying to restart their businesses and will allow self-employed people to take on intermittent jobs without losing their entitlement to the PUP.</p><p>The Government also announced the provision of support of &euro;50m for the live entertainment sector in Budget 2021. This will include measures for the commercial entertainment sector and will support live entertainment across the country. The 2021 supports for the live entertainment sector will be the subject of further consultation with stakeholders. It will also be informed by the pilot live performance scheme in 2020 which is being rolled out now.</p><p>The three main schemes, the CRSS, EWSS and PUP compare favourably with any other packages on offer in other countries.  The new scheme announced this week, the COVID Business Aid Scheme will provide funding of up to &euro;8,000 for those businesses that are in receipt of a rates bill from their local authority. While the grant is modest, it will help smaller businesses in particular to cover these costs &ndash; rent, insurance, utilities, security. </p><p>The Government is very much open to proposals from the wedding sector as to how we can help further.  However, Government schemes to support businesses are generally designed to help meet fixed costs that cannot be avoided, and it is not possible to provide compensation for loss of personal income or profits.</p><p>My colleagues, Minister Catherine Martin T.D., Minister for Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the Gaeltacht and Minister Charlie McConalogue, Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine may be able to provide more specific details on the events and hospitality industry and details on supports for the food sector respectively.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-02-17a.89.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021021700059#WRB06800"><p>The EU&rsquo;s Safeguard Measures for steel were initiated in July 2018 in response to the United States applying a 25% tariff on steel imports originating from 3rd countries, including the European Union. The aim of the Measures is to manage the volume of steel entering the EU Single Market from 3rd countries as a consequent of the threat of EU market distortion by the dumping of steel originally intended for the US market onto the EU market as a result of the original US tariffs. The Measures currently in place allow for the importation of steel from 3rd countries by way of quotas, determined in line with traditional volumes of trade in steel. These current measures are due to expire at the end of June 2021, unless prolonged after a further review which is currently underway.</p>  <p>Due to the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the European Union, as of 1 January 2021, the UK is no longer party to the EU&rsquo;s Measures and the UK is now a 3rd country in relation to the application of the EU&rsquo;s Safeguard Measures. In anticipation of the UK&rsquo;s new status outside of the EU, in September 2020, the UK Government issued a notice stating that it would establish its own set of Safeguard Measures and calculated its own quota levels for imports of steel products from 3rd countries, including the EU into the UK.</p>  <p>  Irish importers can continue to import steel from the UK without the additional "Safeguard" tariff of 25% if the volume of imports remains within the EU's quota allocations for the UK.  Imports from the UK to Ireland, or other EU Member States, in excess of these quotas will attract a 25% tariff. Similarly, imports of steel from other 3rd countries into Ireland would only be subject to a 25% tariff if the exporting country exceeds the available quota. Importantly, however, Irish importers can continue to import steel from the rest of the EU as part of the Single Market where no tariffs or quotas apply.</p>  <p>  In applying the Safeguard Measures, the European Commission has completed 2 reviews of the Measures, with the most recent review published in June 2020. The findings of that review included details on the availability of quotas for each product category. The Commission's review found that in the last quarter of year-2 of the measures (i.e. April - June 2020), a significant level of quotas remained unused, with quotas available in every product category.  </p>  <p>  The review also noted that as of 15 May 2020, there were 9 million tonnes, or 29% of the total quotas, available for use in year-2 of the Measures ('year-3' of the Measures began in July 2020). This would indicate that the application of the EU's Safeguard Measures does not affect the availability of supply, as quotas are not exhausted before the end of a given period. Quotas available for steel reflect traditional levels of trade in steel and the Commission's evidence suggests that the quotas are not being exhausted and that the market remains competitive.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, neither my Department, nor any of our Enterprise Agencies, is aware of any supply concerns by industry regarding imports of steel into Ireland, however officials within the Department are engaged with industry groups to monitor any unforeseen impacts of the current measures. </p>  <p>  Finally, it is my understanding that the Commission are examining possible amendments to Union legislation on tariff rate quotas to resolve issues relating to steel from Great Britain imported into Northern Ireland coming within the scope of the current Safeguard Measures. Officials in my Department will continue to monitor the situation and they remain actively engaged with the Commission on the matter including the interplay between the Measures and the Northern Ireland Protocol with the view of finalising how measures should operate and apply in respect of Northern Ireland.</p></reply>

However, I know that EU Commission Executive Vice-President and Trade Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis will seek to meet with Ms. Tai at the earliest opportunity in order to discuss the full range of EU-US trade relations including many shared priorities for Ireland. </p>  <p>  Both the EU Commission and Member State Trade Ministers, including myself, continue to have the transatlantic trade and investment relationship as a key policy priority.  </p>  <p>  Bilaterally, Ireland and the US have a long-standing trade and investment relationship based on broadly similar values and interests that has proved hugely beneficial in many ways for both our countries.  In that regard, Ireland remains fully invested in and committed to a continued strong partnership with the US.  Top level engagement with the new US Administration aimed at resetting the EU-US trade relationship and the elimination of existing tariffs is an EU priority which would represent a positive development for trade and jobs on both sides of the Atlantic and something I am strongly invested in and support at EU Trade Minister level.</p>  <p>  Pending the appointment of the next USTR, my officials have maintained ongoing contact with the Office of the USTR both from Dublin, most recently with a senior officials meeting by VC in late January, and from Washington, where my Department's Trade Counsellor and his colleagues in the Embassy led by our Ambassador are in continuous engagement with the Office of the USTR.  </p>  <p>  Ms. Gina Raimondo, the current Governor of Rhode Island, has been nominated as the next Commerce Secretary and is awaiting confirmation by the Senate.

It is proposed as a 575km long (500km subsea), 700MW cable from the north-west coast of France to the south coast of Ireland. At this scale it would be able to provide electricity for some 450,000 homes.</p>  <p>  The Celtic Interconnector will provide a reliable high-capacity electricity link between Ireland and France that will have significant benefits for the people of Ireland. The project will provide access to the European internal energy market, leading to expected increased competition and lower prices in Ireland. It will also enhance security of electricity supply and facilitate increased capacity for renewable energy here via export access to the mainland European markets.</p>  <p>  In late 2019 the European Commission announced a grant of &euro;530m towards the construction of the interconnector under the Connecting Europe Facility fund. This grant was made possible by significant support for the project from the Irish Government that resulted in its designation as an EU Project of Common Interest. The estimated cost of this project remains approximately &euro;1 billion.</p>  <p>  Extensive planning by EirGrid and a period of public consultation took place last year with regard to the development of interconnector infrastructure, following which decisions were reached on the interconnector's location in East Cork.

The scheme will, over time, employ 307 people, some of whom will be engaged on a seasonal basis, with 210 full time equivalents engaged over the delivery period. The scheme encompasses 33,000 hectares of Bord na M&oacute;na peatlands previously harvested for peat extraction for electricity generation.

This followed on from the publication of a previous report by the Department of Finance on Local Public Banking in July 2018. The further report concluded that there is no business case for the State to establish a public banking system in Ireland.</p>  <p>  An Post is transforming its retail network by delivering new products and new formats. This includes, among other things, diversifying and growing the financial services products it provides for individuals and SMEs to include loans, credit cards and more foreign exchange products, local banking in association with the major banks and a full range of State Savings products. Two new dedicated sub-brands, An Post Money and a new business-to-business brand, An Post Commerce, were launched. Investment by An Post of &euro;50 million in the network is designed to encourage communities to use the enhanced services in their local post office.</p>  <p>  While it is longstanding Government policy that postal services will not be directly subsidised by the Government, we remain fully committed to a sustainable post office network as a key component of the economic and social infrastructure in both rural and urban areas.</p>  <p>  A lot of work has been done over the past few years to develop the network and this has had a positive effect for both postmasters and customers. This momentum needs to be maintained and if An Post, the postmasters and Government work together we can ensure that the network can emerge as a central hub for a wide variety of valuable community-focused services.</p>  <p>  Government believes An Post has untapped potential to do more and make a further significant contribution across many areas of public, business and community life in Ireland. I intend to set out a series of next steps on the Offline Services Report shortly.</p>  <p>  What we are doing now is working with An Post to investigate the scope to channel additional services through the network. As with any business the post office needs to develop commercial strategies to enable it to grow and maintain its relevance for its users. All options will be considered fully and efforts will be redoubled to give effect to our commitment to ensuring a sustainable and viable post office network.</p>  <p>  An Post has recently submitted a new draft Strategy for analysis and consideration by the shareholding Ministers in line with the requirements set out in the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies. In this regard I recently met with the CEO of An Post on the matter. I will be providing my views on the draft Strategy in due course but final responsibility for the content of the plan, including commercial strategies therein, rests with the Board of An Post.</p></reply>

The deployment plan forecasts construction commenced in all counties within the first 2 years and over 90% of premises in the State having access to high speed broadband within the next four years.</p><p>There are some 273,548 premises in Co Cork of which approximately 71% have access to high speed broadband through commercial operators. The remaining 79,424 premises are located in the Intervention Area in County Cork.</p><p>I am advised by National Broadband Ireland (NBI) that, as of 11 February 2021, over 174,000 premises across all counties have been surveyed. Surveys have been completed in Co. Cork in  Midleton, Cullen, Templebreedy, Carrigaline, Ballyfoyle, Douglas, Ballyphehane, Glasheen, Mahon and Kilpatrick, with surveys underway in Ballydesmond, Kiskeam, Umeraboy, Knocknagree, Rineen, Cullen, Coolinarna, Millstreet, Hollymount and Caherbarnagh. Pre-build works are underway in Fountainstown, Ballinhassig, Monkstown, and Upper Rochestown. The first fibre to the home connections are successfully connected  in Carrigaline and construction work is continuing with significant technical testing and validation taking place prior to wider release of the area. There are over 4,500 premises in the Carrigaline deployment area and some 300 premises are currently eligible for connection with NBI advising that a further 373 premises will be eligible for connection by 1 March 2021.</p><p>Further details are available on specific areas within County Cork through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website <i>www.nbi.ie</i>. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. I am advised that NBI is working to provide more detail on its website, with a rolling update on network build plans. NBI also has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries.</p><p>Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 11 February, 268 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and by the Department of Education for school BCPs. BCPs connected in Cork are Ballindangan Community Centre, Aghabullogue Community Centre, Castletownkenneigh Community Centre, Lissavard Community Centre, Whitechurch Community Centre and T.O.

This Directive is to be transposed into Irish law by end of June this year.</p>  <p>  Following on from its report on the status of production expansion of relevant food and feed crops worldwide, the European Commission has set out the criteria for determining high ILUC-risk feedstocks in Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/807. Under the delegated regulation, palm oil is currently the only one that meets the criteria as a high risk feedstock (though other feedstocks may be added in future). However, in certain circumstances (e.g. where additionality can be demonstrated), quantities of palm oil could be certified as low ILUC risk.</p>  <p>  Under RED II, Member States will be not be allowed to count any energy from renewable fuels with a high ILUC risk towards their renewable energy targets in any year from 2021 onwards, over and above the amount of energy achieved from these fuels in 2019. In addition, Member States must, from 2023 onwards, gradually reduce this limit to 0% by 2030. It should be noted that the quantities of biofuels from palm oil used in Ireland are very small with just 2 million litres placed on the Irish road transport market in 2019.</p>  <p>  In September 2019, a public consultation was launched on the development of the Biofuels Obligation Scheme in the period from 2021 to 2030. This consultation closed in November 2019 and 42 responses were received. I, as Minister for Transport, expect to publish shortly a policy statement which will set out my plans for biofuels and other renewable transport fuels for the coming years, which will include measures for the treatment of high ILUC risk biofuels.</p></reply>

This scheme is funded by my Department and administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI). To date over 142,000 homes have received free upgrades leaving them better able to afford to heat their homes to an adequate level. To qualify for the scheme recipients must be in receipt of a qualifying welfare payments from the Department of Social Protection.</p>  <p>  There are currently over 7,800 homes awaiting works on the Warmer Homes Scheme work programme. This includes homes that are: currently undergoing works; have been allocated to contractors for works; have completed an initial home survey and are awaiting allocation to a contractor or are awaiting the initial survey of their home.</p>  <p>  SEAI data indicates that for homes completed in 2020, the average time from application to completion was approximately 18 months, which would have included an impact of COVID-19 restrictions. For the same time period, the average time for a surveyor to be allocated was approximately 8 months.</p>  <p>  SEAI have advised my Department that the average waiting times quoted above should only ever be used as a general guide and waiting times may vary, based on the demand for the scheme at the time of application. For instance, once the survey is completed and works are allocated to a contractor the time to complete works is dependent on a number of factors including the scale of works to be completed, access to the property, availability of materials, weather and more recently COVID-19 public health restrictions.</p>  <p>  Funding for the SEAI energy poverty retrofit schemes has increased to over &euro;109 million in 2021. This is an increase of &euro;47 million on the 2020 allocation and means that almost half of the total SEAI residential and community retrofit budget will support people vulnerable to energy poverty. This funding will mean that more households can receive free energy efficiency upgrades, making their homes warmer, healthier and cheaper to run, in line with the Programme for Government.</p>  <p>  In addition to the increased budget, capacity by the industry to deliver more activity has also increased due to a new, broader contractor panel to provide works which commenced at the end of 2020. I also secured additional resources this year to expand the capacity of the SEAI to allow it drive the various grant programmes that it operates, including the Warmer Homes Scheme, and to ensure that level of activity envisaged under the Programme for Government is delivered. My Department is also in regular contact with the SEAI at official level in relation to the operation of the Scheme. Recommendations on the implementation of changes to the scheme to better target those most in need will also be finalised shortly.</p></reply>

Current grid connection rules are applied according to CRU&rsquo;s &ldquo;Enduring Connection Policy Stage 2 (ECP-2)&rdquo; Decision Paper which introduced amendments to certain elements of the grid offer process for community-led projects to enable them to develop and connect to the network. The ECP-2 Decision Paper sets out the policy and rules for onshore grid connection for the next number of years and requires that community projects must pay the balance of the application fee prior to receiving a grid connection offer. When community-led projects are applying for grid connection they pay a &euro;2,000 application fee deposit and successful projects with planning permission will then progress to a connection assessment. After the connection assessment is conducted community-led project with planning permission must pay the balance of the application fee in order to receive a connection offer from ESBN.</p>  <p>  I have recently announced that community projects must be 100% community-owned to gain support in future auctions of the Government's Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS). This means that communities will now be able to retain all the benefits that are associated with generating their own electricity. These benefits can provide a secure long-term financial boost to the community at large and allow reinvestment into the community's long-term sustainable future.</p>  <p>  It is recognised that electricity generation is a complex task and especially so for communities. In that regard an enabling framework of supports and funding is being developed by my Department and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland with details to be announced shortly. This should help to alleviate some of the issues that communities are having in the development of their own community energy projects. Officials in my Department will continue to engage with all stakeholders, including community groups, ESBN &amp;amp; CRU, to ensure that communities are enabled to fulfil their potential in developing community energy projects.</p></reply>

However, there are complex issues at play in this area, which are understandable given the sensitive nature of the medical data in question. These efforts will continue, focussing, in particular, on pricing trends.    Since mid-2017, a range of charging options have operated, which encourage householders to reduce and separate their waste. This provides flexibility to waste collectors to develop various service-price offerings that suit different household circumstances. Mandatory per kilogramme 'pay by weight' charging was not introduced. A Price Monitoring Group (PMG) was established in mid-2017 to monitor the on-going cost of residential waste collection to homeowners across Ireland as the &lsquo;flat-rate structure&rsquo; was being phased out. While fluctuations in prices and service offerings have been observed, the overall trend has been relative price stability. Results from the PMG are available on my Department's website.</p>  <p>  In September 2020, I launched a new national waste policy for the period 2020-2025, A Waste Action Plan for a Circular Economy. This plan contains a range of measures to empower households through enhanced consumer protection requirements. It also envisages an enhanced monitoring of the market to ensure no changes occur in the relative price stability.</p></reply>

Guided by public health advice, measures have been introduced across the system to enable the continued operation of services during the pandemic.  </p>  <p>  There is continued strong messaging that public transport capacity remains restricted and, therefore, should only be used for essential travel, with only those who have to travel at peak times doing so.  People are being encouraged to walk or cycle where practical, and organisations are encouraged to continue to facilitate working from home.</p>  <p>  The Government is also spending considerable additional Exchequer funds on the public transport sector in order to support the continued operation of necessary services, despite the reduced demand and the restricted capacity owing to the Covid-19 situation.  Government support for all public transport services in 2020 amounted to over &euro;620m.  For 2021 over &euro;670m has been provided in funding in order to ensure that the existing level of public transport services, albeit at a higher cost, continue to operate in a safe manner. By comparison, the level of PSO and Local Link funding provided in 2019 was in the region of &euro;300m.</p>  <p>  In addition, last summer the  Government approved temporary funding support for the non-PSO (licensed, commercial) bus sector in respect of its continuation of necessary bus services, and the duration of this support was recently extended.</p>  <p>  The Government's  Living with Covid Plan, clearly sets out the guidance and restrictions that will apply for all sectors, including public transport, at the 5 levels of the Plan, including strong messaging that people should use active travel as an alternative where this is feasible.  The advice is aimed at ensuring public transport is safeguarded for those who need it most, most notably, essential workers.  </p>  <p>  The National Transport Authority (NTA) has the statutory responsibility for the regulation of fares in relation to public passenger transport services  and also has statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public transport services by way of public transport services contracts in respect of services that are socially necessary but commercially unviable.  The funding of those services comprises both the fares paid by passengers and the subvention payments from the Exchequer.  The main purpose of the subvention payment is to meet the gap between income from fares and the cost of operating services.</p>  <p>  Any assessment of a proposed change to public transport fare structures would be a matter for the NTA to consider in the first instance.  I have, therefore, referred the Deputy's question to the NTA for direct reply.  Please advise my private office if you do not receive a reply within ten working days.</p></reply>

PPTs are classed as mechanically propelled vehicles, the use of which requires a valid licence, tax and appropriate insurance in accordance with Section 3 of the Road Traffic Act 1961. As PPTs do not fall under any existing vehicle category, it is not currently possible to tax and insure them and there is no separate licence category for them. Therefore they may not be used on public roads and in public places.  However, their use is permitted on private land with the permission of the landowner.  While their use on public roads (including footways) is clearly illegal, I am aware that there has been some confusion on this matter and that commercial interests have not always highlighted the legal constraints on their use.</p>  <p>  The intention is to legislate for e-scooters in accordance with the Programme for Government this year. This involves identifying and developing appropriate amendments to primary legislation across a range of complex areas. The work must be carried out in such a way that it does not undermine the overall framework of Road Traffic Law or Road Safety in general. Department officials are currently working on drafting the necessary changes to primary legislation. Subject to satisfactory resolution of the necessary issues, Minister Ryan intends to bring forward amendments to the enabling primary legislation when the Road Traffic (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill is before the Oireachtas. </p>  <p>  Experience overseas has shown that a change of regime may have consequences for road safety, the management of roads and footpaths, the movement of traffic, public transport and goods, public health and the environment. These are all factors which must be taken into consideration when legislating. </p>  <p>  Until new legislation is in place, the use of electric scooters will remain illegal.  As such, their use on public roads and in public places is subject to the same enforcement by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as any other illegal conduct.  The conduct of such enforcement is a matter for the Garda.</p></reply>

However, if a flight goes ahead and a customer either cancels or does not use their ticket, they are not entitled to a refund under EU law. </p><p>Mindful of the position that Government has taken in relation to international travel in the interests of public health,  the issue of consumer rights has been high on my agenda since taking Office.  I have raised this with the airlines, and at the height of the uncertainty last Summer, in particular, I engaged with both Aer Lingus and Ryanair to underscore that options offered to consumers should be fair and reasonable. </p><p>As it now seems likely that Summer 2021 is also going to be adversely affected from a travel and holiday perspective, the Deputy can be assured that the same message around fairness and reasonableness will be conveyed again, in addition to the need to comply fully with consumer rights as covered in EU law.  If any individuals are unclear about those rights, the Commission for Aviation Regulation has a dedicated web site for consumers, <i>www.flightrights.ie</i>.</p></reply>

The agenda centred on two main items.  Firstly, Council continued discussions on the Eurovignette Directive, which concerns Heavy Goods Vehicles and aims to address issues such as road infrastructure financing and tolls, greenhouse gas emissions, and congestion. </p><p>Secondly, there was a policy debate on the European Commisison's new Single European Sky proposals published in September 2020, which has the overall objective of improving the management of European airspace and air navigation service systems across the EU. </p><p>Other agenda items consisted of a range of information points touching a broad range of issues, including investment in rail, the impact of COVID-19 on air passengers' rights, and socially responsible connectivity.  A report on the outcome of the meeting, including a range of background papers, can be found on the Council website at the following link: </p><p><i></i></p><p>As noted in the Programme for Government, the Government is committed to placing Ireland at the heart of Europe. Though physical meetings continue to be constrained by the pandemic, it is crucial to continue to work closely with fellow Member States and the European Commission on policy matters. In this regard, on 10 November 2020, I held a call with EU Transport Commissioner Adina Valean, during which we discussed key supply chain issues relating to both Brexit and COVID-19 impacts. </p><p>My Government colleagues and I firmly believe that Ireland's interests are best served by pursuing an active and engaged membership of the EU. As Minister for Transport, I will continue to collaborate and forge alliances with my counterparts in other EU Member States with which we share common goals and interests.</p></reply>

States which are a party to this convention may endorse certificates attesting recognition issued by other states in accordance with the procedures provided for in the Convention. In addition to the STCW Convention, EU legislation has provided for a wider range of recognitions amongst member states in accordance with Directive 2008/106, as amended. The United Kingdom left the European Union at the end of January 2020 and entered a transition phase which continued to apply EU legislation to the United Kingdom. The transition phase ended at midnight CET on the 31st of December 2020. On this basis EU Directives including those on mutual recognition ceased to apply to the United Kingdom from this time. </p>  <p>  In preparation for the departure of the United Kingdom from the European Union and the end of the transition phase the European Commission issued Brexit Preparedness Notices to advise of the implications including the impact on seafarers qualifications. My Department promulgated these by means of Marine Notices, the most recent Marine Notice Number 35 of 2020 was issued in August of last year. In particular, these Preparedness Notices explained the two types of recognition including recognition by acceptance and recognition by endorsement.</p>  <p>  In relation to recognition by endorsement my Department has been actively engaged with ensuring the minimum amount of disruption to seafarers and shipping companies caused by the United Kingdom&rsquo;s departure from the European Union. On this basis, Ireland initiated the EU recognition process under the Directive on the 1st of January 2021 and my Department signed a memorandum of understanding with the United Kingdom in January 2021. These actions by Ireland have also initiated a wider process by the European Commission and it is anticipated that the European Maritime Safety Agency will be tasked to carry out an assessment of the United Kingdom to assess its implementation of the IMO STCW Convention.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that in relation to those certificates which are subject to recognition by acceptance rather than recognition by endorsement the European Commission&rsquo;s Brexit Preparedness Notice states &ldquo;The certificates issued to seafarers by the United Kingdom are no longer &ldquo;accepted&rdquo; by an EU Member State under Article 5b of Directive 2008/106/EC after the end of the transition period. Thus, a master or an officer holding a certificate issued by the United Kingdom &ldquo;accepted&rdquo; by an EU Member State will not be able to continue working on board vessels flying the flag of that Member State after the end of the transition period.&rdquo; Seafarers are advised to be guided by the Brexit Preparedness Notices issued by the European Commission and as published by my Department.</p>  <p>  In this case it is noted from the information supplied that the candidate has attended a course after the end of the transition period which has been approved by the United Kingdom Authorities.

In October 2016, UNECE's World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations, which is an intergovernmental platform responsible for regulating for the safety of vehicles, adopted Regulation No. 138 - "Uniform provisions concerning the approval of Quiet Road Transport Vehicles with regards to their reduced audibility (QRTV)".  </p>  <p>  This regulation applies to cars and vans (vehicle categories M1 and N1) that can travel in normal mode, reverse or in at least one forward gear without the use of an internal combustion engine. It requires such vehicles to be fitted with an audible device that emits a warning sound while the vehicle is moving between 0-20km/h before being permitted on the market anywhere in the EU.</p>  <p>  The EU has passed legislation to give this regulation legal effect, and since July 2019, all electric and hybrid models placed on the market in the EU are required to have an AVAS installed that will emit a noise when travelling at low speeds below 20 km per hour. The noise increases in pitch as the car&rsquo;s speed decreases, which should help to alert pedestrians of oncoming vehicles.  It is important to note that many manufacturers had already opted to install this technology before the legislation came into effect for reasons of safety. </p>  <p>  With regard to e-scooters, the intention is to legislate for e-scooters this year in accordance with the Programme for Government. This involves identifying and developing appropriate amendments to primary legislation across a range of complex areas. The work is to be carried out in such a way that it does not undermine the overall framework of road traffic law or road safety in general.  </p>  <p>  Until new legislation is in place the use of electric scooters, other than on private land with the permission of the landowner, will remain illegal.</p></reply>

A total of 75% of the capital costs is provided through a grant, up to a maximum of &euro;5,000 per charge point.</p><p>My Department will continue to support this scheme through the grants provided by SEAI and in parallel is also developing a charging infrastructure strategy, in line with the Programme for Government, which will ensure capacity keeps ahead of demand. </p><p>Combined with an effective public charging network, Ireland's home charging policy will help sustain and service the expected growth of electric vehicles on Irish roads. Charging while at home accounts for around 80% of electric vehicle charging in Ireland and it is best practice, internationally, to promote home charging as the most common and cheapest form of charging. To support home charging, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), on behalf of my Department, administers an EV Home Charger Grant of up to &euro;600 towards the purchase and installation of an EV home charger unit.</p><p>Budget 2020 saw the allocation of &euro;6m to fund the construction of EV charge points with an extra &euro;1m being allocated in 2021. In 2021, Government are funding the installation of home chargers, public charge points and destination chargers.  The budget breakdown for 2021 is as follows;</p><p>- &euro;3m for home charging to support the provision of 5,000 chargers including the installation of charge points in apartment blocks</p><p>- &euro;2m to support 400 public charge points</p><p>- &euro;2m for the provision of destination chargers </p></reply>

The need to once again return to level 5 restrictions for reasons of public health will inevitably impact further on delays to driver testing. During the level 5 period, driving tests will be available only to those who are involved in essential services, including essential retail work.   </p>  <p>  While the service is limited during level 5 restrictions, the Road Safety Authority is examining ways of increasing the number of tests within health constraints with an eye to resuming wider testing after level 5. This includes increasing the number of testing staff to help reduce and, over time, eliminate the backlog. </p>  <p>  Following discussions with the RSA, my Department has approved the hiring of a further 40 temporary driver testers for 22 months, and the process of recruitment is now underway.  However it will take some time for people to be selected and trained. These new hires will be in addition to the 36 temporary testers who I previously gave sanction to rehire during 2020. </p>  <p>  These measures will help to increase testing capacity.  However, I would like to stress, that many of the issues impacting on the delivery of service are concerned with the throughput of centres themselves in light of the restrictions, rather than on the availability of staff.</p>  <p>  The RSA are also looking at a number of other measures, including whether the number of tests a driver tester can perform each day can be increased, subject to health assurances.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to monitor and review any financial and other resource implications.</p></reply>

This section defines &quot;health expenses&quot; as&quot;expenses in respect of the provision of health care including the services of a practitioner&quot;.</p><p>A practitioner is defined as&quot;any person who is:</p><p>a.registered in the register established under section 43 of the Medical Practitioners Act 2007,</p><p>b.registered in the register established under section 26 of the Dentists Act, 1985, or,</p><p>c.in relation to health care provided outside the State, entitled under the laws of the country in which the care is provided to practice medicine or dentistry there&quot;.</p><p>In the case of counselling or psychotherapy, the relief is available where the counsellor, psychologist or psychotherapist carrying out the treatment is a qualified practitioner, or where a patient is referred by a qualified practitioner for a diagnostic procedure.</p><p>This is similar to the position that applies to other medical expenses, such as physiotherapy and I am satisfied that the legislation provides sufficient flexibility for expenses that should qualify for tax relief.  Accordingly, there are no plans to change these arrangements at this time.  </p><p>It is noted that there may be significant differences in the level of qualifications and/or clinical training undertaken by individuals who provide counselling or psychotherapy services in Ireland.  The question of whether counsellors and psychotherapists could be registered with an appropriate body, or meet an equivalent standard that might then be used in the context of this tax measure, is a matter in the first instance for the Minister for Health.</p></reply>

Revenue has two import systems &ndash; Automated Entry Processing (AEP) and a new system, the Automated Import System (AIS). The AEP system has not had any outages since 23 November 2020. However, since its launch on 23 November 2020, AIS has been unavailable on four occasions.  Three of these outages related to scheduled maintenance and on two of these occasions the resulting restart unfortunately, took longer than planned, resulting in prolonged downtime. The fourth incident arose when a technical issue required the system to be restarted.</p>  <p>  I am further advised by Revenue that since the UKs departure from the EU, and while monitoring activity levels within their systems, it identified degradation in performance of AIS during times of peak processing resulting in delayed responses to declarations and other messages lodged by trade.  One of the contributing factors to the levels of transactions being presented for processing is the growth in the business levels of large filers with high volumes of small consignments, a business model which has increased significantly with the move to online shopping since the start of the pandemic.</p>  <p>  Revenue has acknowledged that a delay in processing creates difficulties for trade and business and that the impact of delays for some businesses can appear as if the AIS system is not actually available when it is but is operating considerably below the performance level required and expected by trade and business. In instances when the delays are substantial, Revenue has taken actions to allow businesses to continue to move their goods.</p>  <p>  I am advised that Revenue is working with its software provider to increase capacity at peak processing times and that certain measures taken to date have improved performance and resilience and that this work is continuing.  At the same time Revenue is working with large filers, to develop tailored solutions that will facilitate their business model and ensure that other goods traffic is not adversely impacted by peak load processing delays. </p>  <p>  I am aware that Revenue continues to monitor customs systems performance and where any delays are identified that have the potential to impact businesses, Revenue will take timely actions to ensure that businesses can continue to move goods.  Revenue staff are working in the ports on a 24/7 basis to assist businesses and the Customs 24/7 Helpline is contactable on 01 738 3685.</p></reply>

It should be noted that this Bill is being introduced in order to transpose an EU Directive, it is not a legislative response to a problem that has emerged in the Irish market. </p><p>Euro banknotes are produced using sophisticated printing technology and have a number of prominent security features, which make them easy to distinguish from counterfeits without using special equipment. These features act as a deterrent to counterfeiters. </p><p>All Member States of the Eurosystem have a responsibility to support the identification and removal of counterfeit banknotes from circulation. The Central Bank of Ireland provides training to professional cash handlers, members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, customs officials and other bodies on counterfeit detection. The Central Bank of Ireland ensures that professional cash handlers, as defined under Article 6 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1338/2001, remove suspect counterfeit banknotes from circulation and submit them to the Central Bank for analysis. The Central Bank analyses these items and reports them to the European Central Bank (ECB) and European police forces using Counterfeit Monitoring Systems.</p><p>Recently published ECB statistics found that banknote counterfeiting is at an historical low level.  Some 460,000 counterfeit euro banknotes were withdrawn from circulation in 2020, a decrease of 17.7% when compared with 2019. The &euro;20 and &euro;50 notes continued to be the most counterfeited banknotes, jointly accounting for about two thirds of the total. 94.5% of counterfeits were found in euro area countries, while 2.8% were found in non-euro area EU Member States and 2.7% in other parts of the world.</p><p>The likelihood of receiving a counterfeit is very small, as the number of counterfeits remains very low compared to the over 25 billion euro banknotes in circulation. In 2020, 17 counterfeits were detected per 1 million genuine banknotes in circulation.</p><p>The full ECB Press Release on counterfeiting can be found here:   </p></reply>

This means that for the purposes of trade and the movement of goods between the EU and the UK, the UK is now a 3rd country and therefore a range of customs formalities and other regulatory controls apply to goods moving to, from or through the United Kingdom, excluding Northern Ireland. </p>  <p>  Customs is an EU competence and Ireland, like all EU Member States, must implement import requirements as set out in the Union Customs Code (UCC), the legal framework for customs rules and procedures in the EU customs territory. Compliance with these rules are essential to maintaining the integrity of the Single Market and the Customs Union.  Deficiencies in Ireland&rsquo;s implementation of the relevant regulatory controls and requirements could have serious consequences for exports from Ireland and their automatic right of free circulation within the European Union.</p>  <p>I know that Revenue fully understands and appreciates that some businesses have experienced and continue to experience difficulties adjusting to the need to comply with the new customs and other regulatory formalities that now apply to trade with Great Britain. Revenue has been working closely with trade both at individual business level and with the range of trade and business representative bodies in order to assist them in meeting the challenges which the UK&rsquo;s departure from the EU has brought for Irish businesses. Revenue also has a 24/7 presence at Dublin and Rosslare ports and help is also available via the Customs 24/7 telephone helpline (01 738 3685) and via email helpline channels. As part of this active engagement with business Revenue continues to explore with business the opportunities to avail of certain simplifications and facilitations that are available in accordance with the UCC.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Government has also provided a range of supports to assist businesses in adapting to the new formalities and procedures that are now in place, including the Ready for Customs Grant scheme and the Clear Customs training programme which are particularly relevant to the challenges referred to by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  Finally, I think it is important to note that approx. 75% of all freight movements during January were green routed and permitted to leave the ports without any interaction with Customs or the other regulatory authorities. However, as Great Britain is now a 3rd country, and goods traded with them are subject to sanitary and phytosanitary checks, checks that are essential to public health and safety, it will never be possible for all goods movement arriving into Ireland from Great Britain to be green routed.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-02-17a.410.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021021700064#WRG02100"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 139, 160 to 165, inclusive, 177 and 178 together.</p><p>The Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) is a social welfare payment for workers who have become unemployed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. PUP payments are classified as income supports and are subject to income tax. The taxation arrangements for the PUP were legislated for in Finance Act 2020 which reflects the standard approach to taxation of social welfare type payments, which means they are liable to income tax but exempt from the Universal Social Charge (USC) and Pay Related Social Insurance (PRSI).</p><p>The PUP along with the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) was introduced in March 2020 as emergency measures to deal with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy. The Government objective at that time was to get much needed assistance to employees as quickly as possible.  To meet that objective, both subsidies were not taxed in &lsquo;real-time&rsquo; in the normal manner, meaning the collection of any tax due was deferred until year end. This approach was based on an expectation at the time that the emergency supports would be short-term in nature, which turned out to not be the case due to the continued prevalence of COVID-19.</p><p>In relation to the Deputy's suggestion that I ask Revenue to waive any liabilities arising from the payment of the PUP, questions of equity arise. Other income earners in receipt of comparable &ldquo;normal wages&rdquo; are taxable on those wages,  in the interest of equity, payments under the PUP are subject to income tax. Furthermore, Revenue is independent in the exercise of its functions. </p><p>Revenue have advised me as follows: </p><p>The impact of the &lsquo;year-end&rsquo; approach is that some PUP and TWSS recipients now have an additional tax liability for 2020. As confirmed by Revenue last September, these liabilities will be collected, interest free, by reducing the employees tax credits over four years, starting in January 2022. Alternatively, an employee can opt to fully or partially pay any additional liability as a single sum through the Payments/Repayments facility in the myAccount service. These arrangements remain in place and are fully available to PUP and TWSS recipients.</p><p>When a PUP recipient returns to work, he or she should immediately cease the PUP claim with the Department of Social Protection (DSP). In turn, DSP will notify Revenue that the payment has ceased, and Revenue will then adjust the employee&rsquo;s tax credits accordingly. It is not the case that the employee is taxed on the full year calculation of PUP, where a return to work has occurred during the year, with a requirement to seek a refund for the overpaid amount (as suggested in Deputy O'Dowd's question). This is purely a mechanism to reflect the fact that the person is in receipt of PUP. For a person who is in receipt of PUP at the start of the year, the weekly amount is annualised on the Tax Credit Cert (TCC), with knock on impacts on the tax credit and standard rate cut off point, as if that person will be on PUP for the full year. When the person comes off PUP, the TCC is amended to reflect the fact that the payment has ceased. A revised instruction (Revenue Payroll Notification) will issue to the relevant employer to reflect the updated position and the revised TCC will issue to the employee via the online myAccount service. </p><p>Revenue has published information on the taxation of the PUP at link:  <i>www.revenue.ie/en/life-events-and-personal-circumstances/pup-tax-liability/index.aspx,</i>which may be of interest to the Deputies. Revenue has also very clearly set out how the taxation of the PUP and EWSS will occur in 2021. </p><p>The replacing of the TWSS with the EWSS from 1 September 2020 and the continuation of both that scheme and the PUP into 2021 has re-established the practice of operating PAYE in the normal (real-time) manner for such payments. However, those people receiving PUP payments in 2021 will only pay tax when they return to work. The mechanism to tax PUP payments is by reducing the recipient&rsquo;s tax credits and rate bands.  </p><p>Income tax is normally calculated using the &lsquo;cumulative basis&rsquo;, which means that for each pay day, all earnings and all tax credits are accumulated, and the tax due is calculated on a year to date basis. This ensures employees pay the correct amount of tax as it falls due. In exceptional circumstances, employees may be placed on the &lsquo;Week 1&rsquo; basis (also known as the &lsquo;non-cumulative basis&rsquo;). This normally occurs where there is a large reduction in tax credits that could cause financial hardship or where there is a lack of information on prior employments within the current tax year. Where employees are placed on a &lsquo;Week 1&rsquo; basis, income tax is deducted on a pay-period to pay-period arrangement, without reference to previous pay or tax paid. As such the employee will not suffer a large deduction of tax in a pay-period but will also not receive any refunds that might be due until the &lsquo;cumulative basis&rsquo; is implemented. These normal taxing arrangements are operating in respect of PUP payments received by employees in 2021 and are in accordance with the legislation as set down. </p><p>Regarding the TWSS, it is important to note that any additional &lsquo;top up payments&rsquo; made by employers to employees during 2020 under the TWSS were taxed in the normal (real-time) manner and are generally not included in the year-end arrangement. Top-up payments in addition to the basic subsidy would have very likely given rise to a tax liability, even if only paid over the course of 12 weeks.  It was therefore wholly appropriate that PAYE operated in respect of such payments in the normal way as it is did for other earners through the period, with the deduction of income tax and USC in 2020. </p><p>Specifically, regarding the taxation of PUP, the following points are also relevant:</p><p>- A single person currently in receipt of the PUP will continue to receive the payment gross and tax is not collected from these payments until s/he returns to work.  This is also the case where both married spouses/civil partners are receiving PUP;</p><p>- 50% of all PUP recipients are not on the highest rate of &euro;350 per week. A single person&rsquo;s weekly tax credits will fully cover any tax due on weekly PUP payments at the &euro;203, &euro;250 and &euro;300 payment rates.</p><p>- For these rates, the employee will in fact have excess weekly tax credits of between &euro;3.46 and &euro;22.86 which will build up for the period s/he is out of work. This means that the employee will have additional tax credits to offset against income when s/he returns to work;</p><p>- For a single person in receipt of PUP of &euro;350 per week, his/her weekly tax credits cover 90% of the tax payable, leaving tax due of approximately &euro;6.50 per week.</p><p>USC is not chargeable on PUP payments which will either fully or partially offset any tax impact on overall net wages and should be borne in mind.</p><p>If a single person is in receipt of the PUP from January 2021 to end of June 2021 before then returning to work (i.e. 26 payments of PUP at &euro;350 per week = &euro;9,100), the total outstanding tax due on the payments received at that point is approximately &euro;170. By adjusting the employee&rsquo;s tax credits while he or she is receiving the PUP payment, as outlined above, this, eliminates or reduces any liability at year end. Any such liability will also be fully or partly offset by the reduction in the total USC liability for the year because, as explained above, PUP payments are not liable to USC. In effect, this means that, in most cases, the net take home pay of PUP recipients that return to employment will be unaffected by the taxation measures.</p><p>The position for married couples/civil partners is slightly different. Where a couple is taxed under joint assessment and one spouse or civil partner is in receipt of the PUP but does not have sufficient tax credits to cover the tax due, the tax credits of the working spouse or civil partner are reduced to ensure that the balance of the tax is collected during the year. Effectively, the personal tax credit of the PUP recipient is not assigned to the working spouse in the usual manner as it is instead allocated to the excess PUP amount over and above the (PUP) recipient&rsquo;s PAYE tax credit and rate band.</p><p>Finally, in taxing PUP payments in accordance with the legislation, Revenue is seeking to ensure, as far as possible, that people do not end up with a tax liability at the end of 2021 that will have to be paid in future years, particularly where there is already an underpayment in respect of 2020. The alternative &lsquo;year-end&rsquo; approach would result in employees having further underpayments in the years ahead in addition to their 2020 liabilities, which could cause financial difficulties for them down the road. The normal deduction arrangements now applying to both EWSS and PUP for 2021 seeks to insure against this, as tax credits are set aside for offset against any tax due. The arrangement also ensures an equity of tax treatment between those receiving the PUP and employees who are working and receiving similar levels of wages (although the person on PUP will have a lower USC liability). </p></reply>

The support is available to companies, self-employed individuals and partnerships who carry on a trade or trading activities, the profits from which are chargeable to tax under Case I of Schedule D, from a business premises located in a region subject to restrictions introduced in line with the Living with Covid-19 Plan. </p><p>Details of CRSS are set out in Finance Act 2020 and detailed operational guidelines, which are based on the terms and conditions of the scheme as set out in the legislation, have been published on the Revenue website at: <i></i></p><p>To qualify under the scheme a business must, under specific terms of the Covid restrictions, be required to either prohibit or significantly restrict, customers from accessing their business premises to acquire goods or services, with the result that the business either has to temporarily close or to operate at a significantly reduced level. For the purposes of CRSS, a qualifying &ldquo;business premises&rdquo; is a building or other similar fixed physical structure in which a business activity is ordinarily carried on.  </p><p>Where a business does not ordinarily operate from a fixed business premises, such as certain wedding businesses or outdoor fitness/activity businesses, that business will not meet the eligibility criteria for CRSS. </p><p>It is not sufficient that the trade of a business has been impacted because of a reduction in customer demand as a consequence of Covid-19.  The scheme only applies where, as a direct result of the specific terms of the Government restrictions, the business is required to either prohibit or significantly restrict access to its business premises. </p><p>I have no plans to change the eligibility criteria for the CRSS or to introduce sectoral supports. The CRSS is just one of the Government&rsquo;s supports to assist businesses impacted by COVID-19. Businesses who are not eligible for CRSS may be entitled to alternative supports put in place by the Government, including the COVID Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP), the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) and the Tourism Business Continuity Scheme. Businesses may also be eligible under the Debt Warehousing Scheme to &lsquo;park&rsquo; certain VAT and PAYE (Employer) liabilities, excess payments received under the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS), outstanding balances of self-assessed Income Tax for 2019 and Preliminary Tax for 2020.  </p><p>I would draw Deputies attention to the recent announcement by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise Trade and Employment of a new &euro;60 million COVID-19 Business Aid Scheme (CBAS) that is being developed to provide grants to businesses ineligible for the Government&rsquo;s other existing schemes, designed to help with fixed costs.

I'm precluded from intervening on behalf of any individual customer in any particular bank. Decisions in relation to commercial matters are the sole responsibility of the board and management of the banks, which must be run on an independent and commercial basis. The independence of banks in which the state has a shareholding is protected by Relationship Frameworks which are legally binding documents that cannot be changed unilaterally. These frameworks, which are publicly available, were insisted upon by the European Commission to protect competition in the Irish market. </p>  <p>  The application of interest rate charges is solely a commercial matter for the board and management of each bank. </p>  <p>  Deposit balances and liquidity in general has risen significantly across the banking system in Europe in recent years as the ECB has continued to provide additional funds through their asset purchase schemes and long term refinancing operations. This has been further exacerbated by the Covid19 pandemic as households continue to stay at home and save and businesses defer investment decisions. This excess liquidity which has grown significantly in the European system has to go somewhere and in the main it gets placed back on deposit with the ECB who charge the banks -0.50%. The application of negative deposit rates by the ECB has resulted in European banks incurring a consequent cost on deposit accounts. The Irish banks are impacted in a similar way to their European counterparts. The banks across Europe have looked to pass some of the costs associated with negative rates to deposit holders with larger balances. The Irish banks are no different in this regard.</p>  <p>  In passing on some of these costs it is important to note that banks cannot differentiate between customers in different sectors and for that reason the approach taken is to apply charges based on the size of the deposit balance.</p></reply>

In order to claim the Stay and Spend Tax Credit, taxpayers are required to upload a copy of their receipt(s) for qualifying expenditure to the Revenue Receipts Tracker and then make a formal claim for the tax credit when submitting their annual Income Tax Return. </p>  <p>  Under the scheme a claim may be made in relation to qualifying expenditure incurred between the period 1 October 2020 and 30 April 2021. Broadly, qualifying expenditure includes expenditure on either holiday accommodation or &ldquo;eat in&rdquo; food and drink, with a minimum expenditure amount of &euro;25 per transaction being required. </p>  <p>  The scheme was developed at a time when there appeared to be a steady downward trend in infection rates, and there was an expectation that the re-opening of the economy could be sustained uninterrupted.   Unfortunately, this has not been the case and, thus far, with the exception of some short periods, public health restrictions have had the effect of impeding the operation of the incentive as originally envisaged. Stay and Spend is scheduled to operate until 30 April but the flexibility exists for me to extend its operation in 2021 beyond that date (to end 2021).  It is too early as yet to take definitive decisions in that regard.  Much will depend on how circumstances unfold in the months ahead.  As I have said before, I will keep an eye on how matters develop and the role that the scheme might play and consider if any changes need to be made. </p>  <p>  Claims relating to qualifying expenditure incurred in the period from 1 October 2020 to 31 December 2020 can be made when an individual is submitting his/her 2020 Income Tax Return, which is now available for submission.  </p>  <p>  As at 10 February 2021, the number of business registered to take part in the Stay and Spend scheme is 3,137. </p>  <p>  A total of 51,494 receipts have been uploaded by taxpayers to the Revenue Receipts Tracker and the expenditure recorded on these receipts amounts to &euro;8,406,533. The potential tax cost is &euro;1,681,307 assuming all such expenditure is claimed and qualifies in full for tax relief. Of the 51,494 receipts uploaded 9,917 relate to accommodation and food, 8,185 for accommodation only and 33,392 for food only. </p>  <p>  As at 14 February 2021 a total of 7,799 claims have been included in 2020 Income Tax Returns. These claims relate to &euro;2,755,230 of the qualifying expenditure recorded on the Revenue Receipts Tracker to date and the tax cost of same amounts to &euro;551,046. However, as the filing deadline for the 2020 Income Tax Return is not until 31 October 2021, information on the total number of claims and cost for the 2020 year of assessment will not be available until after the filing date and the returns have been processed.  </p>  <p>  Subsequent to claims being made in respect of this new scheme and any other relief or deduction, verification of such reliefs and deductions forms part of Revenue&rsquo;s comprehensive risk assessment programme.</p>  <p>  It is important also to recall that Stay and Spend should not be viewed in isolation from the other measures put in place to support businesses generally and the hospitality sector in particular. </p>  <p>  In recognition of the unprecedented challenges facing the Hospitality and Tourism sector, the VAT rate was reduced from 13.5% to 9 % from 1 November 2020.

The Code specifies that the affordability assessment must include consideration of the information gathered on the borrower&rsquo;s personal circumstances and financial situation.

If a mortgage applicant is not satisfied with how a regulated firm is dealing with them in relation to an application for credit, or they believe that the regulated firm is not following the requirements of the Central Bank&rsquo;s codes and regulations or other financial services law, they should make a complaint directly to the regulated firm.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-02-17a.463.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021021700064#WRG07500"><p>The Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) was introduced on 26 March 2020. It was an emergency measure to deal with the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the economy.  Over 66,500 employers were supported through the TWSS in respect of more than 664,000 employees at a cost of &euro;2.9bn. The scheme operated until 31 August 2020 and was replaced by the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) from 1 September 2020.</p><p>Payments made under the TWSS were regarded as income supports and share the characteristics of income.  Other income earners in receipt of comparable &ldquo;normal wages&rdquo; are taxable on those wages.  In the interest of equity, therefore, payments under the TWSS are subject to income tax and Universal Social Charge (USC).  It is noted however that a zero rate of PRSI applied for the purposes of employee PRSI contributions under the TWSS.  The taxation treatment of TWSS payments was legislated for in section 28(5)(e) of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020.</p><p>While income tax and the USC on earnings are generally deducted in real-time as and when the person is paid, tax was not collected in real-time through the PAYE system while the TWSS was in operation.  Instead, liability to tax was to be calculated by Revenue through the regular end of year review process.  This decision was taken in order to maximise the amount of financial support that was provided to recipients at a time when it was considered that they needed such support most, when the TWSS was first announced and expected to only be in place for 12 weeks.  When the TWSS was extended for a further 10 weeks until the end of August 2020, Revenue took steps to minimise the amount of income tax and USC due, if any, on TWSS payments at the end of the year.  This was done by placing all recipients of the TWSS or PUP on the &lsquo;<i>week 1 basis</i>&rsquo; of taxation for the remainder of the year so as to &ldquo;preserve&rdquo; unused tax credits that can then be used to offset any income tax or USC liabilities that arise at year end. </p><p>The final calculation of the end of year liability for each person is dependent on a range of factors, including a person&rsquo;s civil status, their available tax credits, the amount received under TWSS and/or PUP, any top-up payments made by the employer, as well as other entitlements and credits, such as health expenses.  </p><p>Revenue will be adopting a fair and flexible approach to collecting tax due on payments made under the TWSS and has given assurances that if any income tax and USC liabilities still arise following the allocation of unused credits, it will work with its customers to collect the outstanding liabilities and a number of flexible arrangements may be entered into, including the collection without interest over an extended period of time for 4 years beginning in 2022. </p><p>It is also understood that Revenue are facilitating employers who wish to pay the tax liabilities of their employees where such income tax and USC liabilities arise from the schemes.</p><p>Data Revenue have now released on the preliminary 2020 end of year statements which shows that almost half of those in receipt of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) or TWSS in 2020 have no outstanding liability to discharge (in fact over a third are due a refund).</p><p>In the case of the remaining taxpayer units with an outstanding liability, the data indicates that amounts to be collected are modest in scale, with 44% owing less than &euro;500 and 72% having a liability of less than &euro;1,000.  </p><p>If paid over the 4 year period beginning in 2022, the majority of those cases will owe less than &euro;5 per week, with nearly half paying less than &euro;2.50 per week. These figures represent a preliminary liability and may be further reduced by additional tax credits or reliefs such as health expenses.  </p><p>The Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), was legislated for under the Financial Provisions (Covid-19) (No. 2) Act 2020.  The EWSS has re-established the normal requirement to operate PAYE on all employee salaries, providing for the regular deduction and remittance of income tax, USC and employee PRSI. </p></reply>

In relation to the particular issue of new mortgage lending, the main retail banks previously confirmed that they are considering mortgage applications and mortgage drawdowns in relation to their customers who were impacted by COVID-19 on a case by case basis and that they are taking a fair and balanced approach.  Lenders continue to process mortgage applications and have supports in place to assist customers impacted by COVID-19. Therefore, if mortgage applicants have any queries or concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on their mortgage application, they should in the first instance contact their lender directly on the matter.</p>  <p>  Regarding the particular issue of extending the period of a mortgage approval in principle, the Central Bank has advised that there are no specific regulatory requirements relating to the duration of an approval in principle. That is a commercial and business matter for individual lenders.  However, a lender should make the duration of any offer of approval in principle clear to a consumer, in line with the requirement of the Consumer Protection Code 2012 to provide clear information to a consumer and bring their attention to key information.</p>  <p>  More generally there are certain consumer protection requirements which govern the provision of mortgage credit to consumers.  For example, the European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016 (CMCAR) provide that, before concluding a mortgage credit agreement, a lender must make a thorough assessment of the consumer&rsquo;s creditworthiness with a view to verifying the prospect of the consumer being able to meet his or her obligations under the credit agreement.  The CMCAR further provide that a lender should only make credit available to a consumer where the result of the creditworthiness assessment indicates that the consumer&rsquo;s obligations resulting from the credit agreement are likely to be met in the manner required under that agreement.  The assessment of creditworthiness must be carried out on the basis of information on the consumer&rsquo;s income and expenses and other financial and economic circumstances which are necessary, sufficient and proportionate. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 imposes &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer and Suitability&rsquo; requirements on lenders.  Under these requirements, lenders are required to assess affordability of credit and the suitability of a product or service based on the individual circumstances of each borrower. The Code specifies that the affordability assessment must include consideration of the information gathered on the borrower&rsquo;s personal circumstances and financial situation.  Furthermore, where a lender refuses a mortgage application, the CMCAR requires that the lender must inform the consumer without delay of the refusal. In addition, the Code requires that the lender must clearly outline to the consumer the reasons why the credit was not approved, and provide these reasons on paper if requested.</p></reply>

I have no plans at present for a measure along the lines proposed by the Deputy.  </p>  <p>  In relation to fitness based measures more generally, I would point to the Cycle To Work scheme, introduced by  Finance (No. 2) Act 2008. The scheme specifies that bicycles and associated safety equipment provided by employers to employees will be treated as a tax exempt benefit-in-kind subject to certain conditions being met. One of the benefits envisaged from the scheme was indeed that more people cycling to and from work would improve health and fitness levels.  Further, Finance Act 2018 commenced the Accelerated Capital Allowances scheme for Childcare facilities and Fitness Centres. The scheme was introduced to encourage employers to develop childcare facilities and fitness centres onsite for their employees. The scheme provides accelerated allowances for qualifying buildings or structures over a seven year period and accelerated allowances for related equipment at 100% in year 1. </p></reply>

The Plan must set out the reforms and investments to be supported by the Facility and must be submitted to the European Commission no later than 30 April 2021.</p>  <p>  My Department, working together with the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Finance and the Department of Enterprise, Trade &amp;amp; Employment, is responsible for preparing the Plan with input from other Departments as necessary, and for ensuring coordination across Government.  This involves detailed engagement with the European Commission which is underway.</p>  <p>  A public consultation process is underway.  A consultation document has been published on gov.ie/consultation.  The consultation process will run until 22 February 2021.</p></reply>

It is available on the gov.ie website at this link: <i></i></p><p>The Strategy has been informed by my priorities and relevant commitments in the Programme for Government and the overall strategic context in which my Department operates.  </p><p>The Department&rsquo;s Mission for 2021-2023 will be to serve the public interest through sound governance of public expenditure and by leading and enabling reform across the Civil and Public Service.  In support of this mission, it will pursue two strategic goals, as follows:</p><p>- To manage public expenditure at sustainable levels in a planned, balanced and evidence informed manner, in order to support Ireland&rsquo;s economic, social and climate goals; and</p><p>- To drive reform and innovation across the Civil and Public Service to improve service delivery to the public, and to enhance strategic policy making and public governance structures.</p><p>The Department&rsquo;s goals, and the actions underpinning them, have been set at a relatively high level and provide a robust framework to support the implementation of the Department's broad remit.  However, the Statement of Strategy includes Climate as one of its core pillars, noting that the strategic context in which the Department operates is shaped by, inter alia, </p><p>&quot;<i>The step up in ambition at EU and national level with associated commitments and targets on climate action and the transition to a low carbon economy, impacting on all sectors of Government and our economy&quot;. </i></p><p>Climate is already a key consideration in determining the Department&rsquo;s priorities and the forthcoming Climate Action Plan will set out in detail the specific actions that my Department and the bodies under its aegis will be taking to meet the Government&rsquo;s ambitious climate agenda. </p><p>With regard to the Climate Mandate, the development of this mandate is a matter for the Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications.  Once the mandate has been developed and approved by Government, it will be applied to my Department and the bodies under its aegis.</p></reply>

These are as follows:</p>  <p>1. Sandymount Flood Relief Scheme (Phase 1 and Phase 2):   Dublin City Council (DCC) are currently working to finalise a scheme design for works in Sandymount, with the current proposed scheme cost estimates at approximately &euro;1.6 million for Phase 1, and &euro;17.3 million for Phase 2. The Office of Public Works (OPW) is working closely with DCC to finalise this design and progress the scheme to planning and construction stage. It is anticipated that DCC will submit the final documentation in preparation for planning in the coming months.</p>  <p>2. South Campshires Flood Protection Project:   Works on this project are substantially complete, with the OPW&rsquo;s direct labour crew now finished on site. While DCC are currently addressing some final elements of the project, flood protection is currently provided. &euro;6.3 million has been spent on this project to date. </p>  <p>3. Clontarf: DCC are currently examining potential solutions to flooding in Clontarf, and if a cost beneficial solution is identified they will submit a business case to the OPW for approval for the project to proceed to detailed design and subsequent stages.   </p>  <p>4. Dollymount:   Dublin City Council led and funded flood defence works along Dollymount Strand. This work is now complete and its total cost was &euro;4million.</p>  <p>5. Sutton and Howth North Flood Relief Scheme  : A potential solution to flooding in this area was identified under the Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme.  While this scheme was not in the first tranche of 60 schemes prioritised to be progressed on foot of the launch of the national Flood Risk Management Plans (FRMP) in 2018, it is scheduled that all FRMP projects will be progressed under the reviewed NDP 2018-2030.  The proposed scheme for Sutton and Howth North is expected to cost in the region of &euro;6million, based on preliminary estimates developed as part of the CFRAM Programme. </p>  <p>  As the projects are all at different stages, and programmes are to be finalised on a number of these projects, we cannot provide a definitive figure for allocation of funds over the next five years. However, the OPW has budgeted and allocated the required funding to progress these schemes (approximately &euro;31 million   euro) as part of its multi-annual budgeting of almost EUR1bn out to 2030.</p></reply>

Construction works are being undertaken directly by the OPW&rsquo;s Direct Labour and Direct Managed Services.</p><p>Building on the option development work of the Shannon CFRAM (Catchment-based Flood Risk Assessment &amp;amp; Management) Study, Westmeath County Council appointed Engineering Consultants in April 2017, to progress appropriate flood risk alleviation measures for Athlone.  Following detailed option development, eight discrete cells of flood defence works were identified and six of these were progressed individually through Part 8 Planning by the Council. One cell did not require Planning approval, as the works were minor in nature, and one cell remains to be progressed to Part 10 Planning stage.</p><p>Construction of the Scheme is progressing well, despite Covid-19 restrictions and effects and also the high water levels that have hampered progress to some extent. The current anticipated timeline for completion of each flood cell is set out in Table 1 below, but are somewhat tentative, given the current Covid-19 situation and the continuing high water levels.  </p><p><b>Table 1: Athlone Flood Relief Scheme - Flood Cell timelines</b> <table>    <tr>       <th><div>Flood Cell</div></th>       <th><div>Anticipated completion </div></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>FC1 &ndash; Deerpark</td>       <td>Q2 2022</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>FC2 &ndash; The Strand</td>       <td>Q2 2022</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>FC3 &ndash; The Quay</td>       <td>Q2 2022</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>FC4 &ndash; Brick Island</td>       <td>Q4 2021</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>FC5 &ndash; Marine View</td>       <td>Q2 2022</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>FC6 &ndash; Iona Park</td>       <td>Construction complete</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>FC7 &ndash; River Al (Cregan)</td>       <td>To be confirmed subject to Planning approval</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>FC8 &ndash; Golden Island</td>       <td>To be confirmed once construction has commenced</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Westmeath County Council, as the Contracting Authority, is responsible for public liaison and Councillors are updated by the Executive at regular meetings. Consultation on preliminary options developed under the Catchment-based Flood Risk Assessment and Management study (CFRAM) was undertaken by the Office of Public Work in 2015, and a further public consultation event was undertaken by the Council on the River Al flood cell in December, 2019. Flood cells advanced by the Council through the Part 8 planning process were all publicly advertised and it was open to the public to make submissions. Any specific interaction with interested parties during the construction phase of the scheme falls within the remit of Westmeath County Council.</p></reply>

For the 2014-2020 programming period Ireland was comprised of two NUTS II regions &ndash; the Southern and Eastern Region and the Border, Midland and Western Region. Reflecting the changes introduced to Ireland's regional structure, this will change for the 2021-2027 period, to three NUTS II regions, the Southern Region, the Eastern and Midland Region and the Northern and Western Region. </p><p>For the 2014-2020 programming period the EU Regulations provided for expenditure under 11 Thematic Objectives. They also required that at least 80 % of the total European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)resources at national level be allocated to two or more of the thematic objectives 1, 2, 3 and 4. Given this structure, it is not possible to break out the allocations under the headings of the digital agenda, support for small and medium-sized enterprises, environment and the net-zero-carbon economy. </p><p>In response to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Commission introduced additional flexibilities, delivered through two Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative (CRII and CRII+)packages, in which Member States could re-programme existing allocations of funding towards the Covid-19 response, at a co-financing rate of 100%. Ireland took advantage of these flexibilities and reprogrammed &euro;226.6 million of unclaimed ERDF funding to support a new Health Support Heading primarily used to support the purchase of PPE for the Health Services. </p><p>Details of the two ERDF Regional Operational Programmes, are summarised in the table below:</p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th>Thematic Objectives for ERDF</th>       <th>ERDF S&amp;amp;E</th>       <th>ERDF BMW</th>       <th>ERDF - Total</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Strengthening research,   technological development and innovation</td>       <td>&euro;21,652,061</td>       <td>&euro;20,157,967</td>       <td>&euro;41,810,028</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Enhancing the competitiveness of small and medium-sized enterprises</td>       <td>&euro;11,933,177</td>       <td>&euro;9,889,293</td>       <td>&euro;21,822,470</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Supporting the shift towards a low-carbon economy in all   sectors</td>       <td>&euro;60,878,975</td>       <td>&euro;18,000,000</td>       <td>&euro;78,878,975</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Preserving and protecting the environment and promoting   resource efficiency</td>       <td>&euro;24,427,315</td>       <td>&euro;13,148,850</td>       <td>&euro;37,576,165</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Health Support Scheme (PPE) *</td>       <td>&euro;129,165,299</td>       <td>&euro;97,415,632</td>       <td>&euro;226,580,931</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Technical assistance</td>       <td>&euro;2,009,350</td>       <td>&euro;2,097,179</td>       <td>&euro;4,106,529</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>TOTAL</td>       <td>&euro;250,066,177</td>       <td>&euro;160,708,921</td>       <td>&euro;410,775,098</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>* A further &euro;60m of European Social Funding (ESF) was also reprogrammed for the Health Support Scheme, under the EU Corona Virus Response Investment Initiative. </p><p>In addition as part of Next Generation EU additional resources were provided through the REACT-EUmeasure for the 2014-2020 Programmes. Funding from REACT-EU is split into two tranches, one allocated at the end of 2020 and another to be allocated at the end of 2021. In the first tranche, Ireland has been allocated approximately &euro;84 million (2018 prices). The second tranche makes up 30% of the total funding allocation and the allocation method will be based on economic data available in October 2021. </p><p>With regard to how REACT-EU can be utilised, maximum flexibility is being given to Member States to utilise the additional funding under their existing European Social Fund, European Regional Development Fund, and Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived programmes, with an option to avail of up to 100% EU co-financing.The relevant national authorities in Ireland are currently engaged in a process to finalise the arrangements to allocate this funding between the eligible Funds and Programmes. </p><p>In relation to 2021-2027Ireland is expected to receive a total of &euro;1,137 million (in 2018 prices) in Cohesion Policy Funds, comprising of:</p><p>- &euro;351 million for the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF);</p><p>-  &euro;451 million for the European Social Fund + (ESF+);</p><p>-  &euro;258 million for European Territorial Cooperation (including PEACE PLUS); and</p><p>-  &euro;77 million under the Just Transition Fund (JTF).</p><p>The details supplied to date indicate an initial ERDF allocation for the transition region &ndash; the Northern and Western Region of &euro;97,811,529 with the remaining &euro;253,296,072 allocated across the two more developed Regions &ndash; the Southern Region and the Midland and Eastern Region. However, the Regulations governing the funds, which are nearing finalisation, provide for a number of flexibilities, including transferring allocations between Funds, and between Regions.  </p><p>Work is well advanced in preparing Ireland&rsquo;s Partnership Agreement and ERDF Operational Programmes for 2021 - 2027. I have acknowledged that the Northern and Western region of Ireland has been designated as a 'Region in Transition'. In light of this, I announced in October 2020 that there would be a specific ERDF programme focused on the North West and that the Northern Western Regional Assembly will act as Managing Authority for the programme for the 2021-27 period.  Moreover, an independent Needs Analysis was conducted by Indecon Economic Consultants to provide the evidence base for the future ERDF (and ESF+) programmes. The report includes a specific analysis of regional disparities and the particular challenges faced by each region. Given the reclassification of the Northern and Western region, a specific chapter is dedicated to the past performance and the particular needs of this region. In developing the Operational Programmes, consideration will be given to how best we can avail of the flexibilities available in the regulations, how to maximise synergies between the various EU Funds and how the overall process can help to address the specific needs of all regions.</p></reply>

More than 40 bodies have made submissions to Sport Ireland for consideration by the agency and the Expert Group on Return to Sport. As the level of infection in the community at present remains high, and our health service is under significant strain, it is likely to be some time before it is possible to significantly relax the restrictions on sport and exercise. Nevertheless, evaluation of these submissions is continuing and nearing completion. It is my intention to bring these matters to my colleagues in Government within the next few weeks.</p>  <p>  Insofar as risk assessment and advice is concerned, the Expert Group on Return to Sport provides relevant advice to the sporting bodies to inform their own risk assessment, and the majority of sporting bodies have put in place appropriate COVID-19 protocols to mitigate the risk of transmission at training and competitive events.

This was the first time this type of support was offered to the music industry and it was designed  in a time of crisis and at short notice to cover all music genres.</p><p>First Music Contact (FMC) is an independent private company limited by guarantee and is the lead national music organisation for resourcing musicians and the independent music sector in Ireland.  My Department has a well established working relationship with FMC. It is an organisation funded by the Arts Council on the basis of its  proposal for programming activities each year as by my Department through Culture Ireland for international promotion of musicians under the terms of a Performance Delivery Agreement. Fifty percent of FMC&rsquo;s funding is raised through self-generated income, private funding and sponsorship.  </p><p>FMC has operated in the domestic music sector in Ireland for 25 years. FMC has had weekly advisory meetings for Irish artists and their teams for the past 20 years, delivered Ireland Music Week for 19 years, the Breaking Tunes music portal and community for domestic artists is 10 years old this year. This is additional to international facing export work,  presented under the title Music from Ireland, which is now in its 16th year of operation.  For all of these reasons FMC was considered to offer a cost effective way of administering the MISP last year when there was no capacity in my Department or the Arts Council to manage such schemes in the given timeframe. </p><p>FMC therefore fulfilled the criteria of having in depth knowledge of the music industry, a history of managing applications from musicians and their agents, many years of mentoring artists and an understanding of national and international factors in music support and promotion.</p><p>As there was no financial gain to management of these schemes and the only costs being covered were limited and receipted administrative costs there was no requirement for an open process.No other body was considered to be able to match FMC's experience, and capacity to deliver in the tight timeframe with cost efficiencies. </p><p>Under the terms of the Performance Delivery Agreement between my Department and FMC for the management and delivery of the Music Industry Stimulus Package, a maximum of &euro;83,000 was provided for administration purposes from the &euro;1.7m allocated to the Package.</p><p>A breakdown of total administration costs relating to the fund are as per the table below.</p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th>MISP Administration Cost Breakdown</th>       <th></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Panel Assessors Fees</td>       <td><div>&euro;26,440.00</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Legal , banking and Auditing</td>       <td><div>&euro;7,452.00</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>MISP Manager and Accounts Staff costs</td>       <td><div>&euro;48,425.00</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Digital Support</td>       <td><div>&euro;490.68</div></td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

It is my intention to compile the final review in a timely manner and the results will be published.

I understand that it is the only company of its kind in Ireland available to the independent music sector which delivers songs to radio, press and industry from one portal.</p>  <p>  When releasing music, it is important that artists are able to distribute as widely as possible.  Distribution has a significant cost but is recognised as a vital cog in stimulating activity in the sector. Accordingly, I understand that First Music Contact (FMC), who is managing the Music Industry Stimulus Package on behalf of the Department, negotiated a favourable reduced rate with the company on behalf of all successful applicants to ensure wide distribution of the supported album releases.</p>  <p>  The album release scheme for which &euro;280,000 was awarded is the only scheme for which Yangaroo services were negotiated.  I understand that to date, FMC has paid &euro;14,000 for Yangaroo services on the basis of 28 redeemed vouchers of &euro;500 each. As the remaining 28 album release awardees present vouchers for use of Yangaroo services, FMC will provide payment to that company.

His Department has confirmed that sports clubs and groups are not eligible for the COVID-19 Business Aid Scheme.</p>  <p>  Regarding support from my Department, a Covid-19 funding package of &euro;85 million was provided last year to support the sport sector. This significant investment benefited all levels of the sport sector, including thousands of grassroots clubs across the country, and provided some certainty for sporting organisations in their planning for 2021.</p>  <p>  In addition to funding allocated to National Governing Bodies of Sport to enable them to support their affiliated clubs, assistance was given to 1,637 clubs throughout the country as part of small grant schemes operated by Local Sports Partnerships.  These schemes provided an additional mechanism to support community groups and clubs who may not be affiliated to a national organisation or recognised National Governing Body but who provide a vital local service.</p>  <p>  I fully recognise that the financial and operational challenges associated with Covid-19 will continue well into 2021 and that many clubs will find themselves in financial difficulty again this year.  Additional funding was allocated for Sport Ireland in Budget 2021 to continue to support our valued sport sector.  This includes funding to provide for supports to the sector to meet the ongoing challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic. Decisions in relation to how funding will be allocated and the criteria to be applied will be made by Sport Ireland in due course.</p>  <p>  In that regard, Sport Ireland is in ongoing communication with the National Governing Bodies of sport and is assessing the financial needs of the sector for the year ahead. In addition. I am engaging with the National Governing Bodies both bilaterally and through the Covid-19 Sports Monitoring Group, which met most recently on 28 January, in regard to any supports which may be required in the period ahead.</p></reply>

I recognise the essential role that the print media plays in this regard and the particular value of local and regional newspapers in bringing communities together and sharing reliable and relevant local news.  The production and publication of newspapers, journals and periodicals and the distribution of those publications has been listed as an essential service. </p><p>The sector faces a fall in revenue arising from the pandemic, but also longer term challenges as a result of changing patterns of media consumption, technology and shifts in advertising revenue. </p><p>As the Deputy will appreciate it is of particular importance in relation to media organisations to avoid any perception of Government interference or influence and the funding of newspapers is therefore a complex issue.  I am however cognisant of the importance of this sector, and the financial issues which it currently faces.</p><p>Since I assumed formal responsibility for the media sector in September 2020, I have engaged in meeting key stakeholders including Newsbrands, Local Ireland and the National Union of Journalists (NUJ).  Work is continuing to explore the issues arising, with a follow up meeting between my officials and the NUJ taking place on 3<sup>rd</sup>February and a further meeting with Local Ireland has been scheduled for Wednesday 17 February.In addition, the Government has put in place a range of supports for all businesses impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which are available to local newspapers. </p><p>Funding for local radio stations is provided through the Sound and Vision Scheme. This is a statutory scheme provided for under Part 10 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 and largely funded by the television licence.  It is limited by statute to audiovisual and sound media and is administered by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.  There is no equivalent statutory scheme for the print sector and the BAI has no function in funding the print sector.  On 27 January 2021 the BAI announced another &euro;6.9m in supports which included &euro;1.4m allocated by the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media to the BAI Broadcasting Fund in December 2020 for live music projects.  This will assist in providing a platform for music industry professionals who would have predominately worked in the live music sector which has been severely impacted by Covid-19.  It will allow for projects that will help musicians to connect with audiences through Television and Radio. A further round of &euro;2.5m was announced recently for the independent radio sector and further rounds will follow later in year and the BAI will announce these as they arise. This funding is on top of the supports already put in place in 2020. Further information is available at: <i></i></p><p>In recognition of these longer term challenges facing the sector, the Programme for Government provided for the establishment of the Future of Media Commission to consider the future of print, broadcast, and online media in a platform agnostic fashion.  The Commission, chaired by Professor Brian MacCraith, recently concluded a public consultation to which a number of stakeholders in the print sector have made submissions. The Commission is currently in the process of engaging with key stakeholders in a series of thematic dialogues. I look forward to receiving the Commission's Report on the completion of its work which will inform media policy, including print media, over the next 10 years. </p></reply>

The genesis of the scheme is Recommendation No 9 of <i>Life Worth Living</i>- the Report of the Arts and Culture Recovery Task Force. </p><p>The Scheme as advertised provides that a local authority can apply for a capital grant of up to &euro;250,000 for a single  project at a funding rate of up to 90%.</p><p>The pilot scheme was developed in consultation with the local authority County and City Managers Association, as the Local Authorities are best placed to understand the individual needs of the communities they serve. </p><p>The scheme is intended <i>to fund local authorities to adapt, equip or otherwise improve public spaces for  cultural and events activities, taking account of public health guidelines and of the needs of the local arts community. </i>Outdoor public spaces that can provide year-round use can improve wellbeing and contribute positively to the public realm.  The support will allow each local authority to adapt, equip or otherwise improve public spaces for cultural and events activities.  The new scheme will take account of public health guidelines and of the needs of local arts and entertainment communities. Ideally projects will respond to the challenges associated with COVID-19 and support the recovery of the creative, cultural, entertainment and events sector as well as being future-proofed from a health and safety perspective.  </p><p>The Public Spending Code requires cost benefits analyses to be completed for projects over &euro;20m and as this scheme will not reach that threshold, such an analyses was not therefore required.The scheme is designed to deliver speedy results in order to support live performances as soon as it is safe to do so, and within any potential future restrictions on outdoor events.</p><p>Funding for the scheme will be delivered from within existing resources of the Department.It will not come from the allocation of &euro;50 million made in Budget 2021 for the live performance sector.  It is however part of a comprehensive suite of measures to support the cultural sector in response to the impacts of COVID-19 on the sector. It is also designed to align with similar schemes being developed by F&aacute;ilte Ireland to address infrastructure for outdoor dining. These initiatives have significant potential to enhance the public realm in local authority areas. They link to the wider work of the Night Time Economy Taskforce and will potentially contribute to the longer term regeneration of cities and towns across the country. </p></reply>

Its purpose was to provide targeted support to businesses within the hospitality sector impacted by continued restrictions.</p>  <p>  The Stay and Spend scheme was devised at a time when there appeared to be a steady downward trend in infection rates and there was an expectation that the re-opening of the economy could be sustained uninterrupted. Public health restrictions have had the effect of impeding the operation of the scheme as originally envisaged.</p>  <p>  The Scheme is due to operate until 30 April but flexibility exists for the Minister for Finance to extend its operation in 2021 beyond that date.  The Government will monitor how matters develop over the coming months and the role that the scheme might play, and consider if any changes need to be made.</p></reply>

The <i>Water Services Policy Statement 2018-2025</i>sets out the range of policy objectives across the key thematic areas of quality, conservation and future proofing that will be pursued between now and 2025. The Policy Statement supports the promotion of water conservation and water resource management as an important element of water services policy that is to be reflected in strategic investment planning by Irish Water. For the period of the Policy Statement, this will involve the prioritisation of multifaceted programmes around leak detection and repair, network improvements, cost effective metering, public awareness campaigns and funding to the 'Find and Fix' scheme for addressing domestic customer leaks. </p><p>There are no plans at present to introduce a grant scheme along the lines suggested. It is worth noting however that non-domestic customers of Irish Water, including sports centres, currently face charges for water services based on their actual metered consumption and in line with a charging policy determined by the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities. This is in keeping with Ireland's obligations under the Water Framework Directive. It is understood that some sports organisations may already have arrangements in place to capture and store rainwater for use for purposes (such as watering green areas) which do not require potable water. By doing so they are conserving the use of treated water and reducing their water bills.  </p></reply>

The range of objectives and actions it specifies have been pursued in partnership with stakeholders and agencies across the housing sector to address vacancy in our housing stock. The key drivers of these actions are: local authorities, the Housing Agency, and Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs), supported by schemes available within my Department specifically designed to tackle vacancy, such as the Repair and Lease Scheme, the Buy and Renew Scheme and the Long Term Leasing Scheme.</p><p>- The Repair and Leasing Scheme (RLS) is targeted at owners of vacant properties who cannot afford or access the funding needed to bring their properties up to the required standard for rental properties. The scheme provides upfront funding to carry out the works and, in return, the property owner agrees to lease the dwelling to the local authority to be used as social housing for a period up to 25 years. The maximum loan for property repair available under the Repair and Leases scheme has been increased by my Department from &euro;40,000 to &euro;60,000. The number of dwellings delivered under the Repair &amp;amp; Lease scheme from July 2018 to end Q3 2020 is 167 dwellings. </p><p>-  The Buy and Renew initiative allows local authorities to purchase private vacant properties for use as social housing. The number of units purchased by local authorities under the Buy and Renew scheme from July 2018 to end of 2020 was 419 units.</p><p>- The Housing Acquisitions Fund is a &euro;70 million revolving that was established in January 2017 with the objective of enabling the Housing Agency to acquire vacant units from banks and investment companies for social housing use.  The fund is replenished by the Housing Agency through the sale of units primarily to the AHB sector and the funds received are then recycled back into the fund for future acquisitions. Since July 2018, a total of 436 properties had been purchased by the Housing Agency using the Fund and placed on caretaker leases with AHBs. </p><p>Table 1 below gives a breakdown of the number of properties delivered under each of the schemes in each local authority. </p><p>Table 1 <table>    <tr>       <th><div>Local Authority </div></th>       <th><div>Repair and Lease Dwellings Delivered Q3

Their aim is to provide for the safety and welfare of people in and about buildings. The Building Regulations are set out in functional terms and are performance based &ndash; they do not set limitations on the materials. </p><p>The associated Technical Guidance Documents (TGD A - M respectively) provide technical guidance on how to comply with the regulations in practical terms for non-complex buildings.  Where works are carried out in accordance with the relevant technical guidance, such works are considered to be, <i>prima facie</i>, in compliance with the relevant regulations. </p><p>The Building Regulations are subject to ongoing review in the interests of safety and the well-being of persons in the built environment and to ensure that due regard is taken of changes in construction techniques, technological progress and innovation.</p><p>Part B of the Building Regulations deals with Fire Safety. The associated Technical Guidance Document B (TGD B) provides guidance indicating how the requirements of Part B can be achieved in practice. Where works are carried out in accordance with TGD B, this will, prima facie, indicate compliance with Part B of the Second Schedule of the Building Regulations.</p><p>A fundamental review of Part B (Fire Safety) is underway at present and will take note of the Fire Safety in Ireland report (published in 2018), and consider common and emerging building trends, developments and events from a global perspective, matters relating to external fire spread, external fire resistance, internal fire resistance, cladding systems, sprinklers, etc. Changes in standards, including fire test standards and technological changes in areas such as materials and systems have necessitated a fundamental analysis of the provisions and assumptions contained in Technical Guidance Document B &ndash; Fire Safety.</p><p>In this context, my Department established a Consultative Committee in December 2020 to discuss the technical revision of Part B/TGD B and has already met several times.</p><p>Draft documentation in the form of revised draft Building Regulations (Part B Amendment) Regulations, Technical Guidance Document B &ndash; Fire Safety and a Regulatory Impact Analysis are currently being developed with a view to being brought forward for public consultation later this year.</p><p>Separately, Part D (Materials and Workmanship) requires that all works should be carried out in a workmanlike manner using <i>&ldquo;proper materials&hellip;which are fit for the use for which they are intended and for the conditions in which they are to be used&rdquo; </i>to ensure compliance with the Building Regulations and includes materials which comply with an appropriate harmonised standard or European Technical Assessment or comply with an appropriate Irish Standard or Irish Agr&eacute;ment Certificate or with an alternative national technical specification of any State which is a contracting party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area, which provides in use an equivalent level of safety and suitability.</p></reply>

A Call for Proposals from AHBs opened on 14 December 2020 and closed on 5 January 2021. Applications were then competitively assessed by my Department and the Housing Agency. On 8 February 2021, I gave approval in principle under the CREL scheme for the development this year of 390 new homes by the Cl&uacute;id, Respond and Tuath AHBs. These new homes are located in Dublin, the Greater Dublin Area, and Cork, with cost-covering rents projected to be at least 25% below comparable open market prices. Precise details, including locations, will be released when the AHBs have completed commercial arrangements.</p>  <p>  The Call for Proposals for the CREL scheme included a strict condition that properties must not have been submitted for funding under the Payment and Availability Agreement, the Capital Assistance Scheme, or any of the Department's other social housing funding mechanisms. The homes to be used for Cost Rental under the CREL scheme are therefore not part of the respective AHBs' social housing pipelines.</p></reply>

The most recently published SSHA carried out in 2019, details the number of households on all local authority waiting lists as of June 2019. </p><p>The results of the SSHA include breakdowns by each local authority across a range of categories. The results do not provide a breakdown of the numbers by electoral area and my Department does not hold such data, nor does it record data on a month by month basis in the manner sought.</p><p>In relation to the specific question posed regarding breakdown by one, two or three bedroom facilities, information of this exact type is not held by my Department. However, tables 2.4 and A1.4 of the report provide details on household size. It should be noted that the category &ldquo;Household Composition&rdquo; in the previous reports, was replaced in the 2019 report by the &ldquo;Household Size&rdquo; profile category which provides more granular level of detail regarding the number of persons in each household type.</p><p>With respect to the year that applicants went onto the housing list and length of time spent on the social housing list, Figure 2.8 and Table A1.8 provide details on the length of time households have been on the record of qualified households (the Waiting List).</p><p>Full details in relation to the 2019 assessment are available on my Department's website at the following link: <i></i>.</p><p>It should be noted that due to the Covid 19 pandemic, the 2020 assessment was delayed and conducted in November. Work is ongoing and the summary report of the 2020 assessment will be published in due course.</p><p>My Department does not hold information of the specific type as requested on transfer lists. The oversight and practical management of social housing waiting lists, including the allocation and transfer of tenancies, is a matter for the relevant local authority in accordance with the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, and associated regulations.</p><p>Section 22 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 requires all local authorities, as a reserved function, to make an allocation scheme determining the order of priority to be accorded in the allocation of dwellings to households qualified for social housing support and to households approved for a transfer, the allocation of which would, in the opinion of the authority, meet the accommodation needs and requirements of the households. Ultimately, it is a matter for the local authority to decide the conditions to be met in relation to transfer applications.</p><p>Budget 2021 provided &euro;3.3 billion for the delivery of housing.  Subject to the impact of the covid related restrictions on the construction sector, the available funding will deliver 12,750 new social homes through build, acquisition and leasing.  A major focus of this investment is the delivery of new build, with an overall target of 9,500 new homes, in addition to 800 acquisitions and 2,450 homes to be delivered through leasing programmes. </p><p>In relation to the reduction of waiting times, my Department publishes comprehensive programme level statistics on a quarterly basis on all social housing delivery activity. This is published on the statistics page of my Department&rsquo;s website, at the following link: <i></i>. The most recent data is for Quarter 3 2020, and it shows that 1,042 social homes were delivered in Cavan and 1,388 in Monaghan for the period 2016 to Q3 2020. </p><p>The Government will be publishing a new housing strategy this year, which will set out details of social housing delivery for 2021-2025, including social housing targets for 2022 onwards.</p></reply>

Consideration of this matter is important in ensuring that local authority elected Councils are fully representative of the constituents they serve.</p>  <p>  Currently, there is no expenditure category for childcare or other caring costs incurred by councillors while attending meetings. This was an issue raised in the consultation process as part of the Independent Review of the Role and Remuneration of Local Authority Elected Members, led by Ms Sara Moorhead SC and published in June 2020. The expenditure categories for vouched expenses of councillors are aligned with those available under the Public Representation Allowance (PRA) for Oireachtas members. Oireachtas members cannot claim for childcare costs, though there is a privately operated fee-paying cr&egrave;che facility available for Oireachtas members and staff.</p>  <p>  Tailored allowances for caring costs are not available to other office holders in the State nor are they available for local authority employees who service council meetings.</p>  <p>  In her report, Ms Moorhead did suggest that the extension of the allowable expenses to include caring costs incurred by councillors in attending Council meetings could in theory be considered. However, she acknowledged that such a proposal would be out of line with practice for other office holders and state employees, and so advised that this should be considered with a good degree of caution.</p>  <p>  It is also worth noting that the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs introduced a universal childcare subsidy from August 2017, which is available to all children in Tusla-registered childcare above the age of 6 months.</p>  <p>  I am aware that there is a cr&egrave;che on site in Dublin City Council Civic Offices on Wood Quay which is also adjacent to City Hall. Preference is given to staff and Councillors although it is open to others depending on demand.  Councillors have availed of the cr&egrave;che on either a full time or part-time basis, and can reserve places for Committee meetings which all take place during the working day. The fees are not subsidised for Councillors or staff.</p>  <p>  In addition, there is a parenting room in City Hall where councillors can feed or change young children. Dublin City Council has a parenting policy which permits Councillors to bring babies and children to meetings as long as they are supervised by their parents. My hope is that the approach adopted in Dublin City Council, which has a &ldquo;Parenting (or Caring) Support Group&rdquo;, comprising a number of elected members, will be established in all other local authorities.</p>  <p>  I recently approved the establishment of a working group to examine the non-pay recommendations set out in the Moorhead Review, which include such issues as childcare and parental leave.  This group comprises key local government stakeholders, including representatives from the Association of Irish Local Government (AILG), the Local Authority Members Association (LAMA), the County and City Management Association (CCMA) and officials from my Department.</p>  <p>  The first meeting of the group took place earlier this month.  The terms of reference for the group include examination of the aforementioned recommendations and this will be taken forward by the group.</p></reply>

In general building defects are matters for resolution between the contracting parties involved, the homeowner, the builder, the developer and/or their respective insurers, structural guarantee or warranty scheme.</p><p>In this regard, it is incumbent on the parties responsible for poor workmanship and/or the supply of defective materials to face up to their responsibilities and take appropriate action to provide remedies for the affected homeowners.</p><p>The design and construction of buildings is regulated under the Building Control Acts 1990 to 2020. The Acts provides for the making of Building Regulations and Building Control Regulations.</p><p>The Building Regulations 1997 - 2019 set out the legal requirements in Ireland for the construction of new buildings (including houses), extensions to existing buildings as well as for material alterations and certain material changes of use to existing buildings. Their aim is to provide for the safety and welfare of people in and about buildings. </p><p>The Building Control Regulations set out the administrative procedures for demonstrating compliance in respect of an individual building or works.</p><p>Under the Building Control Acts 1990 to 2020 primary responsibility for compliance of works with the requirements of the Building Regulations, rests with the owners, designers and builders of buildings.</p><p>Enforcement of the Building Regulations is a matter for the 31 local building control authorities which have extensive powers of inspection and enforcement under statute.</p><p>In addition local authorities also have extensive powers of inspection and enforcement under the Fire Services Acts 1981 and 2003, the Housing Acts and the Planning and Development Acts, which may be relevant where fire safety concerns arise in residential developments.</p><p>The Programme for Government sets out a number of commitments in respect of the important policy area of building defects and provides for an examination of defective housing, having regard to the recommendations of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing report, &quot;Safe as Houses&quot;.</p><p>In this regard, my Department is actively engaging with key stakeholders and I have had several meetings with stakeholder representative groups on this matter over recent months. My Department is currently working to establish the structures to examine the issue of defective housing, this will include apartment buildings, in line with the commitment in the Programme for Government.</p><p>I recently appointed Mr Seamus Neely, former Chief Executive of Donegal County Council, to the position of Chair to the independent working group to oversee the effective implementation of the group&rsquo;s terms of reference which are currently being finalised.</p><p>In addition, I brought a Memorandum for the Information of the Government to Cabinet recently to note the establishment of a working group with the appropriate expertise to examine the issue of defective housing. It is intended to hold the inaugural plenary working group meeting shortly.</p><p>In regard to the working group&rsquo;s deliberations, the group will seek to engage with a range of interested parties, including homeowners, public representatives, local authorities, product manufacturers, building professionals and industry stakeholders, among others.</p><p>In the context of fire safety, when a building is constructed and occupied, statutory responsibility for fire safety is assigned by section 18(2) of the Fire Services Acts, 1981 &amp;amp; 2003, to the &lsquo;person having control&rsquo; of the building. In multi-unit developments, the &quot;person having control&quot; is generally the owner management company.</p><p>Under the Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011, which is under the remit of the Minister for Justice, the owner management company must establish a scheme for annual service charges and a sinking fund for spending on refurbishment, improvement or maintenance of a non-recurring nature of the multi-unit development.</p><p>In the interest of supporting owners and residents living in developments where concerns regarding non-compliance with fire safety requirements have arisen, the Framework for Enhancing Fire Safety in Dwellings was published in 2017. It is intended to be used as a guide for the owners and occupants of dwellings (houses and apartments) where fire safety deficiencies have been identified, or are a cause for concern, to develop strategies to improve fire safety and to develop strategies to enable continued occupation in advance of undertaking the necessary works to ensure compliance with the relevant Building Regulations. The Framework is available at the following link: <i>.</i></p><p>Separately, the ongoing building control reform agenda, with its many initiatives, already provides a comprehensive roadmap for embedding a culture of real compliance within the construction industry. The reform agenda includes:</p><p>- Amendments made to the Building Control Regulations;</p><p>- Establishment of the National Building Control Office; and</p><p>- The ongoing development of new legislation through the Building Control (Construction Industry Register Ireland) Bill.</p><p>Now, if/when issues arise whether pre, during or post construction, it is clear who has held the designated roles and who is responsible for addressing the issues. This facilitates and simplifies the inspection, implementation and enforcement role of Building Control Authorities.</p></reply>

The main interaction between the LDA and local authorities is based on collaborative arrangements. The Bill specifically provides for the LDA to deliver services to local authorities at the request of the local authority including to deliver social and affordable housing on local authority lands. The majority of such lands will remain in local authority ownership post development in this case.</p>  <p>  The Bill also permits the LDA to purchase local authority lands where a local authority has decided to put lands up for sale. As with all proposed sales of lands suitable for housing by public bodies, the LDA Bill requires that the LDA be offered 'first refusal' to purchase such lands. This situation would only arise where the local authority has decided not to develop the lands for their own functions.</p></reply>

Data on the status of the Mussel in the Blackwater, including its current distribution and abundance, is incomplete. However some recent surveys of parts of the river found more mussels than were previously known in the main channel of the river.</p>  <p>  It is agreed that significant further work is required. The necessary survey work would likely require 2 years to complete, given the need for a period of reasonable weather to arrive at suitable river conditions for survey work to succeed. It will require additional expert resources in my Department to commission survey work, and possibly to work in collaboration with other interested parties; and this requirement is being addressed at this time.</p></reply>

The Code is overseen by an Interim Regulatory Committee supported by a Regulation Office based in the Housing Agency.</p>  <p>  The Regulation Office operates a risk-based approach to regulation. In line with pre-determined risk factors, the Regulation Office evaluates all approved housing bodies (AHBs) against these factors in order to prioritise its resources. This is a vital element in determining which AHBs are assessed in the annual assessment cycle.</p>  <p>  In total, 109 regulatory returns were submitted in 2020. These consisted of 86 Annual Regulatory Returns and 23 Engagement Returns (issued to organisations already in Engagement with the Regulation Office). A further 177 AHBs which were not selected for assessment submitted a Charter of Commitment reaffirming their commitment to the Voluntary Regulatory Framework.</p>  <p>  The Regulation Office is currently carrying out its assessment of the returns submitted for 2020. It is anticipated that this process will complete in April 2021. Where compliance issues have been identified, these are reported to each organisation individually in order that they may be addressed. If serious non-compliance issues are identified, the organisation may be entered into an Engagement process with the Regulation Office.  Information on compliance issues identified in the previous regulatory assessment cycle is published in the Regulation Office&rsquo;s 2019 Annual Report and Sectoral Analysis, available on the Housing Agency website. A similar analysis of the 2020 assessments will be published following completion of the current assessment cycle. The Regulation Office was contacted 76 times in 2020 in relation to Notifiable Events.</p>  <p>  The transition from voluntary to statutory regulation for AHBs is well underway. The Approved Housing Bodies Regulatory Authority (AHBRA) was formally established on 1 February 2021 to oversee the effective governance, financial management and performance of all AHBs. It is anticipated that the AHBRA will become fully operational in 2022. This is to allow the Regulator sufficient time to determine its strategy and adopt the standards by which AHBs will be assessed. This process will involve consultation with relevant stakeholders.</p></reply>

However, I understand that the Department&rsquo;s view is that the origins and associations of the pillar are unlikely to relate to burials.</p>  <p>  While there is insufficient evidence at this point for the marker to be recorded as an archaeological monument, I understand that the Department has given guidance to assist local investigations to find out more about it and will also be happy to provide advice on any such further information that may come to light.</p>  <p>  If the group that has raised the matter with my Department wishes to arrange an archaeological assessment of the site, its best course would be to contact the landowners, and, if the latter are agreeable, to then submit the necessary license application to the Department for consideration under the National Monuments Acts.</p></reply>

Funding in this regard has been increasing year on year to support this scheme.</p>  <p>  It was acknowledged that some local authorities had contractual commitments during last year&rsquo;s allocation process, therefore, contingency was built into the allocations in 2020 of &euro;2.5m.  This was included to ensure local authorities were not placed in a difficult financial situation and it was left open for them to apply for additional funding in respect of contractual commitments.</p>  <p>  A number of local authorities availed of these additional supports and DPG funding for 2020 was fully exhausted.</p>  <p>  It is envisaged that a similar approach will be taken this year. My Department will be contacting local authorities in the coming weeks to identify commitments carried forward from 2020 so that these works can be considered as part of the 2021 funding process and an appropriate allocation provided. It is a matter for each local authority to prioritise the works required under the scheme in the context of available funding and in line with the terms of the DPG scheme.</p></reply>

The Scheme is open to eligible tenants, including joint tenants, of local authority houses that are available for sale under the Scheme. To be eligible, tenants must meet certain criteria, including having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum and having been in receipt of social housing support for at least one year.</p>  <p>  The minimum reckonable income for eligibility under the scheme is determined by the relevant local authority in accordance with the detailed provisions of the Ministerial Direction issued under Sections 24(3) and (4) of the 2014 Act. In the determination of the minimum reckonable income, local authorities can include income from a number of different sources and classes, such as from employment, private pensions, maintenance payments and certain social welfare payments, including pensions, where the social welfare payment is secondary to employment income.</p>  <p>  In determining reckonable income, the income of all tenants of the house, including adult children that are joint tenants, is included, as is the income of the spouse, civil partner or other partner / co-habitant of a tenant who lives in the house with them, thus ensuring the appropriate level of discount is applied to the purchase price.</p>  <p>  The minimum income criterion was introduced in order to ensure the sustainability of the scheme.  Applicants must demonstrate that they have an income that is long-term and sustainable in nature. This ensures that the tenant purchasing the house is in a financial position, as the owner, to maintain and insure the property for the duration of the charged period, in compliance with the conditions of the order transferring the ownership of, and responsibility for, the house from the local authority to the tenant.</p>  <p>  A review of the first 12 months of the Scheme&rsquo;s operation has been undertaken. In addition, the Programme for Government commits to maintaining the right of social housing tenants to purchase their own home with some changes to eligibility. The review and the commitments in the Programme for Government are being examined as part of the work on the broader social housing reform agenda. I expect to be in a position to publish the review and finalise changes to the Scheme once the work on these reform measures is complete.</p></reply>

On 22 December 2020, Government approved the priority drafting of the Affordable Housing Bill 2020, the General Scheme of which I published on 20 January last.</p>  <p>  The Bill includes provisions to underpin three schemes which will prioritise the increased supply of affordable homes through (1) affordable homes delivered by local authorities utilising the Serviced Sites Fund, (2) a new affordable purchase shared equity scheme for private homes, and (3) the introduction of a new form of tenure in Cost Rental.</p>  <p>  Budget 2021 allocated &euro;75 million for the affordable housing shared equity scheme to be introduced later this year.  The scheme will be targeted at first time buyers of new build homes who would otherwise not be in a position to buy a home. The detailed design aspects of the scheme, including eligibility criteria and price caps, is currently ongoing, and will be informed by our continued engagement with all relevant stakeholders.</p></reply>

The scheme was informed by the work of an Expert Panel and the current maximum grant amounts payable under the scheme were finalised in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  This process also took account of the comprehensive engagement that took place between my Department and both Donegal and Mayo County Councils, who operate and administer the scheme.</p>  <p>  The scheme outlines five remedial options ranging from rebuilding on existing foundations to replacing of external walls. The maximum approved costs per dwelling under the scheme are significant and range from &euro;275,000 to &euro;55,000 depending on the remedial option.</p>  <p>  Limits such as these have to be a feature of grant schemes to ensure that the schemes can be budgeted for with the potential financial liability known at all times and also to ensure that the available budget can benefit the majority of properties and the maximum number of people.</p>  <p>  As the application process only opened in June 2020 it would be premature to consider or make any changes to the scheme at this time. I am keeping progress on the scheme under review and engaging with both the local authorities and local action groups on the matter.</p></reply>

The guidance is also a useful reference for service providers working in the sector, highlighting where they can be of greatest assistance to their clients, covering a range of scenarios that may arise for victims of domestic violence currently in receipt of social housing support and those seeking social housing supports.  These include provisions whereby a household may transfer out of their existing tenancy and into a new tenancy agreement with the local authority or they may access an independent tenancy in the private rented sector utilising the various housing supports offered by the State.</p>  <p>  In relation to entitlement to a Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) package, in order to qualify for HAP, a household must be qualified for social housing support by their local authority, which means the household must qualify to go on the local authority housing waiting list. HAP tenants find their own accommodation in the private rented market and are advised that this accommodation should be within the HAP rent limits provided to them by the local authority.</p>  <p>  The guidance document outlines that victims of domestic violence that had been in a joint local authority tenancy can be eligible for re-entry to the waiting list where a deed of separation is in place. Where such a deed does not exist housing authorities may use discretion to allow applications, the guidance document does not address whether the spouse should remain at home while the victim has been forced to leave. </p>  <p>  A housing authority may also provide short-term emergency housing to persons who are unable to return to their homes because of domestic violence on a humanitarian basis without having to assess their eligibility for social housing support or include them on the authority&rsquo;s waiting list for housing supports.</p>  <p>  The guidance was introduced with the objective of supporting a partnership approach by statutory agencies in respect of the delivery of domestic violence services, particularly in relation to helping to prevent and reduce the occurrence of related homelessness and facilitating the provision of long term accommodation for victims of domestic violence. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, Section 3 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1997 provides that a local authority tenant can apply to the District Court for an excluding order against a person, including a joint tenant, who is engaging in anti-social behaviour.  A housing authority may also apply for the excluding order where it believes that the tenant is deterred or prevented by violence, threat or fear, either to himself or herself or to persons associated with him or her, from pursuing an application for an excluding order.  Anti-social behaviour for this purpose is defined to include any behaviour which causes or is likely to cause any significant or persistent danger, injury, damage, alarm, loss or fear to any person in the house, including violence, threats, intimidation, coercion, harassment or serious obstruction of any person and behaviour which causes any significant or persistent impairment of a person&rsquo;s use or enjoyment of his/her home.</p></reply>

On 22 December 2020, Government approved the priority drafting of the Affordable Housing Bill 2020, the General Scheme of which I published on 20 January last.</p>  <p>  The Bill includes provisions to underpin three schemes which will prioritise the increased supply of affordable homes through (1) affordable homes delivered by local authorities utilising the Serviced Sites Fund,  (2) a new affordable purchase shared equity scheme for private homes, and (3) the introduction of a new form of tenure in Cost Rental. </p>  <p>  The statutory basis for the delivery of affordable housing for purchase by local authorities is Part 5 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009.  To support the delivery of these, &euro;310 million is made available under the Serviced Sites Fund (SSF) to provide facilitating infrastructure on local authority lands. With a maximum of &euro;50,000 funding available per home, at least 6,200 affordable homes, to buy or rent, can be facilitated under the fund.  To date, Serviced Sites Funding of almost &euro;188 million has been approved in principle in support of 38 projects in 14 local authority areas, which will assist in the delivery of approximately 4,000 affordable homes.</p>  <p>  All SSF proposals are considered on the basis of economic analyses submitted by local authorities. These are undertaken to confirm affordability challenges in a given area, project viability, and the local authority's ability to deliver affordable homes with at least a 10% discount on open market values.  To date, economic assessments of Cavan and Monaghan have not provided a basis for SSF applications.</p>  <p>  In relation to the Affordable Purchase Shared Equity scheme announced in Budget 2021 (for private developments), provisions for this measure formed part of the Affordable Housing Bill.  This scheme will be targeted at first time buyers of new build homes who would otherwise not be in a position to buy a home. The detailed design aspects of the scheme, including eligibility criteria and price caps, is currently ongoing, and will be informed by our continued engagement with all relevant stakeholders.   However, I can confirm that it is anticipated that this scheme will be available on a national basis to eligible households.</p>  <p>  In addition to these measures, both the Rebuilding Ireland Homeloan and the Help to Buy Scheme are other affordability measures available to eligible households seeking to purchase homes.</p></reply>

Each local authority must have in place a credit committee and it is a matter for the committee to make the decision on applications for loans, in accordance with the regulations, having regard to the recommendations made by the Housing Agency.</p><p>The most recent figures, as at the end of January 2021, from the Agency on the numbers of applications that it has assessed and recommended for approval/decline for Cavan County Council and Monaghan County Council since the scheme began, are included in the below table:</p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th>Local    Authority</th>       <th>Applications    Assessed</th>       <th>Recommended    to Approve</th>       <th>Recommended    to Decline</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><div>Cavan County Council</div></td>       <td><div>30</div></td>       <td><div>11</div></td>       <td><div>19</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><div>Monaghan County Council</div></td>       <td><div>94</div></td>       <td><div>28</div></td>       <td><div>66</div></td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The next stages in the process are approval and drawdown from the local authority. </p><p>My Department regularly publishes information on the number and value of (i) local authority loan approvals and (ii) local authority loan drawdowns.

This meant that for eligible businesses their commercial rates were funded by Government for nine months of 2020.  This was an unprecedented measure, which offered support to businesses and financial certainty to local authorities.   </p>  <p>  The waiver applied to the majority of ratepayers, with a small number of categories excluded, such as utilities, banks, large supermarkets and corporates, whose businesses had not generally been as severely impacted by the pandemic.  However, in acknowledgement that some ratepayers in the excluded categories may have closed during the initial period of the public health restrictions or were otherwise adversely affected, ratepayers in these categories may also have been eligible, if they could demonstrate that the pandemic had a significant negative impact on their business.  Ratepayers were advised to engage with directly their local authority in this regard.</p>  <p>  Payments to the local authorities in respect of the 2020 waiver were completed in early 2021. A total of approximately &euro;730m was distributed among the 31 local authorities. </p>  <p>  Cavan County Council received a total of &euro;5,968,334.74 for approximately 1689 accounts, with 4 valid appeals. </p>  <p>  Monaghan County Council received a total of &euro;6,137,861.96 for approximately 2040 accounts, with 5 valid appeals. </p>  <p>  In order to continue supporting businesses and other ratepayers, and in recognition of the ongoing impacts of  COVID 19 and the associated public health restrictions, the Government recently announced that a more targeted commercial rates waiver will be applied in the first quarter of 2021 to businesses most seriously affected by ongoing restrictions. &euro;160 million has been allocated to meet the cost of this waiver and details were issued to local authorities on 27 January 2021.  Automatic eligibility is extended to retail, hospitality including hotels, pubs and restaurants, leisure and entertainment, personal services such as hairdressers and barbers, health services and various other categories.  Businesses in other sectors may engage directly with their local authorities if they can demonstrate serious financial impact and may also qualify for this waiver.</p></reply>

In order for a household to qualify for HAP, they must first be assessed as eligible for social housing support by their local authority. Any household assessed as eligible for social housing is immediately eligible for HAP and those households must source their own accommodation in the private rental sector. At the end of Quarter 3, 2020, Mayo had 1,345 households in receipt of HAP. </p><p>RAS places responsibility on local authorities to meet the accommodation needs of people who are in receipt of Rent Supplement for 18 months or longer, and who are assessed as having a long-term housing need. The scheme is delivered by local authorities who source accommodation from the private market and from Approved Housing Bodies. Prior to their transfer, households awaiting RAS continue to be supported by the Rent Supplement Scheme. At the end of Quarter 3, 2020, there were 802 tenancies supported under RAS in Co. Mayo.</p><p>Details on the number of households qualified for social housing support in each local authority area is provided in the annual statutory Summary of Social Housing Assessments (SSHA). The most recent summary, conducted in June 2019, shows that 68,693 households were assessed as qualified for and being in need of social housing support. It should be noted that due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the 2020 assessment was delayed and conducted in November. Work is ongoing and the summary report of the 2020 assessment will be published in due course.</p><p>Full details in relation to the 2019 assessment are available on my Department's website at the following link: <i>www.gov.ie/en/publication/29da7-summary-of-social-housing-assessments-2019-key-findings</i>/ .The SSHA 2019 shows that there were 1,205 households on the Mayo County Council social housing waiting list.</p><p>For those households on a housing waiting list, the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 requires that all housing authorities make an allocation scheme determining the order of priority to be accorded in the allocation of dwellings to households qualified for social housing support and to households approved for a transfer.</p><p>Legislation also provides that both HAP and RAS are considered to be forms of social housing support. Households in receipt of HAP and RAS are, therefore, not eligible to remain on the main housing waiting list. However, acknowledging that some households on the waiting list, who avail of HAP and RAS, have expectations that they would receive a more traditional form of social housing support, recipients can avail of a move to other forms of social housing through a transfer list.</p><p>The practical operation of transfer lists is a matter for each local authority to manage, on the basis of their own scheme of letting priorities, and the number of persons on the housing transfer list is also a matter for each individual local authority.</p><p>HAP and RAS continue to be effective and secure forms of social housing support, and remain a significant part of the suite of social housing options currently available across the country.</p></reply>

AHBs signed up to the Code must demonstrate commitment to and engagement with the Code and the Standards.  The Code is overseen by an Interim Regulatory Committee supported by a Regulation Office based in the Housing Agency. Residents who may have concerns regarding the corporate governance at an AHB should, in the first instance, contact the Regulation Office. </p><p>The transition from voluntary to statutory regulation for AHBs is well underway. The Approved Housing Bodies Regulatory Authority (AHBRA) was formally established on 1 February 2021. This new, independent body will oversee the effective governance, financial management and performance of all AHBs. </p><p>The Regulator will have responsibility for, <i>inter alia</i>, establishing and maintaining a register of AHBs; preparing standards by which AHBs will be monitored and assessed; encouraging and facilitating the better governance, administration and management, including corporate governance and financial management, of AHBs. The Regulator will also have powers to carry out investigations and cancel the registration of AHBs. </p><p>It is anticipated that the AHBRA will become fully operational in 2022. This is to allow the Regulator sufficient time to determine its strategy and adopt the standards by which AHBs will be assessed. This process will involve consultation with relevant stakeholders.</p></reply>

It is important to note that the limits introduced at that time also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.</p><p>Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support. The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources.</p><p>However, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is underway. The review will also have regard to current initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and cost rental and will be completed when the impacts of these parallel initiatives have been considered.</p></reply>

I have also outlined Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring continued humanitarian support to the most vulnerable communities in Myanmar, including internally displaced persons.</p>  <p>  My Department provides development cooperation funding to support the livelihood and resilience of vulnerable communities in Myanmar. In particular, funding support has been provided to strengthen food and nutrition security, and in response to humanitarian needs in Rakhine State. We will continue to review the situation with our implementing partners to ensure that Irish funds are utilised where they are needed most. </p>  <p>  It is important that the authorities in Myanmar respond appropriately to these events and that people in Myanmar are free to peacefully and safely express their views. It is vitally important that the military in Myanmar exercise restraint.</p>  <p>  I welcome the united position taken by the UN Security Council in this matter and Ireland will continue to work with our partners on the Council and with countries in the region in response to this crisis. </p>  <p>  Ireland, the EU and other partners are urgently working together to develop an appropriate response.  This was evident at the Human Rights Council where an EU and UK-led resolution was adopted unanimously at a special session of the Council on 12 February.   The comprehensive Resolution addresses the many human rights issues at stake in Myanmar and calls on the Myanmar military to take action to remedy them. The consensus shown by the Human Rights Council is a significant and positive signal of accord on this issue within the international community. The EU will continue to shine a spotlight on the situation by leading a further Resolution at the forthcoming session of the Human Rights Council, which begins on 22 February. This will renew the mandate of the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar.</p>  <p>  In other fora, Ireland continues to work with EU partners and other like-minded countries in responding to the events since 1 February and is committed to ensuring that any course of action is appropriate; works to restore the democratic path in Myanmar and does not negatively impact developmental gains or exacerbate the humanitarian situation. At a political level, Myanmar will be a point of discussion at the Foreign Affairs Council next week. </p>  <p>  Ireland, along with our EU colleagues, has been a steadfast supporter of Myanmar&rsquo;s civilian and democratic transition, its peace process and national reconciliation, and its inclusive socio-economic development. These are roles we want to continue to assume during this challenging period.</p></reply>

At present, there are 27,000 applications in the Foreign Births Registration (FBR) system that are awaiting processing. </p>  <p>  The Passport Service has paused the processing of FBR applications as Ireland is at Level 5 of the National Framework for Living with COVID-19.  Applications that have been sent to the FBR team are being held securely and will be processed when normal services resume at Level 3 of the Framework.</p>  <p>  The impact of Brexit on applications for Foreign Birth Registration has been significant. In 2014, approximately 10,000 applications were received. In 2019, approximately 32,000 were received. Applicants resident in Great Britain account for around half of all applications. Prior to the introduction of the current restrictions, FBR applications were taking 12 to 18 months to process.</p>  <p>  Foreign Births Registration, by its nature, can be a detailed and complex process, often involving official documentation related to three generations and issued by several jurisdictions.</p>  <p>  The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in two periods in 2020 where processing of Foreign Birth Registrations was paused to assist with other essential work such as providing Consular Assistance to Irish citizens overseas. This resulted in 26 weeks of 2020 where the processing of FBR applications was paused.  </p>  <p>  In spite of the pausing of the service, 12,413 people were entered on the Foreign Births Register in 2020. Processing for normal FBR applications has not yet resumed in 2021.</p>  <p>  With additional resources, the Department is working to reduce these arrears in 2021 and thereby improve the delivery period for this service.</p>  <p>  On the question of a delay to completing the registrations potentially impacting on the rights of a person, my Department operates a clear and transparent general policy of processing FBR applications in order of receipt. However, we will consider urgent requests to expedite an application on a case by case basis. During Level 5 restrictions, applicants can make contact with the Passport Service through the WebChat service.</p></reply>

My Department has been closely following the situation, including in relation to reports of systemic abuse, torture, forced labour, forced sterilisations, and restrictions on freedom of religion and belief in the Province.</p>  <p>  We have been active in raising our concerns in relation to this matter. On 6 October 2020, Ireland was one of 39 countries to support a Joint Statement at the UN Third Committee which reiterates our grave concern and recalls the exceptional letter of concern issued by 50 UN Special Procedures mandate holders, which called on China to respect human rights and allow, immediate, meaningful, and unfettered access to Xinjiang.</p>  <p>  Ireland also raised this matter during our national statement at the UN Human Rights Council on 25 September, where we urged China to allow unrestricted access to the region for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.</p>  <p>  Ireland has also previously supported a number of statements at the UN Human Rights Council, in June 2020 and July 2019, and at the UN Third Committee in October 2019. These statements, among other things, urged China to urgently implement the eight recommendations made by the Committee for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination related to Xinjiang, and to uphold its international obligations and respect human rights in Xinjiang. They also called on the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to provide regular information on the situation in the region, in order to safeguard the rights and freedoms that are guaranteed under international law. </p>  <p>  In addition to this, the EU has raised this matter with Chinese authorities directly on a number of occasions. Most recently, High Representative Borrell raised our strong concerns regarding the treatment of ethnic and religious minorities in Xinjiang with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in a videoconference on 8 February. The deterioration of the human rights situation, including the treatment of minorities in Xinjiang, was also raised by EU leaders with China on 14 September, and also during the EU-China Summit on 22 June. </p>  <p>  The protection and promotion of human rights is a core pillar of Ireland's foreign policy, and Ireland will continue to monitor and assess the situation and, along with our EU partners, engage with Chinese authorities bilaterally and in multilateral fora to address our concerns.</p></reply>

A critical pillar of this initiative, COVAX, aims to deliver 2 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines by the end of 2021 to support 92 low and middle-income countries, and has negotiated options on a further 1 billion doses.

Passport Service staff have been temporarily reassigned to provide consular assistance for Irish citizens overseas.</p>  <p>  The Passport Service continues to provide an emergency passport service for Irish citizens at home and abroad. The service is available for those who are required to travel due to the death or serious illness of a family member or because the applicant requires emergency medical treatment.</p>  <p>  Applicants who require a passport for emergency purposes, or to travel for urgent reasons, should contact the Passport Service via our Customer Service Hub Webchat function on our website.</p>  <p>  The Passport Service has a comprehensive plan in place to provide a safe place of work at all Levels of the National Framework for Living with COVID-19. At Level 5, in line with Government guidance that only essential work should take place, the Passport Service provides an emergency and urgent service. At Level 4, the Passport Service will resume processing Passport Online applications with staff assigned into two teams and working at a strict social distance to ensure sufficient resilience to deliver the service. At Level 3, all staff are required to work at a strict social distance and the processing of paper based applications and Foreign Birth Registrations, which require greater interaction between staff, resume. At Level 1, the public counter of the Passport Service will re-open.</p>  <p>  The Passport Online system has improved the ability of the Passport Service to process applications more efficiently. When the service resumed operations in June 2020, the backlog for Passport Online applications was cleared in 4 weeks. Between 1 December and 23 December, all Passport Online simple renewal applications were processed and most complex renewals were processed. First time applications are more complex and take more time to process.</p>  <p>  There is no requirement, at this time, to allocate additional staff to the Passport Service. Similar to all work places, social distancing is required so this limits the occupation of buildings but my Department has been working closely with the Office of Public Works on this matter.</p></reply>

The new Regulation represents a significant development in the EU sanctions regime. For the first time, the EU is equipping itself with a framework that will allow it to target individuals, entities and bodies &ndash; including state and non-state actors &ndash; responsible for, involved in or associated with serious human rights violations and abuses worldwide, no matter where they occurred. This global regime will coexist with country-specific sanctions regimes &ndash; such as those against Belarus and Russia. </p><p>  The framework for targeted restrictive measures applies to acts such as genocide, crimes against humanity and other serious human rights violations or abuses (including torture, slavery, extrajudicial killings, arbitrary arrests or detentions). Other human rights violations or abuses can also fall under the scope of the sanctions regime where those violations or abuses are widespread, systematic or are otherwise of serious concern as regards the objectives of the Common Foreign and Security Policy of the EU.  It will be for the Council, acting upon a proposal from a Member State or from the High Representative of the EU for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, to establish, review and amend the sanctions list.</p><p>  The direct implications for Ireland are that we will be obliged to implement sanctions as listings are decided within the framework of the regime. The regime will target individuals and entities and may involve the imposition of travel bans and the freezing of assets/funds, which may be located in Ireland. Ireland may also be called on to grant humanitarian derogations under the regime, which confers this function upon Member States&rsquo; competent authorities.</p><p>  Ireland is extremely supportive of the new regime and believes it will be a useful addition to the EU&rsquo;s human rights toolbox. . It will provide the EU with greater flexibility to target those responsible for serious human rights violations and abuses. It sends a strong message that the EU is a leader in protecting human rights and is willing to take concrete actions to ensure this.</p></reply>

The conflict has had a devastating impact on the population of Tigray, and poses severe risks to the stability of the wider Horn of Africa region.  </p>  <p>  Since the outbreak of hostilities in Tigray, there have been allegations of war crimes and of crimes against humanity.  Ireland strongly support calls by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights for independent, impartial, thorough and transparent investigations into these allegations, to ensure accountability and, where appropriate, justice.</p>  <p>  Ireland support the EU&rsquo;s call for the withdrawal of Eritrean troops from Ethiopia, whose presence remains a barrier to humanitarian access and is linked to alleged atrocities. Ireland is strongly supportive of regional efforts to try to find a resolution to the crisis in Tigray, including the work of three African Union Special Envoys.</p>  <p>  Ireland raised the Tigray situation at the UN Security Council on 3 February, expressing deep concern at the humanitarian situation in Tigray and calling for unhindered humanitarian access. Ireland also called on all parties in Tigray to comply with their obligations under international humanitarian law and human rights law including those related to the protection of civilians and prevention of sexual and gender-based violence.  Ireland will continue to advocate for an urgent response to the humanitarian situation, and for a peaceful resolution to the conflict through bilateral engagement, our EU membership and at the UN Security Council.</p>  <p>  In his contacts with key interlocutors, Minister Coveney calls on all parties to cease hostilities, respect international humanitarian law and begin dialogue, as well as for immediate and unhindered humanitarian access to affected areas. He has condemned reported atrocities and identity-based attacks, and has called for the human rights of all Ethiopians to be upheld. The Minister continues to engage with key EU, regional and other actors in this regard, including in Addis Ababa, Nairobi and Pretoria.</p>  <p>  My Department, through Irish Aid, has provided over &euro;2.6 million to date to support the humanitarian response to the Tigray crisis. This includes &euro;1.4 million to Irish NGOs within Tigray, &euro;500,000 to the UN refugee agency to support the refugee response in neighbouring Sudan, and almost &euro;750,000 towards humanitarian stocks, and supports for the protection of women and girls. </p></reply>

The Government quadrupled funding to the World Health Organisation (WHO) in 2020, given its role as lead UN agency for health and co-host of the Access to Covid-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, which has the COVAX facility as a centerpiece.

The EDP builds on the intentions set out in the White Paper in relation to equipment acquisition, modernisation and upgrade and has been developed to ensure that the Defence Forces have the major equipment platforms, ancillary equipment and force protection equipment to carry out their important roles both at home and overseas.</p><p>The Defence Forces operate a Crash Rescue Service based at Casement Aerodrome Baldonnel which is required for airfield operations.Details of the amounts spent on contracts awarded from 2019 to date for the renewal of specialist fire service vehicles for the Air Corps are set out in tabular form below:</p><p><b>Tabular Statement: Specialist Fire Service Vehicles for the Air Corps 2019 to 2021</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th>Item </th>       <th>Company  </th>       <th>Amount Spent Inclusive of VAT</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>4x4 RIFT Scania </td>       <td>High Precision Motor Products (HPMP) Ltd.</td>       <td>&euro;332,100</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020</td>       <td>Rosenbauer Panther 6x6 Airport Fire Tenders </td>       <td>Rosenbauer UK Ltd</td>       <td>&euro;1,815,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021 (to date)</td>       <td>N/A </td>       <td>N/A </td>       <td>Nil </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>A contract was placed in 2019 with High Precision Motor Products (HPMP) Ltd. under an Office of Government Procurement (OGP) Framework Agreement for the supply of a Rapid Intervention Fire Tender (RIFT) at &euro;424,810.20 inclusive of VAT). In 2019 &euro;332,100 (incl. VAT) was paid for the Compressed Air Foam System (CAFS) and gantry ladders associated with the fire tender. The remaining sum of &euro;92,710.20 (incl. VAT) will be paid on delivery of the RIFT which is expected in March 2021. The delivery into service of the RIFT vehicle will augment the existing capability of the Air Corps Fire and Rescue Service at Casement Aerodrome Baldonnel.  </p><p>In 2020 following an open tender competition a contract was awarded to Rosenbauer UK Ltd. for the supply of  two (2) new Rosenbauer Panther 6x6 Airport Fire Tenders, due to be delivered by end of February 2021 to replace existing aging Airport 6x6 Fire Tenders. The total cost of these vehicles is &euro;2.35m inclusive of VAT. </p><p>The expected service life of these types of appliances is 15-20 years. I am satisfied that, with these new acquisitions and the planning for future procurements, the Defence Forces continue to have the necessary modern and effective range of equipment available to them in order to fulfil all roles assigned to them by Government.</p></reply>

To this end, it is vital the age and health profile of personnel be such as to ensure that operational capability and effectiveness are not compromised in any way.</p><p>The age and fitness profile of the Permanent Defence Force was an issue of serious concern during the 1990's and was the subject of severe criticism in a series of external reports. One of the key areas identified for urgent action was the development of a manpower policy with an emphasis on lowering the age profile of Permanent Defence Force personnel. </p><p>As a result, new terms and conditions were introduced for personnel enlisting after 1 January 1994 and new contracts for enlisted personnel were for a period of five years&rsquo; service. Since that time, the maximum period of service has been extended out to twenty-one years for line Privates and Corporals. </p><p>In 2015, following an adjudication in the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for PDF members, Privates and Corporals in receipt of Tech Pay Group 3 or higher may be extended to age 50 subject to meeting certain criteria for continuance in service. A review of contracts of service for Line Corporals and Privates and Corporals in receipt of Technical Pay 1 and 2 was recommended. </p><p>An agreement was subsequently reached with PDFORRA in 2019 that all Privates and Corporals recruited post 1994, be allowed to continue in service to 31 December 2022 (or until they reach the age of 50), provided these personnel met certain criteria during the interim period, including medical grades and fitness tests. This agreement was subsequently extended to include post 1994 Sergeants, who also could continue in service to the same date, subject to their meeting agreed criteria in the interim period. </p><p>The High Level Plan- &quot;<i>Strengthening Our Defence Forces</i>&quot; provides for actions or projects to be undertaken to deliver on the Public Service Pay Commission (PSPC) recommendations. A project to consider options to tackle barriers to extended participation in the PDF (including the possibility of extending retirement ages for members of the PDF) is underway.</p><p>This project is divided into two phases. The first phase, focusing on reviewing mandatory retirement ages for Officers and the second phase to review contracts of service for enlisted personnel.</p><p>As this review is currently underway,  it would be inappropriate to pre-empt any recommendations that may arise. </p><p>Under the terms and conditions of the scheme to re-enlist former PDF personnel introduced last April, individuals who wish to re-enlist will serve for a specific period and for a specific purpose which will involve the use of a particular skill or area of expertise which cannot currently be met through the use of existing military resources. Individuals will be required to be able to serve the duration of their contract within the age limits currently set, and additionally meet a range of general eligibility criteria including medical assessments to ensure they are capable of performing normal military duties. </p></reply>

In this regard, the full spectrum of Defence Forces personnel and equipment, commensurate with operational requirements, is made available for deployments, within current means and capabilities, as the need arises.</p><p>At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, a Joint Task Force was established to coordinate the Defence Forces contribution to the whole-of-Government COVID-19 response. It has the authority to draw together, in a joint manner, the contribution of all of the elements of the Defence Forces &ndash; Army, Air Corps, Naval Service, Reserve, etc. This was provided for in a Defence Forces Regulation signed by and under the authority of the Minister for Defence.</p><p>The Defence Forces Joint Task Force is based in McKee Barracks and its priority from the beginning has been to provide support to the HSE, while retaining, at all times, a contingent capacity to provide Aid to the Civil Power support.  The wide range of supports that the Defence Forces have provided to the HSE, as coordinated by the Joint Task Force during the COVID-19 crisis include:</p><p>-  operation of the COVID-19 testing centre at the Aviva stadium; </p><p>-  support for contact tracing efforts;</p><p>-  transportation by the Air Corps of COVID-19 tests to Germany;</p><p>-  collection of PPE from more than 260 cargo flights and the ongoing storage and distribution of this PPE to various HSE sites;</p><p>-  support for HSE testing efforts including through deployment of Naval Service vessels to Dublin, Cork and Galway; </p><p>-  PPE training to workers at Cork and Waterford harbours by Naval service personnel;</p><p>-  provision of tentage and marshalling support at various HSE testing sites around the country;</p><p>-  transportation of patients for testing;</p><p>-  assistance with the fit out of temporary facilities for the HSE (for example, the HSE facilities at City West and the University of Limerick);</p><p>-  production and assembly of PPE using 3D printing facilities; and</p><p>-  the use of lands at Ballymullen Barracks as a COVID-19 testing facility and contact tracing hub.</p><p>In addition to supporting the HSE, the Defence Forces have also provided a broad range of supports to other Departments and Agencies.  Provision of this support was also coordinated by the Joint Task Force.  Examples include: </p><p>-  Support has been provided to the National Ambulance Service through Defence Forces ambulance and crew supports along with tele-triage supports.</p><p>-  Support to the Office of Government Procurement through assistance with storage and distribution of PPE.</p><p>-  Support to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government through the use of lands at Sarsfields Barracks for the location of one of the National Temporary Body Storage Facilities. The Defence Forces were also on standby to provide support if required at the Dublin based National Temporary Body Storage Facility at the Royal Hospital Kilmainham.</p><p>More recently, at the request of the HSE, the Defence Forces have provided a range of non clinical and administrative supports in a number of residential care home facilities.The table outlined below provides the breakdown of the number of Defence Forces personnel deployed to provide supports in private and public nursing homes by county over the past 12 months up to 11 February 2021: </p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th>County Breakdown </th>       <th>Number of DF deployed (in man days)</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Offaly</td>       <td>11 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Meath</td>       <td>29</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cavan</td>       <td>8</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork</td>       <td>480</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick</td>       <td>228</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Clare</td>       <td>224</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total man-days</td>       <td>980</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The Defence Forces are currently deployed to provide supports at two residential care homes in Cork.</p></reply>

I have also extended the Employee Assistance Service to all school staff including caretakers. </p>  <p>  The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under grant schemes. Where a school employs a staff member to support those functions those staff are employees of individual schools and responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school.</p>  <p>  On foot of a Chairman&rsquo;s Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department implemented the 2015 recommendations of an independent arbitrator. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period. This arbitration agreement covered the period up to 31 December 2019 and has been fully implemented. </p>  <p>  The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a secretary or caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration has from 1 January 2019 been paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay. </p>  <p>  F&oacute;rsa trade union has tabled a follow-on claim from the 2015 agreement. Officials from my Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and School Management Bodies have been engaging with F&oacute;rsa on the claim, most recently on 27th of October 2020 under the auspices of the Workplace Relations Commission. </p>  <p>  At that meeting it was agreed that further discussions would be held under the auspices of the WRC with a view to assessing the individual elements comprising the totality of the union&rsquo;s claims.  It is noted that these WRC discussions are taking place within the context of recent D&aacute;il comments concerning the regularisation of pay, conditions of employment and pension provision of school secretaries and caretakers.  </p>  <p>  I welcome and support the continued meaningful dialogue between the parties with a view to reaching an agreed outcome.</p></reply>

Enabling children with special educational needs to receive an education appropriate to their needs is a priority of the Department. In budget 2021, more than 20% of the total Education Budget or &euro;2bn will be invested in supporting children with special needs, an increase from &euro;1.9bn last year.</p><p>The Department's policy is that children with special educational needs access appropriate education intervention in mainstream settings where possible. Many deaf or hard of hearing pupils are included in mainstream classes at primary and post-primary level. Whilst other children who are deaf or hard of hearing and have more complex needs may attend special schools or classes, which have lower pupil teacher ratios. </p><p>Funding is provided by the Department for a weekly home tuition service whereby tutors visit the homes of deaf and hard of hearing preschool children and school-going pupils to provide training in ISL for these children and their families including their grandparents.</p><p>Many students who are deaf/hard of hearing learn ISL to support their communication needs but ISL isn&rsquo;t their primary language. These students and their families can also avail of the ISL Tuition Scheme.</p><p>The total cost of this ISL tuition scheme is in the region of &euro; 310,000 annually, with approximately 240 children and their families supported under the scheme by approximately 72 tutors. </p><p>The scheme is available to deaf / hard of hearing children from diagnosis to leaving post primary school, details on how to apply can be found on the Department&rsquo;s website through the following link: <i>www.education.ie/en/Parents/Services/irish-sign-language-isl-/irish-sign-language-isl-tuition-scheme.html.</i></p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) published the Comprehensive Review of the SNA Scheme on 30th May 2018 and the Department has noted the contents of the report. The report recommends that ISL qualified assistants should be put in place to support deaf students whose primary language is ISL and that this should be aligned to the requirements of the Irish Sign Language Act 2017. This recommendation is under consideration at present for the introduction of this ISL scheme. </p><p>In the interim, these posts are filled, on a case by case basis by the NCSE who allocate a post with similar conditions as SNAs to enable the school to employ someone with an appropriate level of ISL proficiency to meet the needs of the child..</p><p>The Department also provides funding for assistive technology for pupils who are deaf or hard of hearing, equipment is provided under this scheme to enable students attend school and engage with the curriculum. </p><p>Reasonable accommodations and supports are made available to support children with special educational needs, including students who are deaf/hard of hearing, to participate in state exams.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) Support Service includes Visiting Teachers, who are qualified teachers with particular skills and knowledge of the development and education of children with varying degrees of hearing loss and/or visual impairment. They offer longitudinal support to children, their families and schools from the time of referral through to the end of post-primary education.</p><p>Each visiting teacher (VT) is responsible for a particular region and is allocated a caseload of students. The VT supports children/young people, parents, guardians, teachers and other professionals involved with the child.<b><i></i></b></p><p>The visiting teachers offer guidance in matters pertaining to the child&rsquo;s education and overall development and in helping the children to derive maximum benefit from the educational opportunities available.  </p><p>The NCSE also provides funding for individual teachers and whole school staff in mainstream schools, primary and post-primary, special schools, and special classes to undertake courses in ISL, which are available throughout the country through a variety of providers. The NCSE also provide continual professional development to teachers to enhance the quality of learning and teaching of students who are deaf or hard of hearing.  <i></i></p><p>A new undergraduate programme, Bachelor of Education (Irish Sign Language), commenced in 2019 in Dublin City University (DCU) which enables deaf and hard of hearing people who use Irish Sign Language (ISL) to enter primary teaching.</p><p>Previously, there was no entry route to primary teacher education for someone who communicates through ISL and could not meet the minimum entry requirement for Irish in Leaving Certificate. This B.Ed. allows ISL to be accepted as an alternative to Irish. It is an important step towards ensuring increased access and inclusion for all in the classroom.</p><p>It is envisaged that, when qualified, these students will teach in schools for the deaf or special classes in mainstream schools. These qualified teachers will have a high level of ability in ISL, in-depth knowledge of bilingual education and the ability to teach all of the curriculum subjects through ISL. It will further aid deaf children who use Irish Sign Language in primary school to fully access the curriculum by having teachers who are fluent ISL users. </p><p>The Teaching Council has approved accreditation of the Bachelor of Education (Irish Sign Language) programme.  This allowed the B.Ed. to accept ISL as an alternative to Irish for primary teaching from DCU.</p></reply>

I also announced that students will also have the alternative option of applying for grades accredited by the State Examinations Commission (SEC), to be known as SEC-Accredited Grades, which will be issued to students at the same time as the examination results. Students who receive grades from both processes will automatically be awarded the higher grade on a subject by subject basis. </p>  <p>  This decision follows intensive engagement with education stakeholders, both bilaterally and through the Advisory Group on Planning for State Examinations 2021.</p>  <p>  This decision announced ensures for every student a method to assess their learning and attainment at the end of their post-primary education and to progress to higher and further education, and the world of work.</p>  <p>  Putting in place both the examinations and a corresponding measure of SEC-Accredited Grades is essential to ensuring a fair system, having regard to the extraordinary circumstances of the pandemic and the loss of learning that has occurred for this group of students due to the interruption of in-person teaching and learning during the periods of school closure. </p>  <p>  Students will be required to register for the traditional examinations and/or to receive SEC Accredited Grades. Registration for both will take place through an online Student Portal operated by the SEC. Details regarding registration will be announced as soon as possible. </p>  <p>  The timetable for the written examinations in June will be published shortly by the State Examinations Commission.  As far as possible, access to these examinations will be provided for very high risk students.</p>  <p>  Schools will receive guidance, informed by public health advice, on organising examination centres for the June examinations.  </p>  <p>  Oral examinations will be held during the Easter holidays or shortly after. Practical examinations will be held in most of the subjects where these form a normal part of the examination. In some subjects the holding of practical examinations may not be possible for public health reasons and this will be advised as soon as possible. Guidance on projects will issue to schools and students shortly. </p>  <p>  Guidelines and further information on the process of SEC Accredited Grades will be published in the coming days. This will include a full guide for schools and an explanatory guide for students.</p>  <p>  The results of the traditional examinations and the SEC Accredited Grades process are intended to be issued in time for CAO Round 1 offers. Where students opt to receive SEC accredited grades and to take the normal examinations, they will be awarded the better grades across the two forms of assessment, on a subject by subject basis.</p></reply>

School authorities and school personnel are required to adhere to the Anti-Bullying Procedures for Primary and Post-Primary Schools in dealing with allegations and incidents of bullying.  The procedures require all schools to formally adopt and implement an anti-bullying policy that fully complies with the requirements of the procedures. The school's anti-bullying policy must then be made available to school personnel, published on the school website (or where none exists, be otherwise readily accessible to parents and pupils on request) and provided to the Parents' Association (where one exists).  </p><p>The Code of Behaviour sets out the standards of behaviour that shall be observed by each student attending the school.  The Code of Behaviour must also set out any measures that the school may take when a student fails or refuses to observe those standards of behaviour and the procedures to be followed, including those relating to the investigation of any alleged breach of the code.  </p><p>In accordance with the Anti-Bullying Procedures, where a parent/guardian is not satisfied that a school has dealt with a bullying case in accordance with the procedures the parent/guardian must be referred, as appropriate to the schools complaint procedures.  </p><p>Under the Education Act 1998 the school Board of Management is the body charged with the direct governance of a school.  Accordingly, whereas my Department provides funding and policy direction for schools, it does not have the power to instruct schools to follow a particular course of direction with regard to individual complaint cases.  This Department's role is to clarify for parents/guardians and students how their grievances and complaints against schools can be progressed. My Department does not comment on individual cases.</p><p>Where there is cause for complaint matters would normally be addressed by the parent(s) /guardian(s) to the individual teacher or school Principal as appropriate.  If matters cannot be resolved at that level then a complaint can be addressed to the Chairperson of the school's Board of Management.  </p><p>Where a person is of the view that a school's board of management has failed to investigate or adequately investigate their complaint, they should bring the matter to the attention of the Patron.  In the event that, after raising its concerns with the school patron, a parent/guardian still considers that the matter has not been resolved, it is open to the parent/guardian to raise the matter with the Ombudsman for Children. </p><p>The Office of the Ombudsman for Children may independently investigate complaints about schools recognised by the Department of Education, provided the parent/guardian has firstly and fully followed the school's complaints procedures. The key criterion for any intervention by the Ombudsman for Children is that the administrative actions or non-actions of a school has, or, may have, adversely affected the child.  The office can be contacted at: Ombudsman for Children&rsquo;s Office, Millennium House, 52-56 Great Strand Street, Dublin 1; tel. 1800 20 20 40 or (01) 865 6800 or email oco@oco.ie. </p><p>Information on Complaints procedures can be found on the Department&rsquo;s website at: <i>www.education.ie/en/Parents/Information/Complaints-Bullying-Child-Protection-Discrimination/.</i></p><p>Children First National Guidance and the Anti Bullying Procedures for Primary and Post Primary Schools provide that where serious instances of bullying are regarded as possibly abusive it may be necessary to make a referral to Tusla or An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as appropriate. Details on reporting to Tusla can be found at how-do-i-report-a-concern-about-a-child.</p></reply>

Given the evolving situation with Covid-19 the work of the Steering Group had been delayed. However, an initial meeting of the Steering Group was held on the 11th   of February in order to recommence the process, which will continue over the coming period. The review is being conducted to ensure that the school transport is fit for purpose and that it serves students and their families adequately.</p>  <p>This review will also build on the proposals in the Programme for Government as they relate to school transport, including examining the options to reduce car journeys and assessing how the School Transport Scheme can work in liaison with the Safe Routes to Schools Programme;   examining the options for providing a better value and a better service for students, including and examining issues such as the nearest or next-nearest school.</p>  <p>  Other issues under consideration include the efficiency of the service and to also examine potential scope for a more co-ordinated approach involving other Government departments involved in transport services.</p>  <p>  It is planned that the Steering Group will report to me on an interim basis as the review progresses, with a view to presenting a final report later this year with recommendations on the future operation of the Department&rsquo;s School Transport Scheme. </p></reply>

The Department of Education will spend approximately &euro;2 Billion or over 20% of its total educational budget in 2021 on making additional provision for children with special educational needs this year.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide. It has well established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents. NCSE seeks to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special education placements.  </p><p>NCSE is planning a further expansion of special class and special school places nationally, to meet identified need. This process is ongoing.</p><p>It is open to any school to make an application to the NCSE for the establishment of a specialised provision and where sanctioned, a range of supports, including capital funding, is made available to the school. </p><p>Notwithstanding the extent of this investment, there are some parts of the country where increases in population and other issues have led to concerns regarding a shortage of school places. </p><p>Through better planning at both national and local level, it is my objective that specialist education places should come on stream to meet emerging demand on a timely basis. However, the active collaboration of school communities is essential in this regard.  </p><p>There are currently 10 special classes at primary level in the Howth, Dublin 13, Clongriffin area with specialised class placements. These are comprised of 9 Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) classes and 1 Specific Learning Disability (SLD) class.</p><p>Through ongoing consultation at local level the NCSE is aware of those parents whose children will be seeking placement for the 2021/22 academic year, including mainstream placement with appropriate support, special class placement, Early Intervention and special school placement. The NCSE continues to work at local level to identify any and all relevant suitable placements. </p><p>The NCSE is working with a significant number of schools in the county to encourage and support the opening of new ASD classes at all levels. The NCSE has specific plans in place to open a number of additional classes in schools in North Dublin. </p><p>I can also reassure the Deputy that the local SENOs continue to be available to assist and advise parents of children with special educational needs. </p><p>Information on the list of schools with special classes together with SENO contact details is available at <i>www.ncse.ie</i>.</p></reply>

The commenced provisions include those establishing the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) and those providing for an inclusive approach to the education of children with special educational needs.</p><p>The following sections of the EPSEN Act were commenced in 2005: </p><p>Section 1 &ndash; Interpretation;</p><p>Section 2 - providing for the inclusive education of children with Special Educational Needs;</p><p>Section 14 &ndash; placing certain duties on schools;</p><p>Sections 19 to 37 - placing the Council on a statutory footing;</p><p>Section 39 - placing certain duties on Health Boards;</p><p>Sections 40 to 53 - amending the Education Act;</p><p>Schedule 1 &ndash; providing for meetings and membership of the Council; and </p><p>Schedule 2 providing for the Chief Executive Officer of the Council. </p><p>The remaining sections of the Act have yet to be commenced.</p><p>The Sections of the EPSEN Act which have not been implemented are those which would have conferred a statutory entitlement to:</p><p>-  an educational assessment for all children with special educational needs;</p><p>-  consequent development of a statutory individual educational plan (IEP);</p><p>-  the delivery of detailed educational services on foot of this plan; and</p><p>-  an independent appeals process.</p><p>The NCSE estimated, in its Plan for the Implementation of the EPSEN Act Report, which was published in 2006, that additional investment over a period of years of up to &euro;235m per annum, across the education and health sectors, would be required to fully implement the EPSEN Act.</p><p>The view of my Department, at the time, was that the level of investment required could be significantly greater than that envisaged in the NCSE report. Legal advice also indicated that the EPSEN Act, as it is currently constituted, may not be implemented on a phased, or age cohort, basis.</p><p>Revised estimates of the amount of additional expenditure required to fully implement the remaining sections of the EPSEN Act, including the individual sections of the Act referred to by the Deputy, have not recently been conducted. The estimated level of additional expenditure required, to implement the outstanding sections of the Act, would have to take into account annual demographic growth and service developments in the area of special educational needs, pricing adjustments and salary cost differentials on an ongoing basis. Estimates would also have to be made as to the number of pupils who may now currently qualify for the statutory service provisions envisaged by the EPSEN Act.</p><p>The Government is committed to helping every child, particularly those with special educational needs, to fulfil their potential. </p><p>In 2021, the Department of Education and Skills will invest approximately &euro;2 Billion in the area of special educational needs support - 1/5 of the Department's budget and up over 42% since 2011.</p><p>The Government has committed to consulting with stakeholders on how best to progress aspects of the EPSEN Act on a non-statutory basis.</p><p>A range of consultations with Education Partners and Stakeholders took place in relation to the development of a new model for allocating special education teachers over the course of 2017. The new model was introduced for all schools from September 2017.</p><p>Further consultations took place with education partners and stakeholders in the context of the undertaking of a comprehensive review of the SNA scheme and will continue in relation to the implementation of recommendations contained in this report.</p><p>Additional powers have also been provided to the National Council for Special Educational to designate a school place for a person with special educational needs, which is now provided for in the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018.</p><p>While awaiting the full implementation of the EPSEN Act, the NCSE has also published a number of policy advice papers which make recommendations aimed at developing a better or more effective alternative to the current resource allocation model, and which aims to move the system towards ultimate implementation of the EPSEN Act.</p><p>It should also be noted, however, that since EPSEN was enacted, the Department&rsquo;s policy on supporting children with special educational needs has changed and evolved on foot of evidence based policy advice from the NCSE which takes account of international perspectives.</p><p>Significantly, the focus of special needs education provision has changed from a model that is diagnosis led to one which is driven by the needs of the child. This is a substantially different view to the one underlying the EPSEN Act. The levels of investment by Government in special education has increased to facilitate the underlying reforms required to implement and embed the needs based approach.</p><p>This Government will continue to prioritise investment in the area of special education support. Ongoing investment and reform will continue to see improvements made in this area.</p><p>I have also indicated that one of my priorities as Minister for Special Education and Inclusion is:</p><p>Updating our Laws: Reviewing and updating the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act.</p><p>Any review of the Act will take into account the extent of additional investment which has been made in special educational services since 2004, with some &euro;2 Billion per year now being spent of special educational supports.</p><p>It will also take into account the range of reforms which have taken place in recent years including the development of new allocation models which are not based primarily on a response to assessment as policy advice has indicated that requirement of diagnosis can create a risk of children being diagnosed as having a special educational need for resource allocation purposes, rather than for health reasons. Also, that as there is a spectrum of ability and disability within every special education disability category, account must be taken of need, as well as diagnosis.</p></reply>

These supports include teachers engaging with their pupils/students on a regular basis, through a blend of guided and independent learnings tasks and experiences.

These learning tasks enable teachers to monitor progress and provide constructive, developmental feedback to support learning.</p>  <p>  When pupils have started back in school, the principal and teachers can assess their needs and adapt their teaching programme so that any gaps in their learning resulting from the temporary closure of schools can be addressed.</p>  <p>  My Department has agreed a plan with the relevant education stakeholders for the phased return to in-person learning for children in special schools and children in special classes in mainstream schools.

The Review made a number of recommendations regarding SNAs including the need for training.</p>  <p>  A new national training programme for SNAs currently employed in recognised schools was developed on foot of the Review's recommendations. Following a public procurement process, University College Dublin (UCD) School of Education, in conjunction with UCD School of Nursing, Midwifery and Health Systems, were selected to develop and deliver this important educational initiative. UCD's wide-ranging experience and expertise will enable the delivery of a broad-ranging and high-quality programme. This programme began in January 2021 with 500 participants in the first year. Priority was given to SNAs working in School Inclusion Pilot Schools. In total, there are 3,500 places available on the programme over the next four years.</p>  <p>  This major educational initiative will enhance the knowledge, skills and expertise of SNAs whose work is central to the inclusion of students with additional care and complex needs in school life. For some SNAs, this programme may present the first opportunity in recent times for them to engage with the theory and research based best practice underlying their role. Completion of the programme may serve as a stepping stone to further education opportunities in the area.</p>  <p>  Each participant who completes the programme successfully will receive a certificate from UCD School of Education.</p>  <p>  There is no cost to serving SNAs working in schools.

The commenced provisions include those establishing the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) and those providing for an inclusive approach to the education of children with special educational needs.</p><p>The following sections of the EPSEN Act were commenced in 2005.</p><p>Section 1 &ndash; Interpretation;</p><p>Section 2 - providing for the inclusive education of children with Special Educational Needs;</p><p>Section 14 &ndash; placing certain duties on schools;</p><p>Sections 19 to 37 - placing the Council on a statutory footing;</p><p>Section 39 - placing certain duties on Health Boards;</p><p>Sections 40 to 53 - amending the Education Act;</p><p>Schedule 1 &ndash; providing for meetings and membership of the Council; and</p><p>Schedule 2 providing for the Chief Executive Officer of the Council.</p><p>The remaining sections of the Act have yet to be commenced.</p><p>The Sections of the EPSEN Act which have not been implemented are those which would have conferred a statutory entitlement to:</p><p>- an educational assessment for all children with special educational needs;</p><p>- consequent development of a statutory individual educational plan (IEP);</p><p>- the delivery of detailed educational services on foot of this plan; and </p><p>- an independent appeals process.</p><p>The NCSE estimated, in its Plan for the Implementation of the EPSEN Act Report, which was published in 2006, that additional investment over a period of years of up to &euro;235m per annum, across the education and health sectors, would be required to fully implement the EPSEN Act.</p><p>The view of my Department, at the time, was that the level of investment required could be significantly greater than that envisaged in the NCSE report. Legal advice also indicated that the EPSEN Act, as it is currently constituted, may not be implemented on a phased, or age cohort, basis.</p><p>Revised estimates of the amount of additional expenditure required to fully implement the remaining sections of the EPSEN Act, including the individual sections of the Act referred to by the Deputy, have not recently been conducted. The estimated level of additional expenditure required, to implement the outstanding sections of the Act, would have to take into account annual demographic growth and service developments in the area of special educational needs, pricing adjustments and salary cost differentials on an ongoing basis. Estimates would also have to be made as to the number of pupils who may now currently qualify for the statutory service provisions envisaged by the EPSEN Act.</p><p>The Government is committed to helping every child, particularly those with special educational needs, to fulfil their potential. </p><p>In 2021 the Department of Education and Skills will invest approximately &euro;2 Billion in the area of special educational needs support - 1/5 of the Department's budget and up over 42% since 2011.</p><p>The Government has committed to consulting with stakeholders on how best to progress aspects of the EPSEN Act on a non-statutory basis.</p><p>A range of consultations with Education Partners and Stakeholders took place in relation to the development of a new model for allocating special education teachers over the course of 2017. The new model was introduced for all schools from September 2017.</p><p>Further consultations took place with education partners and stakeholders in the context of the undertaking of a comprehensive review of the SNA scheme and will continue in relation to the implementation of recommendations contained in this report.</p><p>Additional powers have also been provided to the National Council for Special Educational to designate a school place for a person with special educational needs, which is now provided for in the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018.</p><p>While awaiting the full implementation of the EPSEN Act, the NCSE has also published a number of policy advice papers which make recommendations aimed at developing a better or more effective alternative to the current resource allocation model, and which aims to move the system towards ultimate implementation of the EPSEN Act.</p><p>It should also be noted, however, that since EPSEN was enacted, the Department&rsquo;s policy on supporting children with special educational needs has changed and evolved on foot of evidence based policy advice from the NCSE which takes account of international perspectives.</p><p>Significantly, the focus of special needs education provision has changed from a model that is diagnosis led to one which is driven by the needs of the child. This is a substantially different view to the one underlying the EPSEN Act. The levels of investment by Government in special education has increased to facilitate the underlying reforms required to implement and embed the needs based approach.</p><p>This Government will continue to prioritise investment in the area of special education support. Ongoing investment and reform will continue to see improvements made in this area.</p><p>I have also indicated that one of my priorities as Minister for Special Education and Inclusion is: Updating our Laws: Reviewing and updating the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act.</p><p>Any review of the Act will take into account the extent of additional investment which has been made in special educational services since 2004, with some &euro;2 Billion per year now being spent of special educational supports.</p><p>It will also take into account the range of reforms which have taken place in recent years including the development of new allocation models which are not based primarily on a response to assessment as policy advice has indicated that requirement of diagnosis can create a risk of children being diagnosed as having a special educational need for resource allocation purposes, rather than for health reasons. Also, that as there is a spectrum of ability and disability within every special education disability category, account must be taken of need, as well as diagnosis.</p></reply>

The Department of Education will spend approximately &euro;2 Billion or over 20% of its total educational budget in 2021 on making additional provision for children with special educational needs this year.</p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide. It has well established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents. NCSE seeks to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special education placements.</p>  <p>  NCSE is planning a further expansion of special class and special school places nationally, to meet identified need. This process is ongoing.</p>  <p>  It is open to any school to make an application to the NCSE for the establishment of a specialised provision and where sanctioned, a range of supports, including capital funding, is made available to the school.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the extent of this investment, there are some parts of the country where increases in population and other issues have led to concerns regarding a shortage of school places.</p>  <p>  Through better planning at both national and local level, it is my objective that specialist education places should come on stream to meet emerging demand on a timely basis. However, the active collaboration of school communities is essential in this regard.</p>  <p>  Through ongoing consultation at local level the NCSE is aware of those parents whose children will be seeking placement for the 2021/22 academic year, including mainstream placement with appropriate support, special class placement, Early Intervention and special school placement. The NCSE continues to work at local level to identify any and all relevant suitable placements.</p>  <p>  The local SENO is currently liaising with the school referred to by the Deputy, as part of ongoing contact with schools in the area on the provision of ASD special classes to meet local demand.</p>  <p>  I can also reassure the Deputy that the local SENOs continue to be available to assist and advise parents of children with special educational needs.</p></reply>

This funding allows for a continued focus on the provision of new permanent school places to keep pace with demographic demand and also provides for an additional focus on the refurbishment of existing school buildings, to include the building and modernisation of PE facilities in post-primary schools.</p>  <p>  The government is committed to a PE Hall build and modernisation programme, starting in the second half of the Project Ireland 2040 period.

I also announced that students will also have the alternative option of applying for grades accredited by the State Examinations Commission (SEC), to be known as SEC-Accredited Grades, which will be issued to students at the same time as the examination results. Students who receive grades from both processes will automatically be awarded the higher grade on a subject by subject basis.</p>  <p>  This decision follows intensive engagement with education stakeholders, both bilaterally and through the Advisory Group on Planning for State Examinations 2021.</p>  <p>  This decision announced ensures for every student a method to assess their learning and attainment at the end of their post-primary education and to progress to higher and further education, and the world of work.</p>  <p>  Putting in place both the examinations and a corresponding measure of SEC-Accredited Grades is essential to ensuring a fair system, having regard to the extraordinary circumstances of the pandemic and the loss of learning that has occurred for this group of students due to the interruption of in-person teaching and learning during the periods of school closure.</p>  <p>  Students will be required to register for the traditional examinations and/or to receive SEC Accredited Grades. Registration for both will take place through an online Student Portal operated by the SEC. Details regarding registration will be announced as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  The timetable for the written examinations in June will be published shortly by the State Examinations Commission. As far as possible, access to these examinations will be provided for very high risk students.</p>  <p>  Schools will receive guidance, informed by public health advice, on organising examination centres for the June examinations.</p>  <p>  Oral examinations will be held during the Easter holidays or shortly after. Practical examinations will be held in most of the subjects where these form a normal part of the examination. In some subjects the holding of practical examinations may not be possible for public health reasons and this will be advised as soon as possible. Guidance on projects will issue to schools and students shortly.</p>  <p>  Guidelines and further information on the process of SEC Accredited Grades will be published in the coming days. This will include a full guide for schools and an explanatory guide for students.</p>  <p>  The results of the traditional examinations and the SEC Accredited Grades process are intended to be issued in time for CAO Round 1 offers. Where students opt to receive SEC accredited grades and to take the normal examinations, they will be awarded the better grades across the two forms of assessment, on a subject by subject basis.</p></reply>

The commenced provisions include those establishing the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) and those providing for an inclusive approach to the education of children with special educational needs.</p><p>The following sections of the EPSEN Act were commenced in 2005. </p><p>Section 1 &ndash; InterpretationSection 2 - providing for the inclusive education of children with Special Educational NeedsSection 14 &ndash; placing certain duties on schoolsSections 19 to 37 - placing the Council on a statutory footing. Section 39 - placing certain duties on Health BoardsSections 40 to 53 - amending the Education ActSchedule 1 &ndash; providing for meetings and membership of the CouncilSchedule 2 providing for the Chief Executive Officer of the Council. </p><p>The remaining sections of the Act have yet to be commenced.  The Sections of the EPSEN Act which have not been implemented are those which would have conferred a statutory entitlement to &ndash; an educational assessment for all children with special educational needs. </p><p>- consequent development of a statutory individual educational plan (IEP)</p><p>- the delivery of detailed educational services on foot of this plan</p><p>- an independent appeals process.</p><p>The NCSE estimated, in its Plan for the Implementation of the EPSEN Act Report, which was published in 2006, that additional investment over a period of years of up to &euro;235m per annum, across the education and health sectors, would be required to fully implement the EPSEN Act. </p><p>The view of my Department, at the time, was that the level of investment required could be significantly greater than that envisaged in the NCSE report. Legal advice also indicated that the EPSEN Act, as it is currently constituted, may not be implemented on a phased, or age cohort, basis.</p><p>Revised estimates of the amount of additional expenditure required to fully implement the remaining sections of the EPSEN Act, including the individual sections of the Act referred to by the Deputy, have not recently been conducted. The estimated level of additional expenditure required, to implement the outstanding sections of the Act, would have to take into account annual demographic growth and service developments in the area of special educational needs, pricing adjustments and salary cost differentials on an ongoing basis. Estimates would also have to be made as to the number of pupils who may now currently qualify for the statutory service provisions envisaged by the EPSEN Act.</p><p>The Government is committed to helping every child, particularly those with special educational needs, to fulfil their potential. </p><p>In 2021 the Department of Education and Skills will invest approximately &euro;2 Billion in the area of special educational needs support - 1/5 of the Department's budget and up over 42% since 2011.</p><p>The Government has committed to consulting with stakeholders on how best to progress aspects of the EPSEN Act on a non-statutory basis.  </p><p>A range of consultations with Education Partners and Stakeholders took place in relation to the development of a new model for allocating special education teachers over the course of 2017. The new model was introduced for all schools from September 2017. </p><p>Further consultations took place with education partners and stakeholders in the context of the undertaking of a comprehensive review of the SNA scheme and will continue in relation to the implementation of recommendations contained in this report. </p><p>Additional powers have also been provided to the National Council for Special Educational to designate a school place for a person with special educational needs, which is now provided for in the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018. </p><p>While awaiting the full implementation of the EPSEN Act, the NCSE has also published a number of policy advice papers which make recommendations aimed at developing a better or more effective alternative to the current resource allocation model, and which aims to move the system towards ultimate implementation of the EPSEN Act.</p><p>It should also be noted, however, that since EPSEN was enacted, the Department&rsquo;s policy on supporting children with special educational needs has changed and evolved on foot of evidence based policy advice from the NCSE which takes account of international perspectives. </p><p>Significantly, the focus of special needs education provision has changed from a model that is diagnosis led to one which is driven by the needs of the child.  This is a substantially different view to the one underlying the EPSEN Act.  The levels of investment by Government in special education has increased to facilitate the underlying reforms required to implement and embed the needs based approach.  </p><p>This Government will continue to prioritise investment in the area of special education support. Ongoing investment and reform will continue to see improvements made in this area.</p><p>I have also indicated that one of my priorities as Minister for Special Education and Inclusion is:</p><p>Updating our Laws: Reviewing and updating the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act. </p><p>Any review of the Act will take into account the extent of additional investment which has been made in special educational services since 2004, with some &euro;2 Billion per year now being spent of special educational supports. </p><p>It will also take into account the range of reforms which have taken place in recent years including the development of new allocation models which are not based primarily on a response to assessment as policy advice has indicated that requirement of diagnosis can create a risk of children being diagnosed as having a special educational need for resource allocation purposes, rather than for health reasons. Also, that as there is a spectrum of ability and disability within every special education disability category, account must be taken of need, as well as diagnosis.</p></reply>

In the current school year over 113,100 children, including over 14,500 children with special educational needs, are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;224.7m in 2020.</p><p>The purpose of my Department's School Transport Scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school. </p><p>In October 2019, my predecessor announced a review of the school transport scheme with a view to taking a fresh look at the service and its broader effectiveness and sustainability. Given the evolving situation with Covid-19 the work of the Steering Group had been delayed. However, an initial meeting of the Steering Group was held on the 11<sup>th</sup>of February in order to recommence the process, which will continue over the coming period. The review is being conducted to ensure that the school transport is fit for purpose and that it serves students and their families adequately.</p><p>This review will also build on the proposals in the Programme for Government as they relate to school transport, including examining the options to reduce car journeys and assessing how the School Transport Scheme can work in liaison with the Safe Routes to Schools Programme;<i></i>examining the options for providing a better value and a better service for students, including and examining issues such as the nearest or next-nearest school.</p><p>Other issues under consideration include the efficiency of the service and to also examine potential scope for a more co-ordinated approach involving other Government departments involved in transport services.</p><p>It is planned that the Steering Group will report to me on an interim basis as the review progresses, with a view to presenting a final report later this year with recommendations on the future operation of the Department&rsquo;s School Transport Scheme. </p></reply>

This model has replaced the previous model of allocating resource teaching support and learning support to schools.</p><p>The Special Education Teacher allocation, allows schools to provide additional teaching support for all pupils who require such support in their schools and for schools to deploy resources based on each pupil&rsquo;s individual learning needs.</p><p>It gives greater flexibility to schools as to how they can deploy their resources, to take account of the actual learning needs pupils have, as opposed to being guided by a particular diagnosis of disability, and schools are guided as to how they should make such allocation decisions.</p><p>The school will take account of learning needs of children as evidenced by performance in schools but also supported where relevant by information provided regarding the nature of a condition that a pupil may have.</p><p>The Department of Education and Skills has published guidelines for schools as to how they should utilise and deploy their resources under the new allocation model, which are available at <i>www.education.ie</i>.</p><p>The guidelines support schools in how they identify pupils for additional teaching support and decide how much support to provide for pupils who need it.</p><p>Under the special education teacher allocation model schools are frontloaded with resources, based on each schools profile, to provide supports immediately to those pupils who need it without delay.</p><p>Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.</p><p>Children do not have to be labelled with a particular condition to qualify for extra teaching assistance.

They can give the most assistance to the pupils who need the support most and allocate resources based on needs.</p><p>Dyslexia is understood in the context the severity and persistence of an individual&rsquo;s needs over time and their response to intervention.  This approach aligns with the new Special Educational model in schools, which uses a problem solving approach to identify the specific needs of the individual, places the focus on matching of specific interventions to that need and support their literacy development and reviews progress.  </p><p>Children who have additional learning needs in school, including children with dyslexia, may receive additional teaching support in schools, without a requirement for them to have a formal assessment or diagnosis of a particular condition.</p></reply>

It is a school-based service with an overall objective of providing an educational psychology service to all schools, through the application of psychological theory and practice, to support the wellbeing, and academic, social and emotional development of all learners.  NEPS prioritises support for learners at risk of educational disadvantage and those with special educational needs.  </p>  <p>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service.  This model does not operate on a waiting lists basis.  The NEPS Model of Service is one where there is a balance between consultation and casework about individual children, and support and development work with school personnel. This model is based on what the research shows is effective in the application of psychology and facilitates a number of ways for psychologists to engage with schools. The needs of children and young people are met most effectively where parents, teachers and psychologist work collaboratively, consulting with each other with regard to the issue or concern. Other agencies and other staff in the school may also be involved.  This could for example include a special education teacher, SNA or personnel from the NCSE.  The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. </p>  <p>  NEPS encourages and supports schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. </p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention. </p></reply>

This is important in the context of addressing the need for additional post-primary school places in Drogheda and Laytown School planning areas for the next 3 years including September 2021.</p>  <p>  The level of interim accommodation to be provided on the St. Olivers Community School site will be in excess of 6,800m&sup2; and will consist of 13 general classrooms, 14 specialist rooms, 2 special classes, pastoral rooms and other ancillary accommodation. Providing enhanced facilities for Drogheda ETSS and the capacity to cater for increased enrolments over the next 3 years, including for September 2021, are particularly important aspects of the project.</p>  <p>  The existing temporary Drogheda ETSS site is too small to facilitate the proposed accommodation and St. Olivers Community College site is the only LMETB owned site in the vicinity that has capacity. The school will remain on the ETB-owned site until its new permanent school building is provided. LMETB has agreed to deliver the project and a planning application will be submitted as quickly as possible.   </p>  <p>  In relation to a permanent site for Drogheda ETSS, the Department has undertaken and continues to undertake a site identification process in respect of suitable sites in the South Drogheda area. To date it has proven challenging to identify suitable available sites in the area. Currently, the Department is undertaking an assessment of two potential sites.   Due to commercial sensitivities it is not possible to provide further information at this stage. </p>  <p>  The Department envisages that the new permanent school will be provided under a Design &amp;amp; Build contract and has procurement frameworks in place to deliver this as quickly as possible.  A typical construction period for a 1,000 pupil school is 18 months.   However, the identification and acquisition of a permanent site and the associated design and planning permission processes are key first steps in facilitating construction of the new permanent school building.</p></reply>

My Department&rsquo;s Wellbeing Policy and Framework for practice has given recognition to the importance of promoting wellbeing in education.  It outlines a comprehensive, whole-school approach to the promotion of wellbeing and positive mental health. It focuses on the whole school community, as well as groups and individual young people with identified needs. </p>  <p>  The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) of my Department provides a comprehensive, school-based psychological service to all primary and post primary schools through the application of psychological theory and practice to support the wellbeing, academic, social and emotional development of all learners. NEPS provides its service to schools through casework and through support and development work with schools. Individual casework involves a high level of psychologist collaboration with teachers and parents, often also working directly with the child/young person.  NEPS may become involved with supporting individual students where the school&rsquo;s SET team or Student Support Team feels that the involvement of the psychologist is needed. Psychologists may provide consultation in relation to appropriate therapeutic interventions to be delivered in the school setting and engage in direct work with an individual student as appropriate. </p>  <p>  In the event that the need for a more targeted counselling or a specialised intervention is identified by the NEPS psychologist, a referral is made to an outside agency for evaluation and ongoing support.  The NEPS psychologist can identify the most appropriate referral pathway and supports school with the onward referral to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Team (CAMHS), HSE Primary Care/Community Psychology teams, or an identified local community based specialist mental health service.  </p>  <p>  In addition to casework NEPS psychologists work with teachers to build their capacity.  NEPS teams offer training and guidance for teachers in the provision of universal and targeted evidence-informed approaches and early intervention to promote children&rsquo;s wellbeing, social, emotional and academic development. Initiatives such as the Incredible Years Social Emotional learning Programmes and the FRIENDS Resilience Programmes have been welcomed by schools and their impact positively evaluated.  </p>  <p>  A student support team is a student-focused mechanism put in place by a school in order to co-ordinate the support available for students in the school and to facilitate links to the community and other non-school support services. NEPS provides support to post primary schools in the development of Student Support Teams to coordinate supports and develop a whole-school approach to wellbeing promotion.  NEPS also provides advice in the setting up or review of Student Support Teams. </p>  <p>  Also at post primary level, counselling is a key part of the role of the Guidance Counsellor, offered on an individual or group basis as part of a developmental learning process, at moments of personal crisis but also at key transition points. Guidance allocations for all schools were increased in the 2020/21 school year. The Guidance Counsellor also identifies and supports the referral of students to external counselling agencies and professionals, as required. The Guidance Counsellor is key in developing and implementing innovative approaches to wellbeing promotion on a whole schools basis though the school&rsquo;s Guidance Plan.  Each post primary school currently receives an allocation in respect of guidance provision, calculated by reference to the approved enrolment.  </p></reply>

The commenced provisions include those establishing the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) and those providing for an inclusive approach to the education of children with special educational needs.</p><p>The following sections of the EPSEN Act were commenced in 2005. </p><p>Section 1 &ndash; InterpretationSection 2 - providing for the inclusive education of children with Special Educational NeedsSection 14 &ndash; placing certain duties on schoolsSections 19 to 37 - placing the Council on a statutory footing. Section 39 - placing certain duties on Health BoardsSections 40 to 53 - amending the Education ActSchedule 1 &ndash; providing for meetings and membership of the CouncilSchedule 2 providing for the Chief Executive Officer of the Council. </p><p>The remaining sections of the Act have yet to be commenced.  The Sections of the EPSEN Act which have not been implemented are those which would have conferred a statutory entitlement to &ndash; </p><p>- an educational assessment for all children with special educational needs. </p><p>- consequent development of a statutory individual educational plan (IEP).</p><p>- the delivery of detailed educational services on foot of this plan.</p><p>- an independent appeals process.</p><p>The NCSE estimated, in its Plan for the Implementation of the EPSEN Act Report, which was published in 2006, that additional investment over a period of years of up to &euro;235m per annum, across the education and health sectors, would be required to fully implement the EPSEN Act. </p><p>The view of my Department, at the time, was that the level of investment required could be significantly greater than that envisaged in the NCSE report. Legal advice also indicated that the EPSEN Act, as it is currently constituted, may not be implemented on a phased, or age cohort, basis.</p><p>Revised estimates of the amount of additional expenditure required to fully implement the remaining sections of the EPSEN Act, including the individual sections of the Act referred to by the Deputy, have not recently been conducted. The estimated level of additional expenditure required, to implement the outstanding sections of the Act, would have to take into account annual demographic growth and service developments in the area of special educational needs, pricing adjustments and salary cost differentials on an ongoing basis. Estimates would also have to be made as to the number of pupils who may now currently qualify for the statutory service provisions envisaged by the EPSEN Act.</p><p>The Government is committed to helping every child, particularly those with special educational needs, to fulfil their potential. </p><p>In 2021 the Department of Education and Skills will invest approximately &euro;2 Billion in the area of special educational needs support - 1/5 of the Department's budget and up over 42% since 2011.</p><p>The Government has committed to consulting with stakeholders on how best to progress aspects of the EPSEN Act on a non-statutory basis.  </p><p>A range of consultations with Education Partners and Stakeholders took place in relation to the development of a new model for allocating special education teachers over the course of 2017. The new model was introduced for all schools from September 2017. </p><p>Further consultations took place with education partners and stakeholders in the context of the undertaking of a comprehensive review of the SNA scheme and will continue in relation to the implementation of recommendations contained in this report. </p><p>Additional powers have also been provided to the National Council for Special Educational to designate a school place for a person with special educational needs, which is now provided for in the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018. </p><p>While awaiting the full implementation of the EPSEN Act, the NCSE has also published a number of policy advice papers which make recommendations aimed at developing a better or more effective alternative to the current resource allocation model, and which aims to move the system towards ultimate implementation of the EPSEN Act.</p><p>It should also be noted, however, that since EPSEN was enacted, the Department&rsquo;s policy on supporting children with special educational needs has changed and evolved on foot of evidence based policy advice from the NCSE which takes account of international perspectives. </p><p>Significantly, the focus of special needs education provision has changed from a model that is diagnosis led to one which is driven by the needs of the child.  This is a substantially different view to the one underlying the EPSEN Act.  The levels of investment by Government in special education has increased to facilitate the underlying reforms required to implement and embed the needs based approach.  </p><p>This Government will continue to prioritise investment in the area of special education support. Ongoing investment and reform will continue to see improvements made in this area.</p><p>I have also indicated that one of my priorities as Minister for Special Education and Inclusion is:</p><p>Updating our Laws: Reviewing and updating the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act. </p><p>Any review of the Act will take into account the extent of additional investment which has been made in special educational services since 2004, with some &euro;2 Billion per year now being spent of special educational supports. </p><p>It will also take into account the range of reforms which have taken place in recent years including the development of new allocation models which are not based primarily on a response to assessment as policy advice has indicated that requirement of diagnosis can create a risk of children being diagnosed as having a special educational need for resource allocation purposes, rather than for health reasons. Also, that as there is a spectrum of ability and disability within every special education disability category, account must be taken of need, as well as diagnosis.</p></reply>

Subsequent to this award, my Department was advised that the person concerned had taken on the role of full-time carer for his child from 14/12/2020.  As the person concerned was not available for full-time work it was established he was not entitled to this payment and his JA claim was closed.

Unfortunately the arrears were not paid at the time and remained unpaid until the matter was raised by the person concerned in 2020. If the person concerned wishes to obtain a copy of the records he should make a request to my Department in writing and should indicate that the records are being sought under the Freedom of Information Act. </p>  <p>  When this error occurred, my Department was operating on a legacy IT system  which could not identify whether arrears may be outstanding and paper processes were relied upon to administer schemes. Since then, my Department has moved to the current IT platform and can identify cases where there may be arrears due.  The Department routinely run reports to identify such cases and ensure arrears are paid to customers in a timely manner. </p>  <p>  Margetson &amp;amp; Greene were incorrectly advised by my Department in August 2015 that there were no arrears due to the estate.

Section 243 of that Act provides for payment in respect of loss of purchasing power where there has been a delay by the Department of more than 12 months in paying a new claim or an increase in a claim.  There is no legislative provision for the payment of loss of purchasing on the maintenance of a claim, as in this case.

A national network of Citizens Information Centres, overseen by eight regional companies, provides information, advice and advocacy services to the public.</p>  <p>  I have made enquiries with the Citizens Information Board (CIB) which funds and supports this network, including the Dublin South Citizens Information Service (DSCIS), which has responsibility for the provision of information, advice and advocacy services in its geographic area. </p>  <p>  I am advised that the DSCIS service is currently being delivered in adherence to Government advice at the various restriction levels. Since March 2020, DSCIS have primarily delivered a service to the public through a &ldquo;call-back service&rdquo;, whereby members of the public phone their local office and leave their details, and then receive a call back from one of DSCIS's information officers within 24 &ndash; 48 hours. </p>  <p>  With the support of safety consultants, DSCIS carried out risk assessments on all of their offices and invested significantly in personal protective equipment (PPE). From June 2020 onwards, DSCIS has provided in-person appointment based services to members of the public, where a query cannot be dealt with by phone or by email. I understand that there are no plans for DSCIS to reduce the current level of in-person services, which are provided on this appointment basis.</p>  <p>  DSCIS recognises the value of in-person services, where a member of the public can walk in to their local office and receive information, advice and advocacy services in relation to their query. DSCIS envisage a return to in-person services as the primary manner in how they interact with their clients, in line with the lifting of restrictions over time.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Last November,   I secured Government approval to extend the 2020 earnings reference period for employees to September 2020.  This change, which is effective from 2 October, meant that people who only commenced employment after February 2020 but were laid-off in October due to increased restrictions can have their payment rate fixed by reference to their earnings in the period March to September 2020.  </p>  <p>   As a result of extending the reference period to the end of September 2020, some 37,430 receiving PUP on 17 November received an increase in their rate of payment. </p>  <p>  It is expected that a significant number of those who benefitted from the extended reference period will be due arrears, either to the 2 October or the date of commencement of their claim for the Pandemic Unemployment Payment, whichever is the later.</p>  <p>  During the months of November and December, a number of very significant IT changes were in progress in relation to the Pandemic Unemployment Payment. These included the finalisation of the general arrears project involving 286,000 additional payments on 1 December, payment of the Christmas Bonus on 8 December to just over 283,000 recipients of the PUP, and advance payments over the Christmas period. My Department has also been focused on responding to the increased numbers of people applying for the Pandemic Unemployment Payment, with an increase of over 200,000 claims in payment since the start of this year. Against that background, and in order to ensure continuity of service delivery, it was not possible to introduce the necessary IT changes to allow for processing of any re-rate arrears which may have arisen. </p>  <p>  The necessary IT development work to ensure processing of any of these arrears has progressed significantly in recent weeks and it is expected that payment will issue shortly. Preliminary analysis of currently awarded claims indicate that just under 39,000 individuals are due payment, with the vast majority of these cases relating to the period from 2 October to 5 November 2020. </p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies matters for the Deputies.</p></reply>

Combined spending on all these payments to carers in 2021 is expected to exceed &euro;1.4 billion.   </p>  <p>  Carer's Allowance is a means tested payment made to people whose income falls below certain limits, and who are looking after certain people in need of full-time care and attention. </p>  <p>  At the end of December 2020, there were 88,906 people in receipt of Carer's Allowance.  The estimated expenditure on Carer&rsquo;s Allowance in 2021 is approximately &euro;953 million. </p>  <p>  This allowance is part of the system of social assistance supports that provide payments based on an income need.  The means test plays a critical role in determining whether or not an income need arises as a consequence of a particular contingency &ndash; such as disability, unemployment or caring.  This ensures that the recipient has a verifiable income need and that resources are targeted to those who need them most.  </p>  <p>  The means test for Carer's Allowance is one of the most generous in the social welfare system, most notably with regard to spouse&rsquo;s earnings.  The amount of weekly earnings disregarded is &euro;332.50 per week for a single person and &euro;665 per week for a couple. By comparison, the income disregard applied to Disability Allowance is &euro;120 per week (as per Budget 2021 this will increase to &euro;140 per week from June 2021).   For Jobseeker's Allowance, it is &euro;20 per day up to a maximum of &euro;60, and the balance is assessed at 60%.  For Jobseeker's Transitional Payment, the weekly income disregard is &euro;165 with 50% of the balance assessed as means.</p>  <p>  It is not possible to estimate the additional cost outlined by the Deputy, as there are too many variables, not least the number of people earning the average industrial income who would potentially also meet the criteria of providing full-time care and would become eligible if the disregard was increased and whether they would be assessed as a single person or a couple.  </p>  <p>  However, the Deputy should note that under the current means assessment there are scenarios where those in receipt of average weekly earnings of &euro;811.58 (or annual income of &euro;42,202.16), as outlined, would qualify for the payment of Carer's Allowance.  For example in the case of a carer whose partner has weekly earnings of &euro;811.58 they may qualify for a weekly payment of &euro;174.00 (almost 80% of the full rate).  If they have qualified children, the payment will be higher.</p>  <p>  Changes to schemes are considered in an overall budgetary and policy context and from an evidence-based perspective.  It should be noted that some 92% of the current recipients of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance have no means or means of less than &euro;7.60 per week and would not benefit by an increase in the disregard.  </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that I am very much aware of the key role that family carers play in our society and I will continue to keep the range of supports available to carers under review.  Any changes to scheme criteria, however, would have implications for overall spending and would need to be addressed in an overall budgetary context.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household.</p>  <p>  My Department also pays an electricity or gas allowance under the Household Benefits scheme at an estimated cost of &euro;195 million in 2021.  This is paid at a rate of &euro;35 per month, 12 months of the year.  </p>  <p>  The criteria for fuel allowance are framed in order to direct the limited resources available to my Department in as targeted a manner as possible.  A Public Service pension is not a qualifying payment for fuel allowance.  Qualifying payments for those aged 66 or over include State Pension (Contributory or Non-Contributory), Widow's, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner&rsquo;s Pension (Contributory), Deserted Wives Benefit, Incapacity Supplement under the Disablement Pension Scheme, Death Benefit Pension under Occupational Injuries Benefit Scheme as well as certain social security payments from a country covered by EU Regulations or a country with which Ireland has a Bilateral Social Security Agreement.   All other qualifying conditions must also be satisfied to receive the payment. </p>  <p>  The Living Alone Increase is a &euro;19 increase in the weekly rate of payment of certain Irish social protection payments, awarded where the recipient is living alone.  For those aged 66 or over,  payments include State Pension (Contributory), State Pension (Non-contributory) , Widow&rsquo;s, Widower&rsquo;s or Surviving Civil Partner&rsquo;s (Contributory) Pension,  Widow's/Widower's Pension under the Occupational Injuries Benefit Scheme, Incapacity Supplement under the Occupational Injuries Benefit Scheme and Deserted Wife's Benefit.  It is not a stand-alone payment.  There are no circumstances where the living alone increase can be paid to people who are not in receipt of a qualifying payment from my Department.</p>  <p>  Any decision to allow former Public Servants who are not in receipt of a qualifying payment to receive the fuel allowance or the living alone increase would have budgetary consequences and would have to be considered in the context of budget negotiations. </p>  <p>  The Government values the role of carers very much and it is for this reason that they receive significant income supports from the Department. Carer&rsquo;s Benefit is a payment made to insured people who may be required to leave the workforce or reduce their working hours to care for a person(s) in need of full time care. It is payable for a period of 2 years (104 weeks) for each care recipient and may be claimed over separate periods up to a total of 2 years (104 weeks). Carer&rsquo;s Allowance is a means tested payment to people on low incomes who are caring full-time for a person who needs support because of age, disability or illness.</p>  <p>  In addition to Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, carers receive further support in the form of free travel and household benefits (for those who live with the person for whom they care) and the annual Carer's Support Grant in respect of each person for whom they care for.  S/he can also receive an extra half-rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance if s/he cares for more than one person. </p>  <p>  The maximum rates of Carer's Allowance for those aged under 66, at &euro;219 (&euro;257 for carers aged 66 or over) where one person is being cared for, and &euro;328.50 (&euro;385.50 for carers aged 66 or over) where there are two or more carees, is significantly higher than that for most schemes administered by my Department.  </p>  <p>  The means test for Carer's Allowance has been significantly eased over the years, and is now one of the most generous means tests in the social welfare system, most notably with regard to spouse&rsquo;s earnings.  At present the means test for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance allows for an income disregard of &euro;332.50 per week for a single person and &euro;665 for a couple.  In the case of a single carer, that person may retain a full-rate payment of &euro;219.00 while having an annual income of just under &euro;19,000, or retain a payment of &euro;109.00 per week (just under half rate) while having an annual income of &euro;25,400, or retain the minimum payment of &euro;4 per week while having an annual income of &euro;31,100. </p>  <p>  Under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme, exceptional needs payments may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which customers are unable to meet from their own resources, and this may include exceptional heating costs.  Decisions on such payments are made on a case-by-case basis.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

For the purposes of the means-test, at the outset and at any review intervals during the lifetime of the claim, a claimant must provide, on request, full and up to date details of any income(s), assets, savings and investments they may hold. </p>  <p>  The person concerned had been in receipt of a State Pension (non-contributory) which, in the course of a review of entitlement, was terminated from 7 February 2020, due to their non-disclosure of means to an Inspector of the Department and later to a Deciding Officer.</p>  <p>  A re-application for pension was received from the person concerned on 26 August 2020.  The case was referred to an Inspector to investigate the means of the person concerned.  As additional financial information, requested on a number of occasions by the Inspector, was not provided, it was not possible to assess the person&rsquo;s weekly means. The Deciding Officer was therefore unable to establish if an entitlement to state pension non-contributory existed and the person's re-application was disallowed. On 6 January 2021, the person concerned was notified in writing of the reasons for this decision.</p>  <p>  Further information was received from the person concerned on 18 January 2021 which was forwarded to the Inspector for consideration. Based on the information provided, the Inspector was still unable to undertake a complete means assessment. This was explained to the person concerned in a letter on 1 February 2021.</p>  <p>  The Deputy's Parliamentary Question will be taken as a request for a further review of this case. The Deciding Officer will arrange for the Department's Inspector to contact the person concerned again in relation to the outstanding information. On receipt of the Inspector&rsquo;s report, the Deciding Officer will make a decision on the State Pension (non-contributory) entitlement of the person concerned and will notify them of the outcome without delay.</p>  <p>  In the interim, should the person concerned be suffering from financial difficulty they are advised to contact their local Community Welfare Service, which may be in a position to provide them with financial assistance. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

Funding is strictly for food items only, which must be of suitable nutritional quality.

The specifications for this tender included the provision of food and household items through a points system by way of an on-site foodhall whereby residents can obtain the items they need at no cost to themselves. Under the terms of the contract the service provider is also required to consult regularly with residents to help ensure the produce available in the in-house store is both ethnically and culturally appropriate to their needs.   </p>  <p>  This model was used in all eight of the regional tender competitions for the provision of such accommodation, of which the Borders Region was the last chronologically to take place. The provision of an onsite foodhall was crucial to the bid from all successful tenderers and would have been factored into their costs.  Tenders were evaluated on the Most Economically Advantageous Tender model, whereby bids are assessed on a combination of the quality of the proposal of service delivery and price. Quality of the proposal of service delivery was 60% of overall marks while price was 40%.</p>  <p>  It would undermine the integrity of the procurement process if bidders were asked (either individually or collectively) to change the service delivery model from that contained in the specifications following assessment and contract award and would leave the process open to legal challenges from any unsuccessful bidders who could claim that they may have been successful had they been allowed to submit bids based on a voucher system or other proposal rather than a foodhall.</p>  <p>  Port Road, Letterkenny will be the 30th accommodation centre to come through the tendering process. All of the accommodation centres that have been procured through this process provide residents with items through the points based foodhall system. The International Protection Accommodation Service (IPAS) of my Department understand that the foodhall system works very well and residents are generally satisfied with the system.</p>  <p>  Additionally, residents will be in receipt of a daily expenses allowance and many residents will qualify for permission to access the labour market and will do so. Residents are of course free to spend their income wherever they see fit, including in local shops.</p></reply>

The ratios are the minimum number of adults required to supervise, care for and work directly with the children in the service.

Given the sensitivity of these deeply personal issues, it was accepted that a bespoke approach was necessary to facilitate and protect individuals who wished to engage confidentially with this module of the Commission&rsquo;s work.</p>  <p>  It is important to acknowledge therefore the reported procedural distinctions in the methodologies employed by the Commission across the different modules of its inquiry process &ndash; not all testimony was sworn evidence gathered or processed in accordance with the full rigours of the Commissions of Investigation Act. This does not in any way alter the value or truth of the stories captured in the Confidential Committee part of the Final Report, but it is important to acknowledge the different procedures implemented by the Commission.</p>  <p>  The Commission is independent in the conduct of its inquiries and I had no role in, or knowledge of, the particulars of its approach. In its Final Report, the Commission states that &ldquo;Witnesses were asked for permission to record their evidence on the clear understanding that the recordings would be used only as an aide memoire for the researcher when compiling the report and would then be destroyed.  All such recordings were destroyed after the report was added to the Confidential Committee electronic repository of information.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  Therefore, the Commission&rsquo;s position is that the decision not to retain these recordings was legitimately and legally taken by it to ensure the anonymity it had promised. My Department's understanding is that recordings were made as an aid to the work of the Confidential Committee and that the above reference includes contemporaneous notes taken by the note taker at the same time and used to create the records retained for the Confidential Committee and used in preparing the final report.</p>  <p>  In October 2020, the Oireachtas enacted the Commission of Investigation (Mother and Baby Homes and certain related Matters) Records, and another Matter, Act 2020 to protect and preserve the Commission&rsquo;s records. This legislation prevented the redaction of personal information so that the records can be made available to those seeking access to their personal information.</p>  <p>  The only exception to the above requirement was to facilitate persons who voluntarily met the Confidential Committee to decide to have their name and contact details redacted so as to protect their anonymity.  Most importantly, no such anonymity applies to the sworn testimony given before the Commission itself.  Many of the mothers and children have undoubtedly had difficult experiences where their agency was taken away and it would be unconscionable to renege on the absolute commitment of confidentiality given to them.</p>  <p>  Intensive preparations are ongoing in my Department to ensure that once the full archive transfers subject access requests can be processed in my Department in full compliance with the Data Protection Regulatory Framework.  In the context of these preparations, I sought further information from the Chair of the Commission to clarify whether it may be technically possible to recover any recordings or notes made by the Confidential Committee.  In its response, the Commission yesterday clarified that its advice from IT experts is that it is not technically possible to recover the audio recordings. This clarification is important in informing how I need to proceed in giving effect to Article 16 of GDPR, and other related rights of data subjects, when the archive of records transfers my Department.</p>  <p>  I have also engaged with the Data Protection Commissioner with a view to supporting clarity on these matters and my Department&rsquo;s management of the archive once deposited.</p>  <p>  A decision on further action, if any, will be informed by these engagements and the legal advices of the Attorney General.</p></reply>

Louth.  These are Carroll Village in Dundalk, Setanta Bed &amp;amp; Breakfast in Ardee and the Carnbeg Hotel in Dundalk.</p>  <p>  Carroll Village, is a dedicated international protection accommodation centre that was initially contracted in 2005 on an annual basis with contract renewal every January since.  My Department has a contract for accommodation services in 23 apartments in the Carroll Village complex and we are currently in discussions with the provider for continued use of these apartments for 2021.   The remaining apartments in the complex are not contracted to my Department. </p>  <p>  Self-catering accommodation provided by my Department normally provides an on-site shop or foodhall where residents may obtain food and household items free of charge under a points based system.  This facility is a contractual requirement for contractors for such accommodation centres.  In addition, a weekly allowance of &euro;38.80 per week for adults and &euro;29.80 per week for children is paid by Community Welfare Officers (CWO).  This allowance is a cash supplement for incidental expenses. </p>  <p>  However, Carroll Village was chosen as a pilot project to provide self-catering facilities with weekly payments from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to cover the normal day to day living costs associated with living independently.  Since 2017, International Protection residents of Carroll Village have been required to cover the costs of utility bills and to facilitate this, prepay meters were installed in the apartments. </p>  <p>  Due to lack of capacity within the IPAS accommodation portfolio and continuing high demand for accommodation services, my Department contracted a number of hotels and guesthouses to provide accommodation and board to protection applicants.  My Department is currently using the Setanta Bed and Breakfast in Ardee as temporary accommodation in Co. Louth.  In addition, as a measure to deal with the impact of Covid-19 on those persons seeking international protection, my Department has also contracted the Carnbeg Hotel in Dundalk to operate as a quarantine centre for applicants before they are re-accommodated within the Department&rsquo;s accommodation centres.</p>  <p>  The forthcoming White Paper on the future direction of the provision of accommodation to International Protection , due to be published this month, will inform the type of accommodation that my Department will contract in the future.</p></reply>

It has now been agreed that the programme will remain suspended during extended restrictions up to 5 March.  Other Early Learning and Childcare and School-Age Childcare services (ELC/SAC services) can remain open on a restricted basis, to offer services to the children of essential workers and to vulnerable children only.  </p>  <p>  Essential workers are those that work in the list of essential services published on gov.ie.  One parent who is an essential worker confers eligibility on the child to access a service.  For the purposes of accessing early learning and childcare services, an essential worker may be working from home.</p>  <p>  My Department is aware that many providers have chosen to refund, waive or credit fees for families not using an early learning and childcare services and I welcome this. </p>  <p>  During the February 1 - March 5 period, to enable parental fees to be waived, along with other objectives, I have introduced revised and enhanced funding arrangements to support providers. Funding is now structured into standard funding and enhanced funding. </p>  <p>  Where a provider has opted to avail of this enhanced funding, they are required to waive fees for children not attending. This applies to both open and closed services. </p>  <p>  One element of the enhanced funding is the Covid Support Payment which is available for services that have a high degree of reliance on parental fees.  This payment is subject to providers agreeing not to charge parents who don&rsquo;t attend.</p>  <p>  If providers do not access the conditional funding, they may still request fees from parents.  Contract terms between providers and parents may stipulate specific obligations of both parties and I acknowledge that the relationship between a service and parent is a private one based on a contract between those two parties. </p>  <p>  Providers will be able to confirm if they are receiving enhanced funding, and consequently, their fee arrangements. They will also be able to clarify refund or credit arrangements for any pre-paid fees. </p></reply>

Childcare is essential for a parents ability to balance work with family responsibilities, especially those in the workforce on whom we rely to deliver essential services. In addition, a household of an essential worker, without an existing childcare arrangement, can form a bubble with another household for the purpose of providing childcare.</p>  <p>  However, insofar as international travel is concerned, there is a Government Advisory in operation against all non-essential international travel, reinforced by legal measures to protect public health and to mitigate the risk of new variants of COVID-19 entering the country.  Travellers arriving into Ireland must complete a passenger locator form, have evidence of a negative or &lsquo;not detected&rsquo; result from a pre-departure PCR test taken within 72 hours of travel upon arrival, and undertake mandatory quarantine for 14 days.  Travellers who arrive without a relevant test result are required to take a test within 36 hours of arrival.

Complaints are made initially to the centre manager with a view to informal resolution.  If the person concerned is not satisfied with the outcome of their complaint, he or she may make a complaint to IPAS who will investigate the matter and take action as appropriate.  In the event that a resident is not satisfied with how his or her complaint is dealt with, he or she has full access to the services of the Office of the Ombudsman and Ombudsman for Children&rsquo;s Office.</p><p>A confidential Freephone telephone support service, funded by but independent of my Department, was also established in May 2020 to provide further support to residents in both permanent and temporary accommodation centres. This Freephone confidential support helpline is operated by the Jesuit Refugee Service (JRS). </p><p>All the Department&rsquo;s accommodation centres are subject to regular unannounced inspections by both staff from IPAS and an independent inspectorate company. Part of the inspection process deals directly with the provision of food services. Meals are assessed during inspection for quality, cultural appropriateness and variety of menu options.  Menus must include a vegetarian option and all food products provided must have a traceability system that complies with food safety requirements.  Any issues identified are notified to the contractor to be addressed immediately.  It should also be noted that our accommodation centres are subject to inspections by Environmental Health Officers.</p><p>Three inspections by IPAS took place in the accommodation centre referred to by the Deputy in 2020.  The reports will be published on IPAS's website <i>www.ria.gov.ie</i>in due course as are all such inspection reports.Some apartments have been refurbished at this centre in 2020.  New kitchens, a new play area and a shop have also been recently installed.  Residents may speak directly with inspectors during these visits and it has been reported that during the last inspection, in December 2020, many residents stated that they were very happy staying at this accommodation location.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the Programme for Government contains a commitment to ending the Direct Provision system and replacing it with a new International Protection accommodation policy, centred on a not-for-profit approach.  We have also committed to the development of a White Paper which will set out how this new system will be structured and the steps to achieving it. My Department is currently developing the White Paper which I expect to publish this month.</p><p>I am committed to improving standards in International Protection accommodation as the Government works to end Direct Provision.

Everyone has a role to play in preparing young people to reach their developmental milestones. </p>  <p>  Legislative provision for aftercare has been strengthened by the Child Care (Amendment) Act 2015, which imposed a statutory duty on Tusla to prepare an aftercare plan for an eligible child or eligible young person, following an assessment of need. In response to the new legislative provision, Tusla has developed a suite of policies and guidance documents for aftercare support, which includes guidance on direct financial support. </p>  <p>  The most prominent form of such support is the aftercare allowance, which is provided to cover a young person&rsquo;s day to day costs as they progress in education or accredited training. The core age range for eligibility for aftercare is 18 to 21 years of age. Specific legislative provision is in place for aftercare to continue until a young person is 23 years of age where they are finishing a course of education. For those young adults who are not in education / training at 18 years, aftercare services support them in accessing any relevant financial allowances and support to which they may be entitled from the Department of Social Protection or other agencies. The amount of financial support an adult will receive at 18 years and the relevant agency or Department will be specific to each adult&rsquo;s circumstances.</p>  <p>  It is considered prudent to ensure the aftercare service is fully delivered, in so far as is possible, and providing measurable and improved outcomes for those transitioning from State care before considering any extension to the relevant age cohort. It will also be necessary to develop a firm evidence base indicating that raising the age criteria is of benefit. Furthermore, the resource implications of extending the cohort eligible for aftercare planning and support would need to explicitly determined, agreed with relevant actors and budgeted for in advance of any consideration to change the qualifying age groups.  </p></reply>

These apprentices were registered across 24 different apprenticeship programmes in areas as diverse as cybersecurity, accounting technician, recruitment, heavy vehicle mechanics and stonecutting and stonemasonry.  This number grew to 769 apprentices i.e. almost 4% of the apprentice population when commercial semi-state organisations are included.  </p><p>A breakdown of the number of apprentices that have been employed across the public sector for each year since 2011 is attached.  The Government has committed to increasing the number of apprentices employed in the public sector and this will be addressed in the forthcoming Action Plan on Apprenticeship.</p><p>The information sought in relation to those apprentices who have been temporarily laid off throughout the pandemic is not collected in the format requested by the Deputy.  However, there are currently 49 apprentices recorded as being redundant due to COVID-19 with another 111 recorded as being on temporary lay-off. It is important to note that not all employers inform SOLAS when they temporarily lay-off an apprentice.</p><p>As of February 2021 there are 6,928 apprentices from 5 craft programmes on waiting lists for off-the-job training. Over 1,800 of these have been waiting for more than one year.  SOLAS and the HEA are working with the education and training providers to identify a route to a phased return to onsite activity in order to allow for some craft apprentices, including those who were close to assessment, to be prioritised for return to onsite activity and completion of practical course elements.  This work will also include medium term solutions to addressing the existing backlogs for off-the-job training. </p><p>The Government has committed to the delivery of a new Action Plan for Apprenticeship within the coming weeks. The Action Plan will set out measures to widen employer engagement with apprenticeship in both the public and private sectors with the target of reaching 10,000 new apprentice registrations per annum by 2025. </p></reply>

Training activity should be in accordance with the COVID safety arrangements developed by SOLAS and limited to the level absolutely necessary and time-critical. In addition the following requirements are to be met by SOLAS:-</p>  <p>  1. ensure training is limited to workers engaged in essential construction work,</p>  <p>  2. ensure training is limited to those not currently holding valid cards, and</p>  <p>  3. approve the running of Safe Pass courses on a case by case basis based on 1 and 2 &ndash; training providers must inform SOLAS in advance of their plans to run a course and demonstrate the immediate requirement for the training.</p>  <p>  SOLAS is continuing  to work on the development of an alternative delivery model which is equitable with existing Safe Pass, CSCS and QSCS course delivery, in being accessible to all eligible workers, providing real time course participant supports and ensuring assessment integrity.</p></reply>

This package includes additional funding of &euro;3m to underpin wellbeing and mental health and student services in our higher education institutions (HEIs), and is in addition to the &euro;2m that was allocated in Budget 2020. This funding is enabling institutions to enhance their student facing services, such as by employing additional student Counsellors and Assistant Psychologists.</p>  <p>  The HEA wrote to all HEIs in 2020 setting each institutions funding allocation towards student support and mental health and wellbeing and the conditions attaching to the funding, including a request that the HEIs distribute it in support of specific student facing areas such as the recruitment of additional Student Counsellors, and implementation of the National Student Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Framework, which I launched last year.</p>  <p>  This Framework is Ireland&rsquo;s first ever national approach to address student mental health and suicide prevention. The Framework delivers on a commitment to develop national guidelines for the higher education institutions (HEIs) in relation to suicide risk and critical incident response, thereby helping to address any gaps which might exist in the prevention of suicide in higher education. The Framework additionally recognises the many challenges students face, and sets out ways in which institutions can support and respond through working proactively to maximise mental health and wellbeing.</p>  <p>  The Framework provides very clear guidance to higher education institutions regarding implementation of good practices in responding to student mental health difficulties. The HEA has partnered with the HSE National Office for Suicide Prevention and Psychological Counsellors in Higher Education Ireland (PCHEI) in providing training in a specialist suicide assessment and management approach. Over 300 psychologists and counsellors across 26 higher education institutions are currently undertaking Collaborative Assessment and Management of Suicidality training, a first in world at this scale across a sector.  The CAMS approach is supported by over 70 studies and given the origins of its development was a university mental health setting, it fits well in a higher education context.  This is further support for student counselling services to meet the complex and challenging needs that present on campuses at an increasing rate in the past number of years.  This also addresses Goal 5 in the Department of Health&rsquo;s Connecting for Life &ndash; Ireland&rsquo;s National Strategy to Reduce Suicide 2015-2020: "To ensure safe and high-quality services for people vulnerable to suicide."  Together with the crisis text line 50808 that I launched in October 2020, I'm confident that capacity to respond to students experiencing high distress and mental health difficulties has been significantly improved over the past 6 months. </p>  <p>  Funding has also helped develop the student counselling services across the Higher Education sector in many ways besides student counsellor resourcing. For example, some institutions have developed new roles of Assistant Psychologist, Student Support Officer and Mental Health Advisors for student mental health supports. Heads of Services have been appointed or further resourced. </p>  <p>I'm very encouraged that the Framework and the additional funding has had immediate impact. The increased capacity has created a lot of activity in outreach to students:   online support groups (anxiety support, mood management) ; open, drop in groups to support connection/reduce isolation and loneliness; groups specifically targeting international students, 1st year students and postgraduates. The additional funding has also supported a very significant increase in workshops being offered such as on resilience; managing fear/anxiety/uncertainty; grief and loss during the pandemic; motivation/staying engaged with college.</p></reply>

A grant will not be paid to a student for a repeat period of study on the same course, or for a different course at the same level, irrespective of whether or not a grant was paid previously.  However, once an equivalent period of study has been completed on the new course, the student may be eligible for student grant assistance for the remainder of the course. </p>  <p>  However, under Article 15(8) of the Student Grant Scheme 2020, the awarding authority SUSI (Student Universal Support Ireland) has discretion to award a grant for a repeat period of study in exceptional circumstances which impacted on a student completing a particular period of study or undertaking exams in lien with guidelines drawn up by the Minister.

This includes the consideration of issues around on-site access for practical work for students. The national co-ordination group for further and higher education is also meeting on a regular basis, and is closely monitoring the impact that Covid-19 is having on third level institutions and their students.</p>  <p>  From the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, significant work has been undertaken by a stakeholder group chaired by Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI), and including the representative bodies of education providers and students to address issues relating to the maintenance of the quality and standards of:</p>  <p>  - teaching and learning, </p>  <p>  - assessment, and </p>  <p>  - qualifications. </p>  <p>  This group has focused on the implementation of alternative arrangements and methods of delivery, where appropriate and necessary, to meet both these standards and, where applicable, the educational accreditation criteria established by Professional Recognition Bodies (PRBs).</p>  <p>  The government&rsquo;s Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business and Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021, Plan for Living with COVID-19, combined with the HSA Return to Work Protocols and ongoing Public Health advice, provide the over-arching framework for all sectors of society for the operation of their facilities and premises in keeping with public health advice.</p>  <p>  Specific to further and higher education, the government has also published &ldquo;Guidance for Further and Higher Education for returning to on-site activity in 2020: Roadmap and COVID-19 Adaptation Framework for returning to on-site activity in autumn 2020&rdquo; accompanied by &ldquo;Implementation Guidelines for Public Health Measures in Higher Education Institutions (HEIs)&rdquo; and outbreaks protocols developed in collaboration with experts within the higher education sector and with the Department of Health. This suite of guidance provides robust advice to higher and further educational facilities on COVID-19 prevention measures, implementation of which will minimise the risk of infection for all students and staff. Further and Higher Education Institutes should adapt and customise these recommendations for their own particular settings, adhering at all times to the overarching Public Health principles on which the guidance is predicated.</p>  <p>  As Higher Education Institutions are autonomous, and as such are academically independent and are entitled to regulate their own academic affairs and administrative processes, including in relation to access to laboratory facilities, and as there are a wide range of courses with practical laboratory elements, students are encouraged to approach their institutions directly if they have any queries in relation to the lab-based elements of their course.  </p>  <p>  However, my Department is continuing to work with all stakeholders to identify mitigating actions which can be implemented.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-02-17a.1571.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1624" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021021700081#WRAA04800"><p>As Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Skills, I am committed to continuing the process of investing in our higher education system and to the development and implementation of a sustainable funding model for the sector.  </p>  <p>  It is important to note that, in considering the total level of resource available to the sector, Universities are autonomous bodies under legislation and have significant income streams from activities perused through academic freedom. </p>  <p>  Government investment in Higher Education is not specifically allocated against a per student metric and state investment in the sector is not limited to the recurrent grant funding of institutions. The provision of Higher Education funding on an annual basis is part of overall expenditure management and budgetary policy for Government.</p>  <p>  In this regard, Government provides financial support to the higher education sector through direct through recurrent grants, and indirectly through a number of specific parameters including free fees, policy initiatives, Springboard, Human Capital Initiative, SUSI fee supports.  </p>  <p>  The student contribution, as paid annually by undergraduate students not in receipt of SUSI grants, is another element of the total resources available to the higher education sector. Other income available to the institutions includes fees collected from tuition fees, part-time courses, postgraduate course fees and other onsite/offsite commercial activities. My Department does not have oversight of these funding arrangements.</p>  <p>  Since 2015 there has been a significant programme of re-investment in higher education. Funding and policy developments taken in recent Budgets have taken significant steps to address the funding needs of the sector.  Most notably, and in line with the recommendation of the Cassells report, a new stream of employer funding was introduced upon a review of the National Training Fund. This level of investment responded to demographic pressures and underpinned a range of initiatives in the higher education sector, including a new research initiative, a substantial investment in the evolution of Technological Universities,  significant skills-enhancing opportunities for individuals, sectors and regions most vulnerable to Brexit as well as updating skills more generally to prepare Ireland&rsquo;s society and economy for a future world of work transformed by technology and automation.</p>  <p>  Government funding demonstrably increased in the period 2016 to 2020 with increased planned investment in Higher Education, an increase of 25% compared to 2016 &ndash; an amount in the order of an additional &euro;370 million bringing the total funding for the sector in 2020 to &euro;1.87 billion pre-Covid (up from &euro;1.5 billion in 2016). This represented the restoration of the peak level of expenditure on higher education achieved in 2008.</p>  <p>  In 2021, in line with the two distinct policy goals that will need to be addressed in budgetary decisions over the medium term, additional funding had been provided for the core budgetary programmes and funding for Covid-19 related policy responses. Exclusive of research provision the total planned Departmental and NTF funding of the HE sector for 2021 is in the order of &euro;1.98billion.</p>  <p>  This includes:</p>  <p>  - Recurrent Grant and Free Fees Funding of over &euro;1.06 billion.</p>  <p>  - National Training Fund Enterprise Focused, Apprenticeship, Springboard and HCI investment of over &euro;305million.</p>  <p>  - Student support and related expenses provision of over &euro;400million.</p>  <p>  Through Budget 2021 funding will be provided to meet demographic and other pressures across the sectors, including Covid-19 impacts, and to provide for additional upskilling and reskilling opportunities, as well as increased capacity and places in the higher education sector. </p>  <p>  In terms of Government funding the immediate matter to consider is that the delivery of further and higher education in the context of Covid-19 will cost the providers more not less. In 2020 the Government has provided funding in the amount of &euro;168m to support the return of students to further and higher education. A further &euro;47.5m is also being provided in 2020 to provide additional skills courses as part of the July stimulus programme. The Government has also made available once off funding to provide financial assistance in academic year 2020/21 to all students who avail of SUSI grants and to all EU full-time undergraduate and postgraduate students attending publicly funded Higher Education Institutions in the state. </p>  <p>  I am confident that the significant additional funding already committed is delivering real benefits on the ground.  However there is always a need to look to the future.  This is why I am progressing the development of a sustainable funding model for higher education.  This is essential in light of the centrality of higher education - both in terms of human capital development, research and innovation - to underpinning the future development of Ireland as a knowledge economy against the backdrop of rapid technological change. </p>  <p>  In that context, the future funding needs of the sector are currently under further review through the Departments engagement with the European Commission/DG Reform. The review is a comprehensive economic evaluation of the various funding options presented in the Cassells Expert Group Report and is being undertaken by an expert independent international consortium of consultants including Indecon and LE Europe.</p>  <p>  Department officials are working closely with the European Commission and the independently appointed consortia of consultants.  The key aim of this review is to investigate methods of increasing the sustainability of higher and further education provision in Ireland, including an examination of the funding options. This review commenced in early 2020 and work is expected to be complete towards the latter part of Q2 2021.</p>  <p>  Department officials will continue to work with stakeholders on this comprehensive analysis of funding options for higher education and the assessment of the appropriate balance in provision across the tertiary education system. </p>  <p>  Completion of this work will allow for an informed debate on the appropriate policy approach to future planning and funding of higher and further education provision which is fundamental to Ireland's economic and social sustainability.</p>  <p>  All of the foregoing highlights my commitment and that of Government to support students and learners in accessing and successfully participating in both higher and further </p></reply>

The training for employment allocation provides &euro;198.4m for the funding of the apprenticeship programme through both SOLAS and the Higher Education Authority.

Both NUTS 2 Regions were categorised as more developed regions, attracting a 50% ESF cofinancing rate and a 66.67% YEI cofinancing rate. </p>  <p>  Reflecting the changes introduced to Ireland's regional structure this will change for the 2021-2027 period, to three NUTS 2 regions, the Southern Region, the Eastern and Midland Region and the Northern and Western Region.   As the Deputy notes, the Northern and Western Region is being categorised as a transition region and will attract a higher ESF cofinancing rate of 60% while the other regions will be cofinanced at 40%.</p>  <p>While the 2014-2020 ESF Programme had indicative allocations by NUTS 2 Region, the Programme has been amended on a number of occasions, most recently to avail of the additional flexibilities, delivered through two Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative (CRII and CRII+) packages, in which Member States could re-programme existing allocations of funding towards the Covid 19 response, at a co-financing rate of 100%.  &euro;60m ESF funding was reallocated to the ERDF to support the  purchase of PPE for the Health Services and we will be drawing down the full ESF/YEI allocations on fewer programmed activities.</p>  <p>  At the end of 2020, the share of BMW expenditure declared in payment applications to the European Commission accounted for 17% of the total expenditure declared.  It should be noted that expenditure in the BMW region was only reported with effect from 2016 as the earlier 2007-2013 ESF Programme ran for a further 2 years in the BMW than in the other regions. </p>  <p>In relation to 2021-2027   Ireland is expected to receive &euro;451m for the European Social Fund+ (ESF+) with an initial ESF+ allocation for the transition region &ndash; the Northern and Western Region of &euro;125,659,754 with the remaining &euro;325,412,787 allocated across the two more developed Regions. However, the Regulations governing the funds, which are nearing finalisation, provide for a number of flexibilities, including transferring allocations between Funds and Regions.   The final allocation between programmes and regions will be determined in the context of discussions with the European Commission on the Partnership Agreement covering all Common Provisions Regulation funds.  </p>  <p>  The Northern and Western region&rsquo;s status as a transition region is being taken into account in the planning of the 2021-2027 programme. An independent Needs Analysis was conducted by Indecon Economic Consultants to provide the evidence base for the future ERDF and ESF+ programmes. The report includes an analysis of regional disparities and the particular challenges faced by each region. Given the reclassification of the Northern and Western region, a specific chapter is dedicated to the past performance and the particular needs of this region. This issue will continue to be taken into account in the drafting and finalisation of the ESF+ programme.</p></reply>

They work in a challenging environment and deal with vulnerable people on a daily basis. Their exceptional commitment has been particularly clear throughout the pandemic, during which they have played a vital part in preventing the spread of COVID-19. </p>  <p>  All applications for a certificate of naturalisation are processed and assessed individually in accordance with legislation. There are no provisions to apply different criteria depending on the category of employment of the applicant and statistics are not maintained by the Immigration Service of my Department to enable me to provide details of the profession of applicants. All applicants are required to meet minimum periods of reckonable residence and standard checks are carried out as part of the overall process to maintain its integrity.</p>  <p>  I am conscious that a significant backlog has built up regarding the granting of citizenships due to the inability to hold in person ceremonies during COVID-19. Unfortunately, the pandemic has prevented the holding of such ceremonies, which are usually attended by hundreds of people and which have become a welcome addition to our public and civic life.</p>  <p>  I was pleased to announce last month that a temporary system is now in place that will enable citizenship applicants to complete their naturalisation process by signing a statutory declaration of loyalty. This signed statutory declaration replaces the requirement for citizenship applicants to attend citizenship ceremonies, which have been temporarily suspended during COVID-19. </p>  <p>  Under the temporary new system, up to 4,000 qualifying applicants will be asked to complete a statutory declaration that will be sent to them by email from the Citizenship Division of the Immigration Service of my Department and bring it to one of the listed designated officials. The designated official must witness the applicant sign the statutory declaration. The applicant must then send the signed statutory declaration, the appropriate fee and any other requested documentation to Citizenship Division. Final processing will then take place and a certificate of naturalisation, will be sent to the applicant.</p>  <p>  The new system is in place from 18 January 2021, and my Department will communicate with applicants regarding the requirements, on a phased basis over the next few months until in-person citizenship ceremonies are able to recommence.</p>  <p>  It is expected that the 4,000 applicants currently waiting on naturalisation will have been provided with an opportunity to gain citizenship by the end of March and I am pleased to say that more than 500 certificates have recently issued. A significant number of healthcare and other frontline workers who have made extraordinary contributions during the pandemic  will also benefit from these new arrangements over the coming weeks and months.</p>  <p>  It remains my intention that large scale ceremonies will recommence once circumstances allow. Since their establishment in 2011, citizenship ceremonies have been joyous occasions which mark the granting of Irish citizenships in a dignified manner and they have become a welcome addition to our public and civic life. In-person ceremonies have been provisionally scheduled to resume in December 2021, subject to the safety of all involved being assured.</p>  <p>  In addition to the provision of an alternative platform to large-scale citizenship ceremonies, work is well advanced on the following suite of measures designed to deal with the current unprecedented level of demand being witnessed:</p>  <p>  - Additional staffing resources are being assigned  to the Citizenship Division. Attendant to this development, restructuring of the organisational structure of the Division is currently underway to ensure optimal customer service delivery. </p>  <p>  - In the context of communications, the Citizenship website has been significantly revamped to make it more user friendly, As part of this process, a new online chat conversation application, or &ldquo;Chatbot&rdquo; called Tara was introduced last December. This provides users with an instant response to frequently asked questions and mimics real-time text or message exchanges with a member of staff. There have been over 10,000 interactions on the Chatbot since it launched.  </p>  <p>  - Plans for the digitalisation of the naturalisation process are also well advanced, through increased digital and ICT investment. As part of this process, eTax-clearance for citizenship applicants has been introduced. Online payments have been trialled for applications from minors and the process is currently being rolled out to adult applications on a phased basis.</p>  <p>  The end result of the digitisation process will be to free up additional resources to focus on enhanced customer service delivery, ensuring the integrity of the process is protected and processing applications in a timely and efficient manner. </p></reply>

My objective is to deliver a new approach to policing and community safety, increasing police visibility in communities and focusing on preventing crime and harm, and delivering a professional, ethical, modern and effective police and security service that is well-managed, cost-effective, properly trained and equipped, and is clearly accountable.</p><p>I will shortly bring the draft scheme of a new Policing and Community Safety Bill to Government.  The Bill has been developed based on the recommendations of the Commission on the Future of Policing. </p><p>The Bill has five main objectives to improve the performance of our policing and security services to deliver our commitment that every community has a right to be and feel safe. This legislation will:</p><p>1. Make community safety an all of government responsibility </p><p>2. Strengthen independent, external oversight of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na</p><p>3. Strengthen the governance of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na </p><p>4. Improve the oversight of our national security infrastructure </p><p>5. Establish and prioritise the creation of Local Community Safety Partnerships</p><p>To deliver on our objective that every community has a right to be safe, we will put safety and perception of safety of communities at the heart of this legislation.  Ensuring that a community can get the right support at the right time is important if we want to tackle crime with a coherent approach.  This means ensuring that the non-crime related activity of harm prevention, such as providing services to people with mental health and addiction conditions, homeless people, children, elderly and others at risk, is properly addressed. </p><p>In the Bill, the prevention of harm will be a specific objective of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na recognising the vital work Garda&iacute; do on the ground every day.  Furthermore, promoting safer communities through preventing crime and harm - particularly to individuals who are vulnerable or at risk - will be a shared responsibility involving other Departments and agencies such as health and social services, local authorities and the wider community working together.</p><p>I can further inform the Deputy that my Department has developed a Community Safety Policy, based on the recommendations of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, and which has informed the drafting of the Policing and Community Safety Bill.</p><p>Local Community Safety Partnerships are the new local structures proposed in the Community Safety Policy. These Partnerships will operate at local authority administrative level and replace and build upon Joint Policing Committees. They will be made up of local representatives, local services, community representatives and residents. Local Community Safety Partnerships will take a strategic approach to their work so that issues arising can be dealt with in a coordinated manner, and addressed collectively by relevant service providers in partnership with the community.

This process determines whether a complaint is about behaviour which would, if proven, constitute a criminal offence or a breach of Garda discipline by a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p><p>Criminal investigations by GSOC are conducted in accordance with Section 98 of the Act. All allegations of criminal offences by Garda&iacute; (for example assault) are investigated by GSOC&rsquo;s own investigators.</p><p>There are three ways allegations of breaches of discipline can be handled:</p><p><b>1. Unsupervised disciplinary investigations </b>(under section 94 (1) of the Act) are conducted by Garda superintendents in line with the Garda Discipline Regulations.  The Protocols between GSOC and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na say that unsupervised investigations must be completed and a final report issued to GSOC within 16 weeks. An example of the kind of case that is investigated in this way is an allegation that there was abuse of authority in the manner in which an arrest was conducted. The local intervention process allows for the resolution of some complaints at a local level; complaints resolved in this way do not become the subject of formal investigation.  </p><p><b>2. Supervised disciplinary investigations </b>(under section 94(5) of the Act) are also conducted by Garda superintendents but are supervised by GSOC investigators who meet with the Garda superintendents to agree an investigation plan. The GSOC investigator can direct and partake in the investigative actions, and must receive interim reports. The Protocols say that supervised disciplinary investigations must be completed and an investigation report provided within 20 weeks. Supervised investigations are appropriate in more serious allegations of neglect of duty, for example, lack of, or insufficient, investigation of a serious crime reported to Garda&iacute;.</p><p><b>3. Non-criminal investigation by GSOC </b>(under section 95 of the Act) &ndash; Certain cases which do not appear to involve criminal offences, but which may involve disciplinary and/or systemic matters, are undertaken by the Garda Ombudsman&rsquo;s own investigators. Disciplinary investigations which follow on from criminal investigations would be among this kind of non-criminal investigation undertaken by GSOC investigators. </p></reply>

All fatal shootings are deeply distressing, and I know that the local community are experiencing real trauma as a result of these events.</p>  <p>  As is the case in every incident involving a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that results in the death of a person, the shooting is being fully and independently investigated by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission (GSOC), which is chaired by a High Court Judge, the Hon Ms Justice Mary Ellen Ring. </p>  <p>  Such incidents are very rare in Ireland but all are fully investigated independently. GSOC have written to my Department to confirm that they have begun a criminal investigation under section 98 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act, 2005. As the Deputy may be aware, GSOC can make wider systemic recommendations on issues they investigate and they are free to do that in this instance also.  </p>  <p>  I know that Garda&iacute; have also been engaging with the local community with regard to the trauma caused by the incident, and family liaison officers from both GSOC and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are available to the Nkencho family. </p>  <p>  At the same time, Garda&iacute; are investigating the incidents at Hartstown Shopping Centre and the events leading to the shooting. There are well established protocols in place between GSOC and the Garda&iacute; to allow these parallel but separate investigations to take place.</p>  <p>  As this tragic event is the subject of  separate and independent investigations, it would not be appropriate for me to comment further as I do not wish to pre-empt the outcome of these investigations. </p></reply>

Webwise will also be working to update their &lsquo;Be in Ctrl&rsquo; and &lsquo;Connected&rsquo; programmes to ensure they reflect the new legislative landscape.</p>  <p>It is also my intention to develop an awareness campaign to draw attention to both the commencement of Coco&rsquo;s law and the penalties applicable if convicted of the sharing intimate images without consent and to draw attention to the harm caused to the victim whose intimate image is shared.</p></reply>

However, processing rates have unfortunately been negatively impacted by the attendant health and safety related restrictions.</p>  <p>  Applications for naturalisation and general queries are currently being dealt with in chronological order. Due to the restrictions imposed by the Covid-19 pandemic and the attendant requirement to comply with public health guidelines, significant delays are being experienced in general processing, particularly those functions which require a staff presence in the office. The Citizenship Division of the Immigration Service of my Department is working very hard to maintain as prompt a service delivery as possible, under the circumstances.</p>  <p>  Under normal circumstances, passports are returned approximately 10 days after their receipt.  However, the current limits on staff attendance in the office has resulted in delays in the return of some passports. If the person concerned sends the post tracking reference by email to the citizenship helpdesk citizenshipinfo@justice.ie, the Division can confirm whether the documents have arrived to the office.</p>  <p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility at INISOireachtasMail@justice.ie, which has been specifically established for this purpose. This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Question process.

The Property Services Regulatory Authority (PSRA) is the independent statutory body established under the Property Services (Regulation) Act 2011, with responsibility to licence and regulate property services providers (auctioneers, estate agents, letting agents and property management agents).</p>  <p>  To be of assistance, I have contacted the Property Services Regulatory Authority (PSRA) and brought this matter to their attention.  The PSRA has supplied the following information about the current guidance developed by them in this regard.</p>  <p>  On 19 May 2020, the PSRA in association with the Institute of Professional Auctioneers &amp;amp; Valuers (IPAV) and the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland (SCSI) issued the Joint Sector Protocol for Property Services Providers (PSPs). The Protocol is intended to ensure strict precautions are taken to provide the highest standards of safety in the sales, lettings, valuations and managements of properties for clients, consumers, employees, employers and those who are categorised as being at risk or at high risk of Covid-19.</p>  <p>  This document gives detailed guidelines for consideration prior to arranging a viewing of a property, what happens during a viewing, post viewing tasks and what to do when a rental agreement is reached including:</p>  <p>  - Confirm whether the respective client is cocooning or in an at risk category and if so, identify any additional precautionary measures that may be required.</p>  <p>  - Agree with the owner/occupier that they will not be in the property at the time of viewing.</p>  <p>  - Agree with owner/occupier and note all touch points in the dwelling for the property service provider (PSP) to sanitise after viewing (e.g. door handles, light switches etc.).</p>  <p>  - Agree with the owner/occupier the use of official Covid-19 signage at locations throughout the property to act as a useful reminder to viewers to follow the HSE rules.</p>  <p>  - Pre-booked private appointment viewings only.</p>  <p>  - Contact viewer(s) in advance to confirm booking and advise of controls in place, and that HSE Covid-19 official instructions must be adhered to during viewings.</p>  <p>  - PSPs should ask viewers to remain a reasonable distance from the property (e.g. remain in car) until given permission by the PSP to enter the property.</p>  <p>  Following on from the Governments publication of the Plan for Living with Covid-19, the PSRA in association with IPAV and SCSI published the Property Services Providers Guidance to implementing the Plan for Living with Covid-19 which set out additional measures to be undertaken at the different levels outlined within the Plan.  An updated version of this Guidance issued in January 2021, to take into account the enhanced restrictions currently in place.</p>  <p>  Both the Protocol and the Guidance are subject to the Government, HSE and Department of Health guidelines on these matters. The full documents are available to view on the Property Services Regulatory Authority website at: www.psr.ie.</p>  <p>  The Property Services Providers Guidance to implementing the Plan for Living with Covid-19 details the measures that must be taken at each level of Covid restrictions as directed by government and property service providers should adapt as government restriction levels are updated.</p></reply>

The legal framework which assists the Garda&iacute; in tackling this type of crime includes provisions under the Criminal Damage Act 1991; the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994; the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003; and the Intoxicating Liquor Acts 2003 and 2008.</p>  <p>  I understand that Garda management engages with transport operators and that a range of regional and local operations have been put in place to address incidents and issues that have arisen at specific locations.  I am further informed that there is ongoing communication between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the respective control centres, and access to good quality CCTV can provide assistance to Garda&iacute; when investigating serious incidents.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that they are not in a position to provide the number of reports of physical assaults, sexual assaults, harassment, intimidation and public order breaches on public transport in the Dublin Metropolitan Region in the years in question, as there are no specific location types on PULSE for trains, Luas trams, buses or coaches etc.  It would require a substantial manual trawl of narratives to try to identify whether incidents occurred on some mode of public transport, which would require a disproportionate amount of time and resources.</p></reply>

It was only after all protection elements had been refused that permission to remain could be considered, under the process provided for under section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended).</p><p>Under that process, permission to remain could be granted where a decision was taken that, based on the circumstances of the individual case, a Deportation Order should not be made and instead permission to remain in the State should be granted. Any such decision would be based on the exercise of ministerial discretion. In the context of the question asked by the Deputy I can advise that there are no separate categories of &ldquo;exceptional measure&rdquo; or &ldquo;exceptional circumstance&rdquo; under which such a decision might be made.</p><p>Between 2015 and 2020 permission to remain in the State, as outlined in the table below, was granted in the context of persons who had had an application for international protection (incorporating both refugee status and subsidiary protection) refused under the processes provided for under the Refugee Act 1996 and the Subsidiary Protection Regulations 2006 and 2013.</p><p><b>Table 1 </b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th>Number</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2015</td>       <td>1244</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016</td>       <td>488</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017</td>       <td>184</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>228</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>75</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020</td>       <td>56</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total</td>       <td>2275</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>For people whose applications for international protection were determined under the provisions of the International Protection Act 2015, there is scope to be granted permission to remain in the State, under section 49(4) of that Act, while they have an international protection appeal pending. The provisions of this Act came into force on 31 December 2016, therefore figures for permission to remain under section 49 of that Act will only be available in respect of the years from 2017 onwards.</p><p>Under the 2015 Act, permission to remain in the State may be granted at first instance or following a formal permission to remain review mechanism.

I have no plans to publish this document.</p>  <p>  Despite the increase in prisoner numbers here in 2019, the Deputy may be interested to note that according to the Council of Europe Annual Penal Statistics, known as the SPACE Report, the rate of imprisonment in Ireland per 100,000 in 2019 was 81.2. This is considerably lower than the average rate across the member states of the Council of Europe which was 125.9.</p>  <p>  In general terms, demographics can have an impact on the prison population but is only one variable which includes; socio-economic developments, crime rate, Garda activity, criminal justice policy and legislation, Courts activity and policy decisions on release.</p></reply>

Passport holders of the following countries are now required to apply for an entry visa or transit visa, as appropriate, before travelling to Ireland:</p><p>- Brazil</p><p>- South Africa</p><p>- Argentina</p><p>- Bolivia</p><p>- Chile</p><p>- Colombia (transit visa now required &ndash; this country was already subject to entry visa requirements)</p><p>- Ecuador (transit visa now required &ndash; this country was already subject to entry visa requirements)</p><p>- Guyana</p><p>- Paraguay</p><p>- Peru (transit visa now required &ndash; this country was already subject to entry visa requirements)</p><p>- Suriname (transit visa now required &ndash; this country was already subject to entry visa requirements)</p><p>- Uruguay</p><p>In addition to the visa requirements above, my Department has temporarily ceased accepting new visa/preclearance applications, with effect from close of business on 29 January 2021, with the exception of those applications which are considered priority/emergency applications. This list includes the following:</p><p>- Workers or self-employed persons exercising critical occupations including healthcare workers, frontier and posted workers as well as seasonal workers as referred to in the Guidelines concerning the exercise of the free movement of workers during the COVID-19 outbreak;</p><p>- Transport workers or transport service providers, including drivers of freight vehicles carrying goods for use in the territory as well as those merely transiting;</p><p>- Patients travelling for imperative medical reasons;</p><p>- Pupils, students and trainees who travel abroad on a daily basis and third-country nationals travelling for the purpose of 3rd level study;</p><p>- Persons travelling for imperative family or business reasons;</p><p>- Diplomats, staff of international organisations and people invited by international organisations whose physical presence is required for the well-functioning of these organisations, military personnel and police officers, and humanitarian aid workers and civil protection personnel in the exercise of their functions;</p><p>- Passengers in transit;</p><p>- Seafarers;</p><p>- Journalists, when performing their duties.</p><p>These measures are designed to support our public health restrictions on movement, including into and out of Ireland. The travel restrictions and the measures introduced as part of the Government&rsquo;s efforts to interrupt the transmission of COVID-19, mean that travel may not be possible and, even if possible, is not advisable unless absolutely essential. It is currently against the law for any person (regardless of nationality or passport) to travel within Ireland for non-essential purposes and people can be fined for doing so. Enforcement of this measure has been strongly increased over the last few days. </p><p>The strong advice therefore is that everyone, regardless of their nationality or visa/preclearance status, or where they started from, who cannot provide proof of an essential purpose to travel to or within Ireland, should not travel to Ireland.</p><p>The situation will continue to be reviewed by the Government in consultation with the relevant authorities in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

People with diabetes are unable to metabolize glucose appropriately and as a result, blood glucose levels remain above normal levels and over time can damage blood vessels. This can lead to long-term damage and disabling and potentially fatal health complications. In high-income countries, including Ireland, diabetes is a leading cause of cardiovascular disease, blindness, kidney failure and lower-limb amputation.</p>  <p>  The most common form of diabetes is type 2, which typically occurs in adults, although it is increasingly seen in young people, including children. Type 1 diabetes typically occurs in children or young people. The third main type of diabetes is gestational diabetes, which occurs because the action of insulin is impaired during pregnancy. Gestational diabetes is becoming increasingly common against rising levels of overweight and obesity as key risk factors. Those with type 1 diabetes require a regular supply of insulin, while type 2 diabetes is largely preventable and complications can be avoided or delayed through a combination of lifestyle changes, medications or insulin therapy, depending on the status of the condition and the stage of the disease in the person concerned.</p>  <p>  Globally, the number of people with diabetes has doubled during the past 20 years, making it one of the most important public health challenges facing national health care systems today. The International Diabetes Federation has recently (2019) estimated that approximately 463 million adults (20-79 years) were living with diabetes globally and that by 2045 this will rise to 700 million. In Ireland it is estimated that there are 190,000 people with diabetes. Approximately 30,000 (15%) of these have Type 1 diabetes, or genetic or secondary causes of diabetes. The remaining 160,000 (85%) patients have Type 2 diabetes with a significant proportion of these patients remaining undiagnosed. It is expected that the number of people with Type 2 diabetes will increase by 60% over the next 10-15 years.</p>  <p>  The challenge posed by the changing disease burden has been recognized globally, with diabetes featuring high on national and international agendas including the World Health Organisation and the European Commission. At national level countries in Europe have made progress towards developing a systematic policy response to the diabetes burden. Effective treatment reduces the risk of disability or fatal complications and its optimal management requires coordinated inputs from a wide range of health professionals, access to essential medicines and monitoring, and, ideally, a system that promotes patient empowerment and well-coordinated care. In that context in Ireland the HSE Clinical Programme in Diabetes leads the multidisciplinary coordinated response to the challenges posed by diabetes in Ireland and I have asked them to examine the matters raised by the Deputy and provide a response to him as soon as possible. </p></reply>

These resources should be directed towards interventions and strategies which are most likely to reduce problem substance use and improve public health. </p>  <p>  As committed by the Programme for Government, Budget 2021 allocated an additional &euro;1m for targeted drug and alcohol initiatives through the network of drug and alcohol task forces.</p>  <p>  The impact of problem drug and alcohol use is a national issue, affecting people from all walks of life. Accordingly, the Department is committed to a population-based approach to allocating resources for drug and alcohol services. This will ensure funding is allocated on an equitable and rational basis in accordance with health and social needs.</p>  <p>  The allocation of the additional funding will also be informed by the priorities arising from the mid-term review of the national drugs strategy, which my Department is undertaking in conjunction with stakeholders.</p>  <p>  I value the contribution of drug and alcohol task forces to tackling problem substance use and look forward to working with them to maximise the impact of the additional resources provided in Budget 2021.</p></reply>

At that time, emergency legislation was introduced which amended all the regulatory acts to provide for a COVID-19 specific register to which no fees would be attached.  The Act provided that the COVID-19 registration would end on 31 July 2020, but that this could be extended by means of Ministerial order.  Orders were made in July, 2020 extending the temporary registrations to 31 December 2020, and again in December further extending to 30 June 2021 the temporary registration provisions relating to medical practitioners, pharmacists and CORU registrants.  </p>  <p>  Given that nursing and midwifery registration is based on a calendar year, an Order was not needed in July extending these to end December 2020, but rather the Irish Nursing and Midwifery Board (NMBI) was able to deal with such registrations ( including any new applications ) under its existing legislation. This continues to be the position and I can confirm that retired nurses who wish to assist with the COVID-19 pandemic response , including the vaccination programme, can avail of temporary restoration to the NMBI register free of charge. The NMBI has informed my Department that it is currently working with the HSE and other employers to facilitate speedy restoration in these cases. As part of this, the NMBI is currently updating the registration system MyNMBI so that, from Monday 1 March 2021, fees will be waived automatically upon restoration. In addition, the NMBI is also now making arrangements to refund fees paid by some registrants who may not have been aware of the availability of free temporary restoration for purposes of assisting with the COVID-19 pandemic response. Those wishing to restore on MyNMBI and who need support with the process can contact the NMBI directly at IEReg@nmbi.ie. </p>  <p>  Finally, to clarify the general position applying to restoration to the Register. It is open to a nurse or midwife to apply at any time to be removed from the Register of the NMBI , for example on retirement. This is categorised as a voluntary removal and such registrants who later wish to be restored need only to pay the annual renewal fee of &euro;100 , which is the same amount as all other current registrants.  Those registrants who have been removed from the register following non-payment of the renewal fee of &euro;100, and who later wish to be restored, incur an additional administration charge of &euro;250 in addition to the annual fee of &euro;100.</p></reply>

Ensuring that all women who develop mesh-related complications receive high quality, multi-disciplinary and patient-centred care is a priority for me and my Department. I would assure the Deputy that considerable work has been done to date in this country and continues to progress on patient safety in relation to mesh implants. </p><p>Uro-Gynaecological (Transvaginal) Mesh is used in the surgical treatment of Stress Urinary Incontinence (SUI) and Pelvic Organ Prolapse (POP) in women and such mesh devices have been widely used for this over the past two decades. Mesh devices continue to be placed on the market for use within the EU as they continue to be certified by European device regulatory competent authorities as being compliant with relevant EU legislation. </p><p>I am aware that in response to concerns raised in late 2017, the then Minister for Health requested the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) to prepare a report on the clinical and technical issues involved in ensuring both the safe and effective provision of mesh procedures in urogynaecology and an appropriate response to women who suffer complications. Published in November 2018, this report was informed by the available national and international evidence and the personal experiences of women who have suffered complications following mesh surgery. </p><p>In July 2018, in advance of publication of the full report, the CMO requested the HSE to pause all mesh procedures where clinically safe to do so. This pause remains in place.  </p><p>The HSE published a detailed Implementation Plan for the recommendations in the report in April 2019. The National Women and Infants Health Programme is leading on this work. The HSE has created a dedicated webpage about vaginal mesh implants, including contact information regarding the pathways for women suffering complications. In addition, multidisciplinary specialist services are now available for women suffering from mesh complications across two sites at Cork University Hospital (CUMH) and National Maternity Hospital (NMH) Dublin. Both centres currently treat women suffering with post mesh complications and have been accepting referrals from the national pathway since it was set up in November 2018.  Women referred to these centres are generally being seen within 3 months of referral, sometimes sooner. I am informed that it has been necessary for these clinics to be cognisant of the current COVID-19 public health guidance.</p><p>Funding has been provided in Budget 2021 to enhance and improve gynaecology services; this includes funding  to further develop the multidisciplinary National Mesh Specialist Service, and to implement additional pelvic floor physiotherapy and clinical nurse specialist services in each maternity network. The development funding will support the ongoing work to implement the recommendations from the CMO&rsquo;s Report.</p><p>Since the emergence of this matter, the ongoing priority focus for the Department and the HSE has been to meet the care needs of women experiencing mesh complications. I strongly encourage all women affected by mesh to engage with the relevant HSE contact points and the associated care pathways, to ensure that their service needs can be identified and provided for. </p><p>With regard to Baroness Cumberlege report, I am aware that in the UK, the Independent Medicines and Medical Devices Safety (IMMDS) Review chaired by Baroness Cumberlege, was established to examine how the UK healthcare system has responded to concerns raised by patients and families about three medical interventions, one of which was mesh. </p><p>The safety of mesh devices has been the focus of considerable regulatory, policy, clinical, and political scrutiny in many jurisdictions in recent years including the United States of America (USA), England, Scotland, Northern Ireland, Australia and other European countries, resulting in several safety reviews by regulatory bodies and other national health systems.</p><p>International evidence and learning play an important role in health policy considerations to promote safe, high quality care for patients. Any relevant learnings from the review will be taken into account as my Department continues to work with the HSE, the HPRA, and other stakeholders to support implementation of the recommendations of the CMO&rsquo;s report on the use of use of Uro-Gynaecological Mesh in Surgical Procedures.</p><p>Women's health is a priority for this Government, as outlined in the Programme for Government. In relation to the wider work of my Department, Budget 2021 will provide a significant investment in services that are important to women, including gynaecology services. It will also provide a Women&rsquo;s Health Fund which will support proposals arising from the work of the women&rsquo;s health taskforce to improve women&rsquo;s health outcomes and experiences of healthcare.</p></reply>

The Framework is now past the mid-way point for implementation. </p><p>Since publication in 2013, there has been significant progress in implementation. This has included:</p><p>- A focus on building an enabling environment for cross-sectoral and collaborative action, supported by a stakeholder engagement and communications strategy.</p><p>- Significant cross government and intersectoral partnerships and working has been created by the Framework.</p><p>- A suite of national policies and plans to address risk factors such as obesity, tobacco and physical inactivity have been published, and policy direction across areas such as cancer, maternity care, drugs and mental health has been informed and influenced by Healthy Ireland. </p><p>Notwithstanding the progress to date, there is an urgent need to scale and expand the activity across all strands of the work, from Government to local level, to support effective implementation, and to capitalise on further opportunities to involve more sectors in implementation.</p><p>In late 2019, the Health and Wellbeing Unit in my Department commenced the development of a Strategic Action Plan for the next phase of the Healthy Ireland Framework. Despite the challenges caused by Covid-19, which has caused some delays to the original timeline for this process, significant progress on the development of the Strategic Action Plan for Healthy Ireland has been made. To date the process has already completed a rapid review of previous progress, extensive stakeholder engagement, a desktop review of other jurisdictions for best practice, and a review of goals for alignment with the Sustainable Development Goals and the Programme for Government.  </p><p>Presently a set of emerging priorities is being considered in partnership with other Government Departments and internally in the Department of Health. The Healthy Ireland Strategic Action Plan is expected to be finalised in early 2021, for agreement across Government and subsequent publication.</p><p><b><i>National Maternity Strategy</i></b></p><p>The Programme for Government commits to 'Promoting Women&rsquo;s Health' and Budget 2021 provides a very significant investment to deliver on this commitment. This includes funding of &euro;12m to ensure a continued impetus to the implementation of the National Maternity Strategy and to improve gynaecology services. In addition, building on the work of the Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce, a &euro;5m Women&rsquo;s Health Fund was allocated in Budget 2021 to improve women&rsquo;s health outcomes and experiences of healthcare. </p><p>As the Deputy is aware, the National Maternity Strategy was published in 2016. The Strategy aims to ensure that appropriate care pathways are in place in order that mothers, babies and families get the right care, at the right time, from the right team and in the right place. Similarly, the Strategy aims to increase choice for women whilst ensuring that services are safe, standardised and of the highest quality. It recognises that, while all pregnant women need a certain level of support, some will require more specialised care.  Accordingly, at the Strategy&rsquo;s core is an integrated model that delivers care at the lowest level of complexity and encompasses all the necessary safety nets in line with patient safety principles.</p><p>The phased implementation of the Strategy is being led by the National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme (NWIHP). Development funding provided to the NWIHP in 2021 to progress the Strategy&rsquo;s implementation will serve to:</p><p>- further develop community-based midwifery services;</p><p>- address deficits identified in HIQA inspection reports;</p><p>- improve access to specialist  and allied health professional services and supports;</p><p>- strengthen training and education supports (e.g. CTG training).</p><p>- Further progress the roll out of the Maternal and Newborn Clinical Management System, which supports better, safer clinical decision-making and a more connected and integrated health service delivering improved health outcomes.</p><p>Notwithstanding the impact of COVID 19, work continued in 2020 to implement the Strategy and to further develop and expand community midwifery services, to facilitate the roll-out of the <i>Supported Care Pathway</i>and to enable women to avail of maternity care at the lowest level of complexity. In addition, the first National Maternity Experience Survey, a key recommendation of the Strategy, was conducted in 2020. The survey reports, published in October, were largely positive, and provide tangible evidence and rich qualitative information about what matters to women and their partners, and identifies, from their perspective, what areas require further focus and improvement.</p><p>Through the implementation of the National Maternity Strategy the quality and safety of our maternity services has improved. The Deputy can be assured that our maternity services are developing progressively and the benefits are being experienced by almost 80,000 families who access such services each year. Development funding has been provided for additional midwives, consultants, theatre staff, ultrasonographers and quality and safety managers; increasingly women have more choice in the service they receive with the development of community midwifery services and the availability of home from home birthing options; access to routine anomaly scanning has increased; Bereavement Teams are in place in every maternity unit; the perinatal mental health model of care is being implemented; all maternity hospitals/units now publish a Maternity Safety Statement on a monthly basis; and phase 1 of the roll-out of the Maternal and Newborn Clinical Management System has been completed. </p><p>The Strategy Implementation Plan is currently being reviewed by the NWIHP with a view to assessing the overall status of implementation and to provide up-to-date timelines for the individual recommendations. My Department will continue to work with the NWIHP in 2021 to support ongoing implementation of the Strategy.</p></reply>

The paper is available online: </p><p>Wastewater surveillance involves the analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material in sewage samples which will capture both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals in the community, providing an early warning system that will identify when SARS-CoV-2 levels are increasing in the community. This type of enhanced surveillance doesn't provide much additional information when there are high levels of virus circulating, but it can be an effective early warning system when there are low levels of circulating virus in the community. </p><p>An inter-agency wastewater surveillance group has been established and it is meeting weekly. Sampling is already being undertaken in Dublin and there is a plan in place to expand sampling to more than 60 wastewater treatment plants across all 26 counties.</p></reply>

Under the Regulations, health warnings which advise consumers that electronic cigarettes contain nicotine are mandatory on packaging. Electronic cigarettes and refill containers must also be child and tamper-proof. The Regulations provide for mandatory safety and quality requirements for electronic cigarettes and refill containers, including maximum nicotine concentrations for electronic cigarettes containing nicotine, and maximum volumes for cartridges, tanks and nicotine liquid containers. The Regulations also require e-cigarette manufacturers or importers to notify the HSE of all products that they place on the market and of the ingredients contained in the product. If a manufacturer, importer or distributor has a reason to believe that a product is not safe, they are required to immediately notify the HSE and to explain what corrective action has been taken.</p>  <p>  Further regulation of electronic cigarettes is planned for under the Public Health (Tobacco and Nicotine Inhaling Products) Bill. The Bill will introduce a mandatory licence for the retail sale of nicotine inhaling products and prohibit the sale of vaping products to, and by, persons under 18 years of age. The General Scheme of the Bill has been submitted for pre-legislative scrutiny to the Oireachtas Committee on Health and to the Office of the Attorney General for drafting of the Bill.</p></reply>

The Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without undue hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself and his or her family, having regard to his or her overall financial position and reasonable expenditure. However, every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines. The HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income threshold where they face difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from, the social and medical impacts of an illness.</p>  <p>  The issue of granting medical cards based on having a particular disease or illness was previously examined in 2014 by the HSE Expert Panel on Medical Need and Medical Card Eligibility. The Group concluded that it was not feasible, desirable, nor ethically justifiable to list medical conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility. In following the Expert Group&rsquo;s advice, a person&rsquo;s means remains the main qualifier for a medical card. However, I also recognise that patients require a responsive and compassionate health system to meet their medical needs, particularly in cases of terminal illness. I am therefore pleased to confirm that the Government recently agreed to introduce an administrative arrangement for up to 12 months on an interim basis, that will enable persons who have been certified by their treating Consultant as having a prognosis of 24 months or less, to be awarded a medical card. These applications will not require a means assessment nor will they be reassessed.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, since 2015 medical cards are awarded without the need of a financial assessment to all children under 18 years of age with a diagnosis of cancer, for a period of five years.</p>  <p>  With regard to the estimated cost of providing a medical card in the manner sought, this information is not readily available at this time.</p></reply>

Notwithstanding these pressures, CHO6 are continuing to work to reopen the GMHS on a phased basis. The recruitment of permanent staff is progressing (with administrative staff in post) and IT expansion underway. </p>  <p>  Existing PrEP users are now being facilitated in GMHS. The Clinic Consultant and other doctors are providing virtual consultations, and PrEP service users can also attend GMHS for STI screening and blood testing, with support from agency nurses. Those with diagnosed STIs will be treated in GMHS also.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department are in regular contact with the HSE to monitor progress on the phased reopening of the service.</p></reply>

It is directed by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) and coordinated by the Health Service Executive (HSE). Samples are taken by healthcare professionals in healthcare settings, community test centres, workplaces or in the patient&rsquo;s home. All testing for COVID-19 as part of the national strategy is currently conducted in the National Virus Reference Laboratory (NVRL), hospital diagnostic laboratories and other designated laboratories overseen by the NVRL.</p><p>These tests are provided free of charge and there is currently sufficient capacity in the system for testing through this pathway. Members of the public are advised to follow the HSE guidance in respect of testing which is available on the HSE website.</p><p>The national testing strategy has been implemented to ensure that:</p><p>- test results are reported to the relevant stakeholders (for monitoring and surveillance purposes as COVID-19 is a notifiable disease);</p><p>- contact tracing activities are initiated (where appropriate);</p><p>- an incorrect test result does not lead to false reassurance resulting in individuals failing to seek the necessary medical help. During this time, the individual may also unknowingly spread the virus;</p><p>Under the Infectious Disease Regulations (S.I. No. 53/2020 - Infectious Diseases (Amendment) Regulations 2020 which amended the Infectious Diseases Regulations 1981 (S.I. No. 390 of 1981), all medical practitioners, including clinical directors of diagnostic laboratories, are required to notify the Medical Officer of Health (MOH) / Director of Public Health of certain diseases, including COVID-19. The MOH also reports such cases onwards to the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC). This is to ensure that test results are reported to relevant stakeholders for monitoring and surveillance purposes and to investigate cases, thus preventing spread of infection and further cases. This requirement also applies to all private testing services who are, therefore, legally obliged to report positive Covid-19 case to the relevant authorities.</p><p>As Minister for Health, I do not have statutory responsibility relating to the provision of privately operated COVID-19 testing facilities. However, the HSE has published guidance for private testing laboratories undertaking SARS-CoV-2 testing to ensure that all tests are reported and dealt with in an appropriate manner, and in line with our infectious disease legislation.</p><p>Where the HSE becomes aware of any specific issues with private laboratory reporting, they engage directly with the private testing laboratories to resolve any issues. They communicate the HPSC guidance and monitor the market for new providers to ensure they are aware of their obligations. The HSE website also offers factual, up to date and accessible public facing information on private testing <i></i>.</p><p>The tests provided by the public system are provided free of charge and there is sufficient capacity in the system for testing through this pathway. Anybody who has symptoms is advised to seek assistance from their GP and is advised to follow the HSE guidance in respect of testing which is available on the HSE website.</p></reply>

On the 28th December 2020 the Government approved the implementation of a new Northern Ireland Planned Healthcare Scheme. The new Scheme operational from 1 January 2021 for 12 months on an administrative basis will enable persons resident in the State to access and be reimbursed for private healthcare in Northern Ireland by the HSE, provided such healthcare is publicly available within Ireland.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the HSE has also put in place transitional arrangements for certain patients who have a legitimate expectation of continuing to access care in the UK under the current provisions of the EU Cross-Border Directive Scheme including provision for reimbursement of healthcare costs by the HSE to persons who fall into certain categories, such as patients who can evidence that they have treatment booked prior to December 2020 for treatment in 2021. Patients are advised to contact the HSE CBD office directly with queries on individual applications and whether they are covered by the transitional arrangements or the Northern Ireland Planned Healthcare Scheme.</p>  <p>  Patients also continue to have access to health services under the EU CBD Scheme in all other remaining EU/EEA countries.</p>  <p>  In the context of the Covid-19 Pandemic, persons seeking to utilise these schemes should review and adhere to the public health guidance and restrictions in place at any point in time.</p></reply>

The recent Report of the Clinical Advisory Group, which was re-established by the HSE to carry out a review of eligibility for medical cards in cases of terminal illness, recommended inter alia, that legislative change would be necessary to underpin an extension to the current prognosis timeframe required for 'End of Life' medical cards. My Department is therefore currently undertaking an examination of potential options for a legislative framework.</p>  <p>  However, pending the development of legislative options, I am pleased to confirm that the Government recently agreed to introduce an administrative arrangement for up to 12 months on an interim basis, that will enable persons who have been certified by their treating Consultant as having a prognosis of 24 months or less, to be awarded a medical card. These applications will not require a means assessment nor will they be reassessed. My Department is actively engaging with the HSE's National Medical Card Unit to ensure all necessary processes and communications to operationalise the scheme are in place within a matter of weeks.</p></reply>

The legislation necessary to establish the Tribunal, the CervicalCheck Tribunal Act 2019 passed through the Oireachtas and was signed into law by the President on 23 July 2019. </p>  <p>  It was originally intended that the CervicalCheck Tribunal would be established by the end of March 2020. However, establishment was delayed due to the outbreak of COVID-19. A further delay arose in June 2020 when previously nominated members were no longer in a position to take up roles in the Tribunal. </p>  <p>  I commenced the relevant sections of the CervicalCheck Tribunal Act 2019 on 21 October 2020 and signed the order to appoint 27 October 2020 as the establishment day of the Tribunal.</p>  <p>  Following a pause in the steps towards full establishment of the Tribunal, to allow for discussions with the 221+ Patient Representative Group about the Tribunal and CervicalCheck Cases generally, the establishment of the Tribunal was finalised with the appointment of the nominated members with effect from 1 December 2020, facilitating the Tribunal in starting its work and providing women who are eligible to make a claim to the Tribunal with an alternative to the Courts for their claims.</p>  <p>  The Tribunal remains the most appropriate venue to hear and determine CervicalCheck claims. It has been specifically designed for that purpose. It is, of course, entirely up to eligible women as to whether or not they use it.</p>  <p>  In respect of screening it is important to note that all of the recent major reviews and reports state that our national cancer screening programmes, including CervicalCheck, meet international standards, are valuable in improving the health of our population, and that the public can have confidence in them.  However, it is also important to highlight the limitations associated with screening programmes, Interval cancers occur in all screening programmes. The National Screening Services strive to prevent or diagnose as many cancers as possible but acknowledge that all international programmes report a number of interval cancers each year.</p>  <p>  In his report Mr. Justice Meenan explained the limitations of the screening process and the implications that these limitations have for the issue of liability with regard to CervicalCheck claims. Accordingly, the format for the CervicalCheck Tribunal which Mr. Justice Meenan recommended recognises the issues of liability involved in CervicalCheck cases and allows them to be addressed by the Tribunal.   </p>  <p>  In relation to Cervical Check, the programme made the technical transition to HPV cervical screening in March of last year. This improved testing methodology, along with the continued roll-out of HPV vaccinations, means that Ireland can look forward to a significant reduction in the incidence of cervical cancer cases over the next 10-20 years. It is worth noting that since CervicalCheck started in 2008, the number of women who developed cervical cancer has fallen by 7% year on year between 2010-2015. In the absence of screening, cervical cancer may not have been detected in these people until they developed physical signs or symptoms of more advanced disease.</p>  <p>  Screening is a population health measure for people who are presumed healthy and do not have symptoms.  An important message for the public, including anyone who may be between screening tests or waiting for a rescheduled appointment, is to be aware of, and act upon, any symptoms associated with the conditions they are screened for. Anyone with concerns about symptoms should contact their GP who will arrange appropriate follow-up care.</p></reply>

Given that there will be initially limited vaccines available, it will take some time for all to receive those vaccines and that has necessitated an allocation strategy to ensure that those most at risk of death and serious illness receive the vaccine first.</p><p>The priority is to first vaccinate and protect directly the most vulnerable amongst us, that is, those most likely to have a poor outcome if they contract the virus. The priority is to directly use vaccines to save lives and reduce serious illness, hence the focus on the over 65 year old cohort in long term residential care facilities, and healthcare workers in frontline services often caring for the most vulnerable.</p><p>The next group to be vaccinated are those aged 70 and older in the following order: 85 and older, 80-84, 75-79, and 70-74. Vaccination of this group will begin in this month.</p><p>All of the groups will be covered as further vaccine supplies become available and the immunisation programme is rolled out nationally.</p><p>The evidence will be kept under review and the allocation groups may be updated, where necessary, in light of new evidence.</p></reply>

At present all children under six years of age are eligible for a GP visit card and therefore GP care without charges.</p>  <p>  The Health (General Practitioner Service and Alteration of Criteria for Eligibility) Act 2020 provides, amongst other things, for the phased expansion of GP care without fees to all children aged 12 years and under. The initial stage of this phased expansion will be the provision of GP care without fees to all children aged between 6 and 8.</p>  <p>  The appropriate date for commencing the expansion remains under consideration in light of COVID-19 and the additional pressures the expansion might place on general practice in that context and in anticipation of the usual increase in demand for healthcare services over the winter period. This date will be determined following consultation with the IMO. It is important to ensure that any additional pressures placed on general practice will not limit its capacity to meet the needs of all patients in the community.</p></reply>

The commissioning of these reports by the HSE arose from recommendations in the Scally Scoping Inquiry Report.</p><p>Implementation of the recommendations of the ERG reports is now underway, with implementation groups already established by the HSE, which include patient representatives, as well as clinicians and other screening services staff.</p><p>Important actions across all programmes will be to adapt and enhance the information provided to participants so they can better understand the benefits and limitations of their screening test, and so make informed decisions as partners in their own healthcare. Some of the challenges in achieving better public understanding of screening stem from the fact that cancer screening programmes are population health measures, designed to improve outcomes on a population-wide basis, and not designed to be diagnostic on an individual level.</p><p>As highlighted in the ERG reports, interval cancers, ie any cancer that is diagnosed after a previous normal screening test is carried out and before another screening test is carried out, are an unfortunate but inevitable fact given that no screening test is 100% accurate, and false negatives do occur. While screening offers the benefit of detecting many cancers at an earlier stage, this is sadly not always the case.</p><p>A cancer diagnosis is a very stressful and often devastating event for anyone, and where such a cancer is diagnosed in a person who has participated in a screening programme, it is also important that the manner of the disclosure and discussion of  a patient&rsquo;s screening history does not add further undue stress. The ERG reports set out a number of guiding principles for clinical audit which will underpin the development of the future framework for clinical audit and review. This includes the principle that communications with patients diagnosed with cancers must be respectful and open. In terms of the design of patient-requested case reviews as part of the implementation of the ERG reports, these will be developed in a consultative and collaborative manner with patient representatives.</p><p>In relation to CervicalCheck, the introduction last year of the HPV screening test is a significant milestone for our cervical cancer screening programme, as this test is more sensitive and typically detects 18 out of 20 abnormalities, compared to the 15 out of 20 the smear test typically detects. Going forward, this will mean in overall terms, even with the most effective and sensitive screening programme, that  approximately 2 in every 1000 screened will still not be detected and interval cancers will still occur. This is undoubtedly, and sadly, unfortunate, and devastating for the individuals concerned.</p><p>This is also why it is so important that the public understands that screening is a population health measure for people who are presumed healthy and do not have symptoms. An important message for the public, including anyone who may be between screening tests or waiting for a rescheduled appointment, is to be aware of, and act upon, any symptoms associated with the conditions they are screened for. Anyone with concerns about symptoms should always contact their GP who will arrange appropriate follow-up care.</p><p>It is also important to re-iterate that all of the recent major reviews and reports state that our national cancer screening programmes, including CervicalCheck, meet international standards, are valuable in improving the health of our population, and that the public can have confidence in them.</p><p>In terms of a population perspective,  when we consider that over 6,000 women are detected and referred for early treatment each year, cervical screening continues to have significant value for population health.</p><p>As Minister for Health, my priority is to continue the work to restore the CervicalCheck screening programme as a leading international cancer screening programme, to improve public trust and confidence in screening, and further the global aim to eradicate cervical cancer<b>.</b></p></reply>

The committee's recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation. It makes recommendations on vaccination policy to my Department. The NIAC continues to revise recommendations to allow for the introduction of new vaccines in Ireland and to keep abreast of changes in the patterns of disease. Therefore, the immunisation schedule will continue to be amended over time.</p>  <p>  In 2009, the NIAC recommended HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccination for all 12 to 13 year old girls to reduce their risk of developing cervical cancer when they are adults. In September 2010, the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of secondary school.</p>  <p>  Therefore, the gender-neutral HPV vaccination programme targets all girls and boys in first year of secondary school to provide maximum coverage. All vaccines administered through the School Immunisation Programme are provided free of charge. </p>  <p>  The ages at which vaccines are recommended in the immunisation schedule are chosen by the NIAC in order to give each child the best possible protection against vaccine preventable diseases. As the HPV vaccine is preventative it is intended to be administered, if possible, before a person becomes sexually active, that is, before a person is first exposed to HPV infection.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to be guided by NIAC's recommendations on any emerging evidence on this issue in the future.</p>  <p>  Anyone not in 1st year of secondary school or age equivalent in special schools or home schooled during the 2020/2021 school year who wishes to get the HPV vaccine, must go to their GP or sexual health clinic and pay privately for the vaccine and its administration.</p></reply>

This assessment was completed in February 2020, with the NCPE recommending that Patisiran not be considered for reimbursement unless cost-effectiveness could be improved relative to existing treatments.</p>  <p>  The HTA report with respect to Patisiran was reviewed by the HSE Drugs Group, along with the outputs of commercial discussions with the applicant which took place in May 2020, and the patient group submission received during the HTA process.  The HSE Drugs Group requested patient and clinician input via the Rare Diseases Technology Review Committee (RDTRC) to assist the group in making its recommendation to the HSE Executive Management Team (EMT) regarding reimbursement of Patisiran.</p>  <p>  The RDTRC convened on 24 September and reviewed the clinical data previously submitted as part of the established pricing and reimbursement process. The Committee also heard from Consultants involved in the specialist management of patients with hATTR amyloidosis. The RDTRC continued its review of Patisiran at its subsequent meeting on 5 November which included patient input on the impact of hATTR amyloidosis.</p>  <p>  Following these meetings, the Committee finalised a statement summarising the clinician and patient engagement on Patisiran which was received by the HSE on 26 November 2020.</p>  <p>  The HSE has advised that it met with the applicant company in December 2020 and in early January 2021 for further discussions and deliberations on the pricing position.</p>  <p>  At its January 2021 meeting, the HSE Drugs Group reviewed all the relevant documentation concerning the application, including information provided by the RDTRC. The HSE has advised that, having considered all of the criteria of which is obliged to take account, the HSE Drugs Group was unable to recommend in favour of reimbursement.</p>  <p>  The decision-making authority in the HSE is the HSE EMT. The HSE EMT decides on the basis of all the demands with which it is faced (across all services) whether it can fund a new medicine, or new uses of an existing medicine, from the resources that have been provided to it in line with the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.</p>  <p>  The HSE has confirmed that, on 9th February, it issued notice to the applicant company of the proposed decision of the EMT not to support reimbursement of Patisiran.</p>  <p>  Where the HSE EMT team has considered a recommendation of non-reimbursement from the HSE Drugs Group and is minded to accept such a recommendation, the HSE is legally required (in line with the 2013 Health Act) to set out in detail a notice of any proposed decision to an applicant company.</p>  <p>  The HSE, where such circumstances apply, is also legally required to provide at least a 28-day period (from the formal written notice of proposal) to enable an applicant company to consider the proposal not to reimburse and to make representations to the HSE. The HSE is legally required to consider any such representations in advance of a formal decision.</p>  <p>  I am further advised by the HSE that it received an application in August 2019 for the reimbursement of Inotersen (Tegsedi) for the treatment of stage 1 or stage 2 polyneuropathy in adult patients with hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (hATTR).</p>  <p>  On 26 August 2019, the HSE commissioned a rapid review with respect to this indication. Following receipt of a rapid review dossier, the NCPE advised the HSE on 7 October 2019 that a full HTA was required for this medicine to assess the clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness of Inotersen compared with the current standard of care.</p>  <p>  The HSE commissioned a full HTA on 9 October 2019 as per agreed processes. As of 11 February 2021, the applicant has not submitted a HTA dossier to the NCPE for assessment. A completed HTA is required to progress this application, as per the formal processes governing the pricing and reimbursement of medicines.</p>  <p>  The applications for Patisiran and Inotersen remain under consideration in line with the 2013 Health Act.</p></reply>

In addition, the Programme was mandated to drive and lead the implementation of the National Maternity Strategy. </p>  <p>  The NWIHP therefore provides strategic direction and leadership, drives improvement, and fosters a learning culture in maternity, neonatal and gynaecological services. The Programme also aims to ensure that learning from adverse incidents is disseminated and applied in a comprehensive and consistent manner, promoting a national approach to consistent, evidenced-based practice in maternity care.  The Programme has identified the development of key performance indicators in the areas of maternity and gynaecology services as a priority for 2021.</p>  <p>  The Programme is intended to act as the single central authority on maternity care and as a reference point and resource for women&rsquo;s health issues within the HSE.  The Programme is also tasked with the appropriate allocation and effective, specific targeting of all new development funding for maternity, neonatal and gynaecological services. </p>  <p>  In relation to the actions being taken regarding maternal mental health, the Specialist Perinatal Mental Health Service Model of Care was launched by the HSE in November 2017 and is currently being implemented. The new model of care addresses the seven key actions identified in the National Maternity Strategy, including developing and delivering access to appropriate care, early identification and a multidisciplinary approach by skilled professionals, including standardised access to perinatal psychiatry and psychology. </p>  <p>  Specialist Perinatal Mental Health Services are aligned to the six maternity networks and, in that context, are being developed in a hub and spoke model.  Funding of some &euro;3.6m was provided in recent years for the six Specialist Perinatal Mental Health hub teams at the Rotunda Hospital; National Maternity Hospital; Coombe Women &amp;amp; Infants University Hospital; Cork University Maternity Hospital; University of Limerick Maternity Hospital; and University Hospital Galway.  While some gaps in staffing remain, all of the hub sites are now in operation.  On average, eight to nine multidisciplinary staff provide services at each site. </p>  <p>  Along with six hub teams, there are 13 spoke sites in the other maternity units.  An integral component of the Specialist Perinatal Mental Health Service Model of Care is the deployment of a mental health midwife to each of the 13 maternity spoke sites. The mental health midwife augments the liaison psychiatry services and their focus is on women with mild to moderate mental health problems throughout the perinatal period.   An equally important aspect is to educate all midwives, public health and practice nurses on the need to ask women about their mental, as well as their physical health.  11 of the 13 spoke mental health midwives are now in place and the recruitment process is in train for the two remaining sites.</p></reply>

In the CervicalCheck Tribunal, or in the High Court, a woman can choose not to sue the laboratories, and to make a claim only against the HSE. However, the laboratories will still need to be involved, as it is their reading of smears that is at issue. </p>  <p>  In a recent case, the laboratories were involved as &lsquo;third parties&rsquo; rather than defendants, and the CervicalCheck Tribunal can facilitate that model. </p>  <p>  The SCA have clarified that where a woman chooses not to name the laboratories as defendants, it will not seek to challenge this and will instead join the laboratories as third parties.

GPs are reimbursed by the HSE for the provision of those services. Where a medical card or GP visit card holder experiences difficulty in finding a GP to accept him/her as a patient, or where the person has been removed from another GP's list or refused entry onto a GP's list, the HSE has the power to assign that person to a GP's GMS patient list.</p>  <p>  People who do not hold a medical card or GP visit card access GP services on a private basis and can make enquiries directly to any GP practice they wish to register with. As private contractors, it is a matter for each individual GP to decide whether to accept additional private patients. Where a GP practice has a full list of patients and cannot take on new patients, patients should contact other GP practices in the surrounding areas.   </p>  <p>  The Government is aware of the workforce issues currently facing general practice, including the limited access to GP services in certain areas, and has implemented a number of measures to improve recruitment and retention in general practice. </p>  <p>  These measures include an increase in investment in general practice by approximately 40% (&euro;210 million) between 2019 and 2023 under the terms of the 2019 GMS GP Agreement GP. The Agreement provides for increased support for GPs working in rural practices and for those in disadvantaged urban areas, and for improvements to maternity and paternity leave arrangements.  In addition, the number of GPs entering training has been increased steadily over the past number of years, rising from 120 in 2009 to 214 in 2020, with a further increase foreseen in 2021.

Mr. Justice Charles Meenan on an Alternative System for Dealing with Claims Arising from CervicalCheck. In his report Mr. Justice Meenan explained the limitations of the screening process and the implications that these limitations have for the issue of liability with regard to CervicalCheck claims. </p>  <p>  Mr. Justice Meenan considered the appropriateness of a redress or compensation scheme to address claims arising from CervicalCheck and referenced such schemes including the statutory Hepatitis C and HIV Compensation Tribunal. Mr. Justice Meenan advised that such a scheme was not appropriate for CervicalCheck cases as in those schemes it was not necessary to prove negligence or breach of duty for compensatory damage, and instead recommended a format that would allow the issues of liability to be addressed.</p>  <p>  Judge Meenan recommended that the Tribunal would have power to determine issues of liability and award damages on the same basis as a judge of the High Court, and that the Tribunal legislation should require the Tribunal to hear and determine claims on the same basis as that Court.  </p>  <p>  Accordingly, the Tribunal will make awards relating to recurrence in the same way as the High Court. That is, an additional amount can be made as part of the Tribunal settlement, to factor in a future chance of recurrence.  </p>  <p>  An advantage of the Tribunal over the courts is that, if a claimant does not wish to accept the amount awarded by the Tribunal, they can appeal to the High Court, an extra step that would not be available if the claimant had gone directly to the High Court. However, just like the Court system, a claimant cannot return with a second claim in respect of the same event years later. Providing for eligible women to return to the Tribunal for additional claims would also require the Tribunal to be in existence indefinitely.</p>  <p>  In his Report Mr. Justice Meenan set out the necessary features of any alternative system for CervicalCheck claims, which in addition to recognising the issues of liability involved, included that participation in any alternative system must be on a voluntary basis.</p>  <p>  It is unlikely that respondents or third parties would consent to participate in an open-ended process when the courts could offer certainty and finality, meaning that no cases would ultimately be heard by the Tribunal, leaving the eligible women with no option other than the courts.</p></reply>

The measures in place for each level reflect the prevailing disease situation and recognise that we can and must prioritise some activities over others. </p><p>At level 5, all non-essential retail, and all non-essential services must remain closed.

The unprecedented surge in Covid-19 infection rates has implications for staffing of all health services in terms of necessary redeployment of staff to urgent pandemic related duties including testing, vaccination, contact tracing and patient treatment.  </p>  <p>  Virtual clinics are held where possible, with attendance in person limited to appointment only. Service restrictions are predominantly due to social distancing requirements; waiting rooms can now only hold a fraction of patients compared to before the pandemic. </p>  <p>  Phone lines, the GMHS website and other resources such as man2man.ie and sexual wellbeing.ie are regularly updated to reflect current service delivery and to signpost users to the HSE list of approved PrEP services. </p>  <p>  Although services have been subject to some Covid-19 related restrictions, the national PrEP programme has continued to expand and over 2,000 individuals, mostly gay men, are currently registered on the national PrEP programme.  </p>  <p>  Routine STI testing, including HIV testing, is available for free through all 23 public STI services in Ireland. HIV testing is also provided to specific populations, such as those who inject drugs, homeless people, migrants and prisoners, and is included as part of the national antenatal screening programme for all pregnant women in Ireland. The latest report (2018) indicates an uptake of almost 100%.</p>  <p>  HIV testing is available in all hospitals and conducted where this is clinically indicated. Many emergency departments (EDs) offer HIV and hepatitis screening as part of an ED viral screening programme for anyone having bloods taken when they attend the ED. </p>  <p>  The HSE is currently piloting a free home STI/HIV testing service, supported by the Sl&aacute;intecare Integration Fund, in Dublin, Cork and Kerry. The first phase of tests were made available early January and additional tests will be made available over the coming months. Tests are being made available in a phased manner to ensure there is sufficient capacity in local clinics for service users who may need follow-up treatment or support.</p>  <p>  All health services, including STI/HIV services are continuing to face service restrictions due to the current impact of Covid-19 on the hospital system and social distancing requirements. Public STI clinics are prioritising those with symptoms or requiring treatment, and this includes anyone who may be referred for confirmation HIV testing. </p>  <p>  Student health services provide STI/HIV testing and STI treatment for their students at a subsidised rate, though some are currently providing testing for free to students, due to the service restrictions elsewhere. Home HIV and STI testing kits are also available to purchase in pharmacies.</p>  <p>  In terms of the future direction of services, it is intended to review and refresh the National Sexual Health Strategy in 2021, taking into account the views of stakeholders. Funding remains in place for all current services, including the national PrEP programme; it is hoped that these vital services can return to being delivered to their full potential, and indeed, developed further, once it is possible to reduce the multiple pandemic related constraints on the health service as a whole. </p>  <p>  As the topics raised are service matters, for additional operational updates, including the current status of HPV vaccinations, I have also asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The closure of the GMHS in 2020 related primarily to the necessary redeployment of increasing numbers of personnel to diverse COVID-19 related duties. Since the closure, significant efforts have been made to maintain service provision.   </p>  <p>  All health services are again facing restrictions, as the health system needs to prioritise treating those with COVID-19 and rolling out the vaccination programme. Notwithstanding these pressures, CHO6 are continuing to work to reopen the GMHS on a phased basis. The recruitment of permanent staff is progressing, with administration staff in post and IT expansion underway. </p>  <p>  Existing PrEP users are now being facilitated in GMHS. The Clinic Consultant and other doctors are providing virtual consultations, and PrEP service users attend GMHS for STI screening and blood testing, with support from agency nurses. Those with diagnosed STIs will be treated in GMHS also.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department are in regular contact with the HSE to monitor progress on the phased reopening of the service.</p></reply>

The regulations are a binding international legal agreement involving 196 countries across the globe, including all the Member States of the World Health Organisation. </p><p>Their aim is to help the international community prevent and respond to acute public health risks that have the potential to cross borders and threaten people worldwide. </p><p>The purpose and scope of the Regulations is to &ldquo;<i>prevent, protect against, control and provide a public health response to the international spread of disease in ways commensurate with and restricted to public health risks, and which avoid unnecessary interference with international traffic and trade</i>&rdquo;. The regulations came into force in June 2007.</p><p>A Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), such as the declaration on 30 January 2020 in relation to Covid-19, is declared under the provisions of IHR.</p><p>Article 22 of the Regulations specifically provide for the designation of a &ldquo;competent authority&rdquo; (in relation to points of entry, i.e. airports and ports) by Member States for the purposes of the Regulations.</p><p>The HSE has a Port Health Group which consists of representatives from Public Health, Environmental Health, the National Ambulance Service and the HSE&rsquo;s Office of Emergency Management. The Health Protection Surveillance Centre is Ireland&rsquo;s designated Competent Body for liaison with ECDC and is Ireland&rsquo;s national WHO International Health Regulations (IHR) focal point for communicable diseases.</p><p>There has been ongoing engagement between the HSE (HPSC and Port Health); the Department of Health; the Department of Transport; and the Department of Transport&rsquo;s various agencies in relation to the designation of a competent authority or authorities for Ireland, in accordance with IHR. </p><p>Following further engagement between the Department (Health Protection Unit in the CMO&rsquo;s Office and HSE (HPSC and Port Health), work was conducted to progress this issue during the course of 2019, including the commencement of a review of the relevant legislation by the Department and the submission of a proposal document by the HSE. It was intended that this issue would be further pursued in the context of a more in-depth review of Public Health Legislation in 2020, but this was paused following the onset of the pandemic.</p><p>It should be noted that the 2008 and 2009 Infectious Diseases Regulations took account of the provisions of the International Health Regulations when they were drafted, revoking and replacing preceding Regulations relating to infectious diseases on both shipping and aircraft. Consistent with other Regulations made in accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1947, key responsibilities in these areas were allocated to medical officers of health and health officers (and some of these would mirror the requirements of IHR).</p><p>The European Commission has recently issued its new legislative framework for the health sector, which includes provision for a Regulation on cross-border threats to health (which will repeal Decision No 1082/2013/EU). This includes provision for both EU wide and Member State pandemic planning, including greater compliance with IHR. Provision is also made for audits by the ECDC with a view to strengthening IHR and EU emergency structures.</p></reply>

On the second occasion, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would have discretion to issue an Adult Caution. </p>  <p>  An implementation, monitoring and evaluation group, chaired by the Department of Health, is implementing the Health Diversion Programme. The group is finalising proposals to commence implementation of the programme on an administrative basis in a number of locations in 2021.</p>  <p>  As outlined in the Programme for Government, a review of the programme will take place following the first full year of implementation, to ensure that it is meeting all of its aims.</p>  <p>  I am committed to a health-led approach for possession of drugs for personal use, and I look forward to the commencement of the Health Diversion Programme in 2021.</p></reply>

On the 28th December 2020 the Government approved the implementation of a new Northern Ireland Planned Healthcare Scheme. The new Scheme operational from 1 January 2021 for 12 months on an administrative basis will enable persons resident in the State to access and be reimbursed for private healthcare in Northern Ireland by the HSE, provided such healthcare is publicly available within Ireland, such as orthodontic treatment. It should be noted that the scheme operates on parameters similar to the EU Cross Border Directive. Patients are advised to contact the HSE CBD office directly for further information on individual applications and types of treatment available under the NI Planned Healthcare Scheme.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore, patients also continue to have access to health services under the EU CBD Scheme in all other remaining EU/EEA countries.

Currently there are almost 2,500 GPs contracted to provide services under the GMS Scheme and as at 1 January,18 panels, or less than 1%, are vacant. Where a vacancy arises in a practice with a GMS contract, the HSE becomes actively involved in the recruitment process to find a replacement GP. There are currently no vacancies in New Ross. </p>  <p>  Where a medical card or GP visit card holder experiences difficulty in finding a GP to accept him/her as a patient, or where the person has been removed from another GP's list or refused entry onto a GP's list, the HSE has the power to assign that person to a GP's GMS patient list.</p>  <p>  People who do not hold a medical card or GP visit card access GP services on a private basis and can make enquiries directly to any GP practice they wish to register with. As private contractors, it is a matter for each individual GP to decide whether to accept additional private patients. Where a GP practice has a full list of patients and cannot take on new patients, patients should contact other GP practices in the surrounding areas.   </p>  <p>  The Government is aware of the workforce issues currently facing general practice, including the limited access to GP services in certain areas, and has implemented a number of measures to improve recruitment and retention in general practice. </p>  <p>  These measures include an increase in investment in general practice by approximately 40% (&euro;210 million) between 2019 and 2023 under the terms of the 2019 GMS GP Agreement GP. The Agreement provides for increased support for GPs working in rural practices and for those in disadvantaged urban areas, and for improvements to maternity and paternity leave arrangements.  In addition, the number of GPs entering training has been increased steadily over the past ten years, rising from 120 in 2009 to 214 in 2020, with a further increase foreseen in 2021.  The ICGP noted a record number of applications for the 2021 GP training programme.</p>  <p>  These measures will see an increase in the number of GPs working in the State, improving access to GP services for patients throughout the country.</p></reply>

It is directed by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) and coordinated by the Health Service Executive (HSE). </p>  <p>  The national testing strategy has been implemented to ensure that:</p>  <p>  - test results are reported to the relevant stakeholders (for monitoring and surveillance purposes as COVID-19 is a notifiable disease);</p>  <p>  - contact tracing activities are initiated (where appropriate);</p>  <p>  - an incorrect test result does not lead to false reassurance resulting in individuals failing to seek the necessary medical help. During this time, the individual may also unknowingly spread the virus;</p>  <p>  Under the Infectious Disease Regulations (S.I. No. 53/2020 - Infectious Diseases (Amendment) Regulations 2020 which amended the Infectious Diseases Regulations 1981 (S.I. No. 390 of 1981), all medical practitioners, including clinical directors of diagnostic laboratories, are required to notify the Medical Officer of Health (MOH) / Director of Public Health of certain diseases, including COVID-19. </p>  <p>  The MOH also reports such cases onwards to the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC). This is to ensure that test results are reported to relevant stakeholders for monitoring and surveillance purposes and to investigate cases, thus preventing spread of infection and further cases. This requirement also applies to all private testing services who are, therefore, legally obliged to report positive Covid-19 case to the relevant authorities.</p>  <p>  As Minister for Health, I do not have statutory responsibility relating to the provision of privately operated COVID-19 testing facilities. However, the HSE has published guidance for private testing laboratories undertaking SARS-CoV-2 testing to ensure that all tests are reported and dealt with in an appropriate manner, and in line with our infectious disease legislation.</p></reply>

This decision was made arising from the rapid increase in Covid-19 admissions and to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources are made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work.</p><p>Patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols. The HSE continues to optimise productivity through alternative work practices such as the use of alternative settings including private hospitals, community facilities and alternative outpatient settings.</p><p>In recent years, my Department has worked with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to improve access for patients waiting for high volume procedures, including cataracts. Ophthalmology services are provided throughout all hospital groups in the country, with cataract removal one of the key procedures carried out as part of this specialty.</p><p>A key development in improving access to Ophthalmology services was the opening of a stand-alone high-volume consultant-led cataract theatre by the University of Limerick Hospital Group in Nenagh Hospital in 2018, with the intention that it would facilitate patients from surrounding geographical areas to avail of their treatment there. The impact of such initiatives can be seen in the reduction in the waiting times to access cataract procedures since 2019. At the end of January 2021 there were 4,634 patients waiting for a cataract procedure compared to 6,437 in January 2019.</p><p>An additional &euro;240 million has been provided in Budget 2021 for an Access to Care Fund, &euro;210m of which has been allocated to the HSE and &euro;30m to the NTPF for the provision of treatment as required in both private and public hospitals in order to address capacity issues in acute hospitals and waiting lists. </p><p>My Department, the HSE and the NTPF are continuously reviewing waiting lists with a view to ensuring that services for scheduled care are resumed as soon as it is deemed safe to do so in line with HSE clinical guidelines.</p><p>The attached document shows the number of persons on the outpatient and inpatient &amp;amp; daycase (IPDC) waiting lists for ophthalmology in each county and the average waiting time for an appointment at the end of January 2021.</p><p>">Waiting Lists</p></reply>

The low number for quarter two may be due to the impact of the Covid pandemic and restrictions on the work of coroners.</p><p>The number of suicides in Ireland reduced from 578 in 2012 to 516 in 2016 (CSO official figures, including late registrations). CSO official figures for 2017 and 2018  are 383 and 437 respectively, while the provisional figure for 2019 is 421. These figures exclude coroners' late registrations so are likely to change. I attach for your information the latest briefing on suicide figures by the National Office for Suicide Prevention.</p><p>Early international evidence has not indicated an increase in suicide during the pandemic, while a decrease in self-harm/suicide attempts was noted during the early months.

The timing of this, and other assemblies, over the lifetime of the Government has yet to be determined. One element critical to the success of assemblies has been the opportunity to meet in person. The restrictions experienced with Covid-19 have presented considerable difficulties in this regard, as meetings moved to being held online. The experiences and learning in this new way of working will inform how future citizen&rsquo;s assemblies are conducted.</p>  <p>  in 2019, the Government published the report of the working group on alternative approach to the possession of drugs for personal use, which was informed by 20,000 public responses to an online survey. Arising from the recommendations of the report, the Department of Health is implementing the health diversion programme for individuals found in possession of drugs for personal use. The programme will be reviewed after the first full year of implementation, to ensure that it is meeting all of it aims and to make any necessary changes.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commitment to a health-led approach to drug use as set out in the national drugs strategy 2017-2015. The strategy is a dynamic process, subject to ongoing monitoring and review. Accordingly, the Department of Health is conducting a mid-term review of the actions in the national drugs strategy, in consultation with all stakeholders and the national oversight committee. The review is also informed by the new EU drugs strategy and forthcoming work plan.   </p>  <p>  I look forward to the commencement of the health diversion programme and the development of new actions to guide the national drugs strategy for the next four years. I believe that the learnings to be derived from the programme will further inform the health-led approach to drug use in due course.</p></reply>

The Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without due hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself and his or her family, having regard to his or her overall financial position and reasonable expenditure. The issue of granting medical cards based on having a particular disease or illness was previously examined in 2014 by the HSE Expert Panel on Medical Need and Medical Card Eligibility. The Group concluded that it was not feasible, desirable, nor ethically justifiable to list medical conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility. In following the Expert Group&rsquo;s advice, a person&rsquo;s means remains the main qualifier for a medical card.</p>  <p>  However, every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines.  </p>  <p>  Individuals who possess a medical card can access HSE provided physiotherapy services where available either in a hospital setting or in the community, while the Counselling in Primary Care service is available to adults over 18 years who are medical card holders and experiencing mild to moderate psychological and emotional difficulties. </p></reply>

The Health Act 1970 (as amended) provides that all persons ordinarily resident in the country are eligible, subject to certain charges, to public in-patient hospital services including consultant services. All persons, irrespective of illness or condition, accessing public in-patient (including day case) services in a public hospital are liable for the statutory in-patient daily charge of &euro;80 up to a maximum of &euro;800 in any period of 12 consecutive months, subject to a number of exemptions, including medical card holders.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, patients who have a medical card and are treated in a private hospital under the current arrangement are exempt from the Statutory Public Charges, and the cost of their treatment in the private hospital is covered by the HSE.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-02-17a.2619.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021021700096#WRSS01600"><p>Considerable work has been done and continues to progress in Ireland in relation to the safe use of mesh implants and sodium valproate; and the patient voice is central to our understanding of these, and similar, issues. With regard to the specific details, I will first deal with mesh implants and then consider sodium valproate.</p>  <p>  Over the past two decades, Uro-Gynaecological Mesh has been widely used in the surgical treatment of Stress Urinary Incontinence and Pelvic Organ Prolapse in women.  Mesh devices are certified as compliant with relevant EU legislation, and as such, European regulatory competent authorities consider that the benefits outweigh the risks for these devices.</p>  <p>  I am aware that in response to concerns raised in Ireland regarding complications associated with the use of mesh devices in late 2017, the then Minister for Health requested the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) to prepare a report on the matter, which was published in November 2018. The report was informed by the available national and international evidence and the personal experiences of women who have suffered complications following mesh surgery.</p>  <p>  In July 2018, in advance of publication of the full report, the CMO requested the HSE to pause all mesh procedures where clinically safe to do so. This pause remains in place.</p>  <p>  The HSE published a detailed Implementation Plan for the recommendations in the report in April 2019.  The National Women and Infants Health Programme is leading on this work. The HSE has created a dedicated webpage about vaginal mesh implants, including contact information regarding the pathways for women suffering complications. In addition, multidisciplinary specialist services are now available for women suffering from mesh complications across two sites at Cork University Hospital (CUMH) and National Maternity Hospital (NMH) Dublin.</p>  <p>  In line with good practice internationally, the establishment of an independent, compassionate process for women affected by mesh to have their voices heard is currently being scoped and this may help to drive learning across the health service and ensure that the healthcare system has appropriate responses in place.</p>  <p>  With regard to the medicine, sodium valproate, I am aware of historical and current issues surrounding the use of sodium valproate by women during pregnancy. I am also aware of the significant work carried out by the HSE and the HPRA over the last two years to implement European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommendations from 2018 and to provide support to families who may have concerns about previous exposure to sodium valproate and the possible impact on their children.</p>  <p>  As I understand it, the HSE has improved the structures in place to support families affected by foetal valproate syndrome (FVS), including the establishment of a dedicated genetics clinic in Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital, Crumlin. This means that families now have access to a clear diagnostic pathway if they feel their child may be affected by FVS.</p>  <p>  I have recently committed to holding an inquiry into the historical licensing and use of sodium valproate in Ireland and have asked officials in my department to examine a number of different options for the structure of this inquiry.</p></reply>

Given that there will be initially limited vaccines available, it will take some time for all to receive those vaccines and that has necessitated an allocation strategy to ensure that those most at risk of death and serious illness receive the vaccine first.</p><p>The priority is to first vaccinate and protect directly the most vulnerable amongst us, that is, those most likely to have a poor outcome if they contract the virus. The priority is to directly use vaccines to save lives and reduce serious illness, hence the focus on the over 65 year old cohort in long term residential care facilities, and healthcare workers in frontline services often caring for the most vulnerable.</p><p>The next group to be vaccinated are those aged 70 and older in the following order: 85 and older, 80-84, 75-79, and 70-74. Vaccination of this group will begin in this month.</p><p>All of the groups will be covered as further vaccine supplies become available and the immunisation programme is rolled out nationally.</p><p>The evidence will be kept under review and the allocation groups may be updated, where necessary, in light of new evidence.</p></reply>

This was evidenced by the publication of <i>Get Ireland Active - the National Physical Activity Plan</i>(NPAP) in 2016, and its subsequent implementation.</p><p>The NPAP contains 60 actions intended to promote increased physical activity levels across the population. The Plan is being implemented, overseen by a cross-sectoral Implementation Group co-chaired by the Departments of Health and Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media. The Departments of Education, Children, Equality, Disability, Integration &amp;amp; Youth, Housing, Local Government &amp;amp; Heritage, and Rural &amp;amp; Community Development are also represented, along with Sport Ireland, the HSE, the Federation of Irish Sport, the LGMA and the academic sector.</p><p>Key initiatives underway include the Active School Flag programme and national strategies for walking and cycling. Increasing physical activity levels in children and young people is a priority focus. Improving physical activity in women and girls has also been identified as an early priority area by the Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce.  Implementation of the current Physical Activity Plan will be reviewed this year with a view to charting the future direction of the Plan.</p><p>While the restrictions imposed in response to Covid 19 have impacted on sports facilities, team sports and other sporting activities, research published by Sport Ireland in mid-2020 shows that individual adult activity levels had risen, with more people participating in walking, cycling, running and outdoor swimming.</p><p>As presentations at the recent virtual Irish Physical Activity Research Collaboration conference made clear, regular physical activity can boost positive immune responses while reducing markers of inflammation, and regular exercise is also effective in reducing the severity of symptoms associated with anxiety and depression.</p><p>Recent research carried out by DCU regarding the Department of Education&rsquo;s Active School Flag programme, which is co-sponsored by Healthy Ireland, would indicate positive effects of this programme on school activity levels, but also on attendance, behaviour and learning outcomes.</p><p>Bearing in mind the vital role of physical activity in terms of protecting varied aspects of both physical and mental health and wellbeing, the Keep Well national citizen engagement campaign was launched in autumn 2020 as part of the Government&rsquo;s Resilience and Recovery Plan.  This campaign aims to promote resilience and to provide a range of supports for our citizens.  The campaign has several themes, one of which is &ldquo;Keeping Active&rdquo;. This is in clear recognition of the role of physical activity in supporting positive mental health and improving mood and reducing anxiety, in addition to keeping people fit and healthy and improving their general wellbeing.</p><p>Sport Ireland is leading a series of initiatives that are supporting people in keeping active and exercising within their own local areas.  In addition, sporting organisations and clubs are developing ways to support local communities within the public health regulations. Details of these supports are available through <i></i>and <i>.</i></p></reply>

The priority is to directly use vaccines to save lives and reduce serious illness, hence the focus on the over 65 year old cohort in long term residential care facilities, and healthcare workers in frontline services often caring for the most vulnerable. </p><p>The next group to be vaccinated are those aged 70 and older in the following order: 85 and older, 80-84, 75-79, and 70-74. Vaccination of this group will begin in this month.  </p><p>All of the groups will be covered as further vaccine supplies become available and the immunisation programme is rolled out nationally.</p><p>The evidence will be kept under review and the allocation groups may be updated, where necessary, in light of new evidence.</p></reply>

This does not include the persons getting married or persons attending in a professional capacity.  The various limits at all levels in the Government's Plan are all designed to reduce the number of households mixing with each other and cut down the virus&rsquo;s chances of spreading into more homes. It seeks to balance the risks of different types of gatherings against the desire to allow normal activities to proceed in so far as possible. </p><p>As I am sure the Deputy can appreciate, COVID-19 spreads when individuals and groups come into close contact with one another, enabling the virus to move from one person to another. COVID-19 is infectious in a person with no symptoms, or for the period of time before they develop symptoms.  In certain settings, such as weddings, higher noise levels due to music, can force people into close proximity, requiring them to raise their voices or shout to communicate thus increasing the risk of spreading the virus to others.  </p><p>It is not possible to say what public health measures will be in place in the future.  The public health advice relating to Covid-19 is kept under continuing review by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET),  by my Department and by the Government . The measures in place and the public health advice have been adapted to the changing circumstances and this will continue to be the case for the foreseeable future.</p><p>Details of the public health measures currently in place for weddings can be found at:- </p><p>You may also wish to note that F&aacute;ilte Ireland has provided guidelines for the hospitality industry which includes guidance on weddings and is available at: - </p></reply>

The criteria that apply to the evaluation process allow sufficient scope for the HSE to take on board the particular circumstances that pertain to orphan drugs and rare diseases.</p><p>There has been a number of key changes in the HSE assessment process of medicines within the confines of the 2013 Health Act.  These have included changes to the HSE Drugs Group, whose membership has been expanded to include representatives from the National Patients Forum and more clinical expertise in the area of rare diseases.</p><p>In June 2018, the HSE Leadership appointed a Technology Review Committee for Rare Diseases (RDTRC) which is responsible for:</p><p>1) reviewing proposals received from industry or expert groups in Ireland for funding of new products for rare diseases including orphan drugs, or expanded indications for existing products for rare diseases and making recommendations as to the implementation of the relevant recommendations from the National Rare Diseases Plan 2011-2018; and</p><p>2) providing contributions to the development of clinical guidelines for relevant Orphan Medicinal Products (OMPs) and supporting the implementation of guidelines in conjunction with the National Drugs Management Programme Office where applicable.  The Committee&rsquo;s recommendations for reimbursement of OMPs are not intended to replace any part of the existing medicines appraisal or reimbursement process but rather complement it.</p><p>As a country, we invest heavily in medicines, to the tune of over &euro;2 billion annually. The number of new medicines approved for reimbursement by the HSE from 2019 to date (as of 16th February) is detailed in the table below:  <table>    <tr>       <th>Year </th>       <th>New medicines </th>       <th>New indications of existing meds. </th>       <th>Total approvals </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019 </td>       <td>31 </td>       <td>5 </td>       <td>36 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020 </td>       <td>10 </td>       <td>13 </td>       <td>23 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021 (as of 16th February) </td>       <td>9</td>       <td>7 </td>       <td>18* </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>*includes expanded reimbursement of Duodopa and provisions for availability under the community drugs schemes of intranasal naloxone (Nyxoid) for the management of opioid overdose.</p></reply>

This places a potentially onerous burden on family successors and could challenge the future viability of these productive assets.</p>  <p>  Therefore, the Department of Health has proposed a policy change to the Scheme, to cap contributions based on farm and business assets at three years where a family successor commits to working the productive asset. The stated policy objective of the legislation is to introduce additional safeguards in the Scheme to further protect the viability and sustainability of family farms and businesses that will be passed down to the next generation of the family to continue to work them as productive assets to provide for their livelihood. </p>  <p>  This change was approved by Government and underwent pre-legislative scrutiny in the last D&aacute;il. Progress on the development of the Bill was negatively impacted by the dissolution of the last D&aacute;il and by the COVID-19 pandemic. The response to the pandemic has been and continues to be a national and public health priority. However, work on this legislation has continued to progress. I requested a waiver to conduct pre-legislative scrutiny from the Business Committee, given this was already undertaken in the previous D&aacute;il, and this waiver was granted on 4th February 2021. I have met with the Attorney General to discuss this legislation, and there has been an ongoing and active engagement between the Department of Health and the Office of the Attorney General on the development of the legislation, which will be brought to the Houses of the Oireachtas at the earliest possible opportunity. It is on the priority list for publication in the Spring legislative session.</p></reply>

To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy is a standardised approach used by the HSE to manage scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures.  It sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists and was developed in 2014 to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

This model of care will ensure that infertility issues will be addressed through the public health system at the lowest level of clinical intervention necessary.  It will comprise three stages, starting in primary care (i.e., GPs) and extending into secondary care (i.e., Regional Fertility Hubs) and then, where necessary, tertiary care (i.e., IVF and other advanced assisted human reproduction (AHR) treatments).  Structured referral pathways will be put in place and patients will be referred onwards for further investigations or treatment as required and as clinically appropriate.  It is intended that, in line with available resources, this model of care for infertility will be rolled out on a phased basis over the course of the coming years.</p><p>Phase One of the roll-out of the model of care has commenced and involves the establishment, at secondary care level, of Regional Fertility Hubs in maternity networks. which will facilitate the management of a significant proportion of patients presenting with infertility issues.  Funding of &euro;2m was provided to the HSE to commence Phase One of the roll-out of the model of care in 2020. This was utilised specifically in respect of the development of the first four Regional Fertility Hubs &ndash; namely, Cork Maternity University Hospital, the Rotunda Hospital, the National Maternity Hospital and the Coombe Women &amp;amp; Infants University Hospital. </p><p>Additional funding of just over &euro;1m is being made available to enable the continuation of Phase One of the roll-out in 2021, including through the setting-up of the final two Regional Fertility Hubs, to be located in Galway and Limerick. </p><p>The roll out of Phase One has been slowed due to the management of the Covid-19 pandemic by the health service broadly and its impact upon the provision of elective health services, including fertility services.</p><p>Phase Two of the roll-out will see the introduction of tertiary infertility services, including IVF, in the public health system.  Phase Two will not commence until such time as infertility services at secondary level have been developed across the country and the AHR legislation is commenced.  Drafting of the AHR legislation is ongoing, in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General.</p><p>It should be noted that while AHR treatment is not currently funded by the Irish public health service, a defined list of fertility medicines needed for fertility treatment is covered under the High Tech Arrangements administered by the HSE.  Medicines covered by the High Tech Arrangements must be prescribed by a consultant/specialist and authorised for supply to the client&rsquo;s nominated community pharmacy by the High Tech Hub managed by the Primary Care Reimbursement Service.  The cost of the medicines is then covered, as appropriate, under the client&rsquo;s eligibility, i.e., Medical Card or Drugs Payment Scheme.  Given the costs associated with certain fertility medicines, I am aware that these schemes can have a material impact on the total cost of AHR treatment for individuals who avail of them.</p><p>In addition, there is other support available in that patients who access IVF treatment privately may claim tax relief on the costs involved under the tax relief for medical expenses scheme.</p><p>Overall, the implementation of the model of care will help to ensure the provision of safe, effective and accessible infertility services at all levels of the public health system as part of the full range of services available in obstetrics and gynaecology.</p></reply>

All felling licences are important as they all supply material and support jobs and my Department aims to take a balanced approach to issuing them. In this regard, it is worth noting that 1,719 felling licences issued in 2020 representing a volume of just over 5 million cubic metres. Of this, 2.7m m3 issued to Coillte and 2.3m issued to private owners. </p>  <p>  The same legal framework and referrals applies to Coillte and private felling licences. Coillte have invested heavily in ecologists and supply NISs to my Department to support applications that require Appropriate Assessment. Likewise private forest owners may, where appropriate, and at their own expense, submit an NIS prepared by a suitably qualified person and this can reduce the waiting time for a decision to two to three months.</p>  <p>  I am committed to increasing the level of output and would point out that in order to do so we have invested heavily in resources including the recruitment of additional ecologists, forestry inspectorate and administrative staff, with extra resources to be added in 2021. This has already resulted in an increase in the number of licences issued, and in the last quarter of 2020 felling licences to the amount of 2m cubic metres issued, representing 40% of annual output. This upwards trend has continued this year with felling licences for just over 1m cubic metres  issued to 5th February. The aim is to sustain and build substantially on that output in order to ensure the consistent high level of output and volume which the sector needs. </p>  <p>  I would like to reiterate my commitment to supporting the forest sector and to building on the recent progress, so that a continual improvement in delivery is achieved.</p></reply>

We are tackling these delays by means of a systematic project plan. We have invested heavily in resources including the recruitment of additional ecologists, forestry inspectorate and administrative staff, with extra resources to be added this year.</p><p>There are currently 1,890 files referred to our ecology team. Most files referred to Ecology will likely require an Appropriate Assessment. Without a detailed examination of each file referred to ecology it is difficult to give a precise number.</p><p>Of these, 1,123 are for tree felling licences from private landowners. Where files require an Appropriate Assessment, the Department is required to carry out an Appropriate Assessment Determination (AAD). This can be done by the Department itself carrying out an Appropriate Assessment Report to inform the AAD or by the applicant providing a Natura Impact Statement (NIS) to inform the AAD. The Department prioritises files where the applicant has provided an NIS.</p><p>When the NIS is received, it is assigned to an ecologist and is normally processed within two to three months of receipt. My Department has received a NIS from individual landowners for 120 tree felling applications since the establishment of the project to deal with the ecology backlog in July 2020, of which, 80 have been processed by the ecologists.  </p><p>There are currently 39 felling applications assigned to ecologists for which a NIS has been received and which are being processed.</p><p>The following table shows a county breakdown of the 39 applications assigned to ecologists, for which a NIS has been received.</p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th>County</th>       <th>No. Assigned</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cavan</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Clare</td>       <td>5</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork</td>       <td>2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Donegal</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway</td>       <td>7</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerry</td>       <td>6</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Laois</td>       <td>2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick</td>       <td>4</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mayo</td>       <td>4</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Roscommon</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Tipperary</td>       <td>2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Waterford</td>       <td>2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Westmeath</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>This table shows a county breakdown of the 1,123 tree felling licences awaiting assessment by an ecologist. <table>    <tr>       <th>County</th>       <th>Screened  In</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Carlow</td>       <td>21</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cavan</td>       <td>29</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Clare</td>       <td>100</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork</td>       <td>130</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Donegal</td>       <td>27</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin</td>       <td>3</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway</td>       <td>54</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerry</td>       <td>100</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare</td>       <td>30</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilkenny</td>       <td>40</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Laois</td>       <td>56</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Leitrim</td>       <td>14</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick</td>       <td>90</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Longford</td>       <td>2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth</td>       <td>6</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mayo</td>       <td>54</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Meath</td>       <td>22</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Monaghan</td>       <td>2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Offaly</td>       <td>30</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Roscommon</td>       <td>24</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Sligo</td>       <td>26</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Tipperary</td>       <td>111</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Waterford</td>       <td>35</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Westmeath</td>       <td>36</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wexford</td>       <td>43</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wicklow</td>       <td>38</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total</td>       <td>1,123</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

The overall MFF was subsequently agreed with the European Parliament in December 2020. </p>  <p>  The MFF agreement sets out the EAFRD contribution rates to be established in Member States' CAP Strategic Plans. This includes 43% of the eligible public expenditure in what is known as 'other regions'. Ireland fought very hard to maintain the current EU co-financing rate of 53%, but, as with any negotiation process, compromises had to be made. The MFF agreement also sets out that the minimum level of EAFRD co-financing is 20%, while a higher 80% co-financing rate will apply for environmental and climate related commitments.  Therefore, the overall level of co-financing  for the EAFRD in the next programming period will be very much dependent on the types of measures Member States wish to support in their CAP Strategic Plans for the 2023-2027 period.</p>  <p>  EAFRD spending for 2021 and 2022 will be programmed under the Rural Development Programme 2014-2022. The EAFRD allocation for 2021 and 2022 of &euro;692m and EURI funding of &euro;190m is now available for programming in the extended transitional period. The RDP provides funding based on national programmes and all farmers have an equal opportunity to apply for funding regardless of their location.</p>  <p>  The 2023-27 CAP Strategic Plan will see a strategic planning process at a national level, with funding available to farmers in all parts of the country, as before. All expenditure under current and future programmes will be subject to the national budgetary process.</p></reply>

No 62 of 2016.</p>  <p>  Article 12(1) of that Regulation provides that all equine animals must be identified with a passport no later than 12 months from the date of birth of the animal and, in any event, before the equine moves permanently from the holding of origin. </p>  <p>  Equine passports are issued by Passport Issuing Organisations (PIOs) approved by my Department. Information available from these organisations suggests that high rates of compliance with the identification rules are being achieved. </p>  <p>  Enforcement of equine identification legislation is primarily undertaken by authorised officers in my Department's Regional Office network who engage in checks at sales venues including marts and fairs, as well as at horse slaughter plants and at export points including ports and airports. These officers work closely with veterinary colleagues in Local Authorities and liaise with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Revenue Commissioners Officials, as required. </p>  <p>  In addition, inspection of equine passports forms part of the equine identification validation processes at competition venues to ensure that all intended participants are identified properly and accompanied by a valid identification document. </p>  <p>  Where breaches of equine identification legislation are identified, my Department's policy is to adopt a fair and proportional approach to resolving such issues. In this regard, authorised officers engage with keepers making them aware of their responsibilities and generally issue a compliance notice in the first instance to ensure compliance with the legislation.</p></reply>

It is a sector with great tradition in Irish agriculture and holds significant potential for the future. My Department has introduced a number of specific support measures for the tillage sector in recent years. In 2015, a Voluntary Coupled Protein Aid Scheme was introduced providing a fund of &euro;3 million with the aim of sustaining production of plant proteins to a level of 12,000 hectares. It is proposed to continue with the VCS for the CAP transitional period for tillage farmers. Furthermore, my Department is considering the continuation of the VCS for protein crops in the next CAP in order to promote the growing of native protein crops. </p>  <p>  The Tillage Capital Investment Scheme (TCIS), under TAMS II, covers specific areas of investment including Minimum Disturbance Tillage Equipment, Sprayers, Fertiliser Spreaders and increasing Grain Storage and Drying capacity. Over &euro;16m has been paid to farmers to date under the Scheme. In addition, over &euro;7m has been paid to farmers for tillage investments under the Young Farmer&rsquo;s Capital Investment Scheme as part of TAMS II.  </p>  <p>  The horticultural sector operates in an open market, increasingly international and competitive. Ongoing development of horticulture is dependent on its ability to maintain and extend its competitive advantages in this environment. In spite of these challenges the industry has seen a growth in output value of some 30% in the 10 years since 2010. This growth has been assisted by the strong investment by the sector in new technologies, including public investment. My Department operates the Scheme of Investment Aid for the Development of the Commercial Horticulture Sector, focusing on small to medium sized enterprises. This Scheme is intended to assist in the development of the horticulture sector, including beekeeping, by grant aiding capital investments in specialised Horticultural plant and equipment. It aims to facilitate environmentally friendly practices, promote the diversification of on-farm activities, improve the quality of products and improve working conditions. For 2021, the budget for this Scheme was significantly increased to &euro;9 million.</p>  <p>  My Department promotes the transition to organic tillage and horticulture farming by providing the highest organic payment rates for conversion and maintenance for tillage and horticulture. In addition, under TAMS II, a dedicated capital investment scheme (Organic Capital Investment Scheme (OCIS)) is in place providing support for organic tillage farmers for a wide range of equipment and structures.</p>  <p>  Forestry and agro-forestry offer significant opportunities for farm diversification, and my Department supports forestry through planting grants, premia and various schemes to incentivise increased planting, particularly to encourage the planting of broadleaf species. </p>  <p>  Negotiations on the new Common Agriculture Policy (CAP) are underway and the CAP Strategic Plan will provide in excess of &euro;12 billion in funding to farmers and rural communities in the period from 2023 to 2027. In the interim, support continues under the Rural Development Programme, with payments in excess of &euro;1.7 billion in 2020. My Department will continue to support cereals, crops and horticulture with appropriate supports under CAP.</p>  <p>  The agri-food sector has benefited from an approach to strategic planning through the development of 10-year stakeholder-led strategies, updated every five years. Since their inception 20 years ago, up to the current Food Wise 2025 plan, these strategies have ensured that the sector has a coherent, stakeholder-led vision and strategy to underpin the sector's continued development and all sectors are considered, including cereals, crops and horticulture. Currently, a Committee representative of the sector is developing the agri-food strategy to 2030. </p>  <p>  The development of the strategy is a commitment of the Programme for Government, to provide, &ldquo;an ambitious blueprint for the industry for the years ahead, adding value sustainably in the agri-food sector into the future and supporting family farms and employment in rural Ireland&rdquo;. The strategy is expected to be published in the first half of this year and will include actions for cereals, crops and horticulture in the period to 2030. The Strategy is also expected to look at the potential for diversification into organic production, as well as the potential for farmers to diversify further into forestry production.</p></reply>

The negotiations on the revised EU Control Regulation are currently ongoing at the Council Working Party.  The Portuguese Presidency has indicated its intention to bring a general approach on the proposal to the Council of Fisheries Ministers in June. The European Parliament is also discussing the Commission's proposal for a Regulation and is in the process of preparing its own recommended amendments to the text.  Earlier this month, the European Parliament's Fisheries Committee published its draft report on the proposal which will be submitted for approval at the European Parliament plenary on 8 March. When both the Council and the Parliament have formally adopted their positions, trilateral negotiations will commence involving the EU Council, the European Parliament and the Commission.</p>  <p>  My Department has been engaged fully in the negotiation process and continues to be actively involved in the ongoing discussions with the Presidency, other Member States and the Commission on the proposal. My Department has consulted with stakeholders during this process and will continue to keep them apprised of developments. </p>  <p>  I am supportive of many of the proposed changes in the Commission proposal that strengthens the EU arrangements for control, inspection and enforcement. I am also seeking that measures introduced are proportionate, support simplification, cost efficiency and reducing administrative burden for Member States and industry. In relation to inshore vessels, we are supporting  the principle of a tracking system for smaller vessels and a simplified and more flexible electronic system for the recording of catches by these vessels. We are seeking that new systems be introduced on a phased basis.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government sets down an ambitious programme of actions that promote a sustainable seafood industry, including supporting the completion of the new Fisheries Control Regulation to increase the effectiveness of existing control measures and agree rules that will ensure a level playing field for all EU vessels.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government (PfG) acknowledges this in saying that while Irish agriculture must maintain a strong export focus, there is also a desire to see a greater emphasis on producing a more diverse range of food to meet our domestic needs. It also sets out the need to enhance the link between communities and food production and in this regard, commits to promoting short, efficient routes to market that connect small food producers to the consumer and providing advisory, investment and marketing support for those who wish to diversify into new products. The PfG also commits to support the small food producer, providing support for on-farm diversification enterprises and investment in local processing facilities, allowing farmers to sell their products into the local and wider domestic markets. </p>  <p>  My Department and agencies under its responsibility, including Bord Bia and Teagasc, offers a range of supports to help implement these commitments. Examples include the Rural Innovation and Development Fund; and the LEADER Food Initiative, which is implemented through the LEADER programme under the responsibility of the Department of Rural and Community Development. </p>  <p>  Bord Bia supports include market insights; branding and marketing; access to expert sector managers; and training for moving business online. At the recent Bord Bia Small Business Seminar, the theme of which was &lsquo;Be Extraordinary&rsquo;, the latest insights and guidance were offered to help small businesses understand and meet changing consumer and market needs. Initiatives like &lsquo;Food Academy&rsquo; and marketing assistance grants are also of help to small scale food businesses supplying local markets. </p>  <p>  Looking forward, I am confident that the next ten-year strategy for the agri-food sector, the successor to Food Wise 2025, will build on these excellent initiatives when it is finalised later this year. In addition to growing international markets and value-added exports, there will also be a focus on developing additional market opportunities for primary producers and food businesses closer to home.</p></reply>

In October 2020, the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament adopted their respective positions on the Commission proposals.</p>  <p>  Trilogue negotiations between the three institutions, which are aimed at reaching a final shared agreement on the shape of the new CAP, commenced at the end of 2020 and are expected to run for some time yet.   </p>  <p>  The Council General Approach that I have supported provides for the provision of basic payments to farmers based on a system of entitlements or on a rate per hectare, depending on the system applied by the individual Member States.   </p>  <p>  The overwhelming majority of Irish farms are family farms operated by a farmer, whether part-time or full-time, assisted by other family members. Only a minority of farms are of such a size and output that they employ additional labour. Therefore, it is unlikely that any system relating payment to the number of additional farm workers would be appropriate, bearing in mind the national farm structures. </p>  <p>  The Council General approach provides for a number of options for redistribution, giving Member States the necessary flexibility to put in place appropriate national measures. These include further convergence of direct payments, capping and reduction of payments, and the Complementary Redistributive Support for Sustainability, which would allow extra payments on the first hectares of a holding. My officials are examining these possibilities, and this work will continue in close consultation with all stakeholders.</p></reply>

The core support for the beef sector under the current RDP is the &euro;300m Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP).  </p>  <p>  In addition to this support, over the last two years, over &euro;200 million of additional supports were made available specifically to the beef sector, including the BEAM, since 2019, the Beef Finishers Payment last year and the Beef Environmental Efficiency Programme (BEEP/S) schemes. It is important to note that supports targeted at beef finishers also support suckler farmers through the weanling selling season. </p>  <p>  The objective of the Beef Environmental Efficiency Pilot (BEEP), which was piloted in 2019, was to further increase economic and environmental efficiency in the suckler herd through better quality data on herd performance supporting decision making on farm. The 2019 budget allocated a total of &euro;20 million for BEEP. A total of 16,556 farmers participated in the pilot with payments totalling &euro;15.4m. Building on the success of the BEEP pilot of 2019, its successor BEEP-S of 2020 included optional animal health and welfare measures and provided payments of over &euro;40 million to over 24,000 beef farmers. </p>  <p>  In Budget 2021, &euro;85 million has been allocated for specific supports for sustainable beef farming. This includes over &euro;40 million for the extension of the BDGP during the transition period before the next CAP. This scheme is a significant support for participating farmers, as well as having delivered measurable improvements in the economic and environmental performance of the suckler herd as a whole.</p>  <p>  The remaining &euro;45 million has been allocated for the Beef Sector Efficiency Pilot. This scheme will build on the success of the BEEP-S scheme this year, aiming to improve the weaning efficiency of suckler cows and calves by recording weights, and also optional animal health and welfare measures. This provides for a maximum payment per suckler cow/calf pair of &euro;90 per head for the first 10 suckler cows, and &euro;80 thereafter. The 2021 scheme will also contain &euro;5 million for a new calf weighing measure to support beef farmers rearing dairy beef calves.</p>  <p>  Details on the measures are currently being finalised and will be announced in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

On 22 October 2020, I announced a COVID-19 Aquaculture Support Scheme under the Programme, designed to compensate oyster and rope mussel producers for lost sales arising from the COVID-19 Pandemic. The Scheme closed in November with 181 aquaculture enterprises applying. Payments ranged from &euro;6,800 to &euro;16,300 for oyster producers and, for rope mussel producers, &euro;1,300 to &euro;9,000.</p>  <p>  The terms and conditions of the Scheme provided that it was available only to those operators who were compliant with certain legal obligations that apply to all aquaculture producers, namely compliance with their aquaculture and foreshore licences and with the requirement in law to submit returns to Bord Iascaigh Mhara of the Aquaculture Production and Employment Survey. It is an offence to fail to comply with this requirement to submit the survey. The Scheme required that applicants must have complied for each of the three previous years, unless they were a recent entrant to the sector who would not have been in production for those three years.</p>  <p>  Other supports to aquaculture producers under the EMFF Programme, including for capital investment, innovation, professional advisory services and organic certification have continued to be available throughout the Pandemic and demand from producers for these grants has remained strong.</p>  <p>  As the Pandemic continues and its impacts on markets continue to evolve and change, I am keeping the range of supports under review, in the context of the suite of Government horizontal supports that continue to be available.</p></reply>

Along with Minister of State Senator Pippa Hackett who is responsible for forestry, it is my immediate priority to deal with this backlog and to issue licences in the volume needed for this important sector to continue to contribute to our rural economy, that services both the local and export market.</p><p>You will be aware of the delays caused by changes to the licensing system, which means that a significant number of cases now need ecological input to comply with environmental requirements. We are tackling these delays by means of a systematic project plan. In 2020, we invested heavily in resources including the recruitment of additional ecologists, forestry inspectorate and administrative staff, with extra resources to be added this year. This has already resulted in an increase in the number of licences issued, and the last quarter of 2020 saw the highest number of licences issued last year. In addition, January saw the highest number of licences issued in any one month since July 2019.So far this year 494 licences have issued, which is an 18% increase on the same period last year.</p><p>I would like to reiterate my commitment to supporting the forest sector and to building on the recent progress, so that a continual improvement in delivery is achieved. </p><p>The table below shows the status of private licences on hand by type and county. Please note that this excludes Coillte licences currently on hand for processing. It describes the number of forestry licences that have been provisionally screened in and are awaiting assessment by an ecologist. Most files referred to Ecology require an Appropriate Assessment. The remaining licences are either in the early stages of processing ahead of any screening assessment, or post screening assessment and awaiting further consideration, which could involve for instance a request for further information from the applicant or has been referred to the forestry inspector for final decision.</p></reply>

The Regulation does not stop this route of sale. However, from January 2022 antiparasitic VMPs will require a veterinary prescription before they can be sold.</p>  <p>  Several stakeholders, including Licenced Merchants, have raised concerns about the potential impact of this change in regulation. To address this, my Department has established an Antiparasitic Resistance Stakeholder Group which is chaired by the Chief Veterinary Officer. This group has an extensive work programme and its considerations are being guided by two principal objectives</p>  <p>  - Protecting the efficacy of antiparasitics which are critical to the Irish pasture-based production model.</p>  <p>  - Establishing a regulatory system that is pragmatic, retains a substantive role for existing stakeholders and delivers value for money for farmers</p>  <p>  My Department as part of the Antiparasitic Stakeholder Group has committed to conducting a Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) on the EU Regulation which is underway. This process essentially addresses the same issues that an economic impact assessment would. The RIA will focus on areas where Ireland has national discretion with regards transposing the Regulation and specifically where intended policy decisions may impact stakeholders. The Assessment cannot be finalised until the relevant policy options have been examined which will be informed by stakeholder consultations.</p></reply>

This new authority will enforce EU-wide rules on prohibited unfair trading practices in the food supply chain and will have powers to enforce this Directive, penalising those who breach regulations. The NFO will have a specific role in analysing and reporting on price and market data in Ireland.</p>  <p>  My Department is taking a two step approach to the establishment of the NFO. Firstly a statutory instrument will be drafted to transpose the UTP Directive by the deadline of 1st May 2021. This will provide for an Enforcement Authority which will have the powers as currently provided for in the Directive. The legislative and operational requirements for establishing a new Office of a Food Ombudsman or equivalent that might provide for functions other than those provided for in the UTP Directive are being examined. Primary legislation will be required both to establish this new authority, and to provide for any further powers which may be given to that office. My Department is giving this matter priority.</p>  <p>  The UTP Directive does not address issues of price determination or negotiation. While the new authority will have a specific role in analysing and reporting on price and market data in Ireland, it is important to be aware, however, that this authority will not have a role in determining price. It is intended that there will be a national consultation process on the functions of the NFO prior to the primary legislation being enacted.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Beef Taskforce work on price transparency, and the completion of the three market transparency studies commissioned by my Department, will be an important step towards improving visibility of the complex supply chain which is integral in fostering trust and enhancing supply chain relationships. These studies will act as an important starting point for driving increased transparency. It is more important than ever that we all work together given the unique set of challenges currently faced by the sector. Continued strong and constructive engagement in the Beef Taskforce is key to meeting these challenges.</p></reply>

While progress has been made, there are decisions on a number of key issues  still to be made, particularly in relation to the proposed CAP Strategic Plan.  The proposed new Green Architecture which encompasses enhanced conditionality, eco-schemes and agri-environment climate measures needs to be considered in this regard.</p><p>The Green Low Carbon Agri-Environment Scheme (GLAS) was the national agri-environment climate measure under the Rural Development Programme to the end of 2020. To ensure that environmental benefits achieved to date are maintained and that farmers continue to receive support, GLAS 1 and 2 participants with contracts due to expire at end 2020 were offered the option of extending their contracts for a further year. The vast majority opted to do so.</p><p>As regards the successor scheme to GLAS, it is proposed that a new agri-environment climate scheme will be included in Ireland&rsquo;s new CAP Strategic Plan. </p><p>Funding has also been made available for an agri-environment pilot project. It is proposed to do this as a results-based project in order to align it with the principles of the next CAP. Results-based agri-environment payment schemes reward farmers for committed environmental effort by linking payments to the quality of environmental outcomes delivered. This differs to the standard &lsquo;prescription-based&rsquo; model used in GLAS. </p><p>By linking payments to defined indicators the results-based model creates a financial incentive linked with outcomes for participating farmers. The model also makes it worthwhile for participants to gain an understanding of the conditions required for the delivery of optimum biodiversity and environmental benefits. To inform the development of the project, a public consultation was recently launched and will remain open until 26th February. Final decisions on the structure and content of the pliot will be made after the public consultation process. A summary overview document and the online consulation survey are available at gov.ie - Public Consultation on Proposed Agri-Environment Results Based Pilot Project (<i>www.gov.ie</i>). </p><p>I am committed to protecting farmer incomes while also enhancing environmental measures.</p></reply>

The RDP provides funding based on specific schemes - there is no variation in the payment rates based on location with the exception of the Areas of Natural Constraints scheme, where higher rates are applicable to off-shore farms.</p>  <p>   The CAP Strategic Plan will programme the EAFRD expenditure for the period 2023-2027.  The plan, which is under development, will consider Ireland as one region along the lines of the current Rural Development Programme. It will be based on a strategic planning process and will consider the needs arising from a SWOT analysis. It is open to Member States to allocate the EAFRD funds to address the needs in accordance with the priorities of the Member State.</p></reply>

The Deputy will note that a number of counties in Northern Ireland are included in the list, and while the Investigations Division does not carry out investigations in Northern Ireland, these addresses relate to the address of the individual or the entity under investigation.

The new authority whose remit will include the beef sector, will have a specific role in analysing and reporting on price and market data in Ireland.  It is important to be aware, however, that this authority will not have a role in determining price.  </p>  <p>  Establishment of the NFO is ongoing and firstly requires the drafting of a statutory instrument to transpose the UTP directive before the deadline of May 2021. Legislation is then required to establish the new office of the NFO. It is intended that there will be a national consultation process on the functions of the NFO  prior to the primary legislation being enacted.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Beef Taskforce work on price transparency and the completion of the three market transparency studies commissioned by my Department will be an important step towards improving visibility of the complex supply chain which is integral in fostering trust and enhancing supply chain relationships. These studies will act as an important starting point for driving increased transparency.  It is more important than ever that we all work together given the unique set of challenges currently faced by the sector. Continued strong and constructive engagement in the Beef Taskforce is key to meeting these challenges.</p></reply>

The key measure of the scheme is aimed at measuring weaning efficiency and this objective determines the timing of weighing. The 2019 budget allocated a total of &euro;20 million for BEEP.  A total of 16,556 farmers participated in the pilot with payments totalling &euro;15.4m. Building on the success of the BEEP pilot of 2019, its successor BEEP-S of 2020 included optional animal health and welfare measures and provided payments of over &euro;40 million to over 24,000 beef farmers. </p>  <p>  Both of these schemes are now closed and payments have issued.  </p>  <p>  The details of the Beef Sector Efficiency Pilot announced in Budget 2021 are currently being finalised and this process includes consultations with key stakeholders including the main farm organization representatives. This scheme will build on the success of the BEEP-S scheme, aiming to improve the weaning efficiency of suckler cows and calves by recording weights and also optional animal health and welfare measures. This provides for a maximum payment per suckler cow/calf pair of &euro;90 per head for the first 10 suckler cows, and &euro;80 thereafter. The 2021 scheme will also contain &euro;5 million for a new calf weighing measure to support beef farmers rearing dairy beef calves.</p></reply>

On 2nd February 2021, Mr. Vilsack appeared before the US Senate Agriculture Committee - which is the first stage of the confirmation process - and was unanimously approved.</p>  <p>  If Mr. Vilsack is formally confirmed, this would be his third term as Secretary of the USDA. During his previous tenure, a strong relationship was built between the USDA and my own Department. This culminated in a visit to Ireland in June 2014.  It was also while he was Secretary that Ireland gained access for our beef to the US market, which at that point made us the first EU Member State to do so.</p>  <p>  When the position is formally confirmed, I will, of course, be in contact at the earliest possible date, with a view to strengthening what is a very important relationship in the context of the challenging international trading environment in which the Irish agri-food sector operates.</p></reply>

The review report was prepared by an inter-agency working group following on from the submissions from stakeholders. </p>  <p>  After the publication of this report, Minister Noonan proposed the establishment of a working group to include representatives from relevant Government Departments and State Agencies, Environmental Non-Governmental Organisations and industry stakeholders under an independent chairperson to examine the issues identified during the review. In this respect, the working group will address the key issues raised in the report itself, including future use of peat by the horticulture sector. The position of Chair for the Independent Working Group will be filled shortly. Once the Chair is in place, the setting up of the working group members can take place.</p>  <p>  In addition to these developments, my Department is actively looking at alternatives to peat and has funded two research projects to date. It has also recently sought further research be conducted here to explore alternatives to peat based growing media for horticultural production in this area in its latest Research Call for 2021. These must be available, affordable and sustainable and meet quality as well as environmental requirements.</p></reply>

The development of this policy was underpinned by extensive consultation with rural communities. Ongoing dialogue will be maintained with rural stakeholders throughout the duration of the policy timeframe, in order to respond to new issues identified, including, the challenges posed by COVID-19 and the impact of Brexit.  </p>  <p>  My Department has continued to deliver the range of policy measures to support urban and rural communities. Those policies are informed during development, by extensive consultation with a wide range of stakeholders including Government Departments, State Agencies, rural stakeholder groups, young people and the wider public. This on-going engagement process has been important in monitoring urban and rural community activity and in identifying areas relevant to the work of my Department where interventions such as targeted supports or funding are required and the most appropriate remedial or proactive measures that can be taken in response. </p>  <p>  The Rural Regeneration and Development Fund provides investment to support suitable projects in towns and villages with a population of less than 10,000, and outlying areas which will deliver on the National Strategic Objective of Strengthened Rural Economies and Communities and achieve sustainable economic and social development in these areas.  The third call for Category 1 applications to the Fund closed in December 2020.  Based on an analysis of the challenges faced by rural communities and ongoing discussions with stakeholders, this call for applications had a dual focus - to deliver planned and sustainable regeneration in towns and villages, and to channel investment towards economic recovery in the post Covid-19 environment, providing an immediate stimulus to support the recovery and further development of rural economies and communities.  For similar reasons, changes were also made in relation to the intensity of funding which could be sought from the Fund under this call, with the Fund providing up to 90% of the total project value for successful projects under this call.  I will announce the successful projects under this call in the weeks ahead.</p>  <p>  The LEADER programme remains operational through the COVID-19 crisis and payments continue to be made to the Local Action Groups, their Implementing Partners and to project promoters. In December last, I announced details of a Transitional LEADER Programme which will come into effect from 1 April 2021, with an initial allocation of &euro;20 million this year.</p>  <p>   A key focus of the Transitional Programme will be on building capacity within communities which have not received LEADER funding to date.  The programme will also support job creation, foster and encourage entrepreneurship, and support projects which address the climate agenda, digital transformation and the Smart Villages approach to building on local strengths and assets.</p>  <p>  Under the Transitional Programme, the grant rate for enterprises and commercially-focused community projects will be increased from a maximum of 50% to a maximum of 75%.  This will further help to support enterprise development and job creation in rural areas in a post COVID and Brexit environment.</p>  <p>  My Department currently supports over 420 community organisations under the Community Services Programme, or CSP, to provide local services through a social enterprise model, in both urban and rural communities.  CSP funding is provided as a fixed contribution towards the cost of employing an agreed number of full-time equivalent positions (FTEs) and a manager, where warranted.  The Department provides a co-funding contribution of &euro;32,000 per annum towards the cost of supporting a manager and &euro;19,033 per each FTE. In response to the difficulties being experienced by organisations due to COVID-19, my Department developed a Support Fund totalling &euro;4.75M which assists all CSP supported organisations to continue to retain their CSP supported employees on their payroll, regardless of whether the organisations are in a position to continue to provide normal activities or whether they have had to close their facilities/services as a result of the COVID restrictions.  The CSP Support Fund provided funding to many of these CSP supported organisations, ensuring that they can pay their full-time equivalent (FTE) CSP supported employees a maximum of &euro;350 net per week, with a proportionate amount for part-time CSP supported employees, while also assisting with the Employers PRSI contribution, during this crisis period up to April 2021. </p>  <p>  My Department and Pobal, who administer the programme on behalf of my Department, will allow the maximum level of flexibility to these organisation and we will continue to monitor the situation closely in light of COVID and any issues that may arise.</p>  <p>  I will continue to collaborate with my Government colleagues and will monitor the issues which impact our urban and rural communities in order to respond to emerging needs. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-02-17a.2963.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021021700101#WRXX01500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1063 and 1070 together.</p>  <p>  Addressing the issue of social inclusion and isolation in communities is central to many of my Department&rsquo;s policies and funding programmes which deliver targeted supports to benefit vulnerable individuals. Policy in my Department is informed, during its development, by extensive consultation with a wide range of stakeholders including Government Departments, State Agencies, rural stakeholder groups, young people and the wider public.</p>  <p>  This engagement process has been important in identifying areas relevant to the work of the Department where interventions such as supports or funding are required and the most appropriate remedial or proactive measures that can be taken in response. The policies and programmes developed to address isolation and promote social inclusion include the following:</p>  <p>The Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme (SICAP) is Ireland&rsquo;s primary social inclusion funding intervention, delivered locally by Local Development Companies (LDCs) to help those in the greatest need access supports to enable participation in communities. SICAP workers have extensive local connections and in-depth knowledge of available resources and supports and are continuing to work to ensure the emerging needs of their localities are responded to. </p>  <p>  - Local Development Companies (LDCs) have put in place various measures to ensure SICAP supports continue to be delivered and that vulnerable people continue to be supported throughout the COVID-19 crises, examples as follows:</p>  <p>  - Online supports are delivered via telephone, email, Zoom, etc., with LDCs providing additional support to individuals with limited access to technology, in the form providing them with laptops/tablets and upskilling them in their usage. </p>  <p>- LDCs that operate a &ldquo;friendly call&rdquo; service to elderly people saw an increase in demand for the service with some LDCs mobilizing local community groups to become involved in making regular contact with older, vulnerable isolated people during the COVID-19 crises. </p>  <p>  - LDCs supported an increase in demand for Meals on Wheels services and foodbanks, particularly for those not able to travel to shops and those experiencing food poverty. </p>  <p>  - Other responses included Pharmacy &amp;amp; Shopping Services; Employment and Self-Employment Supports; Supports to Community Groups; Online Training; Health, Well-Being and Social Prescribing; Mental Health Supports. </p>  <p>  - My Department offered every flexibility to the LDCs which freed up SICAP workers to focus on a community response to the crisis. Given their presence in local communities, the LDC response to the crisis was rapid and widespread with many of their 170,000 service users reached in the early days and weeks of the crisis.</p>  <p>- There is anecdotal evidence to suggest that COVID-19 has had a disproportionate effect on certain communities those already suffering from disadvantage would be more vulnerable to an interruption of services.   Measures were put  in place to support LDCs who continued to work under the SICAP programme with disadvantaged individuals.  My Department offered flexibility to the LDCs to redeploy SICAP staff to work as part of the  response to COVID-19. This Programme of flexibility will also continue into 2021 with additional areas of flexibility considered where required. In light of challenges faced by LDCs in engaging with beneficiaries the opportunity to reduce their targets was offered in 2020 and again in 2021. </p>  <p>  - Thematic support workshops will be delivered remotely by the Department and Pobal to LDCs in 2021. The purpose of these is to provide a platform to share experiences and learning from new ways of delivering supports during COVID-19. </p>  <p>  Isolation of people of all ages is a significant risk during the pandemic, particularly during periods of tight restrictions on movement and social interaction. The Community Call programme was introduced last year to provide local helplines through Local Authorities for practical supports, information sharing and befriending. As part of the &ldquo;Keep Well&rdquo; campaign, and in particular, the &lsquo;Staying Connected&rsquo; strand, this has been significantly expanded to be proactive with outreach to potentially isolated persons, as the main aim. My Department is represented on the oversight committee for this initiative.</p>  <p>Physical and social isolation can have a significant impact on people living in rural areas. My Department is finalising a new rural development policy for the next five years, which will build on the progress achieved through the Action Plan for Rural Development, which concluded in 2019. The policy will seek to strengthen and build resilience in our rural communities and will identify policy measures for delivery, in order to achieve these objectives.</p>  <p>The National Social Enterprise Policy aims to enable social enterprises increase their social, environmental and economic impact. Many social enterprises are based in rural or isolated areas and provide services to communities that may not otherwise be available. They also operate in our cities and other urban areas, often providing services to disadvantaged communities. </p>  <p>Other key interventions include funding the Seniors Alert Scheme, which enables older people to live securely, with peace of mind, in their homes through the provision of personal monitored alarms, ensuring contact is maintained with those who are vulnerable. </p>  <p>In addition, as part of the Department&rsquo;s COVID-19 Action Plan, increased support was provided for older people through our funding partnership with ALONE for their crisis telephone support line and follow-on practical supports for those who need it. </p>  <p>Volunteering is also very much at the forefront of initiatives of this nature and the Department will continue to support volunteering both by the provision of funding and other supports, and the implementation of the recently published National Volunteering Strategy. </p>  <p>Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) funding will ensure that remote areas, particularly those that are likely to wait longest for connections, are provided with access to high-speed broadband in their communities while waiting for the National Broadband Plan roll-out to reach them. </p>  <p>  The CL&Aacute;R programme provides funding for small scale infrastructural projects in rural areas that have suffered significant levels of population decline. In 2020 the programme  placed a particular focus on supporting CL&Aacute;R communities to deal with the impact of COVID-19 in rural areas through the addition of a new funding measure - Meals on Wheels and Linked Services. This measure was open to established organisations and groups involved in the provision of meals on wheels with linked services. Funding of &euro;340,000 was announced on 20th November 2020 for 45 projects under this Measure. The programme also supports voluntary organisations who provide transport for service users in rural areas under the Mobility and Cancer Care Measure. On 11th December 2020, funding of almost &euro;1.3 million was announced for 26 organisations under this measure. </p>  <p>  The issue of isolation in rural and urban communities cuts across the work of a number of Departments, and this is reflected in ongoing work on community policing, rural transport and social inclusion, among other areas. I will continue to collaborate with my Government colleagues to monitor the adequacy of these supports to address isolation and to work to deliver sustainable outcomes that positively impact the quality of life of those living and working in our communities.</p></reply>

The PPNs are the main link between these groups and their local authorities, and they enable the groups to make their voices heard within formal local decision-making structures. It is important to note that PPNs are wholly independent entities and decide for themselves what networking and capacity-building supports they wish to provide to their member groups.</p>  <p>  My Department supports and advances PPNs at a national level and they are accountable to my Department for their use of public monies and the activities they undertake on behalf of their communities.</p>  <p>  Over the past 12 months, my Department has provided direct funding of &euro;75,700 to each of the 31 PPNs around the country as well as providing structural supports, and this will continue into the future.  This funding supports the ongoing development of the PPNs. The Department also chairs and provides administrative support to the National PPN Advisory Group.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently funding and advancing a number of important national initiatives and key recommendations made by PPN stakeholders in the PPN's Annual Reports to promote their development (e.g. training, awareness-raising, IT support, visions for community wellbeing). Two important initiatives supported by my Department in this regard are the national training course for PPN stakeholders, which is currently underway, and a communications campaign due to be conducted this year. The Department also recently published a PPN Handbook to assist and guide the PPNs and stakeholders in their day to day work.</p>  <p>  My Department is committed to continuing to support PPNs both financially and structurally so that local communities, including marginalised communities, can continue to have an influence on matters that affect them.</p></reply>

BCPs are typically community centres and sports clubs, in the majority of cases managed by local community groups. These sites will primarily be located in areas expected to wait longest for the arrival of fibre services under the National Broadband Plan.</p>  <p>  The objective is that the BCPs will become long-term community assets, providing for a multitude of local needs as they develop over the coming years. In this regard, my officials are designing a suite of programmes, underpinned by the connectivity at BCPs, to develop remote working, eHealth, education and training, and arts and culture projects. </p>  <p>  I have secured an additional &euro;5 million under the Town and Village Renewal Scheme this year for the further development of remote working facilities in digital hubs and BCPs, which I hope to be in a position to announce shortly.</p>  <p>  My Department also funds the Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme (SICAP) which supports over 2,500 local community groups across Ireland annually. In 2020 my Department relaxed SICAP programme rules in order to respond to issues that arose as a result of COVID-19, such as IT deficiencies and connectivity for both individuals and community groups. The threshold for grants to community groups has risen from &euro;1,500 to &euro;2,500, to respond to ICT and other needs during the pandemic.</p>  <p>  Funding for the type of projects referred to by the Deputy may also be available through the LEADER Transitional Programme. This programme will come into effect on 1 April 2021 for new project applications.  The programme will be delivered through Local Action Groups (LAGs) in each of the 28 LEADER sub-regional areas around the country. In order for a project to be eligible for LEADER funding, it must be compatible with the actions outlined in the approved Local Development Strategy for the relevant LEADER area, and it must comply with the Operating Rules and EU Regulations in place for the programme.</p></reply>

This engagement will continue as we endeavour to support the full implementation of the strategy. </p>  <p>  My Department has statutory responsibility to coordinate the design and implementation of the Local Economic and Community Plans (LECPs) at a local level. LECPs work with a 6-year life cycle and current LECPs are completing in 2021 and into 2022. An LECP Advisory Group has been established to support the process to develop Guidelines for the forthcoming LECPs, with representation from Local Authorities. This process will be key for building an effective LECP framework on which community based services will thrive. </p>  <p>  My Department also has statutory responsibility for the local and community development governance structures introduced on foot of the local government reform process, namely the Local Community Development Committees (LCDCs), the Public Participation Networks (PPNs) and Local Economic and Community Plans (LECPs). As a result, the Department has ongoing interaction with all of these structures to support their ongoing work and the work of Local Authorities in the context of community development and social inclusion, including my Department's Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme (SICAP).  Other examples of my Department's engagement with Local Authorities in the context of delivery of community-based services or requirements include the following:</p>  <p>  - The Department funded programmes in 2020 including two rounds of the Community Enhancement Programme (&euro;7m) and two rounds of the COVID-19 Emergency Fund (&euro;4.2m). These were either administered by the Local Authority (LA) or by the LCDC (with support from the LA) in each area, and provide small grants to community groups.</p>  <p>  - The Department worked to support the Community Call initiative which was an unprecedented mobilisation of both state and voluntary resources to combat the effects of COVID-19. The initiative was led by LAs in each area.</p>  <p>  - My Department has responsibility for supporting the delivery of a public library service by LAs and provides funding to assist the authorities with the provision of this service.</p>  <p>  - My Department provides ongoing financial support to support the community function in local authorities including the work of the LCDCs. This funding is in the region of &euro;2m on an annual basis.</p></reply>

In the last year, in particular, my Department has put in place various initiatives including:</p>  <p>  - Worked with Pobal to put in place guidelines for the community and voluntary sector for reopening or operating their premises safely, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  - Worked to support the Community Call initiative which was an unprecedented mobilisation of both state and voluntary resources to combat the effects of COVID-19. This included providing funding for a COVID-19 Community Outreach initiative  implemented by the Wheel and Irish Rural link, which supported the voluntary sector. </p>  <p>  - Provided flexibility under the Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme (SICAP) to allow Local Development Companies work to support initiatives put in place to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>  <p>  - Funded programmes in 2020 including two rounds of the Community Enhancement Programme (&euro;7m) and two rounds of the COVID-19 Emergency Fund (&euro;4.2m).</p>  <p>  - My Department currently supports over 420 community organisations under the Community Services Programme, or CSP, to provide local social, economic and environmental services through a social enterprise model.  Pobal, who administer the programme on behalf of my Department engage with organisations under this programme on a regular basis. </p>  <p>  - In response to the difficulties being experienced by organisations due to COVID-19, my Department developed an additional Support Fund totalling &euro;4.75M which assists CSP supported organisations to continue to retain CSP supported employees on their payroll and also provides assistance towards the cost  of the Employers PRSI contribution, during this crisis period, and up to April 2021. My Department and Pobal are continuing to monitor the situation closely.</p>  <p>  - The CL&Aacute;R 2020 programme placed a particular focus on supporting CL&Aacute;R communities to deal with the impact of COVID-19 in their areas through the addition of a new funding measure - Meals on Wheels and Linked Services. This measure was open to established organisations and groups involved in the provision of meals on wheels with linked services. Funding of &euro;340,000 was announced on 20th November 2020 for 45 projects under this Measure. The programme also  supports voluntary organisations who provide transport for service users in rural areas under the Mobility and Cancer Care Measure. On 11 December 2020, I approved funding of almost &euro;1.3 million for 26 organisations under this measure. I anticipate that the measures to be funded under the CL&Aacute;R 2021 programme will be launched in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  - My Department takes a partnership approach to its work with the voluntary sector and this will continue through the implementation of many of the strategies and action plans under the aegis of this Department, in the development of policy and delivery of services, and through the networks and support structures, many of which we help to maintain. In doing this, we will continue to put communities at the centre of finding and implementing solutions for their own areas.</p></reply>

The programme supports projects from local community groups and businesses which, amongst other objectives, promote economic development, social inclusion and the protection of the rural environment.  </p>  <p>  The programme is administered at local level by 29 Local Action Group across the country who are responsible for selecting and awarding LEADER funding to projects within their own geographical area. </p>  <p>  Under Ireland's current LEADER progamme 2014-2020, &euro;168.7 million was allocated to Local Action Groups (LAGs) for project approvals over the lifetime of the programme.  In the twelve-month period to 31 January 2021, a total of 1,425 core projects, with a value of over &euro;60 million, were approved for LEADER funding by the LAGs.  The investment in these projects make a significant contribution to the development of rural communities across Ireland.</p>  <p>   The current LEADER programme will come to an end on 31 March this year as far as new project approvals are concerned. Due to a delay in agreeing the post-2020 EU Budget, the next EU LEADER programme will not commence until 2023.  </p>  <p>  To bridge the gap to the start of the next programme, in December 2020 I announced details of a Transitional LEADER Programme which will come into effect from 1 April 2021, with an initial allocation of &euro;20 million this year.  One of the objectives on the Transitional Programme is to build capacity in communities, particularly those that have not yet availed of funding under LEADER or my Department's other rural development programmes. </p>  <p>  My officials and I meet with stakeholders involved in the delivery of the LEADER programme on a regular basis, including Local Authorities, Local Development Companies and the Irish Local Development Network.

In 2020, the scheme was adapted to assist towns and villages to respond to the impact of COVID-19. </p>  <p>  I approved over &euro;25.7 million in funding for more than 500 projects under the scheme last year, with the support of an extra &euro;10 million from the Government's July Stimulus package. The approvals included 18 projects with a value of &euro;854,533 in Co. Kildare.  </p>  <p>  I have secured a budget of &euro;20 million this year for an expanded Town and Village Renewal Scheme.
