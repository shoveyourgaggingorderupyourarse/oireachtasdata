The online service providers have reported to my officials that on occasions more than 40,000 individual daily users have logged in to online mart sales. The majority of marts are reporting good clearance rates and robust prices.</p>  <p>  From 1st December, marts have once again been operating under Level 3 measures. Potential buyers can attend the sales ring subject to adhering to 2-metre social distancing, and can view stock in the pens without prior appointment, maintaining 2-metre social distancing.</p>  <p>  In recognition of the ongoing investment by marts in IT infrastructure, and subject to receiving the necessary approval, I will be bringing forward a grant scheme for marts early in 2021.  </p>  <p>I thank mart managers and farmers for engaging so well durinf the Level 5 restrictions and palying their part in keeping each other safe.   </p></reply>

A Judicial Review to the High Court was taken by two applicant fishermen challenging the validity of the Policy.  </p><p>On 6th October 2020, the Judge held in summary that the High Court&rsquo;s final order should be, among other matters, a declaration that Policy Directive 1 of 2019 was made in breach of fair procedures and is void and/or of no legal effect.</p><p>The breach of fair procedures as referenced above related to a failure with obligations to consult with the applicants in accordance with, and to the extent required by, the consultation process and in particular by failing to consult with them once a preferred option had been identified.</p><p>The High Court&rsquo;s ruling has been appealed by the State to the Court of Appeal and a stay is being sought on the orders granted therein. The date for the Court hearing directions is set for 11<sup>th</sup>December. </p><p>As this matter is sub judice, I am not in a position to comment until the matter can be resolved before the Courts. However I would like to assure you that I am committed to delivering the promises made in the Programme for Government that inshore waters continue to be protected for smaller fishing vessels and pair trawling be prohibited inside the six-mile limit.  </p></reply>

It has also been a central element of my Department&rsquo;s response to Brexit. </p>  <p>  While the UK market has always been an important one for Irish exports, successive governments have sought to avoid too great a reliance upon it. The need for diversification has therefore informed the strategic development of the sector for some time, but has become more acute in the context of Brexit. My Department has, accordingly, been very active in intensifying its support for market diversification by, for example, providing budgetary supports to Bord Bia, undertaking Trade Missions to develop new opportunities, and leveraging our network of agricultural attach&eacute;s in key markets around the globe.</p>  <p>  Brexit also produces challenges in terms of access to European markets and further afield via the landbridge.  Businesses will still be able to export food to Europe via the landbridge.  However, it is clear that the way in which operators use the landbridge will change. Delays on the landbridge route are likely and businesses may wish to look at switching to direct route options.  The process for moving goods directly between Ireland and other EU Member States will not change nor be subject to the new  procedures. </p>  <p>  Responsibility for the enforcement of Union agri-food legislation, including traceability and labelling rules, lies with Member States, whose competent authorities monitor and verify, through the implementation of official controls, that relevant Union requirements are effectively complied with and enforced.  My Department will continue to meet its obligations in respect of the Official Controls Regulations irrespective of Brexit.</p></reply>

This commitment was demonstrated in the Budget 2021 when I secured funding for the rollover of existing schemes and through the additional budget allocation for 2021 of &euro;79 million in new funding for a range of projects to include new agri-environment initiatives. </p>  <p>  This funding includes provision for a results-based agri-environment pilot project designed to test the feasibility of the results-based approach for possible upscaling at a national level. The results-based approach provides the highest financial reward to farmers who manage their land in a manner that delivers the greatest environmental benefits. The project will have a significant focus on biodiversity and climate change. It has the aim of increasing the number of farmers undertaking agri-environment actions and will be directed at farmers not currently in GLAS. There is significant work ongoing to design this new scheme and I expect to be in a position to announce the details as soon as they are available. In advance of this, I am also planning a public consultation in the near future on the scheme to hear how farmers feel the pilot scheme should look.</p>  <p>  There is growing recognition of the potential of the results-based approach in the delivery of agri-environment schemes. These include the identification of environmental and biodiversity returns from specific farm measures and a more focused use of funding. They also have the potential to raise awareness among farmers regarding farming methods with the greatest environmental and biodiversity potential. It is expected that this pilot project will inform the development of the next large scale agri-environment scheme under the CAP Strategic Plan to follow on from GLAS. </p>  <p>  With regards to existing scheme participation, my Department is pressing for the earliest adoption of EU regulations to facilitate the operation of schemes in the period between the current CAP and the CAP Strategic Plan post-2020. The intention is to offer a one-year extension of existing schemes from the current RDP, including GLAS 1 and 2 and ensure that scheme participants have certainty on their scheme participation during the transitional phase.</p></reply>

The Taskforce provides a robust implementation structure for commitments entered into in the Beef Sector Agreement of 15th September 2019, with timelines and stakeholder engagement. </p><p>There have been six meetings of the Taskforce to date and the next meeting will be held later this month.</p><p>As part of the Agreement, three specific consultancy studies, all of which relate broadly to market transparency, were commissioned. </p><p>- a  summary of competition law issues as relevant to the sector. </p><p>- an independent review of market and customer requirements, specifically in relation to the four in-spec bonus criteria currently in operation; </p><p>- an independent examination of the price composition of the total value of the animal, including the fifth quarter, along the supply chain. </p><p>The tender for the studies was awarded to Grant Thornton.  Despite the operational challenges associated with COVID-19,  my understanding is that they are progressing well.  The first two studies will be discussed at the next TaskForce meeting. </p><p>I note that work has continued steadily towards fulfilling all the actions in the Beef Stakeholder Agreement, despite the Covid19 crisis which added a further layer of complexity and a significantly challenging working environment. Full details of the actions, progress updates and meeting minutes are available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p><p>I was pleased to have the opportunity to address the Taskforce at their September meeting. I emphasised that constructive and meaningful engagement across this group is essential to maintaining and developing the sector in a sustainable way which adds value at all stages of the supply chain, but particularly for the primary producer.</p><p>I believe the sector can rise to the many challenges facing it and that the Taskforce has an important role to play.  I look forward to seeing continuous, strong engagement from the Taskforce as its work progresses.</p></reply>

Market access or enhanced access for various products has been achieved with a number  of third countries in this period including USA, China, Japan, Singapore, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Chile, Mexico and Ukraine.  </p>  <p>  Ministerial trade missions, in collaboration with Bord Bia and the Irish Embassy network, are important in promoting awareness of Irish agri-food products and supporting meaningful interaction with its growing global customer base. For example, my Department and Bord Bia recently hosted a dairy-focused virtual trade mission to five countries in South East Asia. An innovative aspect of the mission was that it was conducted entirely online. I also participated with Bord Bia and Department officials in business meetings with customers in China, Japan, the USA and the United Arab Emirates.</p>  <p>  The Government's continued commitment to new market development is illustrated by the appointment of my colleague, Martin Heydon T.D., as Minister of State with specific responsibility for this area.  </p>  <p>  Once a market is opened, my Department and Bord Bia are proactive in supporting industry to capitalise on the potential trade opportunities created to further expand the global footprint of the Irish agri-food sector. </p>  <p>Further detail on my Department&rsquo;s initiatives on opening and developing overseas outlets for the agri-food sector can be found in the recently published Market Access Report. The Market Access Portal on my Department's website provides details on the full range of open markets and the relevant certification conditions negotiated with importing countries for a wide range of agri-food product categories.  </p></reply>

We are seeking to protect the interests of the Irish fleet in relation to access conditions, quota shares and the traditional activity of the EU fleet, while insisting that fisheries issues are dealt with as part of an overall trade deal. </p>  <p>  Securing an overall future relationship agreement, including the best possible outcome on fisheries, is a priority for Ireland.  I and my Government colleagues have repeatedly raised fisheries as a priority for Ireland in all bilateral political contacts and in particular in their meetings with Michel Barnier.  I have used every opportunity to re-enforce fisheries as a national priority.  In particular we, and our EU partners, are very clear that the issue of fisheries cannot be separated from the wider trade negotiations. </p>  <p>  The Common Fisheries Policy provides the framework for the long-term conservation and sustainability of fish stocks and is designed to ensure the long-term sustainability of fishing in Irish and throughout EU waters.  The CFP is reviewed every 10 years and the next review is scheduled to be completed by 31st December 2022 when the European Commission will report to the European Parliament and the Council on the functioning of the CFP.  </p>  <p>  The Commission has advised that it intends to commence the review process when there is clarity on the future relationship of the EU and the UK.  The review is expected to be detailed and comprehensive.   At EU level, it is expected that all stakeholders will have an opportunity to engage actively in the review work including the fishing industry, eNGOs and Member States.   </p>  <p>  Ireland will prepare for and participate actively and effectively in the review, including the interaction with stakeholders to prepare Ireland's case and identify priorities.   </p></reply>

These funds play a leading role in scaling up science and technological developments to industrial activity by demonstrating technical and economic feasibility and the development of previously underdeveloped value chains.  These funds can also support a pipeline of activities to lead to participation in EU funding opportunities. The opportunities include the Circular Biobased Europe Partnership, LIFE funding and also financing opportunities through the EIB Circular Bioeconomy Thematic Investment Platform. </p>  <p>  Food loss &amp;amp; waste, is a separate but inter-related policy area to circular bioeconomy.  It requires steps to be taken in relation to prevention, reduction, recovery and reuse (distribution/redistribution) of avoidable waste prior to recycling and valorisation (as e.g. nutrients, feed, biobased products, renewable energy) of unavoidable waste.  My Department has provided support for three projects funded to the amount of &euro;100,000 (excl VAT). This funding is provided under the Rural Innovation Development Fund.  It is available to organisations and economic operators involved in Food Waste Reduction, to promote reducing food waste generated by food businesses, retailer/wholesalers or suppliers in rural areas.   My Department is also engaged with the Department of Environment Climate and Communications, who lead on national food waste prevention programmes &amp;amp; Climate Action Plan tasks, with the aim to reduce food waste by 50% by 2030.</p></reply>

This was a once-off method of allocation of payment entitlements from the National Reserve and it has not occurred since 2015. In the current CAP programme new payment entitlements are allocated from the National Reserve. </p>  <p>  With regard to the next CAP, the draft regulations do not specifically provide for a Scottish Derogation type of allocation of payment entitlements from the National Reserve.

This is exemplified by the DAFM-funded, Teagasc-led project to investigate the establishment of a dedicated Agricultural Greenhouse Gas Research &amp;amp; Innovation Centre. Coupled to the engagement with international partners on this project to provide a basis for best-practice of a proposed centre for climate research excellence, is the focus on the specific climate challenges in Ireland that will enhance research, advisory and farmer coordination to deliver a sustainable climate-friendly agri-food system.</p></reply>

Given the nature of the Irish economy, the importance of agriculture, coupled with the lack of heavy industry in comparison with some other EU Member States, agriculture is responsible for approximately 34% of all greenhouse gas emissions. Clearly, primary agriculture will need to step up and play its part in reducing absolute emission over the years ahead in line with EU and national targets, However it is critical to note that farmers have already made great strides in this regard and have shown a willingness to meet all our climate ambitions.</p>  <p>  The Deputy's question is timely, as I am publishing a climate and air roadmap for the primary agriculture sector shortly. This roadmap will set a out a series of actions that farmers can start to implement on their farms to reduce overall emissions. We need to start seeing changes now. The roadmap will be very much based on the measures contained in the Teagasc Marginal Abatement Cost Curve for greenhouse gases which was published in 2018. </p>  <p>  I want to continue to invest heavily in research and innovation in climate smart agriculture. By investing in research now, we can develop innovative solutions to further reduce the climate footprint of our sector in medium to long term. </p>  <p>  Finally, I see the issue of carbon sequestration as an opportunity for Irish farmers. No other sector will have the ability to offset carbon emissions to the same extent as agriculture. Recently, I provided funding to Teagasc to establish a National Agricultural Soil Carbon Observatory. This observatory will facilitate the intensive monitoring of carbon emissions and removals across a range of Irish soils, putting Ireland at the forefront internationally in terms of understanding, supporting and rewarding farmers for practices that build carbon stores in our soils. </p></reply>

A core focus of this effort is to encourage uptake and use of innovations by farmers in order to promote an agricultural system that reduces and prevents negative impacts on the climate.</p>  <p>  Through a combination of both national and trans-national competitive research calls that my Department has operated or engaged in over recent years, significant funding has been invested in climate related research.  Indeed, over the last 12-months alone, over &euro;8.8m has been committed to support climate and environment-orientated research projects undertaken by early stage researchers in Irish research institutions for the benefit of the agricultural sector and which aim to help farmers work towards and achieve climate-friendly and climate-neutral farms. </p>  <p>  In addition, during 2020 we continued to promote and support researcher engagement in relevant agri-climate research opportunities offered through the EU Green Deal, European Research Networks and the EU LIFE programme. Furthermore, with a focus on delivering a climate-friendly agricultural system relevant to farmers and the agri-food sector as a whole in Ireland, my Department&rsquo;s work, both nationally and internationally, in the development of future research and innovation strategies, programmes and funding opportunities over the next 10-years continues to be of critical importance. </p>  <p>  As we approach 2021, my Department is finalising a new thematic national research Call that will provide further funding to allow the research community to develop innovative solutions for farmers and their sector in order to support them in maintaining and delivering a sustainable and climate sensitive agri-food, forest and bio-based system.  Under Budget 2021 I secured an addtional &euro;3m which has been allocated to research, bringing the research budget within my Department to &euro;18m. </p>  <p>  This competitively allocated funding for research is additional to the grant-in-aid allocations to Teagasc of &euro;147m in 2021, much of which goes towards research and advisory activities related to climate sustainability.</p></reply>

This also sets a forest reference level for the period 2021-2025. </p>  <p>  These older forests for the purposes of greenhouse gas accounting under the regulation are referred to as &ldquo;managed forest lands&rdquo; and which are older than 30 years of age. This reference level is needed in order to account and report greenhouse gas changes from 2021-2025 against this land category. These forests represent about 60% of the forest estate. This detailed assessment has now taken place and is documented in the National Forestry Accounting Plan which has also been reviewed by the European Commission. </p>  <p>  While the Managed Forest Lands area, because of particular circumstances and timing, will be a small emitter over the upcoming period, the amount in question will be far outweighed by what the rest of the estate is storing and sequestering. It is estimated that these older forests will be a small net source of approximately 0.1 million tonnes of CO2 per year, when harvested wood products are included, over the period 2021-2025. </p>  <p>Although these older forests will be a small source of carbon dioxide over the period 2021-2025, projections indicate that the entire forest estate will remain a net sink over the entire period from 2021 to 2050. However, the net greenhouse balance of the estate is strongly dependent on the level of harvest, deforestation and afforestation.   </p></reply>

The review of the NDP, which commenced recently, will allow for an alignment of investment with economic recovery, strategic areas of importance outlined in the Programme for Government and preparation for the post-crisis economy. The NDP Review will seek to deliver a competitive, resilient and regionally balanced recovery.</p>  <p>  Detailed and ambitious Regional, Economic and Spatial Strategies were developed by Ireland&rsquo;s three Regional Assemblies under Project Ireland 2040. The Southern Region&rsquo;s strategy includes a Metropolitan Spatial Area Plan for the Limerick-Shannon region and provides a comprehensive assessment of opportunities available to guide future development, and clear set of policy and quality-of-life objectives for regional, local and national bodies to jointly pursue for the Limerick and Shannon area. These strategies for our regions set out to align economic, transport, planning and ecological objectives in a way that is place specific, and informed by local stakeholders.</p>  <p>  In addition, my Department&rsquo;s nine Regional Enterprise Plans to 2020 play a central role in supporting the delivery of balanced regional development, including for the Mid-West region. The Mid-West Plan is focused on a number of objectives aimed at developing the region&rsquo;s capacity to deliver economic growth and is being implemented by a Steering Committee involving the enterprise agencies, local enterprise offices, local authorities, higher and further education bodies, private sector and others.</p>  <p>I am considering the Programme for Government commitment in relation to the Shannon Estuary and how Government can best deliver this.  </p></reply>

This requirement to report does not apply to infectious disease, other illnesses or mental health impairment as it is not always possible to directly attribute these health conditions to that workplace.  As COVID-19 is an infectious disease which can be caught in any location, it cannot always be reliably associated with a work activity.</p>  <p>  Reporting mechanisms have been put in place to ensure that the HSA is made aware of workplace clusters of COVID-19 through an agreement with the HSE to share information on COVID-19 outbreaks in workplaces especially in high-risk sectors. The HSA also participates on national and local outbreak teams which enables it to respond to particular workplace clusters.</p>  <p>  Importantly , the Biological Agents regulations have now been updated to specifically include SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19. This creates a strict reporting obligation on employers to report the infection of workers exposed to the virus as part of certain work activities. We have all made huge sacrifices to limit the spread of the virus, but none so much as our healthcare workers and those that work in our labs, processing tests and researching the virus. These new regulations are designed to put in place even more protections for workers who are employed in those settings to make sure we are doing everything we can to keep them safe. </p>  <p>The HSA is currently preparing a Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) on the matter of making COVID-19 a reportable illness to the authority. The RIA will assess the feasibility and impact of introducing a statutory requirement for employers to report to the HSA, infections of COVID-19 that are attributable to work activity.  </p></reply>

The IDA has a significant role to play in helping us achieve that objective. The Agency has been working hard, through its staff both here and abroad, to encourage overseas investors to locate or expand in Ireland&rsquo;s regions. The Agency&rsquo;s performance in recent years demonstrates that these efforts are producing results. For example, 54,868 jobs were created outside of Dublin over the past five years leading to 33,118 additional direct jobs (net) on the ground in regions at the end of the IDA&rsquo;s 5-year strategy. </p><p>Between 2010 and 2019 there were two new name investments located in County Donegal, one each in 2011 and 2012.</p><p>These statistics reflect one element of FDI performance, which is not accurately measured by the number of new-name investors.  A more accurate reflection of FDI performance is demonstrated in the Annual Employment Survey which demonstrates a strong performance in Co Donegal over the last decade.   <table>    <tr>       <th>Year </th>       <th>2010 </th>       <th>2011 </th>       <th>2012 </th>       <th>2013 </th>       <th>2014 </th>       <th>2015 </th>       <th>2016 </th>       <th>2017 </th>       <th>2018 </th>       <th>2019 </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>No.of Companies </td>       <td>12 </td>       <td>12 </td>       <td>13 </td>       <td>13 </td>       <td>13 </td>       <td>13 </td>       <td>13 </td>       <td>13 </td>       <td>13 </td>       <td>13 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total Jobs </td>       <td>1,847 </td>       <td>2,101 </td>       <td>2,223 </td>       <td>2,382 </td>       <td>2,607 </td>       <td>2,925 </td>       <td>3,048 </td>       <td>3,400 </td>       <td>3,506 </td>       <td>3,776 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The table above details how Donegal, along with many other parts of the country, has benefitted from this strong regional focus. The County has experienced a significant increase in FDI-driven employment since 2010, with job numbers in IDA client firms there increasing from 1,847 in 2010 to 3,776 at the end of 2019. The County is now home to 13 IDA companies including Abbott, Optum and Pramerica.</p><p>The IDA&rsquo;s experience, over many decades, has shown that the growth of existing overseas firms here can produce as many jobs, if not more, than new name investors. That is why the IDA focuses on both supporting the growth and expansion of its current clients here as well as securing new investors to locate for the first time in locations like Donegal. Pursuing that twin-track strategy has helped produce record FDI results in recent years and should lead to further investment and job creation in the years ahead.</p><p>While clear progress has been made in creating new jobs and economic opportunity in Donegal, the Government is determined to achieve more. Efforts will continue in 2020 and beyond, whether in support of indigenous or overseas enterprise, to help create more employment and economic opportunities in the County.</p><p>In November 2020, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta has announced that Swiss Consultancy firm, Pangea is to establish its operational hub for Finance, Human Resources and Operations in the Donegal Gaeltacht in Gweedore. IDA worked in partnership with &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta to deliver this project.</p><p>The number of Site Visits to County Donegal for the period 2010 to 2019 and to date in 2020 are shown below: <table>    <tr>       <th>County </th>       <th>2010 </th>       <th>2011 </th>       <th>2012 </th>       <th>2013 </th>       <th>2014 </th>       <th>2015 </th>       <th>2016 </th>       <th>2017 </th>       <th>2018 </th>       <th>2019 </th>       <th>2020 to date </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Donegal </td>       <td>4 </td>       <td>2 </td>       <td>1 </td>       <td>7 </td>       <td>6 </td>       <td>5 </td>       <td>7 </td>       <td>2 </td>       <td>8 </td>       <td>12 </td>       <td>1 E-Site Visit to Q3</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Last year there were a total 12 site visits to Donegal. The introduction of international travel restrictions related to Covid-19 has, amongst other things, led to the cancellation or postponement of scheduled IDA site visits and client meetings in every region of the country, including Donegal.  </p><p>As an alternative to site visits, the IDA has migrated many of its business development and client engagement activities to digital platforms. The Agency has developed new digital content and has also put in place an E-Site Visit experience for potential investors. There have been a total of 131 in-person site visits and 101 E-visits nationally as of the third quarter and this is the latest data available.</p><p>It should be noted that site visits are one measure only in a company&rsquo;s interest in a particular location and may not necessarily be a true measure of the overall level of foreign direct investment (FDI) activity in a region or county.  Potential clients visiting Ireland may visit more than one county and may return to a location more than once. These figures represent individual visits and are therefore not indicative of the number of companies that have visited. The final decision on where to locate an investment is always decided by the client and not by IDA Ireland.Regular engagement and collaboration with stakeholders are important in positioning any regional location to attract FDI and in this respect IDA Ireland continues to engage with Stakeholders as well as working with existing clients in all regional locations to generate additional jobs.</p></reply>

Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s position is based on the fact that, while EU regulations permit a threshold of 0.2% of THC in hemp products, products containing any trace of THC are considered as a controlled drug in Ireland under the Misuse of Drugs Orders. In effect, there is no lower limit of THC permissible under national legislation. </p>  <p>  Therefore, products which can contain even minimal levels of THC pose a reputational risk to Enterprise Ireland as the agency is not in a position to verify which companies, products and extraction methods meet the legal requirement in Ireland to contain 0.00% levels of THC.</p></reply>

The H&amp;S Unit works closely with our accommodation team and across our 11 locations nationally to ensure that we are adhering to national health and safety requirements and legislation. In most of these locations the Department shares the premises with other Government Departments, agencies or private sector bodies and works collaboratively to ensure best H&amp;S practice locally. </p>  <p>  Whilst the vast majority of Departmental staff have been working remotely in keeping with Government guidance in March, some staff are required to attend the workplace to undertake essential work. This is determined by senior management to ensure continuity of essential services for the public but at all times operating safe social distancing and complying with all other public health requirements. To assist in this some of the &ldquo;free&rdquo; office capacity arising due to remote working is being used as much as is reasonably practical and work is being organised to ensure physical distance between staff onsite is maintained.  </p>  <p>  Since the outset of the pandemic, the Department and each of our Offices, responded swiftly to implement a range of measures to minimise the transmission of COVID-19 to staff and visitors who may, on occasion, be onsite in our buildings. This includes: the provision of additional hand sanitising kits, wipes and PPE, enhanced cleaning regimes, signage and guidance for staff when occupying shared and communal areas, and where feasible, undertaking works to adjust the physical environment of our occupied buildings - all to support social distancing of staff.</p>  <p>  The Department also established a cross-Department COVID-19 Working Group to oversee various issues arising as a result of the pandemic. The Working Group meets fortnightly developed our own &ldquo;Working Safely&rdquo; protocols ensuring its alignment, and updating as required, with the public health advice and the national &ldquo;Working Safely Protocol".</p>  <p>  A range of H&amp;S and COVID-19 specific information is communicated frequently to all staff and is available on our internal intranet. Staff and visitors are reminded of their personal responsibility to adhere to ongoing protocols.</p></reply>

Under both the IEC and the 1992 EPA Act, activities that require an Integrated Pollution Control or an Industrial Emissions Licence include pigs and poultry operations, milk processing and slaughter houses.</p>  <p>  To ensure consistent standards across EU Member States, licence conditions require the use of best available techniques (BAT). BAT standards are prepared by the European Commission.</p>  <p>  When a new BAT standard is adopted all licence conditions for existing installations falling under the main activity have to be reconsidered and if necessary, updated to ensure compliance within 4 years. Plant or side operators are legally required to meet emission levels specified in the BAT standard, unless a detailed derogation request based on costs and benefits is received, assessed and formally approved by the EPA.</p>  <p>  Before the EPA decides on a licence application under the IED, it must carry out a thorough assessment of the application. This includes, in many cases, an environmental impact assessment (EIA) as required under the EIA Directive, and an appropriate assessment as required under the Habitats Directive. The assessment process is multidisciplinary, involving specialists from different environmental areas such as noise, water quality, and air emissions. Prediction modelling is also undertaken to determine local environmental impacts. </p>  <p>  The Office of Environmental Enforcement within the EPA is responsible for enforcement of the EPA licences. The IED contains mandatory requirements on environmental inspections and requires site visit frequencies ranging from every year to every 3 years, depending on environmental risk-based criteria.   </p></reply>

The Irish cities involved in the study were Dublin and Cork. The report quantified and valued pollution-related health impacts, concluding that the total annual per capita cost is &euro;836 in Dublin, and &euro;756 in Cork. The overall average per capita cost across the EU was &euro;1,276 per annum. </p><p>While Ireland compares favourably to much of Europe, we are taking the following steps to reduce the levels of traffic emissions in our cities:</p><p>- putting 180,000 electric vehicles on our roads by 2025 and almost 1 million by 2030;</p><p>- taking steps to decarbonise the public transport fleet;</p><p>- developing a 5-year cycling strategy, and the roll-out of 200km of new cycle lanes; and</p><p>- encouraging a transition to public transport through a new Park and Ride Strategy to help reduce congestion and lower journey times.</p><p>In addition, the Urban Transport-Related Air Pollution Working Group (UTRAP) was formed last year to consider and address the level of transport-generated air pollution in certain areas. This Group, which is jointly chaired by the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications and the Department of Transport, is due to publish an interim report shortly which will contain a range of recommendations to help further address transport-related emissions.  </p></reply>

In order to implement the Plan, the cost of which was estimated to be in the region of &euro;150m, the Minister for Finance provided a loan of &euro;30m to the company in December 2017 to support the renewal of the post office network (&euro;15m) and the continued fulfilment of a 5 day per week mails delivery service (&euro;15m). </p>  <p>  As part of the delivery of the plan the company was split into two distinct business units, An Post Mails and Parcels and An Post Retail.</p>  <p>  An Post is transforming its retail network by delivering new products and new formats. This includes, among other things, diversifying and growing the financial services products it provides for individuals and SMEs to include loans, credit cards and more foreign exchange products, local banking in association with the major banks and a full range of State Savings products. Two new dedicated sub-brands, An Post Money and a new business-to-business brand, An Post Commerce, were launched. Investment by An Post of &euro;50 million in the network is designed to encourage communities to use the enhanced services in their local post office.</p>  <p>  Government believes An Post has untapped potential to do more and make a further significant contribution across many areas of public, business and community life in Ireland. With an evolving mandate An Post can emerge as a central hub for a wide variety of valuable community focused services. We will work closely with An Post to see if there is scope to channel additional services through the network. All options will be considered fully and efforts will be redoubled to give effect to our commitment to ensuring a sustainable and viable post office network. </p></reply>

These criteria are currently defined under the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) test procedure and include a minimum range in electric mode of 50 km and a maximum emission level of 50 gCO<sub>2</sub>/km. From January 2021, the NEDC criteria will be replaced by the Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP) which will adjust the minimum electric range required to 40km with a maximum emission level of 65 gCO<sub>2</sub>/km. In March 2021, these will be adjusted again to minimum electric range of 50km and maximum emissions of 50gCO<sub>2</sub>/km (WLTP).

Pre-works involve construction of new duct routes, erection of poles, building chambers, and tree trimming. On completion of these pre-works, the main construction works can commence. This involves deploying fibre overhead on poles and in underground ducts, splicing of fibre, and unblocking of ducts. Once the main construction works are completed and the appropriate level of testing has been undertaken, the fibre network can be commissioned and end users can order their connection.</p><p>The first fibre to the home connections are expected shortly in Carrigaline and  will be subject to technical testing and validation prior to a wider release of the area. I am advised that from early 2021 retailers will be able to resell the service and householders in these areas will be able to order high speed broadband provided via the NBI network. </p><p>Further details are available on specific areas within Cork through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie.  Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises when works are due to commence.I am aware that concerns have been raised regarding the level of information available on the deployment of the NBI network and I am advised that NBI is working to provide more detail on its website, with a rolling update on network build plans.</p><p>Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 3 December 2020, 217 publicly accessible BCP sites have been installed by NBI, with 59 already connected to high speed broadband service. The remaining locations will be connected through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development in the coming months. In Cork, BCPs at Ballindangan Community Centre, Aghabullogue Community Centre, Castletownkenneigh Community Centre, Lissavard Community Centre, Whitechurch Community Centre and T.O. Park Labbamollaga Community Facility have been connected.  Further BCPs at Bere Island Heritage Centre, Laharn Heritage Centre and Ballydaly Community Hall have had infrastructure installed by NBI and will be connected in the coming weeks. </p><p>Some 58 schools throughout Ireland have now had infrastructure installed by NBI, with 22 schools already connected to high speed broadband. In Cork, a number of schools including Clogagh and Ballycroneen National School Schools will be connected as part of this initiative.

Therefore, a holder of a Member State issued licence who moves to Ireland can drive on that licence until the licence expires. On expiry, the licence holder will then need to exchange their licence for an Irish licence. After 31 December 2020, the UK will no longer be a Member State and so a UK driving licence will not be recognised here. </p>  <p>  There is an exception to this exchange agreement. Member States are entitled to enter into licence exchange agreements with countries outside the EU under their national legislation. A driving licence issued by a Member State that was itself issued in exchange for a licence from a state that is not a Member State, or a state that Ireland does not have a licence exchange agreement with, cannot be exchanged for an Irish driving licence. The Road Traffic (Recognition of Foreign Driving Licences) Order 2007 (S.I. No. 527 of 2007) refers. </p>  <p>  In the case mentioned above, the UK licence was issued in exchange for a Zimbabwean licence. Ireland does not have a licence exchange agreement with Zimbabwe and so the UK licence cannot be exchanged here.  The position of other individuals, regardless of whether or not they are members of the same family, is not relevant.  </p></reply>

The 2013 Act and its requirements only apply to services provided in the State - it does not provide for cross-border services.  I understand that the legislative position in Northern Ireland is similar.  Thus, under current legislation, a taxi operator wishing to operate cross-border services, would have to apply for and obtain licences on each side of the border.</p>  <p>  As Minister for Transport, a cross-border regime for SPSVs is something I would hope to pursue once the COVID-19 pandemic abates.

It applies to businesses who, under the specific terms of the regulations, are required to prohibit or significantly restrict members of the public from accessing their business premises, with the result that the business is required to temporarily close or to operate at significantly reduced levels. Support provided under CRSS is intended to enable businesses to meet normal fixed costs associated with their business premises such as rent, insurance, utilities and so on, during the period which they are subject to such restrictions.</p>  <p>  Domestic travel restrictions or social distancing measures are not the level of restrictions to which the CRSS refers.  To be eligible to make a claim under CRSS, the applicable restrictions should require the business to either prohibit, or significantly restrict, customers from accessing the business premises in which the relevant business activity is carried on.  </p>  <p>  There has been an easing of restrictions on businesses, with a phased move to Level 3 restrictions nationally from 1 December, with some restrictions easing from 4 December and 18 December respectively.  Since 1 December, hotels, guesthouses and B&amp;B&rsquo;s have been allowed to reopen to provide accommodation services to the general public. Gyms, leisure centres and swimming pools, including those within hotels, were also allowed to reopen for individual use. From 4 December, bars, cafes and restaurants (including hotel restaurants and bars) which serve substantial meals prepared onsite are allowed to open for indoor dining. </p>  <p>  In most cases, hotels ceased to be significantly restricted from operating from 4 December and therefore cease to qualify for CRSS from that date.  However, a hotel, like other businesses reopening after the period of restrictions, will be eligible to claim an additional week&rsquo;s support under CRSS (referred to as a &lsquo;restart week&rsquo;) to assist the hotel in meeting the costs of reopening. </p>  <p>  Depending on the particular trade of a hotel, the hotel may, under the current public health regulations, continue to be subject to some level of restrictions. For example, nightclubs are not allowed to reopen under the current public health regulations and restrictions on indoor gatherings remain, which may impact a hotel with significant conferencing facilities or a hotel whose trade consists substantially of the hosting of large wedding receptions (which are limited to 25 patrons under current regulations). In certain limited cases, restrictions under the current public health regulations might amount to significant restrictions for a hotel, having regard to the mix of its services.  If so, the hotel will continue to be eligible to claim under CRSS.  If a hotel business forms the view that, having regard to the totality of its trade carried on from the hotel premises, it continues to be significantly restricted under the regulations, and therefore is eligible to claim under CRSS, it should retain evidence to support the basis of its claim for future checking by Revenue.</p>  <p>  Pubs that serve substantial meals prepared on the premises were allowed to reopen on 4 December and therefore, from that date, ceased to qualify for CRSS. However, they are eligible to claim the restart week on reopening.  Pubs that do not serve substantial meals which are prepared on the premises are not allowed to reopen and, therefore, remain eligible to claim under CRSS.  I announced an additional seasonal support for businesses who cannot reopen through December. Payable for a period of three weeks beginning 21 December, the additional support will provide up to double the amount of the weekly CRSS support payment due subject to the statutory maximum payment of &euro;5,000 per week. </p>  <p>  This additional seasonal support is being made available in recognition of the additional financial impact on those business of being closed at Christmas time, which for many would be a particularly busy trading period.  All businesses benefiting from this additional seasonal support will still qualify for the additional &lsquo;restart week&rsquo; under CRSS once they can reopen.</p>  <p>  Any business that can reopen without having to prohibit or significantly restrict access to their business premises, but chooses not to reopen, will not be eligible to claim under CRSS.</p></reply>

However, these deductions do not ordinarily include the cost of travelling to and from a principal place of work.</p>  <p>  With regard to considering any tax reliefs on the cost of the use of private vehicles when traveling to and from a place of work, I would draw the attention of the Deputy to the tax expenditure guidelines issued by my Department. Under the guidelines, the introduction of new tax incentive measures should only be considered in circumstances where there is a demonstrable market failure and where a tax based incentive is more efficient than a direct expenditure intervention. While I appreciate the particular contribution made by essential workers attending their place of employment at this time, a measure such as the one proposed does not appear to address a clear market failure, and I have no plans to introduce such a relief. </p></reply>

The cost of the scheme in 2019, excluding motor tax, was &euro;72m.</p>  <p>  The Scheme is open to severely and permanently disabled persons as a driver or as a passenger and also to certain organisations. In order to qualify for relief an organisation must be entered in the register of charitable organisations under Part 3 of the Charities Act 2009, be engaged in the transport of disabled persons and whose purpose is to provide services to persons with disabilities.</p>  <p>  In order to qualify for relief the applicant must hold a Primary Medical Certificate (PMC) issued by the relevant Senior Area Medical Officer (SAMO) or a Board Medical Certificate (BMC) issued by the Disabled Driver Medical Board of Appeal. Certain other criteria apply in relation to the vehicle and its use, including that the vehicle must be specially constructed or adapted for use by the applicant.  </p>  <p>  The terms of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994 set out the medical criteria, and that one or more of these criteria is required to be satisfied in order to obtain a PMC.</p>  <p>A Supreme Court decision of 18th June found in favour of two appellants against the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal's refusal to grant them a PMC. The judgement found that the medical criteria set out in the Regulations did not align with the regulation making mandate given in the primary legislation to further define criteria for &lsquo;severely and permanently disabled&rsquo; persons.</p>  <p>  On foot of the legal advice received, it became clear that it was appropriate to revisit the six medical criteria set out in Regulation 3 of Statutory Instrument 353 of 1994 for these assessments. In such circumstances, PMC assessments were discontinued until a revised basis for such assessments could be established. The medical officers who are responsible for conducting PMC assessments need to have assurance that the decisions they make are based on clear criteria set out in legislation. While Regulation 3 of Statutory Instrument No. 353 of 1994 was not deemed to be invalid, nevertheless it was found to be inconsistent with the mandate provided in Section 92 of the Finance Act 1989.</p>  <p>  In order to allow for the PMC assessments and appeals to recommence I brought forward an amendment to the Finance Bill to provide for the existing medical criteria in primary legislation. When the Bill is enacted, this will allow for assessments to recommence from the 1st January 2021 in circumstances where the legal basis for such assessments is clarified.  </p>  <p>  I consider this to be an interim solution only. While I am very aware of the importance of this scheme to those who benefit from it, I am also aware of the disquiet expressed by members of this house and others in respect of the difficulties around access to the scheme. With this in mind I have asked my officials to undertake a comprehensive review of the scheme, to include a broader review of mobility supports for persons with disabilities, and on foot of that review to bring forward proposals for consideration.</p></reply>

The Government has, therefore, brought forward the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2020 to allow credit unions to hold wholly or partly virtual AGMs and to provide credit unions with greater flexibility in terms of the mechanisms for voting at general meetings. The legislation also provides for an &quot;interim period&quot; which extends the deadline for holding AGMs related to year end-September 2020 until end of April 2021.</p><p>This Bill has been listed as priority legislation for enactment this term. The Bill completed all stages in the Seanad on 30 November and is currently expected to be debated in the D&aacute;il shortly. </p><p>We will support its progress through the D&aacute;il with a view to enactment before the end of the year. </p><p>Once enacted the legislation will take immediate effect and credit unions will be able to convene an AGM to seek whatever approvals may be required from members to pay dividends and a loan interest rebate.  </p><p>It should be noted that virtual AGMs are not prohibited by Central Bank regulations, rather they are not allowed for under the Credit Union Act 1997.</p></reply>

Accordingly, prices and availability of cover varies across the market, and will be priced in accordance with firms&rsquo; prior claims experience.</p>  <p>  My officials contacted Insurance Ireland, the representative body for such providers, on this issue recently.  It stated that while most customers are still able to get life; critical illness; or mortgage protection insurance at this challenging time it is aware of a small number of individual cases where a final decision on some applications is being postponed for a period of time where applicants have an underlying health condition, due to COVID-19. However, it stated that while unaware of any cases where life cover has been denied, such policies are assessed on a case-by-case basis and that underlying health conditions, such as Type 1 diabetes, will be taken into account by the underwriters, as was the case pre-COVID-19. Insurance Ireland further noted that it understands that mortgage protection is not a universal requirement by banks, who in practice apply the following exceptions to holding life cover when an applicant applies for a mortgage:</p>  <p>  - The applicant already has sufficient life cover.</p>  <p>  - The applicant is over age 50.</p>  <p>  - The mortgage is not on the applicant&rsquo;s principal private residence.</p>  <p>  - The applicant cannot get insurance, or only at a much higher rate than normal.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, the Deputy will be aware that both Minister of State Fleming and I have consistently and publicly stated that in the context of COVID-19 we expect insurance firms to treat their customers fairly, honestly, and in accordance with the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code.  The Government will continue to work to protect customers during and after the COVID-19 crisis, and engage with the insurance industry in relation to how it responds to the needs of its customers. This commitment is included in the Programme for Government.</p>  <p>  Finally, where somebody feels they have been treated unfairly by a particular insurance provider, they have the option of making a complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO). The FSPO acts as an independent arbiter of disputes which consumers may have with their insurance company or other financial service provider. The FSPO can be contacted either by email at info@fspo.ie or by telephone at 01-567-7000.</p></reply>

Ulster Bank also confirmed that there is no set timetable for this review and that it is fully aware of the strategically important role that Ulster Bank plays in the provision of financial services to the Irish market.</p>  <p>  The continued presence of a viable and active Ulster Bank in the Irish market would be the most welcome outcome. Ulster Bank is a significant employer with 2800 employees and has 88 branches across the country. Ulster Bank is also important in terms of providing competition in the Irish retail banking market. </p>  <p>  In the absence of direct knowledge about NatWest&rsquo;s strategic review of Ulster Bank&rsquo;s operations, I cannot and will not comment or speculate on possible outcomes as there is no basis for such speculation, which would be open to misinterpretation.</p>  <p>  While I will have further engagement with the bank as the review process continues, I would like to emphasise that I have no role in the review or any commercial decisions arising from it. My officials will continue to monitor developments.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the responsibility for competition policy rests with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) is an independent statutory body that is responsible for the enforcement of competition law in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The Irish retail banking system is concentrated by international standards, with five retail banks accounting for the majority of new mortgage lending, and three retail banks accounting for the majority of new bank lending to SMEs. However, the wider context is one of improving competition in the provision of financial services, with new entrants to both bank and non-bank lending markets for households and businesses in Ireland already announced.  Indeed, it is a welcome development that a new residential mortgage lender has recently entered the market.  This will be of benefit to new mortgage borrowers and also to borrowers who may wish to consider switching to a new lender. </p>  <p>  Price competition is possible even in a concentrated system. It should be noted that recent trends indicate that rates have been falling. For example, interest rates on new fixed rate mortgages (excluding renegotiations) have fallen from 4.11% in December 2014 to 2.64% in September of this year. There have also been reductions in interest rates on loans to SMEs from 5.19% to 4.33% over the period Q1 2015 to Q2 2020, as well as reductions in interest rates on consumer loans (for example, from 8.3 to 7.54% on APRC consumer loans from January 2015 to September 2020).</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the Department of Finance published a paper in 2019 by Indecon Consulting on an Evaluation of the Concept of Community Banking in Ireland. This was a follow on to a previous paper on Local Public Banking published by the Department of Finance in 2018. The Indecon report concluded that there is no business case for the State to establish a public banking system in Ireland, supporting the outcome of the previous report on Local Public Banking.  Indecon&rsquo;s report also noted that there is extensive provision of and access to banking services through some 1,900 bank branches, credit union offices and An Post branches across the country, as well as a wide range of Exchequer funded existing supports.</p>  <p>  Credit unions are increasing the offering of financial products for their members. The Credit Union Act, 1997 (the 1997 Act) and the Credit Union Act 1997 (Regulatory Requirements) Regulations 2016 set out the services that credit unions may provide to their members. These include loans and savings under the 1997 Act and a further suite of services under the 2016 Regulations such as third party payments; ATM services; bureau de change and certain insurance services on an agency basis. I understand that a number of credit unions provide some of the services provided for under the 2016 Regulations. Where a credit union wishes to provide other services to its members, an application may be made to the Central Bank for approval to provide such services in accordance with the provisions set out in sections 48-51 of the 1997 Act.</p>  <p>  One such additional service includes the Member Personal Current Account Service (MPCAS). In 2016, the Central Bank defined and described a suite of additional services known as MPCAS, under which approved credit unions may offer personal current accounts with debit cards, overdrafts and a wide range of payment services within an appropriate risk framework. To date, 54 credit unions have been approved to provide MPCAS.</p>  <p>  An Post offers financial services including a payment account, personal loans, credit cards, a range of insurances, money transmission and foreign exchange services. An Post offers counter services for a number of retail banks, allowing customers to lodge and withdraw cash at An Post branches. There is there is a significant network of post offices in areas where there is no bank branch within five kilometres.</p></reply>

As a result, GDP was 8.1 per cent higher on an annual basis. However, as has been well documented GDP is not an accurate measure of what is going on in the domestic economy, given the size of the multinational sector. In the third quarter, modified domestic demand &ndash; a proxy for the domestic economy &ndash; was down -2.4 per cent year-on-year, with personal consumption down by -5.7 per cent and (modified) investment down by -4.4 per cent. On the other hand, exports were up 5.5 per cent, due to strong growth in the multinational dominated pharmaceutical sector.  </p>  <p>  Looking forward, a contraction in the domestic economy is expected for the fourth quarter as a result of the move to Level 5 of the Living with Covid Plan. However I am optimistic that it will not be as large as that recorded in the second quarter as many sectors of the economy including construction, manufacturing, education and childcare remained open. In the labour market, while the numbers of persons in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment has increased by around 105,000 to 350,000 since Level 5 restrictions were introduced, the overall number of recipients has remained well below the peak of 600,000 in early May.</p>  <p>  While GDP growth may in the end be positive for the year, modified domestic demand will almost certainly still be negative, in line with previous expectations, with private consumption expected to be particularly hard-hit from the restrictions. The extent of the contraction of the domestic economy will become apparent in the coming weeks as hard economic data covering the Level 5 lockdown becomes available.</p></reply>

This approach is intended to reduce the risk of fraud for all types of electronic payments (especially online payments) and to protect the confidentiality of the user&rsquo;s financial data.</p>  <p>  PSPs are obliged to apply strong customer authentication (SCA) when a payer initiates an electronic payment transaction. SCA under PSD2 requires the customer to go through two-factor authentication made up of elements from two of three separate categories: knowledge, possession, and inherence. SCA is a combination of something you know (a password or PIN), something you have (a card reader or token generator) and something you are (a fingerprint).</p>  <p>  The European Banking Authority (EBA) was tasked with developing standards for strong customer authentication and secure communication. These standards were published on 13 March 2018 and came into effect from 14 September 2019.</p>  <p>  In an Opinion published on 16 October 2019 the EBA set the final deadline for full compliance with SCA requirements at 31 December 2020. The EBA felt that this time should be sufficient for issuing and acquiring payment service providers and their merchants to migrate to SCA-compliant approaches and solutions.</p>  <p>  Following the outbreak of Covid-19 earlier this year industry bodies from across the EU, including the Banking and Payments Federation of Ireland (BPFI), wrote to the EU Commission and the EBA seeking a further extension to the deadline for compliance with the SCA requirements. They outlined that Covid-19 was clearly having an impact on all sectors of the EU economy and that industry was unlikely to be able to meet the current deadline of 31 December 2020 for SCA migration.</p>  <p>  Where a regulated payment service provider (PSP) is in a position to implement the requirements with effect from 1 January 2021, the Central Bank expects them to do so, in a manner that does not cause customer detriment.</p>  <p>  Through engagements with regulated PSPs on the progress of their SCA migration plans, the Central Bank is aware of some issues around the full implementation of SCA by 31 December 2020. The Central Bank has communicated to these PSPs that they are required to implement the Requirements as soon as possible in a manner that does not cause customer detriment.</p>  <p>  As the deadline for SCA implementation approaches, Department officials will continue to work with the Central Bank and BPFI to minimise payment disruption experienced by consumers and merchants.</p></reply>

Accordingly, prices and availability of cover varies across the market, and will be priced in accordance with firms&rsquo; prior claims experience.</p>  <p>  My officials contacted Insurance Ireland, the representative body for such providers on this issue.  It stated that while most customers are still able to get life; critical illness; or mortgage protection insurance at this challenging time it is aware of a small number of cases where a final decision on some applications is being postponed for a period of time where applicants have an underlying health condition. However, it stated that while unaware of any cases where life cover has been denied, such policies are assessed on a case-by-case basis and that underlying health conditions, will be taken into account by the underwriters, as was the case pre-COVID-19. Insurance Ireland further noted that it understands that mortgage protection is not a universal requirement by banks, who in practice apply the following exceptions to holding life cover when an applicant applies for a mortgage:</p>  <p>  - The applicant already has sufficient life cover.</p>  <p>  - The applicant is over age 50.</p>  <p>  - The mortgage is not on the applicant&rsquo;s principal private residence.</p>  <p>  - The applicant cannot get insurance, or only at a much higher rate than normal.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, the Deputy will be aware that both I and Minister of State Fleming have consistently and publicly stated that in the context of COVID-19 we expect insurance firms to treat their customers fairly, honestly, and in accordance with the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code.  The Government will continue to work to protect customers during and after the COVID-19 crisis, and engage with the insurance industry in relation to how it responds to the needs of its customers. This commitment is included in the Programme for Government.</p>  <p>  Finally, where somebody feels they have been treated unfairly by a particular insurance provider, they have the option of making a complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO). The FSPO acts as an independent arbiter of disputes which consumers may have with their insurance company or other financial service provider. The FSPO can be contacted either by email at info@fspo.ie or by telephone at 01-567-7000.</p></reply>

Its compliance activities in this area include roadside sampling of private and commercial vehicles at checkpoints combined with a risk based targeted sampling programme based on enhanced supply chain reporting for suppliers and retailers. In addition, Revenue and the UK Revenue and Customs undertook a joint initiative to introduce a new marker for use in marked fuels, which came into operation in April 2015. </p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that it conducted a random National Sampling Programme in the years 2016 to 2019 to assess the extent of fuel laundering. The 2019 programme involved samples being taken from over 200 randomly selected licenced fuel outlets and transport sector trades. Evidence of misuse of fuel was discovered in only 3 cases.  </p>  <p>  The results represent confirmation of the effectiveness of the various measures introduced by Revenue in recent years to enhance compliance in the fuel trade and among users of diesel. The random sampling programme results do not signify the complete elimination of the illicit trade in fuel. However, they do demonstrate that systematic selling of illicit fuel through retail outlets and its use in the transport sector is negligible.  </p>  <p>  Despite this success, I am assured by Revenue that combating such criminality continues to be a priority. Revenue and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na collaborate closely in acting against cross-border fuel crime and also cooperate with their counterparts in Northern Ireland under the framework of the North-South Joint Agency Task Force. This cooperation plays a key role in targeting the organised crime groups who operate across jurisdictions and are responsible for much of this criminality. </p></reply>

The support is available to companies, self-employed individuals and partnerships who carry on a trade or trading activities from a business premises located in a region subject to restrictions introduced in line with the Living with Covid-19 Plan. It is intended to enable businesses to meet normal fixed costs associated with their business premises such as rent, insurance, utilities and so on, during the period which they are subject to such restrictions.  </p>  <p>  To qualify under the scheme a business must, under specific terms of the Covid restrictions, be required to either prohibit or significantly restrict, customers from accessing their business premises to purchase goods or services, with the result that the business either has to temporarily close or to operate at a significantly reduced level. For the purposes of CRSS, a qualifying &ldquo;business premises&rdquo; is a building or other similar physical structure in which a business activity is ordinarily carried on. </p>  <p>  The CRSS is just one part of the Government&rsquo;s supports dealing with the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. Businesses may also be entitled to alternative supports under various measures put in place by the Government, including existing supports available under the COVID Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) and the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS). Businesses may also be eligible to warehouse PAYE (Employer) debts and also excess payments received by employers under the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme, and the balance of Income Tax for 2019 and Preliminary Tax for 2020 for self-assessed taxpayers if applicable.</p></reply>

The scope of the Examination was designed to ensure that such consumer protections were correctly applied to consumers on their family property or personal investments type mortgages.  </p></reply>

Extensive restrictions are in place and these are not simply confined to a small number of senior bankers whose pay is restricted by the &euro;500,000 pay cap. These affect circa 23,000 workers across the three banks in which the State has a shareholding. The policy dictates that variable pay including bonuses and any other fringe benefits including the likes of health insurance and childcare cannot be paid to any staff members from the most junior lowest paid staff to the most senior ranks. </p>  <p>  As a result the previous Government undertook to carry out a review of Government bank remuneration policy to determine if it remained fit for purpose. My department worked with the specialist advisory division of Korn Ferry to undertake this review. Stakeholders engaged with included the major institutional investors in the banks, proxy advisory firms, the Financial Services Union (FSU), the chairs of the remuneration committee in each of the banks, the Central Bank of Ireland and representatives of the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) in Frankfurt.</p>  <p>  As I have indicated previously I have read the report. It is a complex and far ranging piece of work and it has most certainly informed my thinking on the issue.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge that there is a very different European regulatory environment in place now which will help prevent the return to some of the excesses of the boom years including the EU Capital Requirements Directive (CRD IV) and the Remuneration Guidelines of the European Banking Authority.</p>  <p>  Furthermore the powers of the Central Bank were significantly enhanced by the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013, particularly powers to take action against wrongdoing by financial services providers and to strengthen the ability of the Central Bank to take action against individuals.</p>  <p>  However I believe the issue of bank remuneration is inextricably linked to further restoring public confidence in the culture and accountability of our banks and the forthcoming SEAR regime and the Central Bank (Amendment) Bill more generally, will provide an effective framework and will help to reassure the public that meaningful cultural change is underway in the banking sector. </p></reply>

Disability statistics for 2020 are not currently available as a census is completed each year in March for the previous year in line with the National Disability Authority (NDA) Annual Census.  <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th>Percentage</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017</td>       <td>4.1%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>4.1%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>5.14%</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>During 2016/17, a major refurbishment project was undertaken by Facilities Management and the OPW in Government Buildings on Merrion Street.  As part of that project, for example, electronic doors were installed to assist the movement of staff across the campus. In addition in 2019 an external lift was installed to South Block to allow staff with mobility difficulties to access the building easier. </p><p>The Department of Finance adheres to its requirements as set out by the Disability Act of 2005. The Department does not possess information regarding employees who are registered disabled. Staff can volunteer to self-declare a disability.</p><p>The Department has a Disability Liaison Officer (DLO) appointed who works closely with the NDA to ensure that the Department is fully compliant with its obligations under the Act. </p><p>All new entrants complete a confidential disability survey which is forwarded to the DLO for actioning, where appropriate. These declarations are amalgamated with an annual census run by the NDA and forwarded to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform as part of our annual returns who collate centrally Department/Office annual returns for forwarding to the NDA for publication on their website.</p><p>Bi-monthly Disability Liaison Officer Network meetings are held to share knowledge and assist other DLOs across the Civil Service, as well as engaging with staff in accessing training and learning events, where needed.</p><p>The Department&rsquo;s website, (www.gov.ie/finance), internal intranet and the Build to Share programmes (ePQ, eSubmission, eCorrespondence etc), which are used by staff in the course of their work, all have software to aid the visually impaired. A &lsquo;loop&rsquo; system&rsquo; is in place in the Department&rsquo;s Whitaker Conference Room for the hearing impaired.</p><p>The Department has also held Power Hours in the areas of Autism in the Workplace, Dyslexia in the Workplace and has marked International Day of people with disabilities and will continue to do so.</p><p>There are 17 bodies under the aegis of my Department, four of which have staff with a disability as follows: <table>    <tr>       <th>Body/Agency</th>       <th>Year</th>       <th>Percentage</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Financial   Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO)</td>       <td>2018</td>       <td>7%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td>2019</td>       <td>8%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td>2020</td>       <td>-</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Office   of the Comptroller and Auditor General</td>       <td>2018</td>       <td>3.57%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td>2019</td>       <td>5.41%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td>2020</td>       <td>6.67%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Office   of the Revenue Commissioners</td>       <td>2018</td>       <td>4.65%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td>2019</td>       <td>5.32%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td>2020</td>       <td>5.66%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>National   Treasury Management Agency (NTMA)</td>       <td>2018</td>       <td>4.28%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td>2019</td>       <td>4.07%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td>2020</td>       <td>4.19%</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman has confirmed that they conduct an annual Survey of their staff to determine the number of staff with a disability under the definition in the Disability Act 2005, with the survey for 2020 to be conducted at year end. As such, figures for 2020 are not yet available. </p><p>The Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General has confirmed that they only use the Public Appointments Service and recruitment companies that comply with the five codes of practice of the Commission for Public Service Appointments to recruit staff, one of which is the Code of Practice for Appointment of Persons with Disabilities to Positions in the Civil Service and Certain Public Bodies.</p><p>The data for the NTMA is correct as at 31/10/2020 and includes staff assigned to the National Asset Management Agency, Home Building Finance Ireland and the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland. The NTMA established a Disability Awareness Team in 2016 to actively create awareness of the different types of disabilities and how to best support employees with different abilities.  In addition, through partnerships with a number of organisations including the Trinity Centre for People with Intellectual Disabilities (TCPID), Down Syndrome Ireland and AHEAD, the Agency has successfully recruited and retained a number of employees with disabilities.</p><p>The Central Bank of Ireland has confirmed that, to date, they have not recorded those staff who have declared a disability, although they intend to capture this data as part of an annual engagement survey this year. As staff at the Investor Compensation Company DAC are seconded from the Central Bank, they similarly have no data available. The Central Bank, along with the FSPO and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, have advised that they actively assist people with disabilities to participate in their recruitment and promotion processes by accommodating their specific requirements and by providing appropriate supports, as well as providing ongoing support to staff members who have, or acquire, a disability during their employment.  The Central Bank also endeavours to proactively attract persons with disabilities to work in the Bank with targeted programmes such as the Willing and Able Mentoring (WAM) Programme, as well as a work placement programme with the National Council for the Blind. </p><p>Four bodies have confirmed that none of their staff declared a disability during the period in question. These are the Credit Review Office, Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council and the Tax Appeals Commission.  The Credit Review Office has advised that its staff are seconded from Enterprise Ireland, and as such any future recruitment would be in line with that body&rsquo;s policies. The Irish Bank Resolution Corporation currently has no employees and there is no expectation to hire more. The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has indicated that it is an equal opportunities employer and is committed to supporting and promoting the employment of people with disabilities. The Tax Appeals Commission will be recruiting staff in 2021 and is committed to supporting and promoting the employment of people with disabilities and will continue to work with the Public Appointments Service towards reaching a target of 3%.</p><p>Finally, the Credit Union Advisory Committee, Credit Union Restructuring Board, Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal and the Irish Financial Services Appeals Tribunal have had no employees during the timeframe specified.  </p></reply>

Significant work has been undertaken by the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) to ensure that public procurement is accessible by all businesses, including SMEs.  My colleague, Minister of State Ossian Smyth, chairs quarterly meetings of the SME Advisory Group so that the voice of industry is heard at first hand by Government. The SME Advisory Group consists of officials from the Office of Government Procurement (OGP), the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment, Enterprise Ireland, InterTradeIreland, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, as well as representatives from the IBEC, the Small Firms Association, the Construction Industry Federation, Chambers Ireland and the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association.</p>  <p>  The OGP administers the Irish Government&rsquo;s national electronic tendering platform (eTenders).  It is the national facility for all public sector contracting authorities to publish procurement tenders and contract award notices for goods, services and works.  eTenders is also used by potential suppliers including SMEs to view and access tender opportunities.  eTenders is currently provided, managed and maintained on behalf of the OGP by a third party service provider.</p>  <p>  In line with public procurement obligations, the OGP is currently advanced in preparing to advertise a tender for a new contract for an electronic tendering platform.  As part of these preparations, the OGP has carried out extensive stakeholder consultation and engagement, covering both public bodies and potential suppliers, including SMEs, as key stakeholders in the electronic tendering system and process. In that context, in September 2020, a survey of potential suppliers on the electronic tendering process was carried out with the support of Minister of State Smyth and the SME Advisory Group.  SMEs and micro businesses represented 78% of respondents to the survey.  The responses from this survey are being used to inform the requirements for the new contract.</p></reply>

The aim of these rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers transparency and value for money outcomes.</p><p>Regulation 67 of the SI 286 of 2016 - European Union (Award of Public Authority Contracts) Regulations sets out that the most economically advantageous tender (MEAT) should be assessed on the basis of the best price-quality ratio, which should always include a price or cost element.  It is important to note that the Regulations do not preclude the use of cost as the sole criterion in a MEAT award.  It is for contracting authorities to determine the award criteria to identify the MEAT to meet their particular requirements in relation to the contract. The procurement directive applies to all public works contracts with a value in excess of &euro;5.35m and construction-related services with a value in excess of &euro;139k for Government Departments and Bodies and &euro;214k for Local Authorities.</p><p>The general requirements for works and works-related contracts are set out in the Capital Works Management Framework (CWMF). The CWMF represents the tools that a public body must use to procure and manage the external resources necessary to deliver a public works project that is to be delivered under the Exchequer-funded element of the National Development Plan. This guidance incorporates key elements of EU legislation that have been transposed into Irish law and is complemented by circulars and guidance issued by this Department and the Office of Government Procurement.</p><p>The award criterion for works contracts (above &euro;1m) and for the engagement of consultants under the CWMF is the Most Economically Advantageous Tender (MEAT) meeting the specified minimum criteria (if any). The MEAT is determined in accordance with the award criteria set out in the Particulars to the standard CWMF Instructions to Tenderer. The award criterion associated with the form of contract most commonly used for works below &euro;1m is the lowest price.</p><p>Generally speaking where public works are concerned, the better defined the project requirements the greater the weighting that should be given to price. Under the CWMF, works projects that are delivered using the traditional approach are required to be well defined prior to tender.  In these circumstances, it is entirely appropriate for price to be given a majority weighting. In a design and build contract, where the contractor is required to prepare the design as part of their tender submission the majority weighting should be given to quality (or technical merit).  A majority weighting for quality should properly interrogate the innovation, technical achievements and durability of the solutions offered. There is a balance to be struck in deciding to award a public contract between value for money and a quality project outcome.  </p><p>The management of the tendering process for a public contract is a matter for each contracting authority.  It is the responsibility of each contracting authority to ensure that tenderers comply with all the requirements of the process.</p><p>A review of the policies and practices deployed in the procurement of public works projects commenced in March 2019 and is ongoing.  The review is being conducted by the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) with the support of the Government Construction Contracts Committee (GCCC). The focus of the review is on improving the delivery of construction projects in terms of quality, timely delivery and cost outcomes. The initial focus of the review is on the procurement of consultancy services. Overall improvement in project definition is required &ndash; to be delivered through establishing minimum standards for information at the different stages of a project&rsquo;s development.</p><p>The OGP has developed a high-level strategy with the GCCC to guide the implementation which will be addressed primarily through the progressive refinement and enhancement of the CWMF.  The following objectives summarise the strategy:</p><p>The CWMF will enable the delivery of sustainable assets under the NDP by: </p><p>- Developing procurement and contracting strategies that prioritise quality solutions and support the most efficient means of delivery;  </p><p>- Embedding appropriate risk management measures within the project development, procurement and construction stages;</p><p>- Deploying digital solutions throughout the project delivery stages.</p><p>The review will deliver significant changes to the CWMF over the coming years. The OGP has prepared a methodology for extensive structured engagement, both with industry stakeholders, and with the public bodies charged with the delivery of public works projects to inform the implementation of the strategy. It is planned to publish a series of position papers on a broad range of issues to foster debate and engagement on specific issues such as:</p><p>- price variation;</p><p>- risk management;</p><p>- reflecting quality in the award of contracts;</p><p>- adoption of Building Information Modelling (BIM) on public works projects;</p><p>- liability, indemnity and insurance requirements;</p><p>- performance evaluation;</p><p>- encouraging collaborative working.</p><p>Upon conclusion of the consultation period for each issue, the GCCC will prepare a recommendation for approval at the appropriate level.  It is envisaged that the process of engagement will extend over the next 12 &ndash; 18 months, however where the GCCC&rsquo;s recommendations are accepted they may be implemented without waiting for the entire process to conclude providing it is practicable to do so.</p><p>The onset of Covid-19 impacted on the conduct of the review both in terms of engagement with stakeholders and reassignment of internal resources in order to address the impact of the shutdown and the restart phase on the NDP.  </p></reply>

As such there are no separate reduced pay scales for civil and public servants.</p><p>Under the Public Service Stability Agreement (PSSA) 2018 &ndash; 2020, it was agreed to examine the remaining salary scale issues, associated with the addition of the extra points, for those recruited to entry grades after January 2011. The report, laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas in March 2018, estimates the point in time cost of advancing new entrants to the public service two points along their incremental scales. The report estimated a cost of &euro;199.8m in respect of 60,513 new entrants, an average cost of &euro;3,300 per FTE.</p><p>Following this report, lengthy and intensive negotiations with the Public Services Committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions took place over 2018 resulting in an agreement on new entrant salary scales being reached in September 2018. </p><p>The main components of the agreement are:</p><p>- where two additional scale points were applied to pay scales under the Haddington Road Agreement, it was agreed that there will be two separate interventions in the pay scales as they apply to new entrant public servants recruited since January 2011. </p><p>- the two separate interventions will take place at of the pay scales. The practical effect of this is that for new entrants the relevant points on the scale will be bypassed, thereby reducing the time spent on the scale for progression to the maximum point.</p><p>- in situations where only one point was added to the existing pay scale under Haddington Road, then the first point (i.e Point 4) is bypassed by eligible new entrants.</p><p>- this measure was applied from 1 March 2019 and will be applied to each new entrant as they reach the relevant scale points (point 4 and point 8) on their current increment date. </p><p>This is an agreement of considerable scale and complexity, each element of which was the product of negotiation with ICTU. </p><p>New entrant teachers, recruited after January 2011, are covered by the agreement.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware my Department are now engaged in formal negotiations, under the auspices of the Workplace Relations Commission, on the potential of a successor agreement to the PSSA.

If it qualifies, the pension is eligible for an increase to the extent that this will ensure alignment with the pay of serving staff.</p>  <p>  The Deputy has specifically referred to individuals who retired in 2008. In that context, it is necessary to distinguish between those who retired before 1 March 2012 and those who retired after that date.</p>  <p>  Generally, individuals who retired pre-March 2012 will have retired either before imposition of the first FEMPI pay reduction in 2010 or they were protected by the first 'grace period' so their pension does not reflect this reduction. As a result, some pensioners in this cohort are not eligible for pension increases arising from PSSA increases to serving staff as the salary on which their pension is based is still higher than the salary of serving staff on the same grade/scale point. </p>  <p>  Individuals who retired from 1 March 2012 onwards retired either before the second round of FEMPI reductions were imposed in July 2013, were not affected by this second round of reductions as it only applied to salaries above &euro;65,000, or the salary on which their pension is based does not reflect these reductions as a result of the second 'grace period'. Given that the salary on which their pension is based encompasses the first FEMPI reduction in 2010, this cohort of retirees are generally eligible for pension increases arising from PSSA pay increases as their pensionable salary will be lower than the salary of serving staff, following each of those pay increases.</p>  <p>  Finally, I note that the question asks about pension increases in the &lsquo;public sector&rsquo;, which is generally understood as including the commercial semi State bodies. Under the various pension scheme rules operational to such bodies, in the first instance, it is a matter for the Government Department under whose aegis responsibility for individual commercial semi State Bodies falls to consider and approve any pension increase sought, with the consent of the Minister of Public Expenditure and Reform. Obviously, as part of such decisions, account must also be taken of the overall funding position in the relevant pension funds prior to taking any decisions on pension increases. The impact of pension increases on the sustainability of pension funds is an important overall consideration.</p></reply>

The goal of the Programme is to provide trainees with the skills, knowledge and ability to gain meaningful employment via the unique opportunity to gain practical work experience, as well as accredited learning over an 11 month period.  Since we created our first permanent pathway to employment through an internship scheme, over a quarter of the initial OWL interns have since gone on to secure permanent civil service employment.</p><p>The WAM Programme offers graduates with a disability a six-month work placement in either the private sector or Civil Service.  Since 2015, WAM has placed over 490 graduates, of which 47% (229) have been placements in the Civil Service across 32 Government Departments or Agencies.  PAS conducts the recruitment element of the process on behalf of AHEAD in the case of placements in the Civil Service.  PAS and my Department, in conjunction with AHEAD, are currently exploring the feasibility of a confined competition to create a permanent path for employment in the civil service for WAM graduates, upon successful completion of their work placement.  </p><p>In terms of retention of staff with disabilities, my Department&rsquo;s HR Strategy Unit, along with its Disability Liaison Officer (DLO), support new members of staff with a disability or existing staff who acquire a disability.  In terms of raising awareness about disability within my Department, a number of initiatives are in place:</p><p>- The Diversity and Inclusion sub-group within the PERspectives group, a cross-grade, cross-divisional staff forum to support the Department&rsquo;s People@PER Strategy, contributes to the cultivation of a diverse and inclusive culture across the Department;</p><p>- To mark the 2019 International Day of Persons with Disabilities (3 December), all staff in the Department were invited to complete the online Disability Equality Training offered by the National Disability Authority (NDA).  A presentation to raise awareness about autism was delivered by AsIAm (Ireland&rsquo;s largest autism charity) to mark the 2020 observance;</p><p>- New hires in my Department receive a PDF of the Code of Practice for the Employment of People with a Disability in the Irish Civil Service (2007), as well as a welcome letter from the Department&rsquo;s Disability Liaison Office (DLO) along with FAQs on Disability prepared by the National Disability Authority (NDA); and</p><p>- The induction of new hires in the Department includes a presentation and Q&amp;amp;A session with the Disability Liaison Officer. <b></b></p></reply>

The set of measures, individually, do not comprise a list of activities or places which are equally safe, but are &ldquo;baskets&rdquo; of measures which are informed by public health understanding of the disease.</p><p>The number of people allowed to gather in different scenarios is based on experience and reviews of international practice and the judgment of public health experts. It seeks to balance the risks of different types of gatherings against the desire to allow normal activities to proceed insofar as possible.</p><p>Under Level 3 of the Framework, live performance in front of an audience is not permitted and theatres remain closed to the public.  Therefore, it was not possible at this time to allow for live entertainment including live theatre performances to return other than in very limited circumstances outdoors. </p><p>Under the Health Act 1947 (Section 31A &ndash; Temporary Restrictions) (COVID-19) (No. 9) Regulations 2020), the filming, or other recording of performances in a theatre, concert hall, museum or art gallery, without an audience present, is permitted for the purposes of broadcasting such performances on the internet, radio or television.</p><p>The Arts Council is working with theatres and arts centres and other representative bodies to ensure that there is comprehensive guidance available to ensure compliance with the public health guidelines. It intends to continue this work over the coming months. Earlier this year, Theatre Forum produced guidelines for the safe reopening of theatres and under which, theatre operated safely and successfully during the summer months. </p><p>Live performance, with audiences and artists gathering indoors, is a complex issue and we must ensure everything is done in a safe setting. Galleries, museums and cinemas have been able to reopen after special consideration was given to those venues. The disappointment of theatre practitioners who demonstrated diligence and responsibility in their approach to the challenges posed by COVID-19 is wholly understandable. We all want to see the return of live performance as soon as possible and the Department will continue to work with the Arts Council, Theatre Forum and other stakeholders towards that objective.</p><p>I am very conscious of the importance of theatre in Ireland. It is an important source of employment for artists and arts workers, and it is an art form which engages and connects society, in addition to providing a source of well-being support. </p></reply>

The Government&rsquo;s strategy, in line with the public health advice, is disease suppression. COVID-19 spreads when individuals and groups come into close contact with one another, enabling the virus to move from one person to another. The risk of infection spread is greater in certain environments than others e.g. uncontrolled environments, crowded and noisy places, indoor environments, and poorly ventilated spaces.</p>  <p>  In Levels, 3, 4 and 5 of the Government's Resilience and Recovery Plan, sporting competitions and events - indoors or outdoors - are not permitted for any age cohort except for defined exempted athletes and teams, as set out in the public health regulations. Only outdoor, non-contact training is currently permitted under Level 3 in pods of up to 15. </p>  <p>  Accordingly, while the proposal by the Deputy for underage grassroots football matches would not be permitted in the current Level 3 restrictions, engagement with the sport sector is ongoing. I am committed to ensuring the earliest possible safe return to play for both underage and adult football. To that end I have recently written to all National Governing Bodies, including the FAI, seeking written submissions and all available evidence and data for the purposes of informing the development of tailored proposals and approaches for future mitigation measures. It is my objective that such submissions would enable the Government to review and potentially adapt the suite of public health measures currently applying to sport and exercise activities.</p></reply>

The Scheme builds on the success of the Arts and Culture Capital Scheme 2016-2018 which saw grants allocated to 134 organisations in 26 counties to refurbish and enhance their facilities. This funding is provided from a &euro;40m capital investment allocation for local arts and culture infrastructure contained in Project Ireland 2040.  One of the features on this iteration of the investment programme is the emphasis on the reduction of carbon footprints to dovetail with the Government&rsquo;s climate change commitments. </p><p>Assessment and final decision on applications under Streams A &amp;amp; B of the Cultural Capital Scheme 2019-2022 were delayed as a result of COVID-19 as my Department opened up a specific COVID-19 related scheme Stream D, a further stream of funding under this overall scheme.  These assessments are nearing completion and announcements will be made over the coming period. </p><p>I understand that the centre to which the Deputy refers, submitted an incomplete application under Stream A of the Cultural Capital Scheme.  In August this year, this centre along with other similarly incomplete applications were given the opportunity to address the oversight.  The responses to this process will be examined in due course and decisions relayed to the organisations concerned.  </p><p>Under Stream D, capital funding is provided to assist in the re-opening of theatres, arts centres and culture venues as part of Project Ireland 2040. The measures are designed to support arts and culture facilities in preparation for staff, artists and audiences returning to venues to reopen in line with the Government&rsquo;s Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business as well as the Return to Work Safety Protocols. The scheme allows organisations to undertake necessary capital adaptations to their buildings so that they comply with the HSE COVID-19 related public health protection measures.

Its membership includes a range of Government Departments, Agencies whose remit covers aspects of the Night-time Economy and who have valuable input to contribute from a legislative and or policy perspective. The Lord Mayor of Dublin and the Lord Mayor of Cork are also members of the Taskforce given the significant experience in developing the Night-time Economy in Dublin and Cork.  Give us the Night are also represented on the Taskforce.  Give us the Night is an independent volunteer group of professionals operating within the night-time industry and articulates the views of this Sector to the wider Taskforce.  I am confident that the Taskforce represents a wide range of policy perspectives on the Night-time Economy and I look forward to the outcome of their work.</p><p>As part of their work, I have asked the Taskforce to conduct an intensive stakeholder engagement process with all relevant sectors and interested parties who have a significant role in the night-time economy to ensure that all views and ideas are considered by the Taskforce.  Well over 100 stakeholders from community organisations, business and industry, civic society, cultural sector and sporting organisations were invited to submit their views.  Some 58 submissions were received as part of this process and the responses are currently being considered by the Taskforce.  </p><p>As part of this process, the Taskforce has currently invited a number of groups to present their views to the Group over the course of December.  They have already heard from the HSE Alcohol and Mental Health Programme, the HSE National Social Inclusion Office, Alcohol Action Ireland and the Purple Flag Initiative.  Further presentations from Groups representing the business, tourism and hospitality sectors as well as groups representing a resident's association and events and entertainment industries will also be part of this process.  The Taskforce may also invite further groups in to present their views as they develop their work.</p><p>The Taskforce will review the results of the consultation process and is also considering the development of a focus group structure to look at some of the findings and see how they can progress the various issues arising.  I have asked the Taskforce to report back to me within six months from their first meeting with a series of recommendations on practical measures which will help us develop a vibrant and sustainable night-time economy.</p><p>A range of supports and measures from my own Department and across other Departments have already been established for hard hit sectors which contribute to the night-time economy including the arts and creative sectors and the tourism sectors.  However, we need even more creative thinking and innovative solutions to the challenges facing the night-time economy and I want every opportunity explored and maximised.  I look forward to the outcome of the work of this Taskforce.</p></reply>

Over &euro;1m has been approved for 413 Gaeltacht businesses in the past few months through the Online Trading Voucher Scheme and the COVID-19 Business Continuity Vouchers Scheme, both administered by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, along with a series of webinars to share appropriate expertise and an information hub on . </p><p>In relation to these supports, I was pleased to note the impact the Government horizontal supports are continuing to have on substantially reducing the cost base for the commercial radio sector during the restrictions. A total of &euro;4.3m has been received across the industry from the Government&rsquo;s COVID-19 Wage Subsidy Support Scheme.Local radio has also been included in the Government&rsquo;s current advertising campaign on resilience.  </p><p>I acknowledge the valuable role that media plays in countering disinformation, particularly in respect of COVID-19. Local radio plays a particularly important role in bringing communities together, strengthening their bonds of solidarity and mutual support. I recognise the challenges faced by this sector due to COVID-19 and was pleased that a range of supports were delivered to the sector this year.</p><p>During 2020, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI)  held two closed rounds for radio, targeted at the independent commercial and community radio sectors respectively. </p><p>In June 2020, the BAI awarded &euro;2.5m Sound and Vision funding to 32 independent commercial radio stations across the country supporting public awareness and understanding of COVID-19.  This was in addition to a waiver on the broadcasting levy for the independent radio sector for Q1 and Q2 2020 which saved the sector &euro;1m.  I secured &euro;839,000 in Budget 2021 to recoup the BAI for this levy waiver. </p><p>In addition, the BAI distributed &euro;750,000 this year in a special round for the community radio sector.</p><p>The purpose of the Sound and Vision Scheme is to support eligible content across the broadcasting sector as a whole, ensuring a balanced and fair approach. In light of the ongoing challenges faced by the sector, I secured an additional &euro;2m in exchequer funding for the Sound and Vision Scheme under the July Stimulus Package. This greatly enhanced the funding available for the final round of the Scheme this year (round 37), bringing its total value to &euro;4.5m.  This funding round is open to those elements of the radio sector that were not eligible for the rounds to commercial and community radio earlier in the year, namely independent audio producers and public service radio. In addition, the round is open to independent audio-visual producers, and commercial, community and public service television stations.  I will continue to work closely with the BAI to see how we can best support the sector in the coming period. </p></reply>

Athletics Ireland is an independent body and the Government respects its autonomy in matters including engagement with its international federation.</p>  <p>  I am informed that Athletics Ireland has corresponded with World Athletics on this matter and that World Athletics have responded advising that following a review of the matter by their legal team that their current position remains unchanged. </p>  <p>  I recognise that the proposed derogation would confer additional flexibility of representation to the athletes concerned and Minister Martin and I are accordingly supportive of it.

Section 4 of the Act and Schedule 2 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, as amended (the Regulations), set out various exemptions from the requirement to obtain planning permission.  Any such exemptions are subject to compliance with any general restrictions on exemptions set out in the Act or the Regulations and to the specific conditions set out in each class of exempted development in Schedule 2 of the Regulations.</p><p>With regard to exemptions for solar panels, Class 2 of Part 1 of Schedule 2 of the Regulations provides an exemption for the installation or erection of a solar panel on, or within the curtilage of a house or any buildings within the curtilage of a house, subject to certain siting and size conditions. </p><p>Class 56 of Part 1 of Schedule 2 of the Regulations provides an exemption for the installation or erection on a business premises or industrial/light industrial building, or any ancillary buildings within the curtilage of such premises or building, of solar panels (thermal collector or photo-voltaic), subject to certain siting and size conditions.</p><p>Furthermore, Class 18 of Part 3 of Schedule 2 of the Regulations provides an exemption for the installation or erection on an agricultural structure, or within the curtilage of an agricultural holding, of solar panels (thermal collector or photo-voltaic), again subject to a number of conditions. </p><p>As part of the Climate Action Plan 2019, my Department is currently undertaking a review of the solar panel exemptions, and is actively engaging with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications as well as other key stakeholders, with a view to finalising a proposal for draft amending Regulations - to reflect, inter alia, technical developments in the sector. One of the key considerations of the review is to ensure that solar panels can be erected - subject to certain siting and size conditions - without the need to obtain planning permission, to facilitate more widespread generation of energy for self-consumption. Also included in this review, which continues to be shaped by recommendations of the Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications, are solar panel exemptions for educational and community buildings.</p><p>The main outstanding issue that remains to be addressed in the current review is the potential for &quot;glint and glare&quot; impacts for aircraft and the need to ensure that they do not result in any real or potential threat to aviation safety. Accordingly, my Department is presently engaging with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications as well as the Irish Aviation Authority, in order to find a safe and workable solution in relation to this particular aspect of the review. The Department has begun the tendering process for this project, which will involve the development of aviation safeguarding maps for each airport/aerodrome in the country, and has received feedback from potential tenderers estimating a timeline of up to 9 months for its completion. As such, these maps, which are a fundamental aspect of any amendments to the exemptions, are expected to be finalised in Q3 2021.</p><p>As required under planning legislation, any such proposed exempted development regulations must be laid in draft form before the Houses of the Oireachtas and receive a positive resolution from both Houses before they can be made. The draft regulations will also be subject to environmental assessment reporting considerations before being finalised and signed into force. The overall process for revising the solar panel planning exemptions is now expected to be completed by Q4 2021.</p></reply>

These limits were agreed in conjunction with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection (DEASP).  In reviewing the rent limits, my Department worked closely with DEASP and monitored data gathered from the Residential Tenancies Board and the HAP Shared Services Centre.  The HAP rent limits were increased significantly, in the order of 60% in some cases.</p><p>Maximum rent limits for the HAP scheme are set out for each housing authority area by the Housing Assistance Payment (Amendment) Regulations 2017.  The current maximum HAP rent limits are available on the Irish Statute Book website at the following link:</p><p>. </p><p>Local authorities also have discretion, because of local rental market conditions, to exceed the maximum rent limit by up to 20%, or up to 50% in the Dublin region for those households either in, or at immediate risk of homelessness. It should be noted that it is a matter for the local authority to determine whether the application of the flexibility is warranted on a case by case basis and also the level of additional discretion applied in each case. </p><p>In considering this issue, I am conscious that increasing the current HAP rent limits could have negative inflationary impacts, leading to a detrimental impact on the wider rental market, including for those households who are not receiving HAP support.</p><p>My Department closely monitors the level of discretion being used by local authorities, taking into account other sources of data, including Residential Tenancies Board rent data published on a quarterly basis. It is considered that the current maximum rent limits, together with the additional flexibility available to local authorities, are adequate to support the effective operation of the HAP scheme.</p></reply>

A decision of a planning authority on a planning application may be appealed to An Bord Pleanala within 4 weeks of the decision. Under section 126 of the Act, the Board has a statutory objective period of 18 weeks to make a decision on any appeal. </p>  <p>  Where a decision is made by a planning authority or the Board, under section 50 of the Act an application for leave to apply for judicial review should be made within eight weeks of the date of the decision. The High Court shall not extend the eight week period for leave to apply for judicial review unless it considers that there is good and sufficient reason for doing so. Timelines within the courts are ones in which, I as Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage have no statutory function and are a matter for the Courts Service which is statutorily independent.  </p></reply>

As part of this, measures and proposals to support more serviced sites closer to urban settlements such as towns and villages will be examined, within the broader context of the issues effecting such places as already outlined. It is anticipated that any recommendations forthcoming from the TCF approach will be developed over the next six months.</p>  <p>The NPF acknowledges that rural settlements are not suitable for a suburban or a high density approach to development and tailored design approaches are needed. As such, this initiative is intended to address rural-focused issues with a view to supporting settlements at risk of vacancy and decline. The NPF also recognises that in rural Ireland many people seek to have an opportunity to build their own homes.  Under National Policy Objective 18b my Department is committed to developing a programme with local authorities, public infrastructure agencies such as Irish Water and local communities for the provision of serviced sites for housing to attract people to build their own homes and live in small towns and villages.</p>  <p>  Consideration will also need to be given to the expansion of towns and villages in a sustainable manner.  Such development will be incremental, small scale, walkable (including to and from the town/village centre) and will occur on sites that have access adequate water supply and provision for disposal of domestic effluent.  Such extensions should also be guided by responsive design principles so that they appear as a natural extensions to the town/village with a close visual relationship to the prevailing vernacular.  My Department is addressing this in the context the development of proposed &lsquo;sustainable settlement guidance&rsquo;.  </p></reply>

This Strategy strives to provide a targeted, effective and co-ordinated approach to identifying and tackling vacancy across Ireland. </p><p>The activities of the Vacant Homes Officers are already comprehensive; any expansion of their current role will be carefully reviewed and targeted and will reflect the Government&rsquo;s commitment to bringing vacant properties back into use across the country. </p><p>The current role of the Vacant Homes Officer is wide ranging and includes, but is not limited to;</p><p>- tasks that support, implement and further develop, update, monitor and review the progress of local authorities&rsquo; Vacant Homes Action Plans and actions to address vacant private housing, </p><p>- stablishing a co-ordinated approach towards the implementation of the Action Plans within each local authority,</p><p>- undertaking initial vacancy assessment exercise (drilling into available CSO / GeoDirectory data), </p><p>- carrying out or co-ordinating visual inspections / assessment of residential properties in their administrative area, with a view to identifying possible vacant recoverable homes,</p><p>- identification of the registered owners of the properties deemed to be vacant from inspection, and contacting the owners on the options available to assist in bringing their properties back into use for private or social housing purposes,</p><p>- serving as a contact point for dissemination of assistance and information to members of the public (including landlords), on residential vacancy and the schemes available to re-introduce their homes into the usable housing stock, </p><p>- serving as a contact point for dissemination to interested parties of the &lsquo;Guidance on the Reuse of Existing Buildings for Residential purposes&rsquo; (published in December 2018); and </p><p>- the collation and provision of vacant homes data to my Department.</p><p>There are a number of supporting schemes available to assist property owners to bring their vacant properties back into use for social housing &ndash; the Repair &amp;amp; Lease Scheme, the Buy and Renew Scheme or Long Term Leasing.  The maximum loan for property repair available under the Repair and Leases scheme has recently been increased by my Department from &euro;40,000 to &euro;60,000.  This funding increase will mean that property owners who cannot afford or access funding to bring their vacant stock up to standard and back into use will be able to do so to provide social housing. It has an added benefit of increasing investment and employment into the local construction and retail sectors while also providing for the regeneration of local communities.</p><p>The Vacant Homes Unit in my Department recently ran an advertising campaign in national newspapers directed at owners of vacant properties alerting them to the vacant homes schemes available. On foot of this , the Vacant Homes Unit received a very strong response from the public, and as a result many Vacant Homes Officers are currently in the process of engaging with the owners of potentially suitable properties to be brought back into use.</p><p>My Department will continue to keep the Vacant Homes Schemes and the various functions of the Vacant Homes Offices under review with ongoing feedback from our Vacant Homes Officers.</p></reply>

For example, the 2015 scheme was intended to be financed by the interest payable on deposits lodged; this is no longer viable, given the current financial market conditions. </p><p>Furthermore, it is noteworthy that disputes relating to deposits are no longer the most common dispute type referred to the RTB. Prior to 2013, deposit retention had been the most common dispute type. However, deposit retention is now the third most common rental dispute type, included in 20% of dispute applications in 2019.  2019 saw 364,099 registered tenancies with the RTB of which there were 6,185 applications for dispute resolution and, among those, 1,264 pertained to deposit retention issues &ndash; this correlates with 0.35% of tenancies overall. (In terms of case outcomes, in 73% of cases in 2019, it was found that the deposit should be fully or partially refunded to the tenant, which compares to 80% in 2018.) </p><p>Financing the operation of the scheme is an important consideration, particularly in terms of ensuring that the likely outcomes of a new scheme are achieved efficiently and effectively and that the best value from public funds is secured. Careful consideration is therefore required to introduce any necessary reforms and enhancements to the 2015 scheme, with a view to considering whether and how to introduce a re-designed scheme that is fit for purpose and suitable for current and future rental and financial markets. </p><p>Any review of the scope and provisions of a Deposit Protection scheme will need to take account of changes in the residential sectors since the 2015 Deposit Protection Scheme legal provisions were enacted, to inform any necessary legislative change. Consideration will need to be given as to whether or not it is feasible to proceed to revise and implement a deposit protection scheme at this time, or to defer to a later point in time, when the RTB's Change Management Plan has been fully implemented and more robust data and information is available for consideration.</p><p>The RTB has cut case times for deposit-related disputes as the introduction of new processes has borne fruit and the question of proportionality is key and it is imperative to question whether the scale of spending and intervention required is commensurate with the scale of the issue. From a value-for-money perspective at a time when the rental market is experiencing extreme pressure in terms of supply and costs, the introduction of a deposit protection scheme would require careful consideration. </p></reply>

The property in question must also meet certain eligibility criteria.</p><p>Up to the end of November 2020, 884<b></b>households with unsustainable private mortgages have completed the MTR scheme since its introduction nationally in 2013.  The 884 households in the scheme represent 1,493 adults and 1,399 children who have remained living in their homes and communities.  There are currently

statistical information on the operation of the MTR scheme.  This information is available on the Agency's website at the following link:</p><p>.  </p><p>A Review of the MTR scheme for borrowers of commercial private lending institutions published in February 2017 explored the avenues and impediments to participation in the scheme and identified a number of actions to make the scheme work better for borrowers.  My Department and the Housing Agency have worked with all stakeholders to ensure that the actions set out in the review are being effectively implemented to benefit a greater number of households.  As a result of the improvements implemented, an upward trend in case completions has been evident since 2018.</p><p>The MTR Review taking account of capacity within the Approved Housing Body (AHB) sector, also recommended that alternative funding options, including the off-balance sheet potential of private institutional investment, be explored in order to allow the MTR scheme to deliver at scale.  An Expressions of Interest (EOI) Request issued in 2017 inviting parties from the private sectors to express their interest in participating in a new alternatively funded long-term MTR lease model.</p><p>Under this alternatively funded model, a participant from the private sector purchases a property or properties from lenders subsequent to their voluntary surrender by borrowers that meet the MTR eligibility criteria and then enters into a long-term lease arrangement with the local authority in whose area the property is situated for a defined term at an agreed rent, thereby enabling the borrower to remain living in their own home.  The outcome from the EOI process is that a new MTR alternatively funded lease model was announced in 2018 with Home for Life Ltd. as the participant from the private sector.</p><p>AHBs are an integral part of the MTR scheme and their participation in the scheme has enabled and continues to enable a significant number of borrowers to remain in their homes as social housing tenants.  </p><p>The primary difference between an AHB acquiring a property under the MTR scheme and a private company acquiring a property is that in the private company's case private funding is used to purchase the MTR property as opposed to Exchequer funding.  The same MTR eligibility criteria apply and the social housing tenant status of those entering the scheme are the same. </p><p>The MTR process involves the Housing Agency commissioning an independent property valuation and it is on the basis of this valuation that MTR providers, both AHBs and Home for Life Ltd., are invited to express an interest in a particular property.  Should more than one provider express an interest in a particular property, the Housing Agency then randomly selects the provider and assigns the case to that provider.</p><p>In addition, any MTR provider may work directly with lenders to develop joint-agreements to purchase properties at discounts on market values.  Such an approach can achieve a greater number of successful MTR cases as well as the benefit of discounted purchase prices.</p><p>Given the nature of the individual property transaction underpinning MTR, the decision to purchase a property under the MTR scheme is a matter for the MTR provider.  In all scenarios, my Department and the Housing Agency are focussed on meeting the long-term housing needs of the greatest number of households in unsustainable mortgage arrears. </p><p>The Programme for Government includes a commitment to strengthen the Mortgage to Rent Scheme and ensure that it is helping those who need it. Building on the significant improvements already made to the scheme since 2017, my Department is currently working closely with the Housing Agency to identify any further improvements required to the scheme.  </p></reply>

The Housing Assistance Payment (Amendment) Regulations 2017 prescribe maximum rent limits for each housing authority, according to prescribed household classes, and the Regulations incorporate rent limits for a single household.</p>  <p>  If a household has been deemed eligible for social housing support, it is a matter for the local authority to examine the suite of social housing supports available, including the HAP scheme, to determine the most appropriate form of social housing support for that household in the administrative area of that local authority.</p>  <p>  A key principle of the HAP scheme is that eligible households source their own accommodation in the private rented sector, which best suits their needs, in their area of choice.

Each of these deaths is a tragedy and I extend my sympathies to the families concerned.</p>  <p>  The deaths of people availing of homeless services are a concern. In order to provide a better understanding on this matter, the Dublin Region Homeless Executive (DRHE) and the HSE have jointly commissioned a detailed review of recent deaths in homeless services. It is important that we establish the facts concerning the circumstances involved, and that we base our response as policy makers and elected representatives on the best knowledge and evidence available.</p>  <p>  It is vital that we continue to deliver the appropriate measures to ensure that all individuals experiencing homelessness are supported to exit into permanent housing solutions and that those with complex health and mental health needs are provided with the supports they need. My Department is working closely with the Department of Health, the HSE and local authorities in respect of these issues.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government includes measures targeted specifically at those experiencing homelessness with complex needs. It commits to the continued expansion of Housing First, and, importantly, ensuring that health and mental health supports are provided. The provision of addiction and mental health supports has featured prominently in meetings of the High Level Homelessness Task Force that I established and in my regular interactions with the Minister for Health. The issue of deaths in homeless services has also been discussed at the Task Force.</p>  <p>  Engaging with rough sleepers is vital. This engagement is first and foremost to encourage those rough sleeping to avail of shelter.  But critically, it also allows their health needs to be assessed and provided for.</p>  <p>  As we move further into the winter months, cold weather arrangements are in place nationally. My Department is providing funding to allow for an increase in the overall bed capacity, the provision of 24 hour services in facilities with meals provided, and enhancements to outreach operations. The DRHE, which has responsibility for over 70% of all homeless persons nationally, has assured me that sufficient capacity exists in services to ensure that no person should sleep outside for the need of an emergency bed.</p>  <p>  My Department publishes a detailed monthly report on homelessness, based on data provided by housing authorities. The Report outlines details of individuals utilising State-funded emergency accommodation arrangements that are overseen by housing authorities.</p>  <p>  While the information requested by the Deputies is not collated by my Department, I understand that the Department of Health has commissioned the Health Research Board to undertake a one-year feasibility study to collect data on deaths among people who were homeless. I have been advised that the research will apply the methodology used to compile the National Drug Related Deaths Index, which is a census of drug-related deaths and deaths among drug users and those who are alcohol dependent in Ireland. The data collection for 2019 deaths, including deaths among people who were homeless, commenced earlier this year and will review approximately 17,000 files from all Coroner districts.</p></reply>

Inter authority movement is, however, subject to certain conditions, such as the relevant Social Housing Income Eligibility Bands and confirmation that the applicant's income is below the threshold in the new local authority.</p>  <p>  HAP tenants that avail of inter authority movement continue to be dealt with by their originating local authority. However, the rent limits applicable are those that apply in the local authority where the property is situated.</p>  <p>  Each local authority has statutory discretion to agree to a HAP payment up to 20% above the prescribed maximum rent limit in circumstances where it is necessary, because of local rental market conditions, to secure appropriate accommodation for a household that requires it. It is a matter for the local authority to determine if the application of the flexibility is warranted on a case by case basis. Additional discretion of up to 50% above rent limits is available to assist in housing homeless households in the Dublin Region only.</p>  <p>  While there is no legislative provision precluding HAP supported households contributing towards their monthly landlord rent, local authorities have a responsibility to ensure that tenancies are sustainable and are advised not to provide HAP support to tenancies where the household would not be in a position to meet the rental costs involved.</p>  <p>  Each local authority has its own separate differential rent scheme made under section 58 of the Housing Act 1966. The Programme for Government commits to bringing forward a package of social housing reforms, which includes standardising the differential rents regime across the country to ensure fairness. Work on the review of the current rent schemes has been ongoing and I have asked my Department to prepare recommendations regarding the potential for a  standardised local authority rents system, which I will consider in due course as part of a package of social housing reforms.</p>  <p>  There are currently 216 active tenancies that were originally setup by the Dublin local authorities, who are now receiving HAP support in Meath.</p></reply>

Under section 143 of the Planning and Development Act, An Bord Plean&aacute;la is required to have regard to the policies and objectives of the Government, a state authority, the Minister, planning authorities and any other public authority whose functions have, or may have a bearing on the proper planning and sustainable development of cities towns or other areas, whether urban or rural.</p>  <p>  Sections 50, 50A and 50B of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, codify the statutory right of judicial review of any decision of An Bord Plean&aacute;la. While there has been an increase in applications for judicial review over the last number of years, the number of Board decisions that are subject to judicial review constitute a very small percentage of the number of planning cases disposed in any given year. There were 41 judicial review applications in 2018 out of 2847 cases disposed and in 2019 there were 55 judicial review applications out of 2971 cases disposed.</p>  <p>  An Bord Plean&aacute;la takes full cognisance of any settled legal adjudication in relation to its decisions and seeks to apply any principles from those to its application of its statutory decision making role.</p>  <p>  Finally, I am satisfied that the Board has the necessary resources to deliver effectively and efficiently on its important statutory mandate and functions and this is kept under review.</p></reply>

The repression of the Belarusian people and the denial of their democratic rights is unacceptable. We have seen mass and indiscriminate detentions of adults and minors, curtailments of fundamental freedoms, media freedoms and internet shutdowns, and credible reports of torture, ill-treatment and sexual violence against detainees. Ireland has repeatedly called for the repression to end and we have condemned the ongoing use of State violence against peaceful protesters, which recently led to the death of Raman Bandarenka in police custody. </p>  <p>  Ireland strongly supported the imposition of EU sanctions against 55 key figures of the Belarusian administration who were responsible for the fraudulent Presidential election in August and the violence we have seen. The latest tranche of sanctions included Alexander Lukashenko and his son Viktor, and along with our EU partners, we stand ready to take further measures. We also strongly support the EU in re-directing EU funds towards Belarusian civil society and away from the authorities. Complementing these efforts, Ireland has contributed funds to projects in Belarus managed by the European Endowment for Democracy that seek to protect fundamental human rights and media freedoms in the country. </p>  <p>  We have repeatedly expressed our deep concerns about the appalling state of human rights in Belarus in international settings, including most recently at the Human Rights Council (HRC) on 4 December. We have called on the Belarusian authorities to implement the recommendations of the OSCE Rapporteur's Moscow Mechanism Report and the recommendations made by the international community during the recent Universal Periodic Review cycle at the HRC. </p>  <p>  Ireland also shares the concerns of UN Special Rapporteur Lawlor on the persecution of women human rights defenders and we are deeply troubled by the prosecutions of Maria Rabkova, Irina Sukhiy and Marina Dubina. I can assure the Deputy that Ireland will not shy away from pressing the Belarusian authorities to adhere to their international commitments and to immediately and unconditionally release those unjustly detained, including political prisoners. </p>  <p>  The future of Belarus is for the Belarusian people alone to decide and therefore we will continue to urge the Belarusian authorities to engage in a broad-based and inclusive national dialogue as the appropriate means to achieve a peaceful and democratic resolution of the current crisis.   </p></reply>

We would expect Pakistan to fully adhere to the commitments of this Convention. </p>  <p>  Ireland is already active on this issue and is to the fore, leading on UN Resolutions on the Rights of the Child and co-sponsored a UN Resolution specifically on the issue of child, early and forced marriage. This Resolution urges States to enact and enforce laws to ensure that marriage is entered into only with the free and full consent of the intending spouses and there is a legal framework to ensure it is age appropriate.   </p>  <p>  Human rights, including women&rsquo;s rights, are raised regularly in the EU&rsquo;s bilateral dialogue with Pakistan, most recently during the EU-Pakistan Strategic Dialogue on 3 November. The EU Special Representative for Human Rights Eamon Gilmore has also had discussions with Pakistan&rsquo;s Federal Minister for Human Rights. Ireland looks forward to participating in preparations for the next EU-Pakistan Joint Commission planned in early 2021.</p></reply>

In addition, the use of Passport Online can facilitate social distancing, given that a renewal application for an adult does not require the signature of a witness. </p>  <p>  It is important to acknowledge that the online service is extremely easy to use. It has won awards for its user-friendly process, including a NALA award for the use of plain English. It is recognised that some applicants may not be familiar with using a computer. However, in such cases, a friend or relative with basic computer skills can help them to apply &ndash; the process only takes ten minutes to complete. </p>  <p>  The online service is extremely popular with applicants and has, in fact, become the most popular way to make a passport application. </p>  <p>  Passport Online can be accessed by first time applicants, both children and adults, in Ireland, Northern Ireland, Great Britain and Europe. All Irish citizens, including children, can use the online system to renew their passports from anywhere in the world. </p>  <p>  The Passport Service maintained an emergency service during the six week period from 21 October to 1 December. The emergency service was available for those who were required to travel urgently due to the death or serious illness of a family member or because the applicant required emergency medical treatment. The Passport Service was also able to provide assistance to those who required passports for urgent reasons such as taking up employment abroad. This emergency service was facilitated via the online system. </p>  <p>  While staff were on site in the Passport Service during Level 5, carrying out the essential work of processing emergency and urgent passport applications, they took the opportunity to produce an additional 9,000 passports, in the majority of cases for renewal applications. This was done for operational reasons, to ensure that that the complex printing equipment involved in passport production remained in full working order. Following the resumption of operations on 1 December, the Passport Service is working to dispatch printed passports and to process further applications.</p>  <p>  The Passport Service has a great deal of experience in dealing with peaks in demand, and we believe that we are well-placed to ensure that those applications submitted online will be processed within usual turnaround times within approximately four weeks. </p>  <p>  In the event that any applicant has urgent or emergency reasons for requiring a passport, they should contact the Passport Service&rsquo;s Customer Service Hub, by phone or webchat, to make the Passport Service aware of their situation. </p></reply>

The Taoiseach has also made a statement in support of the Finucane family. </p>  <p>  During a discussion of the McKerr group of cases at the European Council Committee of Ministers in Strasbourg on Tuesday 1 December, Ireland made a national statement which reaffirmed the  Government position that only a full and independent public inquiry will provide a satisfactory resolution to the case of Pat Finucane. The Committee subsequently adopted an Interim Resolution in relation to a number of Northern Ireland legacy cases, including the case of Pat Finucane, on 3 December, and the case will be examined again in March.</p>  <p>  The Government will continue to engage with the Finucane family, with the Council of Europe in Strasbourg and with the UK Government t to work towards a satisfactory resolution. </p>  <p>  So many families lost loved ones during the Troubles and are entitled to support in finding truth and justice, as part of healing the wounds of that conflict and building reconciliation.

The preliminary appraisal included an appraisal of various service delivery options, including where the state assumed full responsibility for the service, either through the Air Corps or a dedicated Irish Coast Guard Aviation Branch. Both were ruled out for a variety of reasons but notably the risks to the state and questions around potential affordability and deliverability. </p>  <p>  I agree with the strategic assessment and preliminary appraisal mentioned above and I do not see the Air Corps taking full responsibility for SAR services in Ireland&rsquo;s search and rescue domain. I will not speculate beyond the medium term. However I would like to explore further the option of the Air Corps providing some element of the SAR aviation service as part of the next genration SAR service provision, given their historical role in this area. Having said that I am well aware of the challenges the Air Corps experienced in the past in providing this service and any exploration of them providing some element of the service would need to take into account their existing roles and the current challenges in delivering those roles.</p>  <p>  I can confirm that I have asked my officials to engage further with the Department of Transport, to explore the option of the Air Corps providing some element of the next generation SAR aviation service while at the same time ensuring that the service meets domestic and international obligations for search and rescue and represents value for money for the State.  This engagement is ongoing. </p></reply>

It is accepted that good connectivity is essential to ensure that schools are facilitated to progress the embedding of digital technologies in teaching and learning and for the implementation of new and revised curriculum. </p>  <p>  Under the current primary schools programme the Department continually reviews the availability of services and upgrades schools where the opportunity arises, in line with contractual and budgetary requirements. </p>  <p>  The policy of my Department is to offer the best quality connectivity to all schools in line with the technical solutions available in the market and within financial constraints. Currently investment of some &euro;13m is allocated annually for the provision of internet connectivity to schools. Broadband capacity can vary across geographical locations and is dependent on local infrastructure which can impact on the service that can be provided in individual schools. </p>  <p>  The Department is obliged to adhere to procurement regulations, and must engage with the selected providers on the DES Framework of Providers of Broadband Services through a tender process to award services. Having awarded a school service to the highest placed tenderer, the Department is then required to work with that provider to install the service. This is the basis on which all state-funding is utilised to ensure transparency and equal treatment for all schools and providers, and adherence to regulatory requirements. </p>  <p>   </p></reply>

However it is recognised that some children cannot return to school because they are medically certified as being at very high risk to COVID-19 and with complex medical needs and my Department has published guidance to support schools in making adapted education provision for these instances. Where a parent believes that their child is very high risk, they should engage with their childs school and medical team. </p>  <p>  The HPSC advices also outlines that children with immediate family members, including parents, in both the &lsquo;high risk&rsquo; and &lsquo;very high risk&rsquo; categories can return to school and that this is important for the child&rsquo;s overall well-being.  This is consistent with public health advice internationally in relation to at-risk family members. </p>  <p>  My Department is aware that some parents and children have had concerns about returning to school and the Department has developed and prepared a comprehensive response to supporting the wellbeing of school communities at this time. The resources and supports provided by services such as the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) and the Tusla Education Support Service (TESS) are available to support families who are experiencing particularly challenging times. Schools may also consult with NEPS in relation to the academic, social and emotional needs of their students.  </p></reply>

This investment will support the provision of over 1,200 additional special class places. </p><p>The National Council for Special Education is responsible for planning and coordinating local education provision and school placements for children with special needs for the whole country. </p><p>NCSE has advised that there are currently 11 Primary School ASD classes in South Tipperary.</p><p>Taking a range of demographic factors into consideration, it is anticipated that additional places may be required in Tippeary to cater for likely future demand in the county. The NCSE, through its network of local SENOs, will continue to engage with the local schools to establish additional classes as required.</p><p>It is open to any school to make an application to the NCSE to open a special class.  The active collaboration of school communities is vital to the effective inclusion of students with special educational needs.  </p><p>A list of all special classes, including classes opened for September 2020, is available on the NCSE website at .</p><p>Parents are advised to maintain contact with their local Special Education Needs Organiser (SENO) for information made known by schools on vacancies in special classes already established and for the most up-to-date position on special classes in development.</p><p>SENO contact details are also available on the NCSE website at: . </p></reply>

This is shared by the SEC, which has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations. </p>  <p>  My Department is acutely aware of the disruption caused to students as a result of school closures resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic and which led the decision not to run the state examinations this summer.</p>  <p>  In the context of the return to schools of students for the 2020/21 academic year my Department published a range of documentation and support material as part of the Roadmap for the Full Return to School, which is available at www.gov.ie/backtoschool. That schools have remained open throughout level 5 restrictions has been very encouraging.</p>  <p>  Specific guidance was provided to post-primary schools in the Returning to School: Guidance on learning and school programmes for post-primary school leaders and teachers. In the guidance on in-school assessment advised that:</p>  <p>  It is, however, important that over-assessment is avoided and that an appropriate balance is achieved between formative and summative assessment. The provision of timely feedback to students will be particularly important in this school year given the context where, during the school closure period, the opportunities for and quality of feedback to students on their work varied from school to school and sometimes from subject to subject.</p>  <p>  The assessment of students&rsquo; learning should reflect the aims and learning outcomes of specifications, priority learning units and syllabuses as relevant, ensuring accessibility to the mode of assessment for all students. In planning for assessment, the use of self- assessment by learners of their own progress, as well as peer assessment could be usefully included as a strategy to support assessment activities.</p>  <p>  On 21 August, I announced a series of changes that would be made to assessment arrangements for both Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate examinations for 2021. This announcement was accompanied by a published document detailing these changes, Assessment Arrangements for Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate Examinations 2021, and forms part of the Roadmap for the Full Return to School.</p>  <p>  These arrangements are designed to take account of the disrupted learning experienced by students during the 2019/20 school year and to factor in for some further possible loss of learning time in the 2020/21 school year as a contingency measure. As the loss of learning through school closures will have affected students&rsquo; engagement with their course of study in different ways, the adjustments put in place will play to students&rsquo; strengths by leaving intact the familiar overall structure of the examinations, while incorporating additional choice. The adjustments were arrived at through discussions between my Department, the State Examinations Commission (SEC), the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) and key stakeholders.  </p>  <p>  As schools have significant autonomy in determining how to sequence and pace learning for students in their schools, no centrally prescribed adjustment of the curriculum and courses of study would have been effective for students taking the certificate examinations in 2021. Consequently, the most appropriate way to reflect and take account of the challenges for students that have occurred in 2019/20 and may occur in 2020/21 was to incorporate adjustments to the certificate examinations in 2021.</p>  <p>  These changes to the national assessment arrangements were made with due regard for the principles of equity, fairness and integrity, as these principles apply to assessment and examinations and refer to student to-student, subject-to-subject, and year-to-year comparisons over time. The changes provide reassurance to students, their parents/guardians, teachers and schools.</p>  <p>  Further clarification on the assessment arrangements for 2021 for certain subjects will issue shortly. </p>  <p>  The SEC has valuable learning from the experience of running the 2020 November examinations, notwithstanding that the numbers taking these examinations is significantly lower than the number due to sit examinations in 2021.  The measures relating to COVID-19 that have been put in place for the November examinations will be considered as part of the planning for examinations in 2021.   </p>  <p>  The SEC has commenced its contingency planning for the 2021 examinations, recognising that a flexible and agile approach is necessary in light of the continuing fast-moving environment linked to COVID-19.  It is not intended that there would be any change to the length of the written examinations. Project briefs for relevant subjects have issued earlier than usual and practical coursework will be submitted two weeks earlier than normal as a contingency measure. Teachers are being encouraged to plan and undertake these projects as early as possible in the programme of study.  These changes to the Leaving Certificate assessment arrangements for 2021 are deigned to provide reassurance to students, their parents/guardians, teachers and schools.</p>  <p>  In addition, an advisory group of key stakeholders, which advised on altered arrangements for the 2020 state examinations, was reconvened on 25 November in an online meeting to perform a similar role in respect of the 2021 examinations. The advisory group includes representatives of students, parents, teachers, school leadership and management bodies, the SEC, the NCCA and the Department, including the National Educational Psychological Service. Representatives from the Higher Education Authority and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science are also represented on the advisory group to ensure liaison with the third level sector.</p>  <p>  Other documents published by my Department to support the return to school include Guidance for Practical Subjects in Post-Primary Schools and Centres for Education and Returning to school: Guidance on learning and school programmes for post primary school leaders and teachers. These documents provide guidance for teachers and schools that is specific to each practical subject area, so that students can be facilitated to actively engage with their learning.  All documentation published is available on www.gov.ie/backtoschool.</p>  <p> </p></reply>

The starting salary for a new entrant teacher in 2012 was &euro;30,702. As a result of the programme of pay restoration, the starting salary of a teacher is now &euro;37,692.</p>  <p>  Section 11 of the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 provides that &ldquo;the Minister [for Public Expenditure and Reform] shall, within three months of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before the Oireachtas a report on the cost of and a plan in dealing with pay equalisation for new entrants to the public service.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  The report laid before the Oireachtas on foot of this provision by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform assesses the cost of a further change which would provide a two scale point adjustment to new entrants recruited since 2011. The total cost of such an adjustment across the public sector is of the order of &euro;200 million, of which Education accounts for approximately &euro;83 million. The report also acknowledges that, during the financial crisis, there were policy changes which affected remuneration in different occupations across the public sector (including education).</p>  <p>  The matter of new entrant pay is a cross sectoral issue, not just an issue for the education sector alone. The Government supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants.</p>  <p>  The total year one cost of equalising the pay of new entrant teachers to the pre-2011 arrangements is estimated to be in the region of &euro;59 million per annum in year one (&euro;45 million for full resolution of pay scales and &euro;14 million for re-instatement of the H.Dip allowance).  The costs would rise in subsequent years as more new entrants join the system.</p>  <p>  On 24 September 2018, an agreement was reached between the Government and the public services committee of ICTU in respect of new entrant pay.</p>  <p>  This agreement is benefitting 18,000 teachers and nearly 5,000 SNAs within the education sector. The deal provides for a series of incremental jumps for new entrants.</p>  <p>  I am fully aware that the teacher unions have outstanding issues of concern following the September 2018 agreement. These outstanding matters will be given full consideration. This will happen in the context of the next round of pay talks. The positions of each of the parties on these matters must be given due regard in endeavouring to reach a mutually agreed resolution.</p>  <p>  The current series of restorative measures for new entrants have been achieved through continued engagement and collective bargaining between the Government and the public service unions and shows the benefits that such engagement can bring. </p></reply>

The applicant must also qualify for certain Social Protection payments. </p>  <p>  Because of the varied nature of the many schemes administered by my Department, qualifying criteria and conditions for receipt of a scheme will vary depending on a number of circumstances. These circumstances may include marital status, assessable means or PRSI contributions.  The reason a partner does not receive a widowed or surviving civil partner grant in the circumstances outlined by the Deputy is that the person has not entered into marriage or a civil partnership with the person they were co-habiting with. Entering into a marriage or civil partnership is a legal act, which confers both rights and obligations on both parties that do not exist in law between co-habiting couples.  </p>  <p>  The legal context governing relationships such as marriage is regulated by the Minister for Justice.  Aside from the wider legal issues regarding the status of marriage and civil partnerships, which is a much broader policy area than its implications under the remit of my Department, extending the current provisions to people who have not undertaken equivalent legal obligations would carry significant costs and would also raise significant issues about scheme criteria.  </p>  <p>  Any decision to extend the qualifying criteria for the widowed or surviving civil partner grant would have to be considered in the context of the legal issues that it would raise both for this scheme and across the social welfare system more generally as well as having regard to the budgetary implications.  </p>  <p>  Under the supplementary allowance scheme, my Department may make a single exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet from their weekly income, which may include help with bereavement expenses. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The evaluation will also explore the effectiveness of different approaches and measures applied in bringing young people with disabilities, who are not work-ready, closer to the labour market in addition to examining the range of impacts on the participants of the programme.  The evaluation will be a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods, which will be supported by an analysis of quantitative data collected by Pobal.  The evaluation is being conducted over the duration of the programme and it will conclude in June 2021.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to seek to improve the employment-related supports provided by my Department for people with disabilities.</p></reply>

The Department cannot accurately quantify a cost per placement but on average, the indicative cost of customer engagement is approx. &euro;2,800 per client.  Engagement with the Employability Service can last up to 18 months and customers can exit the service at any point along the way. </p>  <p>  The EmployAbility Service is delivered under a contract arrangement with individual service providers on behalf of my Department.  There are currently 24 EmployAbility contracts in place and the combined value of the contracts entered into is &euro;9.9m in 2020.  The costs of the individual contracts relates to the contracted capacity of each service and the costs of same.  </p>  <p>  The budget for each service provider is stipulated in the contract.  The amount involved, however, having been separately negotiated with each contractor, is commercially sensitive.  I can advise the Deputy that the average contract value is approximately &euro;420,000 per annum.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matters for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Much of this impact can be related to employers operating a &ldquo;first in, first out&rdquo; approach when enforcing cutbacks and reducing their workforce. Research by my Department has shown that young people make up a significant share of workers in the sectors greatly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and resulting public health restrictions; namely the hospitality and retail sectors.</p>  <p>   By end November, if we include PUP recipients in the figures, over 47 percent of young people in the labour force were unemployed, with one-in-four current PUP recipients (approx. 90,000) under the age of 25.  However, it is important to note that, due to the unprecedented economic situation, the Government extended access to PUP to students who worked part-time.  As a consequence almost one in four (approx. 21,000) of current PUP recipients aged under 25  have self-certified as students. These students would not normally be eligible for a jobseeker payment, or counted as  unemployed using internationally recognised standards set by the International Labour Organisation.</p>  <p>  While many young people, in particular those in receipt of PUP, will return to work when restrictions are eased, it is inevitable that some jobs will be permanently lost. These individuals will require high levels of State support to re-find their footing in the labour market.  We must also not forgot those young people who were unemployed prior to the pandemic and who face barriers to work.</p>  <p>  That is why my Department and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science have plans in place to support and assist young people on their journey back to work. Measures being developed to combat unemployment, and youth unemployment in particular, include:</p>  <p>  - Expanding the caseload capacity of Intreo  Centres during Q1 2020 with the assignment of 100 job coaches to provide enhanced employment services and supports. Case  officer support to help people with job search advice and assistance is shown to be the most effective means of helping people move into employment</p>  <p>  - Extending the current contracts of existing contracted public employment service providers into 2021.  In particular, the Local Employment  Service is being extended into four new areas and the capacity of the service increased by 50%.</p>  <p>  - Expanding the benefit of the  JobsPlus recruitment subsidy to employers who hire young people.   Under this scheme an employer receives the JobsPlus subsidy of &euro;7,500 once  they employ a young person (under 30 years of age) who has been unemployed  for just 4 months. A higher subsidy of &euro;10,000 is paid for recruitment of a person who was long term unemployed (over 12 months).  This will help make it more attractive to recruit young people who face difficulties in securing a footing in  employment. My Department will begin actively promoting this Scheme to employers early in the new year, and  8,000 places will be available for young jobseekers throughout 2021.</p>  <p>  - Providing access to additional full-time and  part-time education, including targeted short-term courses, with over 35,000 new education and training places for those currently unemployed.</p>  <p>  - Providing incentives to employers to take on  more apprentices, with the provision of a grant of &euro;3,000 to employers for  each new apprentice recruited until June 2021. By end September, over  3,000 new apprenticeships with over 600 employers were registered.</p>  <p>  - Facilitating access to the Back to Education  Allowance and Back to Work Enterprise Allowance to those displaced by the pandemic by waiving the usual qualifying period of 3-9 months. My Department will actively promote this scheme to suitable candidates and although it is not budget capped, additional provision has been made in Budget 2021 of &euro;3.5million &ndash; equivalent to an extra 700 places.</p>  <p>  My Department is well advanced in developing a new work placement experience programme for those out of work for at least six months to encourage employers to provide jobseekers with the necessary workplace skills to compete in the labour market and to help break the vicious circle of &ldquo;no job without experience, no experience without a job&rdquo;.  It is intended that the programme will support mentoring to encourage jobseekers to expand their horizons and avail of new learning options which can help them to grow into a new career.  There is a target of over 10,000 persons, regardless of age, to be placed on this six month scheme by end 2021. </p>  <p>  Work is also  advanced stage by my Department to develop Pathways to Work, the national employment services strategy for the period 2021-2025. The strategy will seek to build on the support measures outlined above as we assist young people on their journey to work.  Publication is expected in early 2021, following the launch of the Government's National Economic Plan.</p>  <p>  In developing these policies, programmes and services, my Department is working closely with, and eing advised by, he Labour Market Advisory Council which is composed of leading market experts, representatives of industry and workers and representatives of unemployed people.  We will keep these programmes under review and report progress on a regular basis.</p></reply>

There have been a number of advances in respect of the leave available to working parents in recent years. The Parent&rsquo;s Leave and Benefit Act 2019 introduced paid parent&rsquo;s leave of two weeks for each parent to be taken in the first year of a child&rsquo;s life or within the first year of placement with the family in the case of adoption. The Government intends to further extend parent&rsquo;s leave and benefit to five weeks for each parent, to be taken until the child is two.  Work is being undertaken to develop legislation to provide for these changes. </p>  <p>  The Parental Leave (Amendment) Act 2019 further extended the availability of unpaid parental leave. As of 1 September 2020, each parent has an entitlement to 26 weeks which can be taken up to a child&rsquo;s twelfth birthday.</p>  <p>  Where a parent requires urgent leave from work, they may avail of force majeure leave which gives an employee a limited right to leave from work. Under the Parental Leave Acts 1998 and 2019, this leave is available where, for urgent family reasons, the immediate presence of the employee is required due to illness or injury of a close family member, including a child or adopted child. The maximum amount of leave available is three days in a 12-month period or five days in a 36-month period. There are no plans at present to extend force majeure leave.</p></reply>

However, it is not possible at this time to indicate a precise date for the publication of either Bill.  I am pressing for publication of both as soon as possible. </p><p>The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 was signed into law on 30 December 2015.  Since that time there have been 1,596 wards of court declared under the existing wardship system as follows:</p><p><b>Wards Declared</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Year </th>       <th>Number </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020 to mid Nov. </td>       <td>269 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019 </td>       <td>385 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018 </td>       <td>327 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017 </td>       <td>325 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016 </td>       <td>290 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The amendment Bill will, when enacted, allow for the commencement of outstanding areas of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 including the provisions in relation to wardship.  In the meantime, the establishment of the Decision Support Service (DSS) is going ahead, as far as possible, with the assistance and oversight of a high-level Steering Group comprising senior officials from my Department, the Department of Health (DoH), the Mental Health Commission, the Courts Service and the HSE, together with the Director of the DSS.  The Steering Group continues to meet monthly and work is ongoing in the DSS, the Courts Service, DoH, and the HSE in order to be ready for commencement.  My Department has, through the Estimates process, sought and received increased funding in 2021, bringing the budget of the DSS to &euro;5.8 million for the year.  This will allow the DSS to work towards the commencement of services.  The timeline for the DSS to become fully operational, with all legislative provisions in place and commenced, is mid-2022.  The consultation process on the draft codes of practice will be a matter for the Decision Support Service.</p></reply>

The NCS is designed to be highly inclusive and to meet the needs of those families who need it the most. The NCS is based on the principle of progressive universalism and has regard to the best interests of children. </p>  <p>  By making this fundamental shift away from subsidies grounded in medical card and social protection entitlements, and by tangibly reducing the cost of quality childcare for thousands of families, the NCS aims to improve children&rsquo;s outcomes, improve labour market participation and reduce child poverty. It is a central policy component of the NCS to poverty proof and assist people in exiting the poverty trap.</p>  <p>  The NCS includes two types of financial subsidies towards the cost of quality childcare:</p>  <p>  - A universal subsidy payable for children aged between 24 weeks and 36 months who are availing of childcare from an approved childcare provider. The subsidy rate is &euro;0.50 per hour and covers a maximum of up to 45 hours per week. It&rsquo;s payable for children older than 36 months who do not yet qualify for the Early Childhood Care and Education Programme (ECCE). This subsidy is not means-tested and is available to all qualifying families at any income level. </p>  <p>  - An income-related subsidy payable for children aged from 24 weeks to 15 years who are availing of childcare from an approved childcare provider. The level of subsidy paid for the child is determined by the family&rsquo;s reckonable income (gross income minus tax, other deductibles and any applicable multiple children discount). The reckonable income must be between &euro;26,000 and &euro;60,000. The enhanced hours available are up to a maximum of 45 hours per week and the standard hours available are up to a maximum of 20 hours per week. The NCS acknowledges that childcare needs differ widely across families, offering subsidies at an hourly rate allowing for flexible childcare arrangements to be made based on parental needs. </p>  <p>  Under the NCS higher subsidies are awarded to families with younger children, to reflect the higher cost of providing childcare for younger children because of the higher adult-child ratios required by the Early Years Regulations. Subsidies taper downwards from a maximum of &euro;5.10 per hour for children between 6 months and 1 year, to a maximum of &euro;3.75 for school aged children. The number of hours a child is eligible for depends on whether the parent is engaged in work, training or study. </p>  <p>  Please note that in the examples provided by the Deputy insufficient particulars were supplied, including the child&rsquo;s age/education stage, the net income of the family and the hours of childcare required.These criteria affect the level of subsidy that can be allocated to an applicant. The assumptions required to finalise an estimate are noted in the examples below.</p>  <p>  Where the Deputy notes &ldquo;person&rdquo;, we assume this to mean &ldquo;household&rdquo; where all assessable individuals are in work or study. That is we assume the noted income is for the entire household.</p>  <p>  There are also many variables in the calculation of net income. We have estimated a net income to enable the calculations as noted below.</p>  <p>  Example 1: In the case of a household with one child aged 2 and with household earnings of approx. &euro;30,000 gross (assume &euro;27,000 net), the applicant would receive a weekly subsidy of &euro;190 for 45 hours childcare per week.</p>  <p>  Example 2: In the case of a household with earnings of &euro;30,000 gross (assume &euro;27,000 net) with two children - a 7 year old (in first class) and an 11 month old, the applicant would receive a weekly subsidy of &euro;297 during term and time and &euro;398 out of term for 45 hours childcare.</p>  <p>  Example 3: In the case of a household with earnings of &euro;40,000 gross (assume &euro;34,000 net) with a 3 year old and 5 year old child, the applicant would receive a weekly subsidy of &euro;195 during term time and &euro;327 out of term for 45 hours childcare. To note the family would receive an additional 15 hours free childcare per week during term time whilst the 3 year old was in the ECCE scheme.</p>  <p>  Example 4: In the case of a household on a wage of 80,000 gross (&euro;57,000 net) with three children - a child aged 10 (in fifth class), a 7 year old (in first class) and a 2 year old, the applicant would receive a weekly subsidy of &euro;134 during term time and &euro;197 out of term time for 45 hours childcare per week.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-12-08a.1134.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020120800081#WRX01500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 444 to 447, inclusive, together.</p>  <p>  An accommodation centre for families in the International Protection process will open on Port Road in Letterkenny in early 2021. It is expected that residents will move into the centre on a phased basis over a period of 8 to 10 weeks thereafter.   </p>  <p>  While their application is being examined, all applicants for International Protection are offered free of charge: accommodation, meals or food supplies (where self-catering is available) and personal care products.  Other supports such as healthcare, education for children and classes for adults, and a weekly payment for personal expenditure are provided through the relevant State services.  </p>  <p>  As part of the establishment of any such accommodation centre my Department, through the International Protection Accommodation Service (IPAS), develops close working relationships with all state and local agencies including the Departments of Social Protection and Education and the HSE.  This ensures that the whole of Government service envisioned by the system is delivered directly to all residents in all accommodation services by the relevant government department or State agency. </p>  <p>  My Department has already engaged with state service providers in preparation for the arrival of residents to the Port Road Accommodation Centre and will continue to liaise with them as necessary for as long as the centre remains in operation. Officials from my Department have also met with the Letterkenny Municipal Council to brief councillors on the planned opening and will continue to engage and update Council members in coming weeks and months.  </p>  <p>  I can also assure the Deputy that the ongoing welfare needs of International Protection applicants is of upmost importance to my Department and is taken into consideration during the procurement process for accommodation centres. Potential contractors are required to propose an implementation plan to provide for the welfare needs of residents. This plan must provide details regarding the experience and qualifications of staff in providing social care in a residential facility, ideally in a multicultural environment.  Particular consideration is given to the qualifications or experience of staff in dealing with vulnerable people and people suffering from the effects of trauma.</p>  <p>  The Port Road Accommodation Centre in Letterkenny will be operated by Bridgestock Care which has extensive experience of providing services to protection applicants (asylum seekers) and refugees in social care settings across multiple locations both in Ireland and abroad. The team of people available to Bridgestock Care for the centre in Letterkenny is highly qualified and very experienced in providing social care in multicultural environments. </p>  <p>  The IPAS has also recently engaged Barnardos to provide training to all centres and emergency accommodation locations, on 'Understanding Child Development through a Trauma Informed Lens'. This training will assist with ensuring centre staff and managers are aware of the impact of trauma on children and understand how that may inform the behaviour of any child or indeed adult who has been impacted by trauma.</p>  <p>  The IPAS has a complaints procedure which is set out in the House Rules &amp;amp; Procedures Booklet for International Protection applicants.  Complaints are made initially to the centre manager with a view to informal resolution.  If the person concerned is not satisfied with the outcome of their complaint, he or she may make a complaint to IPAS who will investigate the matter and take action as appropriate.  In the event that a resident is not satisfied with how his or her complaint is dealt with, he or she has full access to the services of the Ombudsman and Ombudsman for Children.</p>  <p>  In addition, a confidential Freephone telephone support service, funded by, but independent of, my Department, was also established in May 2020 to provide further support to residents that are being accommodated by my Department. This Freephone confidential support helpline is operated by the Jesuit Refugee Service (JRS).  Any complaint made through this service may be passed in confidence to IPAS for investigation and resolution. </p>  <p>  I can also inform the Deputy that all centre operators are contractually bound to facilitate the establishment of a &lsquo;Friends of the Centre&rsquo; group and must make a room available to facilitate meetings.  The operation of the &lsquo;Friends of the Centre&rsquo; group is facilitated by staff from the accommodation centre. </p>  <p>  The composition of each group varies from centre to centre but will include residents, staff members and volunteers from the local community. Officials from the IPAS will occasionally attend meetings if invited by the group to do so. </p>  <p>  The purpose of the group is to help establish links between the residents of accommodation centres and local community, voluntary and sporting groups which promotes integration across the community and assists residents to have meaningful interaction with the local community. They are a valuable support to residents and to centre managers and staff.  </p>  <p>  The groups promote relationships between the centre and the local community and local clubs so residents may take part in a variety of activities outside the centre, in the community, to assist with their integration.  There is no decision making responsibility in respect of residents associated with the groups.</p>  <p>  The scope of and the types of activities engaged in by the group vary from centre to centre. They reflect the type of residents being accommodated in a centre and also the voluntary groups that are active in a particular locality. For example, the activities engaged in by a group based in a centre that accommodates only single adults will be different to those engaged in by a group based on a centre accommodating families. Examples of groups that have engaged with Friends of the Centre include local Tidy Towns committees, sports clubs, Men's Sheds and Mother and Baby clubs.  Groups providing for activities, in the centres or externally, with the aim of integrating residents of the centres into the community are eligible to apply for funding under the Communities Integration Fund (CIF).  </p>  <p>  The new Centre in Letterkenny will also have an Activities Co-Ordinator to assist residents this through a range of different initiatives including but not limited to:</p>  <p>  - A comprehensive Induction Seminar for all residents the day after arrival that includes information and briefing on all integration initiatives at the Centre</p>  <p>  - English classes provided by the Education Training Board </p>  <p>  - Attendance by the Activites Co-Ordinator (by agreement) with parents at parent/teacher meetings at local schools particularly in cases where they may be language difficulties</p>  <p>  - Ongoing support and guidance from the management team in helping residents who obtain a permission to reside in the State to find suitable accommodation in the community and integrate into society once they leave the centre.</p>  <p>  The operation of the &lsquo;Friends of the Centre&rsquo; group will be facilitated by the Activities Co-Ordinator and other staff from the accommodation centre. </p>  <p>  I am pleased to note that a number of local groups in Letterkenny have already made contact with my Department to offer their support and assistance to the families when they arrive.  I envisage that the Friends of the Centre Group for the Port Road Accommodation Centre will develop into a thriving and productive forum linking the centre with the local community, ensuring the local community have an opportunity to become an active part of the Centre as well as facilitating local engagement with the residents of the Centre.</p></reply>

My Department is assisted with these tender projects by the Office of Government Procurement.</p><p>The tender process which commenced in late 2018, saw regional tender competitions being advertised, assessed and awarded. The competitions were held for the South East, Midlands, Mid-West, South-West, Mid-East, West, Dublin and the Border Regions. </p><p>All properties selected under the tender process must be able to meet the requirements of the National Standards for accommodation centres. This requirement applies to the provision of new centres and to any renewal of a contract with a current provider. </p><p>The Standards were published in August 2019 and developed through an Advisory Group including representatives from UNHCR Ireland and the NGO sector. The Standards will come into force in January 2021 and address a range of themes including accommodation; food and catering; individual, community and family life; health and wellbeing; governance; and meeting the special reception needs of applicants. The Standards will ensure that all new accommodation coming on stream must be able to meet the requirements for independent living by the provision of self-catering facilities for residents including a food hall and the availability of separate family spaces outside of bedrooms.  </p><p>The provision of accommodation is demand-led, based on the number of applicants arriving to claim international protection and requiring accommodation. Where the State&rsquo;s accommodation portfolio is not sufficient to meet demand and the tendering process does not identify and bring on stream the required accommodation as quickly as is needed,  we may advertise in the national media for  expressions of interest for the supply of accommodation. The contracts on offer under this process are generally shorter than those available under the tender process. </p><p>Offers made under the Expressions of Interest process are assessed under the following criteria:</p><p>- A good physical environment,</p><p>- Facilities that provide for family life,</p><p>- Cooking facilities for residents, where possible,</p><p>- Location of property and access to public transport,</p><p>- Provision of suitable security arrangements,</p><p>- An open and understanding management structure, and</p><p>- The ability to develop links with the local community to enhance the experience for residents.</p><p>The International Protection Procurement Service (IPPS) in my Department assesses offers of accommodation against these criteria and and against the National Standards and identifies those properties which are the most suitable. </p></reply>

Priority groups include those studying in disciplines that are dependent on in-person small group learning as is the case for ELE and as restrictions ease there is an expectation that there should be greater opportunity to provide increasing levels of small group learning. </p>  <p>  They also acknowledge that education providers will make their own plans for how they move forward based on their own context specific assessments and will communicate them with their students, learners and staff.  Within the plans, the health and safety of students, learners and staff must always come first, with an understanding that they will need to adapt as the situation changes, in line with the public health advice. Every effort must continue to facilitate social distancing and limit congregation, adhering closely to the guidance to safeguard the health and safety of everyone.</p>  <p>  In light of the nature and demands of quality English language education, the need to meet the pedagogical requirements of its students, alongside recognising the serious challenges that have arisen within this sector as it transitioned to online delivery, ELE providers should in Level 3 commence the process of providing English language education in-person and in classroom based settings where it can take place safely and in small groups. This is consistent with the approach being adopted in further and higher education. </p>  <p>  English language education provided on that basis should, therefore, be regarded as encompassed within the priority groups highlighted by the Minister that are dependent on in-person small group learning. However, classroom based provision is only possible once it is safe to do so and is in line with public health guidelines. </p>  <p>Consequently, ELE providers are requested to examine and assess their individual arrangements to provide classroom based learning for small groups in a safe manner. However, it is acknowledged that while some providers, based on their assessments, will decide that it is safe to return to in-person classroom learning, other providers may consider it necessary to develop a structured plan, implementing online or blended learning solutions during this period of Level 3 restrictions, building towards increasing levels of in-person small group learning over time. If such a plan is necessary, it should be notified to the Department of Justice prior to 7 January 2021. </p>  <p>  It is a priority for this sector to urgently develop and put in place the sector specific guidance and protocols required to ensure that in person English language education, safeguards learners, staff and the communities in which providers are located.  Pending the finalisation and implementation of these protocols it is obviously essential that ELE providers continue to strictly comply with the HSA Return to Work Protocol.</p></reply>

Entry to medicine in Irish HEIs is provided through both undergraduate and graduate entry routes.</p>  <p>  Under the Department's Free Fees Initiative, the Exchequer pays tuition fees on behalf of eligible first time undergraduate students attending approved full-time undergraduate courses (including medicine courses). In order to qualify for funding under the Department&rsquo;s Free Fees Initiative, students must meet the criteria of the scheme including previous education attainment.</p>  <p>  Graduate Entry Medicine (GEM) is one of the pathways to study undergraduate medicine. One of the recommendations of the Fottrell report (2006) was the introduction of a new graduate entry medicine programme (GEM). Students pursuing GEM programmes do so as second degree courses and consequently are not eligible for free fees funding or for student grants. </p>  <p>  However, in order to widen access to GEM programmes, and give assistance towards the financial burden on each student pursuing these programmes, the fees of participating EU students are partly subsidised by the State via the HEA. Currently, the subsidy is &euro;11,200 per student (2019/20 academic year) with the balance of fees payable by the student.</p>  <p>  Higher Education Institutions are autonomous bodies and are responsible for their own day-to-day management and operational affairs, including the management of academic affairs. They retain the right to determine their own policies and procedures. The total level of fees to be charged in the case of GEM fees are therefore solely a matter for the relevant institution to determine in line with its own criteria.</p></reply>

Many HEIs also participate in the Higher Education Access Route (HEAR) and Disability Access Route to Education (DARE) schemes which offer places on courses on a reduced points basis to school leavers from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds and students with disabilities. The operation of HEAR and DARE schemes, the number of places available and which courses are covered is a matter for each HEI.</p>  <p>  Apart from the Student Grant Scheme, the Deputy will be aware of the recently announced &euro;168m funding package for the return to education. This package includes a &euro;10m access support package for higher education students. I have approved the allocation of &euro;8.1m of this funding to top up the Student Assistance Fund (SAF). The SAF assists students in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Institutions have the autonomy to maximise the flexibility in the Student Assistance Fund to enable HEIs to support students during the COVID-19 situation. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the third level institution attended. </p>  <p>  Additionally Budget 2021 provides further funding to increase support for the Programme for Access to Higher Education (PATH) access initiative, which seeks to increase participation in Higher Education from the most economically disadvantaged students.</p></reply>

Also, under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998, management of the courts is the responsibility of the Courts Service, which is independent in exercising its functions. </p>  <p>  However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that the wardship list is being conducted by remote hearing, as are all High Court lists, during the current Covid-19 restrictions.  </p>  <p>  All key aspects relating to the management of the list including ensuring the voice of the person is heard, remain in place, while the management platform has changed. These aspects include the appointment of a guardian ad litem if requested or where required, facilitating the ward or respondent (those subject to a wardship application) attending the hearing remotely or in person if requested, and the appointment of an independent solicitor in addition to the guardian ad litem, where the court decides this is necessary. </p>  <p>  I am advised that details of remote hearings are provided to practitioners representing both wards of court and respondents, guardian ad litems where appointed, the wards and respondents if requested and family members.  Where a person wants to travel to the Four Courts and have the hearing conducted in person, this is also facilitated, subject to public health guidelines. Conducting the list remotely ensures the safety of wards and respondents, their families, practitioners and the staff of the Courts staff.</p>  <p>  Section 11 of the Civil Law and Criminal Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2020 provides for remote hearings in civil proceedings.  The provisions in section 11 were developed following detailed discussions with the judiciary and the Courts Service. Remote hearings are an important tool to facilitate the efficient dispatch of court business and are a reform that was recommended in various reports as necessary changes to ensure the effective operation of the courts and to provide a better experience for users of court services.</p>  <p>  Under section 11, a court may direct that any category or type of civil proceedings may be conducted by remote hearing, either of its own motion or on the application of any of the parties. </p>  <p>  A court shall revoke a direction to participate in a remote hearing where, for whatever reason, it would be unfair to any of the parties to do so, or it would be contrary to the interests of justice to do so.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore, section 11 provides that it shall be an offence to interfere with or obstruct the electronic communications employed in the proceedings or to make any recording of the proceedings without the permission of the Court.</p></reply>

At the outset please allow me to apologise for the delay in responding to your questions.</p><p>As you are aware, the Commissioner is responsible for the direction and control of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The Garda Commissioner is also responsible for the day to day management of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which includes operational/road traffic matters.</p><p>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have the facility to perform driver look-ups when engaging with motorists, when they are using the Mobility Data Stations. </p><p>This aids in the capture of the driver licence number at point of detection and using the Fixed Charge Notice (FCN) App allows this number, once captured, to follow the offence until completed, either by payment of fine or completion in Courts. </p><p>As you are aware, under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998, management of the courts is the responsibility of the Courts Service, which is independent in exercising its functions, which include the provision of information on the courts system.</p><p>However, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that a project is underway to provide for electronic transfer of disqualification orders to the relevant agency once the time period to lodge an appeal has passed, and no appeal has been lodged. I am further informed that this project is being progressed under the oversight of the Circuit and District Courts Operations Directorate. </p><p>I understand that this project is being pursued by the Courts Service independently of the work ongoing in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to progress the mobility project. </p><p>I am further advised that manual notices continue to be sent to the Road Safety Authority with details of drivers disqualified. However, the Courts Service has been ready to automate the electronic transfer to disqualification to the National Driver Licence Service and the Road Safety Authority since the end of 2019 and are awaiting confirmation from the Department of Transport that they are able to receive the data in this format.</p><p>Finally, I am informed that, since 1 May 2020, the Courts Service has been sending the manual Court Notices relating to disqualifications to the Road Safety Authority on a weekly basis as opposed to monthly.</p></reply>

It is important to emphasise that it is the Garda rather than the device that makes the detection. Equally, it should be noted that there is not necessarily a correlation between a look-up on a device and a subsequent detection. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the device does not retain incident data locally for security reasons and it is not possible to definitively answer the question as to the exact number of detections of driving while disqualified made using a mobile data station because PULSE does not differentiate between these instances and detections made by other means. </p>  <p>  I am advised by the Garda authorities that statistics are not compiled in such a way as to identify specific numbers of detections or arrests for driving while disqualified (additional powers were provided to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, allowing the arrest of people who drive while disqualified under section 6(b) and (c) of the Road Traffic Act 2014), as this would necessitate a manual trawl of all relevant incidents recorded on PULSE to collate same, which would require a disproportionate expenditure of Garda time and resources.</p></reply>

Since its inception, the Bureau has been at the forefront of fighting organised crime in this jurisdiction and disrupting the activities of criminal gangs by depriving them of ill-gotten assets.</p><p>The Bureau is widely regarded as a best practice model in the context of combating organised crime.  It works closely with law enforcement bodies at national and international levels and continues to relentlessly pursue the illicit proceeds of organised crime activity. The actions of the Bureau send a strong message to criminals and to local communities that profiting from crime will not be tolerated.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that CAB published its Strategic Plan for 2020 to 2023 in July of this year.  The strategic plan describes the structure of CAB and its key programmes of activity to deliver its remit. CAB has trained a nationwide network of asset profilers to identify assets acquired from the proceeds of criminal conduct. The Bureau continues to develop specialist expertise and technology to trace and investigate these assets. It also continues to work closely with international crime investigation agencies, and has successfully targeted proceeds of foreign criminality from countries such as the US and the UK.</p><p>The Criminal Assets Bureau normally conducts training courses for asset profilers twice per year.  For the most part asset profilers are members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na from local divisions and from special units.  In addition, a small number have been trained from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and from the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.</p><p>During 2019, the Criminal Assets Bureau provided Divisional Asset Profiler Training for 100 personnel. Unfortunately, due to Covid19 restrictions, no Divisional Asset Profiler Training took place to date in 2020.However, preparations have been made to provide the Divisional Asset Profiler Training Programme on-line in 2021.  <table>    <tr>       <th>Year </th>       <th>No. of Garda&iacute; who received Divisional Asset Profiler Training</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>100</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>There are currently 446 Gardai, 17 Revenue and 8 Social Welfare Divisional Asset Profilers operating Nationwide.</p></reply>

This is in accordance with the commitment in the Programme for Government to introduce such legislation within the first twelve months.</p>  <p>  As part of this work a comprehensive public consultation has been carried out which included an online survey and an opportunity for stakeholders to make formal submissions. This consultation was conducted to ensure that the Department fully understands the lived experience of those impacted by hate speech and hate crime as well as the views of professionals and other stakeholders in the field. This is necessary to ensure the laws developed are robust, clearly understood and effective.</p>  <p>  I am pleased with the high level of engagement by the public with this important topic and can inform the Deputy that my Department received in the region of 3,800 written responses to the consultation, including more than 175 detailed written submissions.</p>  <p>  In addition to this comprehensive consultation, my Department has also completed comparative research on international best practice on hate crime legislation.</p>  <p>  I expect to publish the report on the public consultation, together with the comparative research on international approaches in the coming days.</p>  <p>  This work will help to ensure that the legislative proposals presented are evidence-based, proportionate and effective, while respecting important rights to freedom of expression and association.</p>  <p>  I intend to bring a General Scheme of new legislation to Government for approval early in 2021.

However, the Directive has since been transposed by S.I. 493 of 2010 without the need to commence Section 36.</p><p>In addition, it is also thought that Section 36 could have created difficulties for Irish shooters returning from trips abroad with their firearms as the firearms concerned may have been considered imports requiring importation licences.</p><p>Accordingly, I will consider whether or not this provision should be repealed.</p></reply>

Licences under the Explosives Act are issued by my Department only for the importation of fireworks which are to be used in organised displays conducted by professional and competent operators.</p><p>There are serious penalties for breaching the legislation relating to fireworks. An example of the penalties faced include a fine of up to &euro;10,000 and up to five years imprisonment if convicted of having fireworks in your possession with intent to sell or supply. Igniting fireworks or throwing an ignited firework at a person or property is also liable to the same severe penalty.

However, for a broad range of reasons, some cases will take longer than others to process.  In some instances, completing the necessary checks, including security checks can take a considerable period of time with the result in some applications taking longer than the average timescale. </p><p>At the end of October there were 23,187 applications being processed at various stages within the system, ranging from those just received by the Citizenship Division to those where a decision has been made but it is not possible to issue an invitation to a ceremony. </p><p>It is very likely that a significant proportion of these applications would have progressed to completion during 2020 if it had been possible for citizenship ceremonies to go ahead.  It should be noted that the Citizenship Division did not suspend the receipt or processing of applications at any stage during COVID-19 restrictions, although processing rates have been negatively impacted by health and safety related restrictions.</p><p>The breakdown of applications by length of time open is as follows: <table>    <tr>       <th>Length of time open</th>       <th>No. of applications</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&amp;lt; 6 months</td>       <td>4,625</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>6 -12 months</td>       <td>5,304</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>12 - 18 months</td>       <td>4,677</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>18 - 24 months</td>       <td>3,202</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&amp;gt; 24 months</td>       <td>5,379</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total</td>       <td>23,187</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Processing timescales can be impacted by incomplete applications having to be returned; further documentation being required from the applicant; where the payment of the required certificate fee is awaited; or if the applicant has not been engaging with the Immigration Service of my Department. In some instances, the input of several government agencies, both within and outside the jurisdiction is needed and the request and receipt of information from these sources can result in delays in processing some applications. Issues can also arise at the final stage of the naturalisation process, for example, where additional information comes to light which is required to be considered before a final decision is taken.</p><p>Additionally a number of issues have impacted on the processing of citizenship applications over the past 12 months.  A High Court case which was subsequently successfully appealed to the Court of Appeal resulted in significant delays last year. This has been compounded by the COVID-19 restrictions which have impacted the delivery of normal services to date this year. The combined impact of the Jones judgement and the COVID-19 disruption has resulted in the loss of over six months processing time.  As a result, the processing timeline for standard applications has increased to 12 months.</p><p>I recently announced that citizenship ceremonies will be temporarily replaced,  while COVID-19 restrictions are in place,  with a requirement for citizenship applicants to sign an affidavit declaring loyalty to the State. Work is at an advanced stage in my Department on the preparation of the necessary regulations under the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 to make provision for this. It is intended that the regulations will be finalised very early in 2021 and information on the new requirements will be posted on the Immigration Service Delivery (ISD) website at that time. </p><p>In addition, work is well advanced on the following suite of measures designed to deal with the current unprecedented level of demand: </p><p>Additional staffing is being assigned to the Citizenship Division and is expected to be in place by year&rsquo;s end. Attendant to this development, restructuring of the organisational structure of the Division is currently underway to ensure optimal customer service delivery. </p><p>The Citizenship website has been significantly revisited with a view to increasing clarity and enhancing the customer . As part of this process, a new online chat conversation application, or &ldquo;Chatbot&rdquo; has just been introduced called Tara. This is providing users with an instant response to frequently asked questions and will mimic real-time text or message exchange with a member of staff. </p><p>Plans for the digitalisation of the naturalisation process are well advanced, in line with my recent announcement to significantly modernise the Justice Sector through increased digital and ICT investment. As part of this process, on-line payments have been trialled for applications from minors and the process is currently being rolled out to adult applications on a phased basis.</p><p>Citizenship Division will also be moving from a paper based transaction model currently utilised with the Garda National Vetting Bureau to a digital platform.

This report is compiled by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, from information provided by all public bodies staffed by civil servants, and gives details of the number of people with a disability employed in the Civil Service. This report is submitted to the National Disability Authority (NDA).</p><p>I wish to inform the Deputy that my Department&rsquo;s 2018 report indicated that 146 out of 2488 employees, or 5.9%, reported having a disability. The 2019 report indicated that 144 out of 2676 employees, or 5.4%, reported having a disability. This exceeds the current 3% target of employment of persons with disabilities set in the Disability Act 2005. Officials in my Department are currently preparing the 2020 return.</p><p>Considerable work is undertaken within my Department to retain staff with disabilities and to improve the quality of their experience within the work environment. Efforts across a range of areas such as role adjustments, redeployment in some cases, additional and specific training, physical work space adjustments and use of assistive technologies have enabled staff within my Department who have a disability to perform effectively in their role and make a meaningful contribution to the work of the organisation. </p><p>My Department follows the Civil Service Code of Practice on the employment of people with disabilities. My Department&rsquo;s Disability Liaison Officer (DLO) is available to assist and support staff with disabilities, in confidence, and their line managers by providing information, guidance, and support, as well as assisting in the provision of reasonable accommodations. My Department will roll out Disability and Autism Awareness training to all staff next year in line with the National Disability Inclusion Strategy 2017-2121.  </p><p>At induction, new entrants are advised in relation to the role of the DLO and how the Department works to facilitate staff with disabilities. If additional training is required to facilitate an individual to meet the job requirements, the Corporate Learning Unit will source the training. My Department has purchased additional assistive technologies, which allow greater access to training and courses conducted within the organisation. All invitations to attend courses specifically ask participants to identify any special requirements.</p><p>The Deputy may also wish to note that my Department takes part in the Willing Able Mentoring (WAM) programme every year. WAM is an initiative of the Association for Higher Education Access and Disability (AHEAD), which offers a six-month paid mentored work experience placement to graduates with disabilities. My Department also participates in the Job Shadow Day initiative, which brings people with disabilities and local employers together for one day in the workplace. </p><p>With regard to the Deputy's question regarding the number or percentage of staff in my Department, this information is provided in tabular format below. <table>    <tr>       <th>-</th>       <th>2018</th>       <th>2019</th>       <th>2020</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Department of Justice</td>       <td>5.9%</td>       <td>5.4%</td>       <td>N/a*</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na** </td>       <td>3%</td>       <td>3%</td>       <td>3%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Courts  Service</td>       <td>3.2%</td>       <td>3.2%</td>       <td>3.3%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Judicial Council</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Legal Services Regulatory Authority</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>3.7%</td>       <td>2.6%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Legal Aid Board</td>       <td>18 staff</td>       <td>7 staff</td>       <td>12 staff</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>* Currently preparing the 2020 return  </p><p>** This figure is an estimation from returns of the Staff Census form, which all Garda Staff employees are furnished with when they are commencing employment within An Garda Sioch&aacute;na.

This plan will have regard to making the most efficient use of available transport resources.&rdquo;  </p>  <p>  Other transport supports available to persons with disabilities in the State include the Free Travel Scheme operated by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection; and CL&Aacute;R funding, approved by the then Minister for Rural and Community Development, to voluntary organisations providing transport for people with significant mobility issues.</p></reply>

The Department has included detailed information under each head to allow for expert input from the Mental Health Commission and the HSE to be provided prior to publication, to allow the Department the opportunity to address any concerns as early as possible in the process. The draft heads of bill propose to extensively amend and update existing mental health legislation, moving from what has been described as a paternalistic approach in existing statute, to a more person centred, human rights-based approach. The Department is currently awaiting further input from the HSE, which is expected in early December and plans to finalise the draft heads prior to submission for internal legal advice, and to the office of the Attorney General, as required, in early 2021.</p>  <p>  A new Part of the Act related to children is being advanced separately, and the Department has approached the HSE, the Mental Health Commission, the Ombudsman for Children and the College of Psychiatrists for their expert opinions on the draft heads. The Department received the Mental Health Commission&rsquo;s initial input in June 2020, and further observations in November. The Department expects to receive submissions from the other stakeholders in early December 2020, and will then finalise the draft heads related to children at the same time as the rest of the heads.</p></reply>

Ophthalmology services are provided throughout all hospital groups in the country, with cataract removal one of the key procedures carried out as part of this specialty.</p>  <p>  A key development in improving access to Ophthalmology services was the opening of a stand-alone high-volume consultant-led cataract theatre by the University of Limerick Hospital Group in Nenagh Hospital in 2018, with the intention that it would facilitate patients from surrounding geographical areas to avail of their treatment there. The impact of such initiatives can be seen in the reduction in the waiting times to access cataract procedures since 2018.

It also recognises that these changes are difficult for many people. However, it is the case at present that many of the things which we have previously taken for granted are no longer accessible in the same way due to the risks that they pose and the ease with which this virus spreads in particular conditions.</p><p>The Government&rsquo;s medium-term Plan Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with COVID-19, sets out Ireland's approach to managing and living with COVID-19, in a range of areas, over a period of 6 &ndash; 9 months.</p><p>The Plan aims to allow society and businesses to operate as normally as possible, while protecting our key priorities of supporting and maintaining health and social care services, keeping education and childcare services open and protecting the most vulnerable members of our communities.</p><p>The Plan consists of 5 levels. Each level sets out what is permitted for social or family gatherings, work and public transport, bars, hotels and restaurants, exercise activities and religious services, at that moment in time. Each level contains a &ldquo;basket&rdquo; of measures which are intended, collectively, to contribute to lowering the risk of transmission of Covid-19 in alignment with the risk level at that time. The set of measures, individually, do not comprise a list of activities or places which are equally safe. Instead, they are &ldquo;baskets&rdquo; of measures which are informed by public health understanding of the disease. </p><p>The number of people allowed to gather in different scenarios in the Government Plan are based on a review of international practice and the judgment of public health experts. It seeks to balance the risks of different types of gatherings against the desire to allow normal activities to proceed in so far as possible. The measures in place for each level reflect the prevailing disease situation and recognise that we can and must prioritise some activities over others. </p><p>Information in relation to the public health measures in place at all levels of the Plan are available at:- .</p><p>With regard to your specific query please refer to the Health Act 1947 (Section 31A - Temporary Restrictions) (COVID-19) (No. 9) Regulations 2020 Regulation (S.I. 560 of 2020), Schedules 1 and 2 for a list of businesses or services that are not permitted under the current restrictions.</p></reply>

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) in accordance with the advice of the World Health Organisation. </p>  <p>  Patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p>  <p>  The HSE continues to optimise productivity through alternative work practices such the use of alternative settings including private hospitals, community facilities and alternative outpatient settings.</p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy is a standardised approach used by the HSE to manage scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures.  It sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists and was developed in 2014 to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. </p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

These services are provided by over 1,400 independent dental practitioners who have a contract with the HSE. I understand that since the beginning of March, 173 dentists have withdrawn from the DTSS and that 58 new applications are being processed. This is within the normal range of fluctuations of dentists participating in the Scheme in recent years. Patients are not assigned a dentist by the HSE but may choose a dentist who participates in the Scheme. The HSE will assist medical card holders in accessing such treatment if required. </p>  <p>  While the interruption to services caused by the current COVID-19 pandemic has led to some delays in the provision of non-emergency care, there are signs that activity levels have been returning to normal in recent months. </p>  <p>  My Department, in conjunction with the HSE and supported by guidance from the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC), is examining the issue of the provision of PPE across all parts of the health service, including health service contractors. My Department has been engaging with dentists throughout the pandemic and is preparing for further engagement on any additional measures to support the oral health of the public during these difficult times.</p></reply>

The HSE worked intensively to put in place a comprehensive, reliable and responsive testing and tracing operation in a very short timeframe.  </p>  <p>  We continue to build agility in our system to meet the increasing community demand, examples of this include the outlined nationwide recruitment campaign for swabbers and contact tracers, standing up temporary swabbing sites and making process improvements to our end to end test and trace system. The current resource model has been stress tested at higher activity levels and can respond quickly to changes in demand.</p>  <p>  The total workforce now includes circa 736 staff working in tracing and circa 976 working in swabbing. Recruitment in testing and contact tracing will continue until the targets of dedicated staff of 800 in contact tracing and 1,000 in swabbing are met. This will also allow remaining redeployed staff to return to their substantive roles. </p>  <p>  We now have on-island capacity to test up to 126,000 people per week, which can be increased to 140,000 per week by utilising available surge capacity. Testing and tracing and the public health advice relating to Covid-19 is kept under continuing review by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET).</p></reply>

It is directed by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) and coordinated by the HSE. Samples are taken by healthcare professionals in healthcare settings, community test centres, workplaces or in the patient&rsquo;s home.</p>  <p>  The current testing strategy in Ireland, based on expert advice, involves laboratory-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques. All testing for COVID-19 as part of the national strategy is currently conducted in the National Virus Reference Laboratory (NVRL), hospital diagnostic laboratories and other designated laboratories overseen by the NVRL.</p>  <p>  These tests are provided free of charge and there is currently sufficient capacity in the system for testing through this pathway. Members of the public are advised to follow the HSE guidance in respect of testing. This is available on the HSE website.</p>  <p>  A national testing strategy has been implemented to ensure that: </p>  <p>  - test results are reported to the relevant stakeholders (for monitoring and surveillance purposes as COVID-19 is a notifiable disease);</p>  <p>  - contact tracing activities are initiated (where appropriate);</p>  <p>  - an incorrect test result does not lead to false reassurance resulting in individuals failing to seek the necessary medical help. During this time, the individual may also unknowingly spread the virus.</p>  <p>  Under the Infectious Disease Regulations (S.I. No. 53/2020 - Infectious Diseases (Amendment) Regulations 2020 which amended the Infectious Diseases Regulations 1981 (S.I. No. 390 of 1981) and the National Testing Strategy, all medical practitioners, including clinical directors of diagnostic laboratories, are required to notify the Medical Officer of Health (MOH) / Director of Public Health of certain diseases, including COVID-19. The MOH also reports such cases onwards to the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC). This is to ensure that test results are reported to relevant stakeholders for monitoring and surveillance purposes and to investigate cases, thus preventing spread of infection and further cases. This requirement also applies to all private testing services who are, therefore, legally obliged to report positive Covid-19 case to the relevant authorities.</p></reply>

It aims to allow society and businesses to be able to operate as normally as possible, while continuing to suppress the virus. The Plan is framed to account for periods during which there is a low incidence of the disease, with isolated clusters and low community transmission, through to situations where there is a high or rapidly increasing incidence, widespread community transmission and the pandemic is escalating rapidly in Ireland and globally. It recognises the need for society and business to be allowed to continue as normally as possible and is designed so that either national or county level restrictions can be applied. Each level outlines what is permitted for social or family gatherings, work and public transport, bars, hotels and restaurants, exercise activities and religious services. </p><p>As I am sure the Deputy can appreciate, COVID-19 spreads when individuals and groups come into close contact with one another, enabling the virus to move from one person to another. COVID-19 is infectious in a person with no symptoms, or for the period of time before they develop symptoms. For this reason, we are all asked to be extra careful when socialising and working with others. For now, we must act like we have the virus to protect those around us from infection.</p><p>The number of people allowed to gather in different scenarios in the Government Framework are based on a review of international practice and the judgment of public health experts. It seeks to balance the risks of different types of gatherings against the desire to allow normal activities to proceed in so far as possible.</p><p>It is advised to socialise safely and within the capacity limits. These various limits in the Levels are all designed to reduce the number of households mixing with each other and cut down the virus&rsquo;s chances of spreading into more homes. </p><p>The Deputy should note that the numbers should not be considered a target - they are the maximum recommended number. It&rsquo;s always safer to meet less people, less often, for less time. If we do this, we have a better chance of keeping to the lower Levels in the Framework, and continuing to keep businesses, schools, and healthcare services open, while also protecting the most vulnerable. </p><p>Ireland is now on level 3 of the framework Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with COVID-19. Details of the public health measures in place for weddings and places of worship from 1 December can be found at . </p><p>Details of the public health measures in place for the Christmas period can be found at <i></i>.</p><p>Guidance for religious services can be found at <i></i>.</p><p>I and my Cabinet colleagues recognise the immense sacrifices that are being made by people across the country at this difficult time. I know that that includes many people who are affected by their inability to attend church in the way they have been used to. However, there has been significant engagement and solidarity from the Catholic Church and other Faiths at all stages throughout this pandemic to ensure the protection of individuals and communities from COVID-19. Indeed, as the Deputy will be aware, the Taoiseach recently met with the leaders of the Catholic Church recently to consider the range of issues relating this matter.</p></reply>

It monitors the health and wellbeing of people living in Ireland. The survey was stopped at the commencement of Covid-19 restrictions as the method of collecting the data (face-to-face) is not compatible with Covid-19 restrictions.  The survey fieldwork has restarted with a new phone questionnaire with an emphasis on living with Covid-19. It includes a module on mental health and suicide. The results will be available next year.</p><p>The CSO has published four rounds of their Social Impacts of Covid-19 in Ireland survey. The survey results provide data on people&rsquo;s lifestyle and wellbeing at various stages of the pandemic and restrictions levels.  </p><p>Results of the surveys can be found on the CSO website:</p><p><i></i></p><p><i></i>.</p><p>Additionally, there have been a number of studies and research conducted by third party organisations, including the National Suicide Research Foundation, Mental Health Reform and an International Covid-19 Psychological Research Consortium. The studies examined the impact of Covid-19 on people&rsquo;s mental health and well-being. Results of these studies can be accessed by contacting the relevant organisation. </p><p>I recognise that the Covid pandemic may increase anxiety levels among the general population. The Government campaigns, &ldquo;In this Together&rdquo; and &ldquo;Keep Well&rdquo;, which encourage and offer practical advice on keeping our physical and mental health well, provide support for dealing with this issue. </p><p>We do not yet fully understand the impact of Covid-19 on mental health, the extent of subsequent supports that may be required and how this will affect longer term demand for services. However, the HSE already has a range of proactive responses for any rise in service need, including online and other telehealth psychosocial supports. The Department and HSE continue to plan for any surge in demand as it arises and as services return to normal provision and capacity, subject to public health advice.</p><p>I am referring this parliamentary question for part answer by the HSE for its input as service provider to the vulnerable groups mentioned. </p></reply>

The HPRA operates the national system for the reporting and recording suspected adverse reactions/events occurring in Ireland associated with the use of medicines. Anyone can report suspected issues relating to the safety of medicines to the HPRA via their online reporting service <i></i>or alternatively via email at medsafety@HPRA.ie.</p><p>The HPRA encourages patients, carers and other members of the public to report suspected adverse reactions (side effects) to it. Healthcare professionals (including, but not limited to, doctors, dentists, pharmacists and nurses) are also encouraged and reminded to report suspected adverse reactions observed in their practice.</p><p>From the time of authorisation of Mifegyne products (which contains the active substance mifepristone) in late 2018, the HPRA has not received any reports of suspected adverse reactions associated with its use.</p><p>From the time of authorisation of MisoOne (which contains the active substance misoprostol) in November 2019, the HPRA received two reports of suspected adverse reactions associated with its use in the context of early medical termination of pregnancy. These reports described muscle spasms, chills, sore throat and asthenia (weakness), consistent with the types of side effects known to occur with misoprostol and described in the approved product information.</p><p>If individuals are concerned that they have suffered a suspected adverse reaction to any medicine, they are encouraged to contact their healthcare professional who can advise them if they will need any additional medical care or treatment. The healthcare professional may report the suspected issue to the HPRA on the patient&rsquo;s behalf, or alternatively, the patient can report the suspected adverse reaction directly to the HPRA themselves.</p><p>Patients are in an ideal position to identify the impact of medicines they have taken, particularly on their quality of life. Systems for patients/consumer reporting are an important tool to facilitate and encourage &lsquo;spontaneous reporting&rsquo;, which in turn contributes to the overall knowledge of the safety of a medicine and the patient experience.</p><p>The patients&rsquo; role in reporting adverse drug reactions is a key element in building an improved system of pharmacovigilance and the participation of patients is now at the core of the new medicines safety monitoring in Europe.</p></reply>

The HSE Drugs Group requested patient and clinician input via the Rare Diseases Technology Review Committee (RDTRC) to assist the group in making its recommendation to the HSE Executive Management Team (EMT) regarding reimbursement of Patisiran.</p>  <p>  The RDTRC convened on 24 September and reviewed the clinical data previously submitted as part of the established pricing and reimbursement process. The Committee also heard from Consultants involved in the specialist management of patients with hATTR amyloidosis.</p>  <p>  The RDTRC continued its review of Patisiran at its subsequent meeting on 5 November which included patient input on the impact of hATTR amyloidosis.</p>  <p>  The RDTRC finalised a statement summarising the clinician and patient engagement on Patisiran which was forwarded to the HSE Drugs Group the week ending 27 November. The HSE has advised that the  Drugs Group is expected to consider Patisiran again to include the output of the Committee early in 2021.</p>  <p>  The application for Patisiran remains under consideration with the HSE and is being assessed in line with the 2013 Health Act.</p></reply>

Underpinned by a core set of principles, the framework is intended to support the recruitment and retention of the right mix of health workers across the health system to meet planned and projected service need.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government Our Shared Future commits to establishing a Workforce Planning Expert Unit to work with the education sectors, regulators, and professional bodies to improve the availability of health professionals and reform their training to support integrated care across the entire health service.</p>  <p>  A Strategic Workforce Planning Unit has been established within my Department to achieve this objective. Effective medium and long-term health workforce planning will be vital to ensure that the introduction of new models of healthcare are planned and managed effectively to ensure that we have the health professionals required to meet future healthcare need.</p></reply>

The amount of vaccine made available for this winter is almost double the amount of vaccine administered last winter. </p>  <p>  Over 1.33 million of the 1.35 million doses of flu vaccine available this winter have been distributed to GPs, pharmacists and other vaccination sites. Deliveries are continuing and stock is expected to be depleted by the end of the year. In addition, over 460,000 doses of the LAIV for administration to children aged from 2 to 12 have been distributed. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the large increase in available vaccine this year, the full supply of QIV may be used, representing an increase of 35% in uptake over last year. At that stage, sufficient stock will have been delivered for an uptake in excess of 80% in the targeted groups. Not all persons eligible under the programme avail of vaccination, and so it is not possible to quantify the number of persons who may still be awaiting vaccination.</p>  <p>  Given the demand on the international market for influenza vaccine, it is not likely to be possible to procure additional supply. As a consequence, from the fourth round of deliveries which started on 23 October, GPs and pharmacists have been asked that of remaining patients in at-risk groups, priority should be given to the over-65s and healthcare workers with direct patient contact, in line with WHO advice. </p>  <p>  As of 3rd December, over 1.1 million claims for reimbursement from GPs and pharmacists for the administration of influenza vaccines have been received by PCERS.  </p>  <p>  The significant increase in uptake among those in the at-risk groups, combined with the addition of vaccination for children aged from 2 to 12, will help reduce the impact of influenza on the community and the health system.</p></reply>

To support people with a disability, significant resources have been invested by the health sector in disability services, and the Government has ensured that an additional &euro;100 million is being provided for new disability measures next year under Budget 2021. These measures will include an additional 80,000 personal assistant hours.  The 2020 national service plan details that the HSE is seeking to deliver 1.67m hours of Personal Assistant Hours to over 2,550 people.</p>  <p>  The Government is working to ensure that People with Disabilities be allowed to live an independent life of their own choosing, the same as any other person, and this is consistent with the disability reform policy - &ldquo;transforming lives&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  The HSE provides a range of assisted living services including Personal Assistant (PA) services to support individuals to maximise their capacity to live full and independent lives.</p>  <p>  Personal Assistance Services are accessed through an application process or through referrals from public health nurses or other community based staff. Individual&rsquo;s needs are evaluated against the criteria for prioritisation for the particular services and then decisions are made in relation to the allocation of resources.</p>  <p>  Resource allocation is determined by the needs of the individual, compliance with prioritisation criteria, and the level of resources available. It is important to note that the level of service delivered is varied to ensure that each client&rsquo;s needs are reflected. Therefore there is no average agreed number of PA hours per person. PA and Home Support Services are provided either directly by the HSE or through a range of voluntary service providers. The majority of specialised disability provision (80%) is delivered through non-statutory sector service providers.</p>  <p>  As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible. </p></reply>

CHI at Crumlin have recommenced the majority of outpatient and diagnostic services, albeit at reduced numbers, due to public health guidelines on social distancing.  Currently, Consultant Rheumatologists are seeing a number of patients in the outpatient suite including urgent patients and those who were deferred during the early phases of COVID-19.  </p><p>CHI has further advised that there is an active recruitment campaign for an additional Rheumatology Consultant underway. This addition to the medical staff will allow for an increased number of patients to be seen, diagnosed and treatment initiated, as part of the comprehensive Rheumatology service.</p><p>In relation to the provision of MRI services, the demand for specialist imaging has increased over recent years due to increased activity and acuity in CHI, as well as an increasing trend to utilise imaging in diagnosis and treatment.  CHI have advised that, uniquely to Paediatrics, younger children and children up to 18 years old with complex needs may be unable to remain still in an MRI for the lengthy periods required to complete the scan, resulting in the requirement for a General Anaesthetic (GA) to be delivered by a Paediatric Anaesthesiologist.  This limits the ability for these scans to be performed outside of CHI hospitals. CHI have confirmed to my Department that each request for an MRI scan is carefully examined by Consultant Radiologists who must prioritise, based on clinical urgency, each case in terms of access to the scanner.  </p><p>CHI has advised that patients with Down Syndrome who present to Rheumatology services with suspicion of arthritis are clinically assessed and diagnosed by the clinical team. A cohort of these patients will require an MRI scan based on the individualised clinical examination and recommendation.  </p><p>With regard to waiting lists for MRI, the HSE advises that a pilot project commenced in 2016 by the HSE Acute Hospitals Division to progress the collection of national radiology waiting list data.  The data is reported quarterly, and the attached table shows the waiting list by time band at CHI at the end of Quarter 3, 2020. Due to the nature of this data the HSE have advised that it is not possible to determine the proportion of the waiting list associated with specific specialties such as Rheumatology diagnosis or treatment.</p><p>In relation to waiting lists for Rheumatology Outpatient appointments and Inpatient and Day Case procedures the tables attached show the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) published figures at the end of October 2020. NTPF waiting lists are collected in respect of outpatient specialties and inpatient/daycase procedures. Waiting times can be examined in terms of the appointment or procedure that a patient is waiting for, however it is not possible to identify patients based on their clinical diagnosis. </p><p><b>Quarter 3 2020 waiting list for MRI at Children's Health Ireland</b> <table>    <tr>       <th><div>0-3 mths</div></th>       <th><div>3-6 mths</div></th>       <th><div>6-9 mths</div></th>       <th><div>9-12 mths</div></th>       <th><div>12-15 mths</div></th>       <th><div>15-18 mths</div></th>       <th><div>18+ mths</div></th>       <th><div>Total</div></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><div>886</div></td>       <td><div>487</div></td>       <td><div>507</div></td>       <td><div>400</div></td>       <td><div>290</div></td>       <td><div>255</div></td>       <td><div>504</div></td>       <td><div>3329</div></td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) for the HSE and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions. The NCPE uses a decision framework to systematically assess a drug's clinical and cost effectiveness as a health intervention.</p><p>The HSE has advised that it received two applications in February 2020 for the reimbursement of Cannabidiol (Epidyolex&reg;):</p><p>1. for use as adjunctive therapy of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome in conjunction with clobazam, for patients two years of age and older.</p><p>2. for use as adjunctive therapy of seizures associated with Dravet Syndrome in conjunction with clobazam, for patients two years of age and older.</p><p>In February 2020, the HSE commissioned the NCPE to complete rapid reviews with respect to each of these indications.  The NCPE recommended full HTAs to assess the clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness of Cannabidiol compared with the current standard of care with respect to each of the above indications. On 16 March 2020, the HSE commissioned full HTAs for both of these indications.</p><p>Applicant submissions are required in order to proceed with commissioned HTAs. In July 2020, applicant submissions were received by the NCPE for both of the above indications and the HTAs are underway.</p><p>These applications will be assessed by the HSE in line with the 2013 Health Act.</p></reply>

Validation is the process whereby hospital administration contacts patients on waiting lists at pre-planned intervals during the year to ensure that patients are ready, willing, suitable and available to attend a hospital appointment or wish to be removed from the waiting list. </p><p>For a number of years validation was conducted at individual hospital level in Ireland but in 2018 the Minister for Health approved the establishment of the National Centralised Validation Unit (NCVU) within the NTPF. The establishment of a centralised function has facilitated the introduction of a standardised approach to validation of waiting lists across hospitals and across IPDC and OPD waiting lists.</p><p>The NCVU advised my Department that the validation of waiting list process, which had been suspended at the end of March due to COVID-19, recommenced on 7th August. Between 1st January and the end of November 2020 a total of 26,539 patients were removed from the Outpatient waiting list as a result of validation.</p><p>In relation to the data requested by the Deputy, the NCVU provided my Department with the attached document which outlines outpatient validation figures by hospital from 1st January to end November. 2020.</p></reply>

This decision was in line with the advice issued by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) in accordance with the advice of the World Health Organisation. CHI has since re-established services, following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols, to ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically aligned and prioritised way.</p>  <p>  Key social distancing measures and Infection Prevention and Control requirements, such as the current two-metre distancing, have material impact on the available physical space to deliver services, significantly impacting on the overall capacity and operational activity levels for inpatient and outpatient settings. However, spinal surgery continues to be identified as a service prioritisation.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible. </p></reply>

In addition, advertisements for e-cigarettes are prohibited on television, on-demand television services and on radio. Finally, any form of contribution to an event, activity or person with the aim of promoting e-cigarettes and with a cross-border effect is also prohibited. The Programme for Government also includes a commitment to curb the advertising of nicotine-inhaling products near schools, on public transport and in cinemas.</p>  <p>  The protection of children is at the heart of Tobacco Free Ireland, Ireland&rsquo;s current tobacco control policy. Measures including the workplace smoking ban in 2004 which brought an end to smoking in restaurants and cafes, prohibitions on the advertising of tobacco products at the point of sale and the introduction of plain packaging, have greatly reduced young people&rsquo;s exposure to tobacco products. Local initiatives, such as Not Around Us in Limerick that promote smoke free environments have sought to further reduce the areas where smoking and vaping are present in daily public life. At a national level, the HSE adopted a Tobacco Free Campus policy for its facilities in 2012, and that was extended to electronic cigarettes in 2014. Under the Tobacco Free Ireland Programme the HSE has held discussions with several Irish universities and colleges a number of which have introduced similar policies for their own campuses. </p>  <p>  The most recent data on smoking among young people in Ireland is from the European Schools Project on Alcohol and other Drugs 2019 Ireland report. The survey was completed by almost 2,000 Irish students aged 15 and 16 years and found that 32% of respondents had tried smoking, 14% were current smokers (reported smoking in the last 30 days) with 5% smoking daily. Separately, the Health Behaviour in School Age Children Study 2018 found that the number of 12-17 year olds who reported having tried smoking dropped by 5%, from 16% in 2014 to 11% in 2018. </p></reply>

Ireland has too small a population to undertake a sufficiently powered randomised lung cancer screening trial.  Multiple randomised trials including the US National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), the Multicentric Italian Lung Detection trial, and results from the Dutch-Belgian NELSON trial have provided evidence that low-dose CT screening can reduce lung cancer mortality.  However, all population cancer screening programmes are associated with both benefits and harms, and lung cancer screening is no different. In the UK and throughout Europe, there remains considerable debate in the research community about whether, when, and how screening should be implemented. </p>  <p>  Most recently, England's National Health Service announced a planned rollout of low-dose CT screening at ten pilot sites. My Department through its attendance at the UK National Screening Committee and through the work of our own National Screening Advisory Committee (NSAC) intends to keep this topic under continuous review and to work collaboratively with our colleagues in the HSE and our counterparts in the UK and Europe to determine the appropriateness of examining the case for lung cancer screening in Ireland.</p>  <p>  I should emphasise that population screening is no substitute for primary prevention which is the key policy initiative in Ireland when it comes to lung cancer. Cigarette smoking is the single biggest risk factor and is responsible for between 80-90 percent of all cases of lung cancer. The best way to prevent lung cancer is to avoid smoking or if someone already smokes to quit. </p>  <p>  In addition to primary prevention the HSE through the National Cancer Control programme has operated rapid access &lsquo;lung cancer&rsquo; clinics since 2012. These provide direct access to Consultant led assessment and diagnostic services for patients with suspected lung disease or cancer. This service was rolled out by The National Cancer Control programme in 2012. </p></reply>

The National Cancer Registry advises that data from 2015-2017 shows that mortality rates for lung cancer were higher in males (40.3/100,000) compared to females (28.4/100,000).</p>  <p>  While cancer incidence and mortality rates are increasing in females and decreasing in males, absolute numbers of lung cancer cases in both sexes are projected to increase significantly by 2035 due to factors including demographic changes in the population, with our increasing and ageing population.  Indeed, increasing lung cancer incidence and mortality rates in females have been observed internationally, with recent academic papers highlighting this as a priority area for future research.</p>  <p>  Work to increase awareness and early detection of lung cancer is being progressed in line with the National Cancer Strategy.  Lung cancer has been chosen as the first cancer on which to focus in a rolling programme of targeted multi-media based public awareness and education campaigns, aimed at the early detection of specific cancers and with particular focus on at-risk populations.  The Lung Cancer Awareness Campaign was scheduled for roll-out in April 2020 but was postponed due to the Covid pandemic.</p>  <p>  Reducing lung cancer incidence and mortality remains a priority under the National Cancer Strategy 2017-2026. The HSE's National Cancer Control Programme (NCCP) is working to increase awareness and early detection of lung cancer, and to increase survival rates. There have been many improvements in cancer treatment and outcomes over the last number of years, driven by initiatives under successive cancer strategies. It is hoped that the targeted lung cancer awareness campaigns referenced above will result in more cancer's being detected earlier, leading to better outcomes for patients.</p></reply>

The Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without due hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself and his or her family, having regard to his or her overall financial position and reasonable expenditure. The issue of granting medical cards based on having a particular disease or illness was previously examined in 2014 by the HSE Expert Panel on Medical Need and Medical Card Eligibility. The Group concluded that it was not feasible, desirable, nor ethically justifiable to list medical conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility. In following the Expert Group&rsquo;s advice, a person&rsquo;s means remains the main qualifier for a medical card.</p>  <p>  However, every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines. The HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income threshold where they face difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness. Social and medical issues are also considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services.</p>  <p>  While it is none the less important to note that eligibility for a medical card remains primarily on the basis of financial assessment, I do recognise that patients require a responsive and efficient health system to meet their medical needs, which may often be required urgently. The HSE therefore has a system in place for the provision of medical cards in response to emergency situations. For example, where persons are in need of urgent or on-going medical care that they cannot afford, medical cards are granted on an emergency basis which are valid for six months with a means test required before the end of this period for the person and their family, where applicable. </p>  <p>  Separately, where the HSE is informed that a patient is receiving end of life treatment &ndash; that is when patients&rsquo; unfortunately have a prognosis of less than 12 months, a medical card is issued within 24 hours of receipt of the required medical report and a completed application form from a healthcare professional. Medical cards awarded on the basis of end of life criteria do not require a means assessment nor are they reassessed.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, since 2015 medical cards are awarded without the need of a financial assessment to all children under 18 years of age with a diagnosis of cancer.</p></reply>

The Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without due hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself and his or her family, having regard to his or her overall financial position and reasonable expenditure. The issue of granting medical or GP visit cards based on having a particular disease or illness was previously examined in 2014 by the HSE Expert Panel on Medical Need and Medical Card Eligibility. The Group concluded that it was not feasible, desirable, nor ethically justifiable to list medical conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility. In following the Expert Group&rsquo;s advice, a person&rsquo;s means remains the main qualifier for a medical card.</p>  <p>  However, every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines. The HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income threshold where they face difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness. Social and medical issues are also considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services. </p>  <p>  Finally, it should be noted that there are currently over 1.5 million medical card holders and approximately 532,000 GP visit card holders.</p></reply>

The amount of vaccine made available for this winter is almost double the amount of vaccine administered last winter.</p>  <p>  Over 1.33 million of the 1.35 million doses of flu vaccine available this winter have been distributed to GPs, pharmacists and other vaccination sites. Deliveries are continuing, no stock is being retained by the HSE and stock is expected to be depleted by the end of the year. In addition, over 460,000 doses of the LAIV for administration to children aged from 2 to 12 have been distributed.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the large increase in available vaccine this year, the full supply of QIV may be used, representing an increase of 35% in uptake over last year. At that stage, the HSE estimates that sufficient stock will have been delivered for an uptake in excess of 80% in the targeted groups. Not all persons eligible under the programme avail of vaccination, and so it is not possible to quantify the number of persons who may still be awaiting vaccination.</p>  <p>  Given the demand on the international market for influenza vaccine, it is not likely to be possible to procure additional supply. As a consequence, from the fourth round of deliveries which started on 23 October, GPs and pharmacists have been asked that of remaining patients in at-risk groups, priority should be given to the over-65s and healthcare workers with direct patient contact, in line with WHO advice. </p>  <p>  As of 3rd December, over 1.1 million claims for reimbursement from GPs and pharmacists for the administration of influenza vaccines have been received by PCERS.</p>  <p>  The significant increase in uptake among those in the at-risk groups, combined with the addition of vaccination for children aged from 2 to 12, will help reduce the impact of influenza on the community and the health system.</p></reply>

Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/262, which came into effect on 1 January 2016, lays down the rules governing the identification of equidae. This legislation was transposed into national legislation in Ireland via the European Union (Identification of Equidae) Regulations (S.I. No 62 of 2016)(as amended).</p><p>Proper identification is comprised of four elements, all of which must be in place within twelve months of the date of birth of the animal. These comprise:</p> <blockquote> 	- a single lifetime identification document (passport)  containing a unique lifetime identification number (UELN) in respect of the animal, issued by an approved Passport Issuing Organisation (PIO); <br /><br />- all equines issued with a passport since 1<sup>st</sup>July 2009 must have a corresponding microchip inserted, by a practicing veterinary surgeon, the unique number of which is recorded on the corresponding passport to ensure an unequivocal link between the animal and the identification document;<br /><br />- a database recording of specific identification data in the database of the PIO that issued the passport; and <br /><br />- a database entry in the central equine database of the country where the issuing PIO is approved. </blockquote>  <p>In addition, persons in charge of any premises in which equines are kept are required to register their premises with my Department and to maintain records to assist the Department in tracing horses, should a disease outbreak occur. Furthermore, as part of the identification process for equines resident in Ireland, an owner/keeper who applies to have their horse identified is requested to provide the premises registration number of the holding where the animal will be normally resident to the issuing PIO.</p><p>The Equidae (Transfer of Ownership) Regulations 2016 (S.I. No 201 of 2016) governs the transfer of ownership of equine animals and requires that transfer of ownership details be notified to the relevant PIO and the central database within 30 days of date of transfer.</p><p>My Department continues to dedicate a substantial level of resources and funding to animal welfare. In December 2019, the largest ever allocation of funding from my Department of &euro;2.906m to 106 animal welfare organisations was announced.  A number of other organisations undertake work with equines. I will make an announcement of funding for 2020 shortly.</p><p>The Programme for Government also contains commitments to provide additional urban horse welfare programmes. My Department continues to take a proactive approach in tackling challenges by developing facilities for urban and Traveller horse populations and in educating young people among these communities in the care and welfare of horses. This work is carried out in close collaboration with the local authorities, and will be reflected in the new Animal Welfare Strategy which I will launch shortly.</p><p>My Department continues to support a number of urban horse projects nationwide, bringing education on all aspects of equine welfare to disadvantaged areas. As an example, the DSPCA with financial assistance from my Department, continues to facilitate castration and ID clinics and education programmes in an effort to address the problem of over-breeding which can add to welfare issues.</p><p>The Control of Horses Act, 1996 is currently under review within my Department and plans for replacement legislation are well advanced.  My Department will be further engaging on this with stakeholders at an early date. Under the Act, local authorities may take a range of actions in relation to equines including prohibiting horses in certain areas, the issuing of licences, the seizure of horses in contravention of the Act.  These powers can be used in respect of straying horses which includes horses put on land without the owner&rsquo;s permission, including public land.  The local authorities may also prosecute offenders under the Control of Horses Act.  While still at an unacceptable level, the overall numbers of equines seized have been falling year-on-year from a high of approximately 5,000 in 2014 to less than 900 in 2019.</p><p>My Department continues to support other agencies and local authorities in the enforcement of horse welfare related matters.</p><p>The Deputy may be aware that my Department operates a confidential animal welfare helpline through which members of the public can report incidents of animal cruelty or neglect for investigation. If the Deputy wishes to pass on details of any cases of alleged neglect or cruelty that she is aware of, they will be fully investigated by my Department and appropriate actions, up to and including prosecution, may be taken.</p><p>The dedicated e-mail address and Helpline in place for reporting suspected cases of animal welfare are:</p> <blockquote> 	Helpline Phone No. Call Save - 0761 064408, phone - 01 607 2379 and the email address -<i>animalwelfare@agriculture.gov.ie</i>. </blockquote></reply>

This is compared to only five stocks in 2009. This is clear evidence of progress through the CFP and the shared aim of sustainable fishing.</p>  <p>  The report implies that Ireland deliberately sought to have TACs set in excess of the scientific advice and attempted to ignore or downplay the specific circumstances of each stock. These findings do not reflect the complexity of fisheries management and the TAC-setting mechanisms and the relationship to scientific advice.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s goals for sustainable fisheries are supported through the CFP. The CFP provides the framework for the long-term conservation and sustainability of fish stocks around our shores and is designed to ensure the long-term sustainability of fishing in Ireland and throughout EU waters. The CFP utilises the best scientific advice as a key determinant in setting annual fishing quotas.</p>  <p>  The European Commission makes proposals each year for TAC levels for each stock, these are based on formal advice received from the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas (ICES), the independent international body with responsibility for advising on the state of fish stocks. It also takes account of the views of the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF), which gives the Commission its views on the economic, technical and social impacts of the scientific advice. The TAC&rsquo;s are adopted by the EU Council which involves all Member States and the European Commission, not just Ireland. The vast majority of stocks in which Ireland has an interest are shared with other Member States and each has their own views and concerns.</p>  <p>  At last year&rsquo;s December Council, TACs and quotas were agreed for 47 stocks of interest to Ireland. For 32 target stocks, the TACs for 2020 were set at or below the scientific advice where available, meeting MSY criteria. For four vulnerable stocks of interest to Ireland, where the advice was for no fishing, restrictive TACs and quotas were set. This allows for unavoidable by-catches of these stocks, in circumstances where they are part of mixed fisheries. The Council also agreed to very small TACs and quotas to allow for the collection of scientific data for three depleted herring stocks. For the eight  remaining stocks, it was agreed to set precautionary quotas considering the scientific advice available, and the status of many of these as minor by-catches. </p>  <p>  In November, I launched a public consultation on the European Commission&rsquo;s proposal for 2021 fishing opportunities and the scientific advice for stocks as part of my Sustainability Impact Assessment.  Each year, in order to inform Ireland&rsquo;s approach to the December Fisheries Council, an assessment of the potential impacts of the Commission proposal undertaken.  To facilitate the assessment, an open consultation process is carried out, whereby stakeholders may submit comments and observations.  I also met with stakeholders, including environmental NGO&rsquo;s, on 26 November to further discuss the proposal.  The Sustainability Impact Assessment, which is informed by the scientific and technical experts of the Marine Institute and BIM and the views received from stakeholders, was presented to the Oireachtas and I discussed the issues and concerns with the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture and the Marine last week, in advance of the negotiations on TACs and quota setting for 2021.  The negotiations this year will involve EU negotiations with the UK in respect of shared stocks.   </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government sets down an ambitious programme of actions that promote a sustainable seafood industry, technical measures that promote sustainability, decrease by-catch and protect fish stocks for the future,  aggressively tackle the issue of waste in our seas,  work to eliminate illegal fishing and promote a culture of compliance.</p>  <p>  I am committed to working to continue to build on the progress that has been made to secure a sustainable future for our fishing industry and the coastal communities which depend upon it. </p></reply>

In Ireland, some 5% of farmers are under 35 years and 30% are over 65 years. Demographic challenges for the agriculture sector are not unique to Ireland and generational renewal is also a priority at EU level and an objective of the Common Agriculture Policy (CAP).</p>  <p>  There are a range of supports in place to support young farmers and assist succession and the early inter-generational transfer of farms, both through the CAP and through national taxation measures.</p>  <p>  The age limit for young farmer supports under CAP, which is set down in the relevant EU Regulations, is 40 years. There is no discretion for Member States on this requirement.  </p>  <p>  A number of important national agri-tax reliefs are subject to an age limit of 35 years. These were mostly established when the previous CAP definition was also 35 years.</p>  <p>  While taxation policy is primarily the responsibility of the Minister for Finance, our two Departments work closely to ensure it is consistent with the Government's priorities for the agri-food sector. The Department of Finance&rsquo;s Tax Strategy Group paper on stamp duty published earlier this year commits to further examination of this issue in collaboration with my Department, while noting there may be valid policy reasons for the application of differing age limits to tax reliefs and grant schemes targeted at the sector. </p></reply>

The methodology utilized in this assessment has undergone a peer-review process. </p>  <p>  The European Commission's proposal is informed by the scientific advice on the various fish stocks published by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES), which advises the catches that can be taken for a given stock at the level of maximum sustainable yield (MSY).  Fishing at MSY for a given fish stock means the highest possible annual catch that can be sustained over time, by keeping that stock at the level producing maximum growth. </p>  <p>  The outputs from an assessment that predicted over and beyond the European Commission&rsquo;s proposal, while technically possible, would be extremely difficult given the inherent complexities involved. Modelling mixed fisheries involving multiple species and different fleets from Member States, as pertain in the waters around Ireland, all being fished at MSY would be challenging and highly uncertain.  MSY estimates are not static in time. Achieving single species MSY in complex and dynamic fisheries targeting multiple species is challenging because achieving the objective for one species may mean missing the objective for another. MSY is rarely, if ever, attainable simultaneously for all species. Therefore, a predictions model based on all stocks being fished at MSY is likely to be unrealistic and potentially misleading, containing such degrees of uncertainty as to make them unusable in policy making. </p></reply>

No case of HPAI H5N8 has been confirmed in poultry flocks or other captive birds. The individual wild bird findings serve as a reminder that the avian influenza virus is currently circulating in the wild bird population in Ireland. The virus can spread from the wild bird population to poultry farms, through direct contact and in particular through faeces from wild birds infected with the virus. This poses a risk to our poultry flocks and industry.</p><p>On the 1<sup>st</sup>December, I introduced two Statutory Instruments under the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013. These regulations require flock keepers to apply particular bio-security measures for poultry and other captive birds as a precautionary measure against Avian Influenza.

However, my Department is aware of a shipment of animal feed ingredients, due to dock in Waterford last Friday 4th December 2020, to which  a new 25% EU tariff would apply. </p>  <p>  This tariff arises on foot of a recent EU decision to apply tariffs on certain exports from the US to the EU on foot of a WTO ruling in relation to the payment by the US of subsidies to aircraft manufacturer Boeing. It follows the imposition by the US in late 2019 of tariffs on EU exports of similar products following an earlier WTO ruling in relation to the payment of EU subsidies to Airbus. </p>  <p>  The current trade tensions between the US and the European Union are a matter of concern, given the importance of EU-US bilateral trade to the Irish food and drink industry. I believe, ultimately, that a negotiated settlement is the preferred way to address this current dispute, as a further escalation would not serve the interests of either the EU or USA. I hope that this will be the case, and that we continue to see the benefits of free trade for manufacturers and consumers, both in the USA and in the EU.   </p></reply>

It was provided in light of the difficult circumstances that Irish beef farmers had been facing as a result of the market volatility and uncertainty.  One of the conditions under which the  support of &euro;50 million was granted by the EU was that there had to be an element of reduction or re-structuring built in to the scheme. In return for the payment of exceptional aid, participants agreed to reduce the production of bovine livestock manure nitrogen on their holding by 5% for the period 01 July 2020 to 30 June 2021 as compared with the period 01 July 2018 to 30 June 2019.</p>  <p>  Obligations under the measure were developed based on analysis of the herd profile and nitrates profile of the national herd.  It was designed, in consultation with farmer representative organisations, to make the measure as easy to participate in as possible whilst maintaining the requirement under the implementing regulation for temporary market adjustments.  Since 2019, 33,445 farmers have received some &euro;77.72M as part of the scheme. </p>  <p>  It is not intended to amend the scheme requirement because the exceptional aid was granted to Ireland on the basis of this nitrogen reduction being implemented.  However, my Department continues to put in place supports for farmers to assist them in managing their commitments under the Scheme, and my Department will shortly be writing to all BEAM applicants in this regard.  </p></reply>

The role of the VCI does not extend to examining funding mechanisms relating to the establishment or acquisition of veterinary practices. </p><p>A function of the VCI is  to manage the registration of veterinary premises. A Certificate Of Suitability (COS) issued by the VCI, attesting that a premises is of a requisite standard, is required before any veterinary service to the public may begin at and from that premises. The COS may only be held in the name of a registered person. The regulations relating to that certificate are one of the means by which the council regulates veterinary services to the public. </p><p>I am not aware of any evidence which identifies that different ownership arrangements of veterinary practices impacts on the service provided to the farming community.</p></reply>

This means there is a constant turnover of applications and a worklist which has these applications at various stages of processing. We update our weekly licencing output to stakeholders through a dashboard. </p>  <p>  There are approximately 4,700 forest licence applications currently in the system, at various stages of processing. </p>  <p>  Of these, approximately 2,000 have been referred to ecologists for an appropriate assessment, and a backlog has built up over the last 18 months. This worklist of approximately 2,000 files is being dealt with by means of a dedicated project plan which was shared with the stakeholders on its publication in July.</p>  <p>  Generally, the remainder of licence applications that do not require an appropriate assessment are not subject to the delays currently being experienced with licences requiring ecology input. </p>  <p>  To date this year, we have issued 2,330 licences. 570 of these licences have issued since the introduction of the new Forestry legislation at the beginning of October. </p>  <p>  My Department's overall approach to tackling the backlog of applications is subject to continuous improvement and review with the aim of increasing the output of licences on a weekly basis. At the beginning of the year, there were just two ecologists working on the backlog of applications referred to ecology but this figure is now 16. Additional forestry inspectors have also been hired to support this work. This delivered increased output in October and November compared to other months this year. While this still has some considerable way to go, I am encouraged by this progress and intend to sustain and build on this output of licences issued each week. </p>  <p>   </p></reply>

All reports are fully investigated by RC&Eacute; welfare staff.</p><p>The full utilisation of the Exclusion Order process whereby a party can be excluded from being on a greyhound racing track.  </p><p>The updating of the Code of Practice for the Care and Welfare of the Greyhound which has been the subject of a public consultation process.  The Code is provided for under Section 6 of the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011.</p><p>The continuing of an intense testing regime both at race events and through out of competition testing.  The urine sampling regime has been expanded in 2020 to also cover on a periodic basis blood sampling.  Work is also underway in terms of the necessary protocols to implement further enhancements of the testing regime through hair sampling.</p><p>RC&Eacute; implemented a Covid-19 Care Payment Scheme during the period of suspension of racing activity from March to June 2020.  Some &euro;998,000 was paid under the scheme to ensure that the welfare needs of the racing greyhound were met during a period when racing activity was suspended.</p><p>In addition, as part of the conditions attached to the allocation of the Horse &amp;amp; Greyhound Racing Fund RC&Eacute; is obliged to commit 10% of the fund towards welfare and integrity measures.  This would include measures in relation to regulation, testing, laboratory and other aspects of activity that will improve the welfare and integrity approach of RC&Eacute;.  </p><p>The entire allocation to Horse Racing Ireland under the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund relates to animal welfare on the basis that a healthy industry which values its participants will always have the best welfare outcomes. </p><p>While owners have direct responsibility for the care and well-being of their horses, they do so as participants in a vibrant industry which requires the animals to be healthy and well looked after. Distribution of funding to prize money, racecourse facilities, integrity services etc directly contributes to the care of horses.  </p><p>Money is allocated to the Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board, the Irish Equine Centre, the Irish Horse Welfare Trust which directly improves the care and welfare of horses, while funding provided for stable staff is also linked to good standards of care for horses.</p></reply>

The Standards were validated by the Irish National Accreditation Board under the Bord Bia ISO17065 schedule and approved by the EU Commission under the Technical Directive 2015/1535. There are both producer and Processor members. </p><p>In relation to processors, the Grass Fed Standards set out requirements for the processing industry for certification under the Standards. Any processor wishing to become a member must be a certified member of the Bord Bia Meat Processor Quality Assurance Scheme and a verified member of the Origin Green Programme and must, in addition, be certified to the Grass Fed Beef Standard.  </p><p>Prospective processor members must demonstrate sufficient and relevant IT capacity and systems on application. Any costs associated with upgrades must be borne by the applicants. Bord Bia will provide guidance to the IT services of those organisations where required.</p><p>At farm level, the Grass Fed Standards are bound up with the requirements of the Bord Bia Sustainable Beef and Lamb Assurance Scheme (SBLAS) and the Sustainable Dairy<b></b>Assurance Scheme (SDAS).  Agridata and Capita Customer Solutions were selected as independent auditor bodies for farm audits following a public procurement process in 2017. During the course of an on-farm audit, they use data collected to determine if it meets the grass fed regulations, largely utilising existing feeding and housing data recorded as current requirements of the two schemes. On-farm audits are scheduled to take place normally at 18 months duration. </p><p>As the Dairy Grass Fed Standard was launched in May 2020 and the Beef Grass Fed Standard in October 2020, the issue of previous years does not arise. </p><p>The Standards are publicly available on Bord Bia&rsquo;s website <i>www.bordbia.ie</i>.</p></reply>

Encouragingly, exports to our more traditional and existing markets such as other EU Member States exceeded &euro;4 billion in 2019, for the third year running. Notably strong growth was evident in pigmeat, poultry and dairy exports to the EU, with export values increasing to the Netherlands, Italy and Spain in particular. </p>  <p>  On the more practical and immediate issue of transiting the UK in order to continue to access markets, firstly I recognise that the UK landbridge is of huge importance in accessing the EU Single Market, and that we may see severe delays in its operation after the end of the transition period. However, goods moving directly between Ireland and elsewhere in the EU will not be subject to any new procedures. </p>  <p>  I would therefore urge traders currently using the UK landbridge to consider direct sailings as an alternative. Ferry operators have indicated that capacity is available on direct routes as is evidenced by the recent announcement of a new service with daily sailings from Rosslare to Dunkirk. This is also the view of the Department of Transport and the Irish Marine Development Office. I would encourage early engagement between all parties - traders, hauliers and the ferry companies - to discuss their needs and options. </p></reply>

I have had good engagement with key retail and food service customers in Britan, and I know that Ireland's reputation for safe, quality assured grass-fed beef is valued by those customers and by British consumers in general. </p>  <p>   Market diversification efforts have been stepped up considerably by my Department since the Brexit vote in order to mitigate the potential impact of trade disruptions.  Market access or enhanced access for beef has been achieved with a number of third countries in this period including USA, China, Japan, Singapore, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Qatar.  </p>  <p>  My Department and Bord Bia have led trade missions to key European and international markets, and that effort is continuing, albeit for the moment in terms of 'virtual' trade missions. Bord Bia's funding has been increased to allow for greater investment in market insight and development in priority markets. My own Department's network of agricultural attach&eacute;s has similarly increased, particularly in Asia, where we now have attach&eacute;s in the Embassies of Ireland in Beijing, Tokyo and Seoul. </p>  <p>  As a result of Brexit uncertainty, exceptional aid payments direct to beef farmers and additional beef schemes were made available in 2019 and 2020. </p>  <p>  My Department has put in place financial and budgetary measures to help the agrifood and fisheries sectors meet the Brexit challenges they have faced to date. These measures were aimed at enhancing competitiveness and market and product diversification and included low cost loan schemes, supports for Bord Bia and Teagasc, direct aid for farmers and capital funding for the food industry.</p>  <p>  The Government's Brexit Readiness Action Plan makes it clear that further measures to support businesses and affected sectors will be considered in the coming months.</p>  <p>  The Brexit Adjustment Reserve announced by the European Union will be an important additional support for those adjusting to the new reality of trading with the UK as a third country. Every effort will be made to ensure that the agrifood sector gets a fair allocation from this Reserve that is commensurate with the impact on the sector.</p></reply>

This has continued in 2020 with further increases in herd incidence and reactor numbers observed. Herd incidence (on a 12-month rolling basis) has breached 4% for the first time since 2012 and reactor numbers have exceeded 20,000 &ndash; the highest number since 2009.  These trends highlight the need for urgent action by all stakeholders to manage the risk more effectively across all transmission routes.  </p>  <p>  Whilst the immediate trends are disappointing and worrying, good progress has been made over the past decade. During 2009, 5,860 herds were subject to restriction whilst the number in 2019 was 4,060.  By working together, we have made progress before and we can do so again.</p>  <p>  The next TB Forum meeting scheduled for Tuesday 8 December is to further develop a shared understanding of how collectively we can reduce TB incidence.  My Department remains committed to reducing and ultimately eradicating TB in Ireland as demonstrated by the recent sanctioning of an additional 16 officers to assist the TB Programme. Attaining TB-free status remains critical from a farm family profitability and sustainability perspective and from a trade perspective at national and at international level. I am acutely conscious that every TB restriction represents a significant challenge to the farm family concerned.</p>  <p>  It is a deep regret that today over 2,700 herds are currently restricted which represents a 21% increase on the same time last year. I want to work with all stakeholders in ensuring fewer herdowners experience the challenges associated with a TB restriction and that we work purposefully towards eradication of this disease, thus eliminating this on-going cost on farmers and the State.</p></reply>

While TB disease is low relative to historical levels, the number of new restrictions and reactor numbers have been gradually increasing since 2016. The pace of deterioration has accelerated in 2020. </p><p>The reasons for the increased TB incidence in the herds in these areas are multi-factorial and require a range of measures to address the issue. Within each county the TB programme focuses on wildlife, how disease is distributed in the area, contiguous programmes, gamma interferon testing, cleansing and disinfection, testing compliance and frequency and isolation of reactors. Each TB outbreak is investigated by a veterinary inspector to identify the source of infection.

This is reflected in the fact that 9% of export value is now accounted for by international markets. </p>  <p>  My Department and Bord Bia have led trade missions to key European and international markets, and that effort is continuing, albeit for the moment in terms of 'virtual' trade missions. Bord Bia's funding has been increased to allow for greater investment in market insight and development in priority markets. My own Department's network of agricultural attach&eacute;s has similarly increased, particularly in Asia, where we now have attach&eacute;s in the Embassies of Ireland in Beijing, Tokyo and Seoul. </p>  <p>  My Department has put in place financial and budgetary measures to help the agrifood and fisheries sectors meet the Brexit challenges they have faced to date. These measures were aimed at enhancing competitiveness and market and product diversification and included low cost loan schemes, supports for Bord Bia and Teagasc, direct aid for farmers and capital funding for the food industry.</p>  <p>  The Government's Brexit Readiness Action Plan makes it clear that further measures to support businesses and affected sectors will be considered in the coming months.</p>  <p>  The Brexit Adjustment Reserve announced by the European Union will be an important additional support for those adjusting to the new reality of trading with the UK as a third country. Every effort will be made to ensure that the agrifood sector gets a fair allocation from this Reserve that is commensurate with the impact on the sector.</p></reply>

This represented 9.9% growth by value and 12.4% growth by volume compared to 2018.  CSO figures show that dairy exports, which account for 37% of agri-food exports year-to-date, are up by &euro;31m or 0.8% in value to the end of September 2020. This is an excellent performance in light of the difficulties markets have faced this year.  </p>  <p>  Irish dairy products have a highly-rated and hard-earned reputation in terms of quality, safety and sustainability, and this gives them a competitive edge in markets over the world. My Department&rsquo;s ongoing market access activities are focused on the development of new non-EU markets and the retention and enhancement of existing markets. Bord Bia, operating under the aegis of my Department, also play a key role in developing markets through market monitoring, and ongoing trade missions. </p>  <p>  Recently, along with Minister of State Heydon, I participated in a series of 'virtual' dairy-focused trade missions, organised by Bord Bia, to five key markets in South East Asia. Engagement with our trading partners will continue into the future with the goal of enhancing global market share of Irish dairy produce.</p>  <p>  While Brexit will bring particular challenges for the Irish dairy sector in 2021, the long-term fundamentals of the global dairy market are strong, with growing global demand projected from developing economies with increasing middle classes and growing demands for protein. There is continued confidence that the Irish and EU dairy sector is well placed to gain from the opportunity presented by expanding global demand. My Department has engaged and will continue to engage with stakeholders on these and other important issues.</p></reply>

My Department further supports the seed potato sector through the production of High Grade seed material in the Tops potato facility in Donegal where capacity will be expanded in 2021. In addition DAFM has a nationwide seed certification team to ensure the production of high-grade seed with the capacity to deliver on additional acreage and the laboratory capacity required underpinning that certification process. The certification scheme includes a programme of soil and tuber sampling and testing for pest and disease control. This high quality disease-free seed is made available to the industry for further multiplication and supply to commercial growers and for export. </p>  <p>  I am firmly of the view that post-Brexit there will be significant opportunities to increase the production and supply of Irish grown seed potatoes to replace UK imports.  My Department has engaged directly with industry and other stakeholders in raising awareness around the potential implications and opportunities inherent in any prohibition on the importation of seed potatoes from Great Britain from 1 January.</p></reply>

The past decade has seen ever increasing levels of poultry meat production, with the annual slaughter figure rising by 20% to reach 106 million head and the tonnage of production rising by 20% to reach 160,800 tonnes in 2019.  Ireland exports poultry to over 30 countries worldwide. </p>  <p>  The overall value of Irish poultry exports increased by 12% between 2016 and 2019 (&euro;294 million). The value of poultry going to third country markets almost doubled in the same period. In 2019 the UK remained the single biggest destination market for Irish poultry exports, with South Africa the second most important destination accounting for 10% in vlaue and 22% in volume of poultry exports. This is positive evidence of increasing diversification.</p>  <p>  As in other meat sectors, global trade conditions will be crucial in determining the outlook for the Irish poultry sector over the medium to longer term. While the outlook for the sector remains broadly positive, the sector continues to face challenges including the ongoing uncertainty around Covid-19 and Brexit. Ensuring the continued operation of Irish food supply chains and expanding market access remain key priorities for my Department.</p></reply>

This represents almost 52% of total export value for the sector.  </p>  <p>  However, third country markets, which have been steadily expanding in recent years, rose to 29% of total share in 2019. This is illustrated by the significant expansion in Ireland&rsquo;s pig meat exports to Asia, and to China in particular, where export values more than doubled from &euro;79m to &euro;177m.</p>  <p>   Irish pigmeat can be exported to a broad range of international markets including, Australia, Canada, China, Japan, South Korea, and the USA. In May of this year the opening of the Mexican market for Irish pigmeat was announced. With a population of more than 120 million, the Mexican market represents a substantial opportunity for Irish pigmeat exports.  </p>  <p>  The short-term outlook for the pigmeat market will be influenced by global supply and demand dynamics as well as by potential COVID-19 disruption to supply chains.

These latter are among the recipients of substantial ex-gratia funding provided by my Department to underpin important work done by animal welfare organisations.</p>  <p>This work is further underpinned by the Animal Welfare Helpline which my Department operates, Lo-call  0761 064408 , along with a dedicated email address, AnimalWelfare@agriculture.gov.ie, which facilitates the reporting by members of the public of concerns in regard to the welfare of animals.  All calls received are treated in confidence. The animal welfare hotline exists for the reporting of specific incidents relating to animal welfare which come to the attention of members of the public, which they believe are in need of attention.

In December 2019, my Department delivered the largest ever allocation of funding of &euro;2.906m to 106 animal welfare organisations, many of which undertake work with equines.</p>  <p>  In the area of horse racing, the IHRB has authorised Officers under the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 who monitor the welfare of this sector. </p>  <p>  My Department also continues to support a number of urban horse projects nationwide, bringing education on all aspects of equine welfare to disadvantaged areas, and I intend to deliver additional supports in urban areas. As an example, in the context of breeding, the DSPCA with financial assistance from my Department, facilitates castration clinics and education programmes in an effort to address the problem of over-breeding which can add to welfare issues. </p>  <p>  Under the Control of Horses Act 1996, local authorities may take a range of actions in relation to equines including prohibiting horses in certain areas, the issuing of licences, and authorised officers may seize horses in contravention of the Act.  These powers can be used in respect of stray horses, including horses put on land without the owner&rsquo;s permission, including public land.  The local authorities may also prosecute offenders.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that my Department operates a confidential animal welfare helpline through which members of the public can report incidents of animal cruelty or neglect for investigation.</p>  <p>  The dedicated e-mail address and Helpline in place for reporting suspected cases of animal welfare are:  </p>  <p>  Helpline Phone No: Call Save - 0761 064408, phone - 01 607 2379.  </p>  <p>  Email address - animalwelfare@agriculture.gov.ie</p></reply>

In the last few years, my Department has, as a matter of policy increased the number of placements it has made available under the WAM programme. Many former participants of the programme have gone on to secure permanent employment in the Civil Service.  </p><p>My Department has participated in the Job Shadow Initiative on a continuous basis since 2009.  Job Shadow Day is a national project, bringing people with disabilities and local employers together for one day to promote equal employment opportunities </p><p>In accordance with my Department&rsquo;s Diversity, Equality and Inclusion policy, my Department explores initiatives with a view to increasing workplace opportunities for persons with disabilities. One very successful initiative has been collaboration with the Oireachtas on the Oireachtas Work Learning programme (OWL), a learning, development and socialisation programme for young adults with an intellectual disability. The programme aims to provide a real and applied learning experience to the participants in a safe and secure work environment, to support them in developing the skills which will lead them to access paid employment in the open labour market.</p><p>On the question of  retention, if an employee acquires a disability, or an employee&rsquo;s existing disability becomes more severe, my Department offers assistance on request and will provide reasonable accommodations to support and facilitate these staff members remaining in employment and having access to training programmes and opportunities for career progression. </p><p>The question of employee numbers and disability initiatives in the State Bodies under the aegis of my Department is a matter for the Agencies themselves.  This information has been requested from the State Bodies in question and the information will be forwarded to the Deputy directly.</p></reply>

Carlow and 6 in Co. Kilkenny.  Many of the BCPs will provide capacity for remote working and remote study in rural areas.  In 2020, my Department provided &euro;66,780 through the Town and Village Renewal Scheme to develop infrastructure in BCPs in Co. Carlow.</p>  <p>  An additional &euro;5 million has been allocated in 2021 for targeted investment in digital hubs and BCPs through the Town and Village Renewal Scheme. This funding will assist these facilities to become a focus for communities and support remote workers and students.  Details of the funding scheme will be announced in 2021.  It is anticipated that it will be open to all Local Authorities, including Carlow and Kilkenny County Councils.  </p>  <p>  The ecosystem of hubs and other remote working facilities throughout the country are a significant support to both remote workers and students at the present time. They cover the spectrum from fully commercially-operating business models, to public sector and social enterprise operated hubs. </p>  <p>  There is great potential for new hubs to be located in town centres to revitalise the commercial and social life of key towns and to utilise or repurpose vacant buildings.</p></reply>
