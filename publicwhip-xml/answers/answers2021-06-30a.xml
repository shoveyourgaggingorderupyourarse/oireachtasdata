The Government will work with the Executive in Northern Ireland, the British Government and other partners to deliver cross-border investments that enhance our shared island.</p>  <p>  To support development of a more ambitious agenda for co-operation and connection on the island, the Shared Island unit in my Department has commissioned a comprehensive research programme, working with the ESRI, the National Economic and Social Council, the Irish Research Council and other partners. Research will be published through this year and next, focused on needs and opportunities to deepen co-operation across a range of economic, social and environmental domains.</p>  <p>  I have initiated the Shared Island Dialogue series to foster inclusive, constructive civic dialogue, that engages all communities and traditions, on key issues for our shared future.</p>  <p>  I addressed the first Shared Island Dialogue with young people in November, on the theme of &ldquo;New Generations and New Voices on the Good Friday Agreement&rdquo;. </p>  <p>  Dialogues on Climate and Environment; Civil Society engagement; the Equality agenda; and Economic recovery on the island have also been held so far this year, with participation by Government Ministers.</p>  <p>  The next Shared Island Dialogue will be on Health, taking place on 8 July. Recordings and reports of the Dialogues are available online and on social media.</p>  <p>  As Taoiseach, I regularly meet with political, civic, economic and other representatives from across all sections of the community in Northern Ireland, on all aspects of the Peace Process, including our shared future on this island, founded on the Good Friday Agreement.</p>  <p>  Finally, as part of its work programme the Shared Island unit in my Department is meeting with stakeholders, North and South, to hear their views on a shared island, with over 160 engagements held to date. There has been initial correspondence with the Gaelic Athletic Association and the unit will further engage with the GAA and other sporting organisations, recognising their vital contribution in respect of well-being and positive civic and social connections across the island.</p></reply>

The Act requires public bodies to carry out an assessment which looks at the human rights and equality issues of relevance to the functions and policies of their Department, to identify any gaps and appropriate actions to address these.  </p>  <p>  My Department's Public Sector Duty Assessment is available to view on gov.ie at the following link: </p>  <p>  www.gov.ie/en/organisation-information/0f55fb-work-of-the-department-of-the-taoiseach/</p>  <p>  The Assessment focuses on how the Duty impacts on three main areas of activity: services provided to the public, my Department's role in policy development and how my Department treats its own staff. The document also contains a summary of potential gaps identified and the appropriate actions to be taken to address these.</p>  <p>  Monitoring of progress and continued compliance will be included in my Department&rsquo;s Corporate Governance Framework and Annual Reporting process. </p>  <p>  The National Economic and Social Development Office (NESDO) - the only body under my Department's aegis &ndash; is currently reviewing its Policy and Procedures document which will make reference to its obligations under the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014.</p></reply>

One aspect of the RIA is an assessment of the impact of a proposal on people with disabilities.  Where no requirement for a RIA arises, substantive Memoranda for the Government should indicate the impact of the proposal in question on people with disabilities.</p><p>Specific guidelines for all Government Departments on conducting disability impact assessments have been drawn up by the Department of Justice and the National Disability Authority and are available at www.justice.ie.</p><p>While my Department may have an involvement in many areas of policy, legislation is brought forward by the Departments that have specific and detailed areas of responsibility.  The lead responsibility for policies and legislation relating to people with disabilities lies with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  The impacts of public policy on persons with disabilities is monitored and reviewed on an ongoing basis by Government Departments, bodies and agencies in their respective sectors.</p></reply>

This Act provides that certain days may be prescribed as public holidays.  At present, there are nine public holidays. </p>  <p>  An extra holiday has implications of a broad nature in terms of costs and productivity and has cross-government issues to be explored.</p>  <p>  Any proposal for the provision of an additional public holiday would require careful consideration and wide-ranging consultations with relevant stakeholders.  Not least we would need to consider the implications and impact of any new public holiday on employment and for the economy at large, in particular the extra costs it would impose on employers already dealing with the Covid-19 crisis and Brexit.</p></reply>

The AMBER area represents the area to be served by the network to be deployed under the NBP State led intervention.  </p>  <p>  I appreciate people's frustration when they are living so close to a fibre network but cannot obtain a connection to that network, particularly given the heightened importance of connectivity during the Covid-19 pandemic. The NBP will ensure that in all such cases a future proofed high speed broadband network will be built to serve these premises and work to deliver on this is under way.  </p>  <p>  I am advised by National Broadband Ireland (NBI) that, as of 23 June, almost 229,000 premises across all counties have been surveyed. Surveys are complete or underway in County Kildare in Killashee, Oughterard, Naas Rural, Rathmore, Kill, Kilteel, Carnalway, Gilltown, Ballymore Eustace, Bodenstown, Naas Urban, Newtown, Donaghcumper, Athy, Coneyboro, Aughaboura, Ballinapark, Castlemitchell, Bert, Kilberry, Kilkea, Leixlip, Celbridge and Maynooth. Further details are available on specific areas within County Kildare through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. NBI also has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries. </p>  <p>  While substantial progress has been made to date, the Covid 19 pandemic has had an impact on the delivery of the fibre network resulting in delays on delivery of aspects of the programme. Impacts include challenges with mobilisation of key contractors with restrictions on operations, supply chain and logistic delays (both nationally and internationally), as well as the recruitment of key personnel as NBI and its contractors scale, up including challenges associated with on-boarding and training people. Inevitably, like many other organisations, NBI and contractor staff are at risk of contracting Covid 19 or may have to restrict their movements as a result of being a close contact posing further challenges. The full extent of this impact is currently being assessed and NBI has committed to put in place measures to mitigate the impact in as far as possible. </p>  <p>  Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 23 June,  326 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for school BCPs. BCP&rsquo;s are connected at Lullymore Heritage Park, Lullymore East, Bigstone Community Hall, Ballyraggan, and Crookstown Further Education and Training and Community Centre. Further details can be found at nbi.ie/bcp-locations/. </p>  <p>  Rathmore National School, Rathmore West, Saint David's National School, and Piper's Hill Campus have been installed by NBI for educational access. My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband, within the Intervention Area, for connection over the term of the NBP. In this regard, an acceleration of this aspect of the National Broadband Plan was announced in December which will see some 679 primary schools connected to high speed broadband by 2022, well ahead of the original target delivery timeframe of 2026.  Further details are available on the NBI website at nbi.ie/primary-schools-list/.    </p></reply>

There are no specific proposals at present.</p>  <p>  We can all see that in theory it might be of assistance in addressing road traffic problems.  However, there are serious issues to consider.  The Road Traffic legislation which governs camera apparatus used by the Garda to provide evidence - speed cameras in particular - sets strict standards for the apparatus to be used in order to ensure that evidence is reliable.  It would make a nonsense of having standards like this if we allowed anyone to upload footage taken on any apparatus.  My colleague the Minister for Justice is currently proposing legislation relating to Garda use of camera evidence, and the Deputy may wish to raise this issue in that context.   </p>  <p>  I have recently asked officials in my Department to consider the issue of camera based enforcement of bus lanes and intend to bring forward proposals in that regard in future. </p></reply>

In January 2021 Revenue were managing 498 cases involving potential tax avoidance, relating to 27 transactions. </p><p>The settlements reached in the years 2014 to 2020 in relation to tax avoidance challenged by Revenue are set out in Table 1. </p><p><b>Table 1 &ndash; Tax Avoidance Settlements </b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Year </th>       <th>Number of cases </th>       <th>Yield </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020 </td>       <td>104 </td>       <td>&euro;18.4m </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019 </td>       <td>127 </td>       <td>&euro;29m </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018 </td>       <td>22 </td>       <td>&euro;5.7m </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017 </td>       <td>1,352* </td>       <td>&euro;3.8m </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016 </td>       <td>40 </td>       <td>&euro;10m </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2015 </td>       <td>160 </td>       <td>&euro;42m </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2014 </td>       <td>483 </td>       <td>&euro;13m </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total </td>       <td>2,288 </td>       <td>&euro;121.9m </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>*Of the 1,352 avoidance cases settled in 2017, 1,332 were closed following the Supreme Court&rsquo;s decision in the Hans Droog case in which it was successfully argued by the appellant that time limits set out in legislation relating to the self-assessment system apply to anti-avoidance legislation. As a result of the Supreme Court decision and acting on legal advice, Revenue closed similar cases involving time limit issues which it was no longer possible to pursue as a result of the application of the time limit. </p><p>Finance Act 2014 introduced section 811D and provided taxpayers with the opportunity to file a Qualifying Avoidance Disclosure (QAD).  This provided for the disclosure of any tax avoidance transaction entered into on or before 23 October 2014. The final date to avail of the QAD was 30 June 2015.  In general, the type of transactions that qualified for the disclosure initiative were transactions that could come within the definition of avoidance in section 811, also VAT avoidance transactions that could be challenged under the &ldquo;Abuse of Rights&rdquo; principle.  In total 137 cases applied under the QAD provisions with settlements of &euro;43.7 million (including tax and interest). </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-06-30a.113.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021063000085#WRD00700"><p>I am advised by Revenue that payments from the Department of Social Protection are taxable sources of income unless they are specifically exempt from income tax.  Both the State Contributory Pension and the State Non-Contributory Pension are chargeable to income tax, but not to Universal Social Charge (USC) or Pay Related Social Insurance (PRSI).</p>  <p>  The Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 provides for the payment of an increase in the amount of weekly State pensions where the beneficiary of the pension has a qualified adult dependant.  Although the qualifying adult portion of the pension is paid directly to the qualified adult, this payment is premised on there being an entitlement by the beneficiary to the pension in the first instance.  As stated in section 112 of the Social Welfare Consolidation 2005 Act, the qualified adult portion is an &ldquo;increase&rdquo; in the pension and is payable in respect of a spouse/civil partner/cohabitant who is being financially maintained and whose income is not greater than a specified amount.</p>  <p>  The tax treatment of the qualified adult increase is provided for in section 126(2B) Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997, as inserted by Section 12 of the Finance (No. 2) Act of 2013.  That section provides that, for all the purposes of the Income Tax Acts, any increase in the State pension in respect of a qualified adult dependant is treated as if it arises to, and is payable to, the beneficiary of the pension.  Since the increase is treated as income of the beneficiary for tax purposes, only one employee (PAYE) tax credit &ndash; valued at &euro;1,650 - is available in respect of the State Pension, including the qualified adult dependent increase. </p>  <p>  With regard to the Deputy&rsquo;s specific question as to the estimated annual cost to the Exchequer in each of the years 2022 to 2026 of providing for a PAYE tax credit for the qualified adult dependent, I am further advised by Revenue that there are significant variables to consider in order to determine an individual&rsquo;s final tax liability position and as such it is not possible to provide an estimated cost.  This will be dependent on his or her civil status, his or her available tax credits or the amount of income received from other sources or perhaps an individual may not have sufficient sources of income to partially or fully avail of the PAYE credit in his or her own right. Furthermore, by virtue of section 188 TCA 1997, a person aged 65 and over is exempt from income tax where his or her total income is less than the relevant exemption limit.  For 2021, the exemption limits are &euro;36,000 for a married couple or civil partners and &euro;18,000 for a single individual.  </p>  <p>  Finally, I would like to make the Deputy aware that the Minister for Social Protection recently provided details of the number of recipients of State pension (contributory) and State pension (non-contributory) respectively, who were also claiming an increase for a qualified adult and these statistics are set out in Parliamentary Question 13850/21, which can be located at the following link - www.oireachtas.ie/en/debates/question/2021-03-11/140/?highlight%5B0%5D=13850 </p></reply>

For projects estimated to cost over &euro;100 million, the Government is the Approving Authority at each of the key decision gates in the project life cycle, including approval-in-principle at preliminary business case stage, approval to proceed to tender stage and approval to award contracts at final business case stage. The Public Spending Code for the development of public investment projects is available at this link: assets.gov.ie/99068/c14c842b-2afc-41d6-8429-045548548ecc.pdf</p>  <p>  In addition, my Department conducts technical reviews at an early strategic assessment report stage, at preliminary business case stage and at final business case stage. These technical reviews will be carried out to ensure the full options appraisal, economic and financial appraisal, governance and risks of the project are appropriately assessed as part of the development of projects. </p>  <p>  The Minister for Health, Stephen Donnelly TD, and I have shared correspondence in recent months regarding the development of the new maternity hospital business case. This was in relation to the appropriate stage in the Public Spending Code at which this case could be introduced for consideration by my Department for technical review and for decision by Government. In that context, I clarified the requirements within the Public Spending Code for each of the decision gates and that it would be expected that any business case submitted to my Department for review would comply with these requirements. It is my understanding that the business case is currently being developed, as appropriate, within the Health system and it is the responsibility of the Department of Health to bring the business case forward for consideration in due course. </p></reply>

The deadline for applications is 30th June 2021.</p><p>My Department's policy is for applications to be promoted and sponsored by the relevant local authorities in order to ensure continuity throughout the process. Other organisations, community groups or individuals interested in submitting an application have been encouraged to apply in collaboration with their respective local authority and support has been provided by my Department when appropriate to do so. The role of the local authorities to lead engagement with community organisations on the ground is crucial in order to facilitate public consultation and wider stakeholder involvement, particularly in light of the requirement under the UNESCO Operational Guidelines for participatory planning and stakeholder consultation. </p><p>My Department&rsquo;s National Monuments Service has been liaising very closely with those local authorities that have expressed interest in having a property within their county boundaries included on the revised Tentative List, providing advice and guidance on an ongoing basis, commissioning studies/reviews, and encouraging engagement with relevant stakeholders at a local level. This engagement has also included facilitating two World Heritage Workshops in collaboration with ICOMOS Ireland, one held in Killarney in February 2020 and a follow-up workshop online in June 2020. </p><p>These workshops focussed on next steps in the review process, World Heritage knowledge sharing, management of serial and transboundary applications, and the requirements of completing the Tentative List application form. At these workshops, the challenges in the preparation of nomination documentation and management plans for prospective World Heritage properties was detailed, and the need for wide public consultation and local stakeholder engagement was reinforced. </p><p>Following attendance at the workshops, interested parties were requested to submit draft Tentative List applications for review and feedback to ensure that the next Tentative List features properties that are well-placed to progress to World Heritage nomination. Throughout November and December 2020, my Department facilitated feedback in relation to the draft applications through individual online meetings with a World Heritage Expert. </p><p>My Department is not anticipating a revised application for Monasterboice as a component of a serial national application in respect of <i>Early Medieval Monastic Sites</i>or a revised standalone application because despite considerable encouragement, there was no engagement with my Department by Louth County Council in respect of Monasterboice.</p></reply>

It is a wide ranging report which covers funding from a variety of different Government Departments for a range of issues and schemes. Many of the funding lines are outside of the remit of my Department.  The report has also been sent for consideration to other relevant Government Departments. The funding system for local authorities is complex, with authorities deriving their income from a variety of sources including local sources such as commercial rates, charges for goods and services and funding from Central Government.</p>  <p>  Most of the funding from Central Government must be used for specified services. These can be grouped into five broad programme categories: recreational, education, environment, housing and transport.  In relation to funding streams specifically from my Department, &euro;135.3m and &euro;167.5m was provided to Cork County Council in 2019 and 2020 respectively. The increase between 2019 and 2020 is due to an increase in housing funding, as well as funding in respect of the COVID commercial rates and other COVID related expenses that occurred in 2020.</p>  <p>  It is a matter for each local authority to consider how it can maximise local income sources and manage its own spending, in the context of the annual budgetary process. Local authority members may decide, as part of that process, to vary the ARV and LPT in order to increase the revenue available to them.  I note that for 2020 and 2021 Cork County Council raised their LPT rate by +5% and +7.5% respectively, foregoing the maximum 15% raise or just over &euro;3m in 2020 and &euro;2.4m in 2021.</p>  <p>  I would like to refer to the plans recently announced by the Minister for Finance, Paschal Donohoe T.D to reform LPT. These reforms will involve bringing new homes, which are currently exempt from LPT, into the taxation system as well as providing for all money collected locally to be retained within the county. This will also be done on the basis that those counties with a lower LPT base are adjusted via an annual national equalisation fund paid from the Exchequer, as is currently the case.</p>  <p>  I also refer to the unprecedented support for local authorities during the COVID pandemic. In 2020, Cork County Council applied a 100% commercial rates waiver to just over 9,000 businesses and recouped &euro;34.7 m in that regard from my Department.  In addition, in recognition of COVID related income losses, and additional COVID related expenditure incurred in 2020, my Department provided funding of &euro;6.7 m to Cork County Council.  The Government has introduced a commercial rates waiver for 2021, which has been extended to end of September, at an estimated cost &euro;480 m. As has been the case since the outset of the Covid-19 pandemic, my Department will continue to engage with the local government sector and with individual local authorities on the financial impacts of the pandemic and provide them with the necessary financial supports.</p></reply>

There are three separate grants available, including the Housing Adaptation Grant for People with a Disability, with responsibility for the apportionment between them being a matter for each local authority.  Any increase in the existing grant limits and income thresholds would have to be considered in the context of the full suite of grants. </p>  <p>  The terms and conditions governing the grants were examined in 2013 by a review group that included representatives of grant beneficiaries and the local authorities. They considered how the benefits of the grants could be spread as widely as possible and to achieve fairness and value for money in the grants process. Arising from the recommendations of the review group, the income requirements, eligibility and maximum grant were revised in 2014 to focus the grants towards those with the greatest need. </p>  <p>  My Department has committed to beginning a review this year of the means test criteria and maximum grant limits applicable to the housing adaptation grants.</p>  <p>  Funding of &euro;75 million is available nationally in 2021 for the Housing Adaptation Grants for Older People and People with a Disability Scheme. This funding has increased year on year since 2014.  As part of the annual budgetary process, consideration will be given to this funding in future years in line with the Programme for Government commitments and the Policy Statement on Housing Options for Our Ageing Population, which is available on my Department's website at the following link:  </p>  <p>www.gov.ie/en/publication/ea33c1-housing-options-for-our-ageing-population-policy-statement/</p></reply>

My Department provides funding to local authorities also on an ongoing basis where they use their land for social housing developments.  </p>  <p>  Specific allocations of funding are not made to local authorities for land, rather each local authority makes its own decisions regarding land acquisition in line with their needs and my Department provides full funding in respect of the all-in capital costs - including land costs and construction costs - when land is used for the construction of new social housing.  </p>  <p>  To incentivise and support local authorities to further develop their landbanks,  A new initiative has been confirmed for 2021 to support land acquisition where it's for new social housing developments. The focus with this initiative is land that is development-ready for housing, is appropriately zoned, which faces no other known obstacles to its development and where the local authority can work to a delivery programme to develop social housing as soon as possible on the site.  In such cases, funding for the land will be provided by my Department when a local authority presents a social housing development proposal for the site. </p>  <p>  On the back of this initiative, local authorities are seeking suitable sites that can be acquired and funding will be provided by my Department as these are brought forward.  The uptake under this initiative will depend on the need for additional land which will vary across the local authorities. The amount of social housing to be delivered on land acquired under this initiative will depend on the extent of land acquired and the density of housing that can be delivered in line with planning approvals. I hope that public representatives will support local authorities to utilise this initiative to acquire new sites and will then support new social housing delivery on such sites through the planning process. </p></reply>

My Department&rsquo;s role in relation to homelessness involves the provision of a national framework of policy, legislation and funding to underpin the role of housing authorities in addressing homelessness at local level.  </p>  <p>  While responsibility for the provision of homeless accommodation and related services rests with individual housing authorities, the administration of homeless services is organised on a regional basis with a lead authority in place for each region.  In this instance, Clare County Council is included in the Mid-West region along with Limerick City and County Council with Limerick acting as the regional lead authority.  A homelessness consultative forum has been established in each region in accordance with Chapter 6 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2009.  Decisions on the range of emergency accommodation services and funding required in each region are a matter for individual housing authorities in consultation with the Management Group of the relevant regional joint Homelessness Consultative Forum.</p>  <p>  My Department does not fund homeless service directly but rather contributes towards overall costs incurred by housing authorities in the provision of services.

The potential for this legislation to harm the rights and freedoms of the LGBTQI+ community in Hungary, particularly young people, is extremely worrying. Statements by my colleague, Minister of State for European Affairs, Thomas Byrne T.D. and myself, made in the immediate aftermath of the Hungarian Assembly&rsquo;s passage of this bill, made clear Ireland&rsquo;s concerns about this attack on LGBTQI+ rights in Hungary.</p>  <p>  Ireland believes in a Europe of equality, respect, and tolerance. Promoting the rights of LGBTQI+ people is a human rights priority for Ireland. We are also committed to upholding core EU values of respect for human dignity, freedom, and equality as enshrined in Article 2 of the Treaties and the EU&rsquo;s Charter of Fundamental Rights.  </p>  <p>  Ireland therefore co-signed a declaration led by the Benelux countries at the 22 June General Affairs Council meeting in Luxembourg. This declaration expresses grave concern at Hungary&rsquo;s use of child protection as a pretext for introducing measures that violate freedom of expression and other rights as enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, and unjustifiably target the LGBTQI+ community. </p>  <p>  Ireland actively participated at the Article 7 Treaty on European Union hearing on Hungary&rsquo;s adherence to EU values at the 22 June General Affairs Council. During the hearing, we made clear our view that legislation of this kind has no place in the EU and is fundamentally incompatible with EU values. </p>  <p>  An Taoiseach, Miche&aacute;l Martin, also joined with fifteen of his EU counterparts in co-signing a statement on 24 June at the European Council meeting, vowing to continue fighting against discrimination towards the LGBTQI+ community and reaffirming their commitment to the defence of their fundamental rights. </p>  <p>  The Embassy of Ireland in Hungary has actively supported statements of concern made locally by like-minded partners and has registered its deep concern about this law and its implications for equality and human rights. The Embassy of Ireland is also coordinating this year&rsquo;s statement by Embassies in Hungary supporting the Budapest Pride Parade, which takes place on 24 July.</p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to engage on this issue and will reiterate our call for the Hungarian Government to reconsider the introduction of this law.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-06-30a.195.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021063000087#WRF00400"><p>My Department is acutely aware of the disruption caused to students as a result of school closures resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. From 11 January 2021, all students, including students currently in fifth year and who are due to sit the Leaving Certificate examinations in 2022, engaged in a programme of remote learning with their schools. Students in fifth year were prioritised for a return to school following the return of sixth year students.</p><p>The public health restrictions which resulted in the closure of schools in March 2020 highlighted the absolute necessity for schools to be agile in providing for continuity of schooling in the future. As a contingency measure against the possibility of partial or full school closures, my Department provided a suite of guidance materials, agreed with the education partners, to enable schools to mediate the curriculum safely for all pupils/students in a COVID-19 context.  These are available at www.gov.ie/backtoschool.</p><p>The nature of distance learning, which was necessitated during the unprecedented closure of schools last year and early this year, required educators to take on a range of approaches to support their pupils&rsquo; continuity of learning during that period. Assisted by Department-funded resources and supports, schools and teachers demonstrated great innovation in adapting to the unprecedented situation including the use of digital technologies and online learning platforms for teaching and learning.  </p><p>Extensive guidance and supports have been and continue to be made available by my Department and its support services to support schools to plan for the transition to online and remote learning. Circular 0074/2020, &lsquo;Communication/Teaching &amp;amp; Learning Platform&rsquo;, was issued by the Department last year.  In accordance with the circular, it became a requirement for all schools to have in place a communication/learning platform (while acknowledging that many schools have already put such platforms in place) that supports them to respond in the event of a partial or full school closure in the future, including the facilitation of some use of live or recorded video lessons where practicable.</p><p>The circular includes links to a range of materials and supports developed by the Digital Technologies team of the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST), including information and resources for commonly used platforms for teaching, learning and assessment,  short video tutorials exploring how digital platforms and tools can be used effectively for remote learning purposes and clarity regarding how chosen platforms can be effectively used for assessment and feedback purposes, links to each of which are shown.</p><p>Other documents published by my Department include <i>Guidance for Practical Subjects in Post-Primary Schools and Centres for Education</i><i>and Returning to school: Guidance on learning and school programmes for post primary school leaders and teachers</i>. These documents provide guidance for teachers and schools that is specific to each practical subject area, so that students can be facilitated to actively engage with their learning. A number of adjustments were made to the assessment arrangements for the 2021 Leaving Certificate examinations to take account of the disruption to learning experienced by the students who are due to take these examinations.</p><p>However, I am conscious that students who are due to take their Leaving Certificate examinations in 2022 have experienced a degree of disruption to their learning.</p><p>Today, the Advisory Group on Planning for State Examinations received an update in relation to the 2022 Leaving Certificate and Junior Cycle examinations. I announced that the level of adjustment to the assessment arrangements for the 2022 Leaving Certificate Examination cohort would be broadly the same as that applied by the <i>Assessment Arrangements for Leaving Certificate Examinations 2021,</i>as set in December 2020.  There arrangements were announced before the second period of school closures. Minor changes will be made to that document to reflect syllabus content specific the 2022 examinations. The revised document will be published later this month.</p><p>I also announced today that the State Examinations Commission (SEC) will run an alternative set of Leaving Certificate Examinations in 2022, shortly following the main set of examinations.  The SEC will set out the eligibility conditions for these examinations, which will be limited to certain students who are unable to sit the main set of examinations due to close family bereavement, COVID-19 illness during those examinations, and certain other categories of serious illness, to be clearly and strictly delineated.The SEC will issue further details regarding these examinations, with all arrangements guided by prevailing public health advice. There will also be further engagement with stakeholders in this matter.</p></reply>

This included &euro;50m in respect of the 2020-2021 school year brought forward and issued in December 2020. Schools were advised that they can use this funding to support the continuity of teaching and learning should a period of partial or full school closure occur arising from Public Health advice owing to Covid-19 restrictions. The funding is intended to enable schools to implement their Digital Learning Plan through provision of appropriate infrastructure. This includes Desktop PCs, laptops, tablets or hybrid devices, projectors/flat screens, cloud-based tools and software applications, and learning platforms.  </p><p>Decisions regarding the use and deployment of digital technology in schools is a matter for the Board of Management of each school, as schools are best placed to determine the most appropriate solution to adopt in terms of supporting the learning needs of their students based on school's own context and circumstances, and in accordance with their Digital Learning Plan. </p><p>Schools are advised to consult with members of the school community including parents when planning for the introduction of digital technologies including devices. The cost and other implications must be fully considered by the Boards of Managements before a decision is made. It is important for schools, in conjunction with parents, to retain local autonomy for decisions on the use of digital technology, including tablet devices, laptops, and learning platforms, and how best to manage their integration into classroom practice reflective of their own context and requirements.</p><p>The Professional Development Service for Teachers Technology in Education (PDST-TIE) offers advice and supports to schools on digital learning. Advice sheets are available on digital technology in education, including on the adoption of laptops and tablets in schools. </p><p>The Department spends just over &euro;150 million annually to provide a suite of supports to schools in the DEIS programme, of which &euro;16.2 million, in the form of a DEIS grant was allocated to schools ahead of schedule for the 2020/21 school year. This is an annual grant to support learning in the context of DEIS for the academic year. In recognition of the difficulties faced by some students to engage with remote learning during the pandemic, at the time the grant issued last year all DEIS schools were informed by letter that they could consider using some of their DEIS funding to support pupils&rsquo; learning, for example to arrange access to additional materials of supports for students during the move to remote teaching and learning caused by Covid-19. It is a matter for each individual school to determine how best to use this funding, but it is intended to support the objectives of the DEIS programme. </p><p>My Department continues to work to help support schools and families meet school costs. with the publication of Circular 0032/2017 <i>Measures to be adopted by schools to reduce the cost of school uniforms and other costs which</i>issued to schools in 2017 and advises schools of measures to be adopted to reduce the cost of school uniforms and other costs. This circular also instructed schools to consult with parents and their school community on the issue of ensuring costs are reasonable for parents. This circular specified that wherever possible, generic rather than branded items should be specified (e.g. uniform, clothing, IT tablets, sports equipment etc.). </p><p>The development of a new Digital Strategy is underway and an extensive consultation process has commenced with an open call for submissions. Further strands of the consultation will include questionnaires to key stakeholder and engagement through focus groups. A Consultative Advisory Group has been established comprising key stakeholders representing parents, teachers, students and industry. Future funding measures to support schools in embedding the use of digital technologies in teaching, learning and assessment will be considered as part of that process. </p></reply>

From 11 January 2021, all students engaged in a programme of remote learning with their schools.</p><p>Students who have just completed fifth year and who are due to take Leaving Certificate examinations in 2022 have experienced a degree of disruption to their learning.  In these circumstances, it was considered that some level of adjustment to the normal Leaving Certificate assessment arrangements should be made for them that would be proportionate to their experience and be educationally appropriate. Given where these students were at in their studies at the time of each school lockdown period, the impact of the loss of tuition time is less than that experienced by those students who sat the Leaving Certificate this year.</p><p>Yesterday, following a meeting of the Advisory Group on Planning for State Examinations, I announced that the level of adjustment to the assessment arrangements for the 2022 Leaving Certificate Examination cohort would be broadly the same as that applied by the <i>Assessment Arrangements For Leaving Certificate Examinations 2021,</i>as set in December 2020.  There arrangements were announced before the second period of school closures.</p><p>I also announced yesterday that the State Examinations Commission (SEC) will run an alternative set of Leaving Certificate Examinations in 2022, shortly following the main set of examinations. The SEC will set out the eligibility conditions for these examinations, which will be limited to certain students who are unable to sit the main set of examinations due to close family bereavement, COVID-19 illness during those examinations, and certain other categories of serious illness, to be clearly and strictly delineated. The SEC will issue further details regarding these examinations, with all arrangements guided by prevailing public health advice. There will also be further engagement with stakeholders in this matter.</p><p>By way of ongoing reform across Senior Cycle, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) recently submitted the Senior Cycle Review: Advisory Report to my Department and I for consideration.  The Advisory Report, which will be published in the coming months, looks at priority areas, longer-term goals and a proposed timeline on the pace and scale of developments in senior cycle.  It sets out a shared vision articulated as the basis, which will guide further work on specific areas for developments, such as, senior cycle programmes and pathways, curriculum specifications and assessment. This further work will be carried out on a phased basis over the next few years with further consultation as appropriate.</p></reply>

It is not a qualifying payment for Community Employment.  However, time spent in receipt of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment counts towards the duration of unemployment required to be eligible for CE.  A person in receipt of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment will need to qualify for an eligible payment, for example Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance, before they can become eligible for CE.  Once eligibility for CE has been confirmed, unemployed persons can apply for a range of CE vacancies accessible within their community which will provide opportunities to avail of the valuable training and work experience available on the CE schemes.</p><p>A significant number of recipients of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment will return to their previous employment as the COVID-19 restrictions continue to ease.  Unfortunately, however, others will not.

The scheme aimed to provide jobseekers with the opportunity to learn basic work and social skills in a supportive environment while on a work placement. The scheme provided a supportive structure for participants, including case worker support for both placement hosts and jobseekers.</p>  <p>  Since the scheme's inception, a total of 1,002 people have commenced a placement. There are currently 50 participants on the YESS.  </p>  <p>  During placements there is close monitoring of participants and host organisations to ensure all the conditions of the scheme are being met, thereby ensuring that any potential difficulties are identified and resolved. </p>  <p>  YESS guidelines provide that placements must provide the participant with a broad, meaningful and practical workplace experience within the organisation.  The placement should genuinely enhance the participant&rsquo;s ability to obtain future full-time employment.  The placement should demonstrate that an organisation is willing to support the individual and provide the opportunity to learn new and practical skills and access to formal and/or informal training through the support of their mentor.  Participants are not permitted to work unsupervised/unaccompanied for extended periods of time.  A placement host cannot state that previous experience is required when advertising a placement.  The placement title and associated learning outcomes from the work placement must reflect these principles. Placements are checked before being placed on the JobsIreland website in order to ensure that they follow the specification of the scheme outlined in the YESS guidelines.</p>  <p>  The YESS programme quality is monitored by the Department&rsquo;s case officers. Hosts are required to complete a monthly compliance checklist specifying attendance and if the participants are progressing in line with the agreed Learning &amp;amp; Development Plan. Case officers carry out a two-month review of the placement and the Learning &amp;amp; Development Plan with the host and the participant. After three months, a placement extension can be requested if enough progress has been made and where further learning and development opportunities exist. If both parties agree to the extension and the case officer is satisfied both the host and the participant sign the extension.</p>  <p>  At the end of the placement both the host and the participant are asked to complete an evaluation form.</p>  <p>  Complaints and any workplace issues which arise during the placement are addressed and resolved between the placement host, the participant and the Departmental case officer, where possible.  All complaints relating to participation on the YESS are investigated in full by the Department, and appropriate action taken where necessary.  Details of investigations can be made public.  </p>  <p>  Therefore I am satisfied that there are procedures in place to deal quickly with any issues that could potentially arise,  even where these would occur in only a very small number of YESS placements.  </p>  <p>  I trust this information satisfies the Deputy.</p></reply>

A person must have paid 104 PRSI insurable employment contributions at class A, H or P or paid 156 class S contributions if they are self-employed.  The second contribution condition requires that a person must also have 39 reckonable contributions paid or credited in the GCY.  At least 13 of these contributions must be paid.  Where a person does not have 13 paid contributions in the GCY they can be from 2 years before the GCY, the last complete tax year or the current tax year; or they have at least 26 reckonable contributions paid in both the GCY and the year immediately preceding the GCY.</p>  <p>  The reason for the requirement to have paid contributions in the manner set out in legislation is to demonstrate a recent attachment to the workforce.

It should be remembered that more than half of those over 66 years of age are solely dependent upon the State pension, and so a person with additional pension income above &euro;100, is not amongst the cohort of more disadvantaged people that Fuel Allowance is targeted towards.</p>  <p>  Any extension of the Fuel Allowance qualifying criteria, such as increasing the allowable means for fuel allowance purposes, can only be considered while taking account of the overall budgetary context and the availability of financial resources. </p>  <p>  Under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme a special heating supplement may be paid to assist people in certain circumstances.

The means test ensures that the recipient has a verifiable income need and that resources are targeted to those who need them most.  </p>  <p>  By its nature, the means test takes account of the income a person or couple has in terms of cash, property - other than the family home - and capital.  It does not take account of a person&rsquo;s expenditure. In line with most social assistance payments, deductions permitted for carer's allowance include PRSI, union dues, superannuation (pension contributions) and travel expenses.  Uniquely in the system, an income disregard of &euro;332.50 per week (or &euro;665 for a couple) applies to carer's allowance.  A couple with an annual gross income of up to &euro;37,500 (net of PRSI and other allowable deductions) can qualify for a maximum payment, and a couple with an income of up to nearly &euro;60,000 can still qualify for a reduced rate.  </p>  <p>  If net rather than gross income was assessed for Carer's Allowance, it would mean that changes in tax rates or tax reliefs could change the claimant&rsquo;s rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance.  In addition, to deduct costs associated with caring would significantly increase the complexity of the means assessment.  It would also have significant budgetary implications and would give rise to inconsistencies in how means tests are applied across schemes.</p>  <p>  The carer's support grant is an annual non-means tested payment made by my Department to carers.  This grant was increased to &euro;1,850 this year and may be used in whatever way the carer wishes.</p>  <p>  I recognise the crucial role that carers play in Irish society and will continue to seek to improve the supports for carers.  However, any changes must be considered in an overall budgetary context.</p></reply>

Carer&rsquo;s Benefit is a payment made to insured people who may be required to leave the workforce or reduce their working hours to care for a person(s) in need of full-time care and attention.  A person may be eligible for Carer's Benefit if they have enough PRSI contributions.  It is payable for a period of 2 years (104 weeks) for each care recipient and may be claimed over separate periods up to a total of 2 years (104 weeks).  As of May 2021 there were 3,646 recipients of Carer's Benefit.  Estimated expenditure in 2021 is in excess of &euro;47 million. </p>  <p>  Under the provisions of the legislation, to be eligible to claim Carer's Benefit, a claimant must have paid PRSI contributions in Classes A, B, C, D, E or H.  Self-employed workers who pay social insurance contributions at the Class S rate of 4% are not eligible for Carer&rsquo;s Benefit.</p>  <p>  To claim, the carer must have 156 PRSI contributions paid since entry into insurance and either 39 contributions paid in the relevant tax year or 39 contributions paid in the 12 months immediately before the commencement of the Carer&rsquo;s Benefit claim or 26 contributions paid in the relevant tax year and 26 contributions paid in the previous relevant tax year. </p>  <p>  Where a person does not have the necessary social insurance record, for example where they are self-employed, they can claim for Carer's Allowance, and the first &euro;332.20 of weekly income for a single person, or &euro;665 for a couple is disregarded in the means test.  Those who are self-employed can also apply for the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant &ndash; which was increased by &euro;150 as part of Budget Measures 2021.  Self-employed carers can now work up to 18.5 hours per week, this was increased from 15 hours to 18.5 hours in January 2020.   </p>  <p>  There has been an extensive expansion of access to the range of social insurance benefits to self-employed social insurance contributors in recent years without any increase in the 4 percent rate of contribution made by them.  Self-employed contributors are now covered for most of the benefits available under the social insurance scheme which represents approximately 93 percent of the value of all benefits paid by the Social Insurance Fund.   </p>  <p>  Any proposal to further extend social insurance entitlements to self-employed contributors would have to be considered in a budgetary context, taking account of the current economic circumstances and with a view to the sustainability of the Social Insurance Fund.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.  </p></reply>

The scheme provides financial incentives to private sector employers to hire people with a disability for between 21 and 39 subsidised hours per week under a contract of employment.  The basic rate of subsidy is &euro;5.30 per hour giving a total annual subsidy available of &euro;10,748 per annum based on a 39 hour week.  The subsidy is paid to the employer.  </p>  <p>  The WSS is a demand-led scheme and there are currently 1,597 private sector employers availing of the subsidy in respect of 2,535 participant employees.  </p>  <p>  The Ability Programme was introduced in June 2018 and is a pre-activation programme for young people with disabilities.  The funding for this programme will amount to around &euro;16 million over a three year period and is being co-funded by the EU and the Irish Exchequer under the EU's ESF Programme for Employability, Inclusion and Learning (PEIL) Operational Programme 2014-2020.  In total, the programme is supporting over 2,600 young people with disabilities aged between 15 and 29 years of age. Pobal has been contracted by the Department to manage the programme.  The programme has been extended by two months and will now conclude at the end of August. </p>  <p>  The aim of the Ability Programme is to help bring young people with disabilities who are not work-ready closer to the labour market through engagement in training and personal development activities, which would be followed by an incremental exposure to work.  The programme is being delivered by 27 community and voluntary groups from around the country, selected on foot of a competitive process.  The projects being funded have been designed to assist young people in their transition from school to further education and employment.  There are currently 1,175 active participants on the Ability Programme. </p>  <p>  I trust that the above clarifies for the Deputy that the wage subsidy scheme and the Ability programme are supports that target different cohorts of people with disabilities, one group in employment and the other at the  pre-employment stage.</p></reply>

In line with the commitment contained in the Programme for Government, the  Government will use the research into the cost of disability to individuals and families to inform the direction of future policy. </p>  <p>  The report has now been received and my Department is considering it in detail.  This matter is significantly wider than the income support system and will not be addressed through income support alone which is why a whole-of-Government perspective is being taken.  So it is intended to brief and seek the views of relevant government departments who have a role to play in the delivery of disability services and supports.  Once this process is complete I intend to submit the report to Government for consideration.  A decision regarding the appropriate date of publication will be made once Government has had an opportunity to consider the report fully. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.  </p></reply>

The Action Plan sets out a pathway over the next 8 years towards regulation, support and subsidies for all paid, non-relative childminders. The Action Plan will involve change and will bring significant benefits for childminders, and for the children and the families using their services.</p><p>A National Action Plan for Childminding Steering Group will be established shortly, to drive, oversee and monitor implementation of the National Action Plan. The Steering Group will be supported by four Advisory Groups in relation to: regulation and inspection; training and support; funding and financial supports; and consultation and communications.</p><p>The National Action Plan commits to representation of childminders, parents and other key stakeholders on the Steering Group, which will be chaired by my Department. Additionally the National Action Plan commits to representation of childminders on all four Advisory Groups.</p><p>Initial work on some aspects of future training for childminders began prior to launch of the National Action Plan, in the context of on-going work on developing a Workforce Development Plan for early learning and care and school-age childcare. In order to draft proposals, a working group was established specifically on childminding. The working group has strong representation of childminding views. Of its 12 members, six are childminders or work exclusively with or for childminders, while other members represent the views of parents, the statutory regulator (Tusla) and organisations which have provided extensive support for childminders. All decisions on the design and implementation of training programmes for childminders will be made by the Steering Group of the National Action Plan for Childminding.</p><p>The National Action Plan itself was based on extensive consultation and engagement with childminders, and the blueprint for the National Action Plan was the 2018 report of the Working Group on Reforms and Supports for the Childminding Sector, which was coordinated and chaired by Childminding Ireland. The National Action Plan commits to further consultation with childminders, especially during Phase 1 of the Plan when developing regulations specific to childminders.</p></reply>

The current National Standards for Foster Care have been in place since 2003. It is important that standards are reviewed from time to time in order that they remain fit for purpose. It is also important that all stakeholders have confidence in them. The draft national standards are underpinned by four principles of human rights, safety and wellbeing, responsiveness and accountability. If approved it is HIQA's intention that they will replace the individual standards for each of the service functions currently in place for each sector.</p>  <p>  Foster carers are an essential component to the care provided to children in state care and I am committed to ensuring their voice is heard in the development of new standards. My officials are actively engaged with HIQA on this issue.</p>  <p>  New standards do not change existing legislation and therefore have no impact on any legal rights or duties of foster carers under the Child Care Acts, Children First legislation and guidance, or any new legislation under consideration. Legislation and regulations supersede standards in all sectors. Standards set out expectations for services and provide guidance for all parties in the delivery of services.</p>  <p>  Following completion of the recent public consultation and drafting process HIQA will present the Draft National Standards for Children&rsquo;s Social Services for consideration and approval by the Minister for Health and myself. The Standards must be accepted and approved by both Ministers before being implemented.</p></reply>

This survey is conducted by Pobal on behalf of the Department.</p><p>Owing to the impact of COVID-19 on services, capacity figures are not available for 2019/2020. However, figures from previous years would suggest, overall, that supply meets demand, while acknowledging that some pockets of undersupply exist. Capacity is calculated as enrolment plus vacant places. Overall capacity in Kildare increased from 8,349 to 9,731 places between 2017/2018 and 2018/2019, a rise of 17%. The number of vacant places in Kildare rose from 304 in 2017/2019 to 516 in 2018/2019, an increase of 70%. The vacancy rate in Kildare was 6% in 2018/2019, up 2% from 2017/2018. The national average vacancy rate is 6% (see Table 1 below)</p><p>A key policy objective of my Department is to improve affordability, accessibility and quality of Early Learning and Care (ELC) and School-Age Childcare (SAC). A 141% increase in investment over the last number of years has led to a doubling in the number of children receiving free or subsidised early learning and care and school-age childcare. It has also supported the sector to increase the number of places available.</p><p>First 5, the ten-year strategy for babies, young children and their families commits to 'maintain and extend the supply of high-quality publicly subsidised early learning and childcare to best serve the developmental needs of babies and young children, ensuring that it also reflects the needs and preferences of parents and families'. To deliver on this strategic action, a range of actions are under way, including the development of a strategic capital investment plan to deliver large-scale capital investment under Project 2040, and the development of a new funding model for ELC and SAC. </p><p>Also identified among the actions in First 5 is a commitment to strengthen capacity to accurately forecast supply and demand for ELC and SAC by undertaking a regular national needs assessment. In addition, officials in my Department are planning research on the ELC/SAC needs of parents who work atypical hours or live in rural communities.</p><p><b>Table 1: Capacity in Kildare</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Kildare </th>       <th>2017/2018 </th>       <th>2018/2019 </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Enrolled </td>       <td>8,045 </td>       <td>9,215 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Vacant Places </td>       <td>304 </td>       <td>516 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Overall Capacity(all age ranges enrolled and vacancies) </td>       <td>8,349 </td>       <td>9,731 </td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

As such, it is not possible to accurately cost the number of additional students who may qualify for support, if the thresholds are increased. </p><p>The estimated cost of increasing the SUSI income bracket by 10% on all thresholds and adding 10% to the maintenance grant is as follows. Please note data used is 2019-20 figures with applied requested changes. </p><p>-  Increase of 19,000 to 23,000 additional recipients based on SUSI applications received for the  2019/20 academic year. </p><p>-  Increase in cost to the exchequer would be in the region of &euro;40-&euro;50 million. </p><p>The estimated cost of increasing the SUSI income thresholds by 1%, 5% and 10% on all thresholds is as follows (based on 2019/20 academic year):</p><p>-  Increase in cost to the exchequer for 1% would be in the region of &euro;2-3 million. </p><p>-  Increase in cost to the exchequer for 5% would be in the region of &euro;10-&euro;15 million. </p><p>-  Increase in cost to the exchequer for 10% would be in the region of &euro;20-&euro;30 million.</p><p>The above figures do not include any changes to the income thresholds for the special rate of maintenance grants which are linked to long-term social welfare payments.</p><p>The Programme for Government contains commitments to, amongst other things, review SUSI eligibility criteria, adjacency rates and postgraduate grant supports. The review of the Student Grant Scheme is underway with over 250 submissions received via the public consultation process and over 9,000 survey responses were received through an online survey process. It is anticipated that the SUSI review will be completed later this year and will inform policy priorities for the next Estimates process and future considerations regarding the development of student grant policy.  At this point I cannot pre-empt the outcome of the review to indicate when any proposed changes will come into effect. </p></reply>

So while the surplus has built up over previous years due to improvements seen in the economic and labour market situation before Covid-19 started to impact in 2020, it was not possible to increase expenditure beyond that generated by the increase in the levy.</p><p>There has been very substantial growth in NTF spending in recent years on the basis of the +0.1% increase in the Training Levy in both 2018 and 2019 with expenditure increasing by &euro;58m (16%) and &euro;69m (17%) respectively.  This has supported a very significant expansion in NTF priorities.  The Training Levy increased in Budget 2020 to 1% allowing a further increase in NTF spending of &euro;77m.</p><p>The NTF Advisory Group continues to be the mechanism to inform and guide on investment from the Fund and the use of the surplus. The Group has set out a detailed work plan over the next two years to examine a range of themes that will ultimately guide upskilling and reskilling priorities for the NTF into the future.</p></reply>

The Act also provides for the funding of research to provide information on existing and likely future skills requirements of the economy.</p><p>One of the key features of the NTF is its flexibility and the way it responds to changing economic/labour market conditions and this was particularly evident when as part of Government&rsquo;s response to the labour market and skills effects of the pandemic, a range of measures were introduced as a response to upskilling and reskilling needs of individuals and businesses through the July Jobs Stimulus.  These measures are providing 35,000 education and training places at a cost of &euro;100 million to help those who were displaced by the effects of the pandemic. A further 15,000 places were announced as part of the skills package in Budget 2021.

The scheme was initially approved under the July Jobs Stimulus and extended in Budget 2021 for apprentices registering between March 2020 and June 2021.  The Minister announced the expansion of the scheme to apprentices registered before the end of 2021 on the 23<sup>rd</sup>June. The scheme is currently funded from the National Training Fund.</p><p>The intention of the scheme is to ensure that apprenticeship will play a key part in supporting economic recovery at the reopening of the economy following COVID-19.

No admittance will be allowed in jury assembly areas without a jury summons. Juries are assigned a Jury Minder who helps to guide the jury around the building and will remain with the jury while in the courtroom. These minders are in some instances members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and others are trained in the required duties. All are very much alive to the issue of security and possible intimidation. If members of a jury are concerned about leaving the building they will seek the assistance of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Obviously in the context of the pandemic, the Courts Service have taken special measures to ensure the safety of jurors, including changing the way juries are summoned and empanelled, and giving them extra space to sit.</p><p>Section 41 of the Criminal Justice Act 1999 provides for the offence of intimidation of witnesses, jurors or potential jurors. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has provided statistics on the number of instances of reported jury intimidation or interference in each of the past ten years.  These are set out in the attached table. </p><p><i>The number of instances of reported jury intimidation or interference in each of the past ten years</i></p><p>The following statistics are provisional, operational and liable to change. <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th>Proceedings</th>       <th>Convictions</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2011</td>       <td>58</td>       <td>19</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2012</td>       <td>18</td>       <td>4</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2013</td>       <td>22</td>       <td>7</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2014</td>       <td>23</td>       <td>4</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2015</td>       <td>31</td>       <td>13</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016</td>       <td>27</td>       <td>11</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017</td>       <td>38</td>       <td>7</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>29</td>       <td>9</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>43</td>       <td>9</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020</td>       <td>43</td>       <td>9</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021</td>       <td>11</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The Working Group on Jury Service was established to examine the issues raised in the Report of the Law Reform Commission on Jury Service published in 2013 along with any relevant associated material. The LRC had raised a number of concerns in 2013, such as those relating to:</p><p>- How representative juries are of their communities; </p><p>- The wide group of people who can be excused as of right from jury service; </p><p>- Juries serving in lengthy or complex criminal trials; </p><p>- Issues around jury tampering;</p><p>- The reasonable accommodation of persons with disabilities to serve as jurors; </p><p>- The implications of on-line internet activity; and</p><p>- Wireless technology for the work and conduct of juries and issues of remuneration arising from jury service. </p><p>While the working group met on a number of occasions up to April 2019, unfortunately other priorities then overtook the work of that group.  Its work is now being taken forward through my Department&rsquo;s Statement of Strategy 2021-2023 and its priority objective to modernise the courts system. The overall operation of the jury system will be further reviewed in that context, including the work already carried out by the Working Group and any subsequent developments, in particular over the course of the pandemic. This review will be among the priorities set for my Department in 2022.  Any reforms would of course require primary legislation and would build on other important reforms to jury service that have already been introduced in recent years.</p></reply>

That should of course always be the case. </p>  <p>  Any inappropriate cancellation of 999 calls is a very serious issue. This falls significantly below the high standards that the public expect from the Garda&iacute; and the high standards that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na set for themselves. I am particularly concerned that anyone experiencing domestic abuse, and indeed anyone in a vulnerable position, who summoned the courage to seek assistance may not have received it. </p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na wrote to the Secretary General of my Department on 4 December 2020 to inform the Department that a number of 999 calls had been cancelled on the AGS Computer Aided Despatch System and that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was carrying out a review of the reasons behind this.  The correspondence did not make explicit reference to section 41 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act but was of course in keeping with the overall requirement of that section to keep the Minister and the Secretary General fully informed of matters of significance.  </p>  <p>  Following initial engagement by the Department with the Garda authorities, Minister Helen McEntee wrote to the Policing Authority on 5 February 2021 to ask the Authority to oversee the Garda review into this matter, which is ongoing.  Once the Authority has completed its work, I will examine its conclusions, and any action that needs to be taken on foot of that report will be taken. </p>  <p>  Both the Garda Commissioner and the Chair of the Policing Authority have briefed me on this matter in recent weeks. As the Deputy will be aware, the Commissioner also gave an account of these serious shortcomings at last week's public meeting with the Authority and outlined what steps have been taken to ensure it does not happen again, including how the processes have changed and that calls cannot now be cancelled other than by a supervisor. Additional training will also be provided to staff in order to ensure that they have the proper skills to carry out their duties.</p>  <p>  The Commissioner has also confirmed to me that Garda&iacute; are now contacting people whose 999 calls were cancelled to apologise and to ask if they require help from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. It is vital that the best interests of victims of domestic abuse and anyone else whose calls were cancelled inappropriately are the priority focus throughout this process.  </p></reply>

In 2000, two dedicated community based projects were established - the Restorative Justice Service and Restorative Justice in the Community - both of which have since extended their catchment areas and now offer services across the Greater Dublin area, as well as Tipperary, Laois and Offaly respectively. These were established and funded through the Probation Service and both projects provide a restorative justice service to the courts through the use of reparation panels and /or victim offender mediation.</p><p>Significant developments since then include a report of the National Commission on Restorative Justice which was published in 2009 and the Report of the Penal Policy Review Group published in 2014. Both reports supported the wider application of Restorative Justice in probation practice. The Commission&rsquo;s report recommended that the Probation Service continue to be the lead agency in implementing the wider application of restorative justice. </p><p>In addition, Section 78 of the Children Act (2001) made provision for the introduction of the Probation Family Conference. Following the commencement of the Act in 2005, this was rolled out through Young Persons Probation, a dedicated part of the Probation Service established to deliver the community sanctions provided for in the Act. While conferencing has now been integrated in to the supervision of some young people, the number of referrals from the courts has declined in recent years.</p><p>More recent developments in this area include the establishment in 2018 of the dedicated Restorative Justice and Victims Services Unit in the Probation Service, in response to the enactment of the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Act 2017. Furthermore, the Joint Action Plan for the  Management of Offenders 2019-2021 also contains a commitment to develop joint arrangements, including victim/offender mediation, for providing victims of crime with opportunities for positive, restorative responses to the harm they have experienced.</p><p>The Probation Service and my Department are stakeholders in a four year cross-European project (2019-2023), <i>Restorative Justice: Strategies for Change (RJS4C),</i>with partners from ten countries collaborating to implement the Council of Europe Recommendation that restorative justice should be available at any stage of the Criminal Justice process to any victim and any offender.  To this end, the RJS4C has produced an Restorative Justice Collective Strategy for Ireland 2019-2023 to promote and increase awareness and accessibility to Restorative Justice.  </p><p>The delivery of Restorative Justice safely and effectively is one of the strategic objectives for the Department over the next three years. Five high level actions have been identified and outlined in the Justice Plan 2021, two of which have been completed to date, including the mapping of the current state of play of Restorative Justice and the activation of a Restorative Justice case study website.  In January this year, Minister of State Browne launched restorativejustice.ie. which is funded by the Department. This website maps the use of Restorative Justice in criminal justice in Ireland and contains over 35 case studies of both restorative justice and restorative practice and other resources. </p><p>Options have been developed for an appropriate mechanism and process to create awareness and availability of Restorative Justice at all stages of the criminal justice system, with consistency of service ensuring quality in training and practice and a stakeholder consultation will be held in the coming weeks. On foot of this consultation, my Department intends to finalise a policy paper in quarter three and it is intended to publish the policy proposals by year end. </p><p>Following publication of the policy paper and consideration of its contents, the next steps to delivering a mechanism and process to create greater awareness and availability of Restorative Justice interventions at all stages of the criminal justice system will involve the development of an Implementation Plan.</p><p>I believe that it is also important to note that my Department&rsquo;s plan to help victims and vulnerable witnesses in sexual violence cases, <i>Supporting A Victim&rsquo;s Journey,</i>also contains commitments to scope requirements for a more integrated consistent, visible and high quality Restorative Justice service for vulnerable victims who wish to pursue that pathway. </p></reply>

Anyone convicted of a theft offence is liable to a fine or up to 10 years imprisonment. Under section 14 of the Act, a person found guilty of robbery (theft using coercion or force) is potentially liable on conviction on indictment to life imprisonment. As the Deputy will appreciate, the sentence in any individual case is a matter for the presiding Judge.</p><p>The table below, which has been provided to me the Central Statistics Office (CSO), sets out the number of recorded incidents of bicycle theft in 2020 and up to end quarter 1 of 2021. Please note that these crime statistics are published under reservation. <table>    <tr>       <th>Recorded incidents of bicycle theft 2020 to quarter 1, 2021</th>       <th>2020</th>       <th>2021</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Incident type - 0824 Theft/Unauthorised taking of a pedal cycle  - Source data from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na</td>       <td>5,229</td>       <td>812</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The Central Statistics Office (CSO) produce regular quarterly updates on the crime figures and make these available on their website at the following link: </p><p>www.cso.ie/en/statistics/crimeandjustice/recordedcrime-statisticsunderreservation/</p><p>The next quarterly release will include the period from 1st April 2021 to 30th June. In the interim, I am advised by the Garda authorities that a search of the PULSE database was conducted on the 28 June 2021 to identify any incidents of theft or unauthorised taking of a pedal cycle reported between 1 April 2021 and 27 June 2021 inclusive. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na confirm that 1,057 incidents of bicycle theft were reported during this period. These figures are operational and may be liable to change. Crime counting rules are applied.</p><p>The Deputy may be aware that there are a number of initiatives being taken by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to tackle bike theft, including the &lsquo;Lock it or Lose it&rsquo; initiative which was announced on 13 May and which focuses on reminding the public to take extra precautions to keep their bikes safe by locking them in the most secure way possible.</p><p>The Blue Bike scheme has also been designed to highlight bike theft hotspots by placing an end of life bike, painted blue, in such areas with a large sign, warning members of the public to lock their bikes and be aware of bike theft. This scheme has three goals:</p><p>1. To warn the public that bike thieves are operating in the area;</p><p>2. To deter crime by informing offenders that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are monitoring the area; and</p><p>3. To thereby create a safer place for members of the public to lock and secure their bikes.</p><p>I am informed that, in addition to the &lsquo;Lock it or Lose it&rsquo; and Blue Bike initiatives, Garda&iacute; will be resuming property marking schemes and the use of so-called &lsquo;bait bicycles&rsquo; in areas which have been identified as bike theft hotspots as we emerge from COVID-19. Other responses that will be pursued by Garda&iacute; include surveillance of known offenders, the monitoring of any offenders&rsquo; current bail conditions and where necessary the appropriate action of any breach of their bail with the relevant courts, and proactive policing, both overt and covert, of hotspot areas.</p></reply>

All applicable travellers must reserve and pay for a place in mandatory hotel quarantine.</p>  <p>  The Act identifies those who are exempt from mandatory hotel quarantine, and a full list of exemptions can be accessed on www.gov.ie/quarantine.  </p>  <p>  With effect from 8th May, if a person has travelled abroad for unavoidable, imperative and time-sensitive medical reasons they will not be required to undergo mandatory hotel quarantine on their return to Ireland.  They will be required to present a medical certificate from a registered medical practitioner or from a person holding an equivalent qualification outside the State to the effect that they had an unavoidable, imperative and time-sensitive reason for so travelling. In addition, any carer or dependent travelling with this person will also be exempted from the requirement to undergo mandatory hotel quarantine.</p>  <p>  A person whose medical situation is not deemed to be unavoidable, imperative and time-sensitive or who does not have appropriate medical certification is not exempt from mandatory hotel quarantine. For a person to qualify for this exemption, the medical reason for travel to the State must be all of the following:</p>  <p>  -  unavoidable: that is, not elective</p>  <p>  -  imperative: that is, urgent and essential</p>  <p>  -  time sensitive: that is, the medical condition or medical need which is the reason for travel is such that a delay in treatment would cause irreparable or very significant harm</p>  <p>  A registered medical practitioner or person with equivalent qualifications outside the State must assess and certify the medical reasons claimed. Practitioners should bear in mind that all three conditions must be met &ndash; the reason must be unavoidable, imperative and time-sensitive. Not all medical needs or treatments will meet these conditions, so it is important to consult a doctor before travelling to confirm that he or she will be able to provide the appropriate certification.</p>  <p>  A person whose medical situation does not meet this test or who does not have appropriate medical certification is not exempt from mandatory hotel quarantine. Travellers wishing to avail of this exemption must note that both elements must be satisfied &ndash; they must have medical certification and must also be able to satisfy border control staff that their treatment was &lsquo;unavoidable, imperative and time-sensitive&rsquo;; cosmetic procedures, for example, are very unlikely to meet this standard. However, they can still, after entering mandatory hotel quarantine, request a review of their quarantine on grounds of their medical needs. Further information on the review (appeals) procedure is set out below.</p>  <p>  As of 17th April, passengers who are 'fully vaccinated' and have the documents to confirm this are no longer required to complete mandatory hotel quarantine on arrival in Ireland. Dependents, including children, will also be exempted from the requirement to complete mandatory hotel quarantine in this instance.

The Eating Disorders Model of Care was launched in 2018 and was developed in partnership with the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland and BodyWhys, the national support group for people with eating disorders.</p>  <p>  &euro;1.77 million has been invested to date in eating disorder specialist posts, with 21.8 WTEs now in place. In addition, I secured the balance of 3.94M for 2021 and this will enable further investment in specialist posts throughout this year. More specifically, it will allow for the establishment of three new specialist eating disorder teams and the completion of the three existing specialist teams. Premises are already under development for the new community team at the Mount Carmel site, and is expected to be completed by the end 2021. Recruitment is progressing well for all teams.</p>  <p>  The funding allocated to date has seen significant growth and improvement in our services. Despite the significant increase in referrals in 2020, there was a 43% increase in the number of eating disorder assessments completed, compared to 2019, with twice as many people starting treatment.</p>  <p>  As of last year, there are three specialist eating disorder teams in place. This means that we can treat over 90% of people with eating disorders in the community, avoiding more serious inpatient treatment.</p>  <p>  Specialist outpatient treatment has been found to be the most effective and fastest way for most people with eating disorders to recover. Although there is good evidence that inpatient psychiatric care is not required for most people with eating disorders, it is recognised that a small number of people, mainly with restrictive eating disorders, require inpatient care for short periods, for structured refeeding and/or stabilisation.</p>  <p>  In circumstances where in-patient care is required, children and adolescents care is provided in one of the 4 Regional CAMHS Units across the country. Linn Dara (8) and Merlin Park (6) have dedicated a number of specialist eating disorder beds, and while there are no dedicated beds in the remaining two CAMHS units, all beds are available to eating disorder admissions. A further 8 beds are planned for an Eating Disorder Unit in the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital.</p>  <p>  For adults, people who require in-patient care are admitted to local general adult approved centres and attend generic inpatient treatment programmes. CHO6 has 3 dedicated beds for eating disorders based in St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital. The number of adult beds will increase, in line with the National Clinical Programme, including an additional 3 beds in St. Vincent's, 5 beds in North Dublin, 5 beds in Galway and 5 beds in Cork. Timeframes for new beds will have to be established. These beds will be linked to eating disorder hubs. The funding available for 2021 will allow for the creation of two new adult eating disorder hubs in CHO4 and CHO9.</p>  <p>  Importantly, with the right support and intervention, people can and do recover from eating disorders. The Government and the Department, along with the HSE and its partners, are committed to providing and expanding high-quality treatment and support for all those affected by eating disorders.</p></reply>

The reorganisation of care was reflected in the national cardiovascular strategy in 2010 which proposed the centralisation of cardiovascular services in order to maximise access, expertise and population coverage which formed part of the consideration of the current National Review of Specialist Cardiac Services. </p>  <p>  The National Review of Specialist Cardiac Services commenced in January 2018 with Professor Phillip Nolan as Chair of the Steering Group. This Review aims to achieve optimal patient outcomes at population level with particular emphasis on the safety, quality and sustainability of the services that patients receive by establishing the need for an optimal configuration of a national adult cardiac service. This aligns with the Sl&aacute;intecare reform programme.</p>  <p>  While substantial progress has been made on the Review, the COVID-19 Pandemic has impacted on the progress of the review, as the Chair has played a key role in the national COVID-19 response, both as a member of the NPHET and Chair of the Irish Epidemiological Modelling Advisory Group. However, it is intended that the Review will continue and work is now underway to progress this over the coming months.</p>  <p>  All recommendations in the &ldquo;Changing Cardiovascular Health 2010 &ndash; 2019&rdquo; have an identified lead organisation. The Health Service Executive is the lead for a significant number of the recommendations.</p>  <p>  As part of this Parliamentary Question relates to an operational issue, it is a matter for the Health Service Executive (HSE). However, members of the Oireachtas are advised that the HSE is currently unable to access the information to answer Parliamentary Questions due to the recent cyber-attack, which has required a temporary shut-down of HSE IT systems.

The measures in the Act were first approved by Government for drafting in 2013. Research was carried out on a range of measures proposed for inclusion in the Bill including public attitudes to the proposed measures, labelling provisions and minimum unit pricing. Research on minimum unit pricing was carried out by Sheffield University Alcohol Research Group and by CJP Consultants. No specific research on potential impacts on cross-border trade was carried out at that time as the Government Decision approving the drafting of the Bill envisaged that the measure would be introduced simultaneously in Northern Ireland and in the Republic. </p><p>Earlier this year, my counterpart in Northern Ireland, Minister Robin Swann set out that his Department would not have the capacity to implement minimum unit pricing during his mandate. In order to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with the way alcohol is currently consumed here, including the loss of over 1000 lives each year, the Government decided to act on minimum unit pricing without waiting for Northern Ireland to introduce the measure. </p><p>In relation to impacts on border trade the Government took into account the evidence from Scotland which introduced minimum unit pricing in 2018 and which borders England which has not introduced the measure. </p><p>To examine any potential impacts on border retailers, NHS Health Scotland commissioned Frontier Economics to evaluate the impact of minimum unit pricing on producers and retailers of alcoholic drinks in Scotland in the nine months following its introduction. The report, &ldquo;<i>Evaluating the impacts on the alcoholic drinks industry in Scotland: baseline evidence and initial impacts&rdquo;</i>, published in October 2019, found that no retailers or producers reported closing stores or production facilities, reducing staff numbers, or reducing investment because of minimum unit pricing. It also found no evidence of minimum unit pricing having a significant impact on the profitability, turnover or employment of Scottish retailers located near the border. </p><p>The timing of the introduction of minimum unit pricing in Northern Ireland is a matter for the Northern Ireland Executive. </p></reply>

While there is still a high level of infection nationally, the situation is considered reasonably stable and significant progress is being made in relation to the roll-out of our vaccination programme.   </p>  <p>  On 28 May, Government decided to move ahead with the process of lifting restrictions further. A range of measures were eased in June, and it has signalled a further easing of measures in July and August subject to the epidemiological situation at the time.  </p>  <p>  I can confirm to the Deputies that solo dancing and individual dance instruction are included as activities under individual training and restarted on the 7 June. </p>  <p>  While there has been scope to continue with the easing of public health measures, our approach must continue to be cautious, gradual and on a phased basis, with sufficient time between any easing of measures to assess the impact. This will be critical to ensure that our progress in controlling the virus is maintained. </p>  <p>  Significant progress has been made on suppressing the virus over recent months due to the huge effort of people across the country. By working together, we have saved lives and limited the impact of the disease on society in Ireland. To protect the gains of recent months we must continue to practice basic preventative behaviours and to follow public health guidelines.  </p></reply>

It sets target times for their safe return and details the conditions and challenges that will have to be met. However, the implementation of this plan has been suspended pending the resolution of the recent ransomware attack, which is having a significant impact on acute hospitals. The HSE is focusing on urgent and time critical appointments and procedures until this incident is resolved. Once the incident is resolved the focus will return to restoring routine elective services.</p><p>My Department does not have full access to information on the impact of this ransomware attack on elective waiting lists but will provide an update as soon as one is available.</p><p>My Department, the HSE and the NTPF are putting in place plans to improve access to elective care and reduce waiting times for patients. These plans include increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services where minor procedures are provided at the same time as outpatient consultations, providing virtual clinics and increasing capacity in the public hospital system. </p><p>An additional &euro;240 million has been provided in Budget 2021 for an access to care fund, &euro;210m of which has been allocated to the HSE and a further &euro;30m to the NTPF. This will be used to fund additional capacity to address the shortfall arising as a result of infection control measures taken in the context of COVID-19, as well as addressing backlogs in waiting lists. </p><p>My Department, the HSE and the NTPF are currently in the process of finalising a Multiannual Waiting List plan to address waiting lists and bring them in line with Sl&aacute;intecare targets over the coming years.</p><p>Due to the ongoing IT issues triggered by the HSE cyber-attack, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) has been unable to receive weekly national hospital waiting list data or downloads. The latest published waiting list information was collated by the NTPF on 13<sup>th</sup>May 2021. The information requested by the Deputy concerning the number of persons awaiting hip replacement surgery at University Hospital Galway; the length of time that they have been waiting; the average waiting time for such surgery, is outlined in the attached document. This information is based on the latest available data provided by the NTPF. The NTPF has advised that the health system does not collect the data necessary to calculate average wait times.  In particular, the time to treatment of patients who have already received their care is not collected.

The Eating Disorders Model of Care was launched in 2018 and was developed in partnership with the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland and BodyWhys, the national support group for people with eating disorders.</p>  <p>  &euro;1.77 million has been invested to date in eating disorder specialist posts, with 21.8 WTEs now in place. In addition, I secured the balance of 3.94M for 2021 and this will enable further investment in specialist posts throughout this year. More specifically, it will allow for the establishment of three new specialist eating disorder teams and the completion of the three existing specialist teams. Premises are already under development for the new community team at the Mount Carmel site, and is expected to be completed by the end 2021. Recruitment is progressing well for all teams.</p>  <p>  The funding allocated to date has seen significant growth and improvement in our services. Despite the significant increase in referrals in 2020, there was a 43% increase in the number of eating disorder assessments completed, compared to 2019, with twice as many people starting treatment.</p>  <p>  As of last year, there are three specialist eating disorder teams in place. This means that we can treat over 90% of people with eating disorders in the community, avoiding more serious inpatient treatment.</p>  <p>  There are currently 2 eating disorder specialist community teams based in CAMHS, one in CHO4 Cork and Kerry Regional Eating Disorder Service CAREDS (operational since May 2019) and the other based in CHO 7 Linn Dara Community Eating Disorder Service LDCEDS (operational since April 2018). Funding has been made available in 2021 to progress the recruitment of an additional CAMHS based eating disorder specialist community team in Community Healthcare West (Galway, Mayo and Roscommon, CHO2).</p>  <p>  Specialist outpatient treatment has been found to be the most effective and fastest way for most people with eating disorders to recover. Although there is good evidence that inpatient psychiatric care is not required for most people with eating disorders, it is recognised that a small number of people, mainly with restrictive eating disorders, require inpatient care for short periods, for structured refeeding and/or stabilisation.</p>  <p>  In circumstances where in-patient care is required, child and adolescent care is provided in all of the 4 Regional CAMHS Units across the country. Linn Dara (8 beds) and Merlin Park (6 beds) have dedicated a number of specialist eating disorder beds, while the remaining 2 CAMHS units accept relevant admissions of children with eating disorders. There is national coordination of child and adolescent admissions, with transfer arrangements in place as required by individual clinical need. As of 29/06/21, there are 3 people on a waiting list for a specialist CAMHS eating disorder bed. </p>  <p>  There are plans for an Eating Disorder Unit in the new National Children&rsquo;s Hospital which will provide 8 additional beds. The HSE also funds individuals in private facilities. Decisions are made based on individual clinical need, as assessed by the local mental health team, and the prioritisation of available funding.</p>  <p>  With respect to your question regarding the average wait time for in-patient beds, as it relates to an operational issue, it is a matter for the HSE. However, members of the Oireachtas are advised that the HSE is currently unable to access the information to answer Parliamentary Questions due to the recent cyber-attack, which has required a temporary shut-down of HSE IT systems. The disruption to service is on-going, and the HSE is working hard to restore its IT capacity and resume normal services. Members of the Oireachtas will be advised as soon as the HSE is again in a position to provide responses to PQs and are encouraged to resubmit their Parliamentary Questions at that point.</p>  <p>  Importantly, with the right support and intervention, people can and do recover from eating disorders. The Government and the Department, along with the HSE and its partners, are committed to providing and expanding high-quality treatment and support for all those affected by eating disorders.</p></reply>

A copy of the latest guidance can be accessed at www.hpsc.ie. </p>  <p>  The guidance acknowledges that some patients may find it very difficult to manage without personal contact with others who are important to them even for a short period of time. The guidance also acknowledges that many people who are in hospital for extended periods or have specific needs may suffer greatly from a lack of contact with family and friends. Furthermore, the guidance also provides for visiting in critical and compassionate circumstances, such as situations where a patient is significantly distressed or disturbed and although unable to express the desire for a visit, there is reason to believe that a visit from a significant person may relieve distress.</p>  <p>  In acute hospitals or sections of an acute hospital where there is no ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, reasonable visitor access should be facilitated to the greatest degree practical for those patients who ask to receive visitors. In general visits should be arranged in advance with the ward.  </p>  <p>  Within this context, hospitals are required to strike a balance between the need to balance the risk of the introduction of COVID-19 by visitors by doing all that is practical to support safe visiting when visiting is essential.   </p>  <p>  Although the situation has greatly improved, the risk associated with COVID-19 remains very real. There is still a risk of introduction of infection, including the possibility of a new variant of COVID-19, against which the vaccine may be less effective. Therefore, caution remains appropriate. At all times vigilance on the general infection prevention and control measures must be maintained and public health advice must continue to be followed, including when visiting, to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and protect those living in our communities.  </p>  <p>The guidance will be kept under continuing review as new evidence and data emerges. </p></reply>

The Nursing Midwifery Board of Ireland (NMBI) is the independent regulatory body for nursing and midwifery. As a core function the NMBI engages with 13 Higher Education Institutes (HEIs) and continues to monitor educational programmes and clinical placement locations. The education and training of nurses and midwives is a robust process. The degree programmes are provided by the HEIs, and the content is evaluated by the NMBI to ensure all  courses comply with EU Directive 2005/36/EC (Recognition of Professional Qualifications in Practice) and the relevant national standards.</p>  <p>  As Minister, I am acutely aware of the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic for student nurse and midwives, and indeed for the entire health workforce. </p>  <p>  There is no doubt that the provision of education programmes for healthcare students during a pandemic is challenging.  Recognising these challenges, I secured additional supports and protections for student nurses and midwives which included access to the Pandemic Unemployment Payment and additional occupational health supports equal to those of employees, while on clinical placement.  Furthermore, a Clinical Placement Oversight Group has been monitoring student clinical placements during the pandemic. In order to ensure the safe and effective fulfilment of required clinical and practice placements, this Group, informed by real-time information and data from all hospital groups and HEIs, provided regular updates to me.</p>  <p>  Undergraduate nursing students who do not achieve competence in the clinical environment while on placement are provided with further opportunities to meet the relevant requirements through a period of additional practice placement/repeat placement in line with local HEI policy. Students are afforded three opportunities to successfully complete a clinical placement. However, students are not permitted to progress to the next stage of their programme or year without successful completion of the required clinical placement modules for the current stage or year.

There are also actions relating to food poverty under <i>First 5: A Whole-of-Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families</i>, the Roadmap for Social Inclusion 2020-2025, and the Obesity Policy and Action Plan 2016-2025.</p><p>There are a number of initiatives underway in relation to this area.  In relation to the commitment in the Programme for Government, a Food Poverty Working Group has been established by the Department of Social Protection, and this Working Group has the key relevant Government Departments sitting on it, including the Department of Health.  From a nutrition policy actions perspective, and to assist with the Department&rsquo;s contribution to the Working Group, a Healthy Eating Food Poverty Working Group under the Healthy Eating Sub Group of the Obesity Policy Implementation Oversight Group has been established.</p><p>The School Meals Scheme operated by the Department of Social Protection, working with nutrition standards developed under the aegis of the Department of Health, maintained during the summer of 2020 and during the more recent school closures due to the pandemic. Healthy Ireland is also working on Nutrition Guidelines for Food Parcels with <i>safe</i>food and the HSE.</p><p>A Food in Schools Forum has also been established to provide strategic leadership and guidance on food in schools initiatives, and to help ensure that food provided is representative of the Healthy Eating Guidelines and makes a significant contribution to childhood nutrition. A pilot meals programme in Early Learning and Care settings is due to take place in 2021, and Healthy Ireland is leading on developing nutrition standards for this.</p><p>More broadly, the Healthy Ireland Strategic Action Plan 2021-2025, launched in May 2021, features an additional theme on &ldquo;Reducing Health Inequalities&rdquo;, and this will be a major focus of Healthy Ireland and Sl&aacute;intecare.  The goal of the Sl&aacute;intecare Healthy Communities Programme will be to improve the long-term health and wellbeing of the most disadvantaged communities in Ireland, with health-specific interventions targeting smoking, social prescribing, parenting, healthy eating (e.g. expansion of the Healthy Food Made Easy programme), and Making Every Contact Count.</p><p>In terms of research, in the Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children (HBSC) report published in January 2020 and based on 2018 data, the main study reported a drop of 3% in those reporting ever going to school or bed hungry, at 19% compared to 22% in the previous study based on 2014 data.  In the HBSC middle childhood survey, in 2018 28% of 3<sup>rd</sup>and 4<sup>th</sup>class children reported ever going to school or bed hungry because there was not enough food at home, compared with 29% in 2014.</p></reply>

If the core system itself was not affected, PCs and clients that were connected to these systems were often compromised in some way. The National Integrated Medical Imaging Health System was scheduled to get a significant upgrade in 2020 so that the PCs that support it could be migrated to the latest Windows operating system. It was simply not possible to implement that programme of work in the middle of the pandemic. Whilst that did result in a scenario whereby many PCs connected NIMIS were running older operating systems, the recent ransomware attack was much more sophisticated than a straightforward attack on an old version of a Microsoft operating system. The Health Service Executive (HSE) advised the Joint Committee on Health on June 23rd 2021 that they plan to push ahead with the NIMIS upgrade after the current cyber recovery phase is complete.</p>  <p>  The HSE has reported that operational capacity will remain restricted until full connectivity is restored.</p>  <p>  As these Parliamentary Questions relate to operational issues, it is a matter for the HSE.

This has been advised to GPs by the HSE. </p>  <p>  Patients are not charged for blood tests taken at public hospitals following referral by their GP.</p>  <p>  The issue of GPs charging GMS patients for phlebotomy services is complex given the numerous reasons and circumstances under which blood tests are taken. My Department and the HSE discussed this issue previously with the relevant GP representative body.  However, it did not prove possible to achieve agreement that no charges for blood tests would be applied in any circumstances. It is intended to raise this issue again at an appropriate time.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that the GP chronic disease management programme which is being phased in, having commenced last year, will involve the ongoing monitoring of patients&rsquo; condition and any blood tests required in this context will be covered by the fees payable for this care. </p>  <p>  The position remains that where a patient who holds a medical card or GP visit card believes he or she has been incorrectly charged for routine phlebotomy services by his or her GP, then that patient should report the matter to their HSE Local Health Office. The local management, upon being notified of potential inappropriate charging of GMS patients, carry out an investigation into each complaint and will, where appropriate, arrange for a refund of charges incorrectly applied by the GP.</p></reply>

It should be noted that the scheme operates on parameters similar to the EU Cross Border Directive. Patients are advised to contact the HSE Cross Border Directive office directly for further information on individual applications and types of treatment available under the NI Planned Healthcare Scheme.  </p>  <p>  Patients also continue to have access to health services under the EU Cross Border Directive Scheme in all other remaining EU/EEA countries. In the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, persons seeking to utilise these schemes should review and adhere to the public health guidance and restrictions in place at any point in time. </p>  <p>  The National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) works with public hospitals, as opposed to with patients directly, to offer and provide the funding for treatment to clinically suitable long waiting patients who are on an inpatient/day case waiting list for surgery, having been referred on to such a list following clinical assessment by a consultant/specialist at an outpatient clinic. </p>  <p>  The NTPF advise that they do provide treatment for patients who are awaiting procedures under the category of 'Dental/Maxilla-Facial Surgery'. The NTPF further advise that children can avail of treatment through the NTPF, including for dental procedures. The key criteria of the NTPF is the prioritisation of the longest waiting patients first. While the NTPF identifies patients eligible for NTPF treatment, it is solely on the basis of their time spent on the Inpatient/Daycase Waiting List. The clinical suitability of the patient to avail of NTPF funded treatment is determined by the public hospital.</p>  <p>  Where resources are available the HSE, through national or local initiatives, outsources routine orthodontic care to reduce waiting times. Under the most recent procurement initiative approximately 2,000 patients were transferred to orthodontists in the private sector between 2016 and 2020. A successor arrangement is currently being prepared and the HSE hopes to place the first patients during the summer months.  </p></reply>

This places a potentially onerous burden on family successors and could challenge the future viability of these productive assets.</p><p>Therefore, the Department of Health has proposed a policy change to the Scheme, to cap contributions based on farm and business assets at three years where a family successor commits to working the productive asset. The stated policy objective of the legislation is to introduce additional safeguards in the Scheme to further protect the viability and sustainability of family farms and businesses that will be passed down to the next generation of the family to continue to work them as productive assets to provide for their livelihood.</p><p>This change was approved by Government and underwent pre-legislative scrutiny in the last D&aacute;il. Progress on the development of the Bill was negatively impacted by the dissolution of the last D&aacute;il and by the COVID-19 pandemic. The response to the pandemic has been and continues to be a national and public health priority. However, the Programme for Government committed to introducing this amendment to the Nursing Homes Support Scheme and I am pleased to say that Cabinet approved the publication of the Bill on the 11th May. The Bill completed Second Stage in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann 18th-20th May and was referred to the Select Committee on Health. It passed Committee Stage today, 30th June, and is due for Report and Final Stage in the coming weeks. It is expected that the Bill will be enacted prior to the summer recess and will commence shortly thereafter.</p></reply>

The Health Act 2007 (as amended) empowers the Chief Inspector to carry out this function through the processes of registration, continual monitoring and inspection and, where necessary, the application of its powers of enforcement. </p>  <p>  Following inspection visits, HIQA inspectors produce inspection reports which outline the level of regulatory compliance and non-compliance. The inspection reports are then issued to the service provider following which, the service provider must put in place action plans to address any areas of concern. Service providers are subject to ongoing monitoring and all of the required improvements are inspected again by HIQA in subsequent visits to ensure compliance.</p>  <p>  In the interest of openness and transparency, HIQA publishes its inspection reports on the HIQA website where they are available for examination by the general public. The exception is in relation to centres with very low resident numbers where, to protect the privacy of residents, the reports are finalised but are not published. </p>  <p>  There is no statutory timeline for the publication of reports. However, in preparing reports, providers are afforded a right of reply so that they can identify any factual inaccuracies or highlight any judgements that they believe are disproportionate. The inspection report is not finalised until this process has been completed. During this process, the provider is asked not to distribute the report until the report has been finalised. This passage of time is considered appropriate in the context of the process set out. </p>  <p>  The regulations do require providers to inform residents about how to access the reports when they have been finalised. For example, the Care and Support Regulations for centres for people with disabilities (SSI 367 of 2013), regulation 20(2)(d) requires the provider to include how to access any inspection reports on the centre in their residents&rsquo; guide.</p>  <p>  I am aware that on 3 June 2021 HIQA issued written notice of a decision to cancel the registration of Camphill Communities of Ireland (CCoI) Duffcarrig residential centre within 28 days.  As CCoI do not intend to contest the decision, the HSE is working closely on a transition plan in relation to the Duffcarrig centre with a view to identifying an alternative provider.  I understand that the HSE and the provider have met with the parent representatives of the service users concerned and the focus of the HSE is to ensure that residents receive safe services during the transitional period. </p></reply>

In order to protect women, babies, staff and our maternity service as a whole, it has been necessary to introduce restrictions on attendance at maternity services. This has unfortunately included limitations on access of partners to maternity wards, theatres and appointments.  My Department and the HSE have been engaging closely in relation to this matter. </p>  <p>  The HSE has advised that in mid-May a review of compliance was conducted in all maternity hospitals/units, based on the HSE-AMRIC national guidance in place. At that time, the HSE confirmed that 14 of the 19 maternity hospitals/units were fully compliant with the guidance.  As of last week, the HSE has advised that all 19 maternity hospitals are now fully compliant with that national guidance. </p>  <p>  However, it should be noted that this guidance was limited to planned attendances. Accordingly, the HSE's National Women and Infants Health Programme has advised that additional guidance was issued on 23 June to maternity hospitals. This guidance now addresses unplanned attendance, including at the Early Pregnancy Assessment Units, or emergency presentations in late pregnancy. The guidance also addresses attendance for women with at-risk pregnancies. I am advised that the HSE anticipates that a two-week period may be required to ensure all hospitals are able to address local logistical issues that might arise in implementing this additional guidance. </p></reply>

In accordance with the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE. The HSE assesses each application on a qualifying financial threshold. This is the amount of money that an individual can earn a week and still qualify for a card. It is specific to the individual&rsquo;s own financial circumstances. </p>  <p>  Persons aged 69 and under are assessed under the general means tested medical card thresholds which are based on an applicant&rsquo;s household income after tax; PRSI and the Universal Social Charge (USC) have been deducted. Certain expenses are also taken into account, i.e. mortgage payments, which helps to increase the amount a person can earn and still qualify for a medical card.</p>  <p>  Regarding persons aged 70 or older, the medical card assessment is based on gross income. As noted in Parliamentary Question 231 of 12 May 2021, this assessment process was introduced for this cohort only, by way of the Health Act 2008, as a means to replace the automatic entitlement to a medical card for people aged 70 years and over.   The new gross income arrangements were therefore introduced on that basis and provided for the vast majority of people aged 70 years and over to continue to hold medical cards under the new income thresholds. The weekly gross income thresholds for eligibility to a medical card for those aged 70 and over were recently increased in November 2020 and are currently &euro;550 per week for a single person general means tested medical card scheme which is based on an applicant&rsquo;s household income after tax; PRSI and the Universal Social Charge (USC) have been deducted. Certain expenses are also taken into account, i.e. mortgage payments, which helps to increase the amount a person can earn and still qualify for a medical card. </p>  <p>  There are no plans at present to revise the current age cohorts for the different medical card assessment processes.</p></reply>

This move to HPV cervical screening, which is a more sensitive test and helps identify more people at risk of cervical cancer in the population, means that Ireland joins a small group of countries that employs the best-in-class testing to screen their populations for cervical cancer.   </p>  <p>  The National Screening Service and CervicalCheck programme have been running a public information campaign on the new HPV test this year. This campaign includes explaining why we now test for the HPV virus first and what follow-on tests some people may need to have. There are a range of resources available on their website, and CervicalCheck also have a Freephone number (1800 45 45 55) which people can contact with any queries they may have or to seek further information. </p>  <p>  In relation to the specific concerns raised, while I cannot comment in relation to individual cases, it is important that anyone experiencing symptoms is advised to contact their GP. It is important that the public understands that screening is a population health measure for people who are presumed healthy and do not have symptoms, it is not a diagnostic test. Anyone with concerns about symptoms should always contact their GP who will arrange appropriate follow-up care. </p>  <p>  In relation to participation in the CervicalCheck programme, this is voluntary and screening tests are offered to all women and people with a cervix in the target age group of 25 to 65. In general, people aged 25 to 29 are invited every three years; people aged 30 to 65 every five years. Depending on their clinical circumstances some people may be invited or advised to have more frequent tests. Further details about how often anyone should attend for screening is available from CervicalCheck.  An individual's clinical care team will be best placed able to advise what type of tests or care they may need based on their individual circumstances.  </p>  <p>  As this Parliamentary Question primarily relate to operational issues, further details may be provided by the HSE. </p>  <p>  However, members of the Oireachtas are advised that the HSE is currently unable to access the information to answer Parliamentary Questions due to the recent cyber-attack, which has required a temporary shut-down of HSE IT systems.

As issues relating to international surrogacy concern areas of law that intersect across the remits of several Government Departments, my Department is engaging with the Department of Justice and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth in respect of this policy area.</p>  <p>  Overall, the aim of the AHR legislation is to promote and ensure the health and safety of parents and others involved in the process (such as donors and surrogate mothers), while, most importantly, consideration of the welfare and best interests of children born as a result of AHR is the key principle underpinning all legislative measures in this area.</p></reply>

The Act specifies the criteria for decisions on the reimbursement of medicines. </p>  <p>  In line with the 2013 Health Act and the national framework agreed with industry, a company must submit an application to the HSE to have a new medicine added to the reimbursement list.</p>  <p>  Reimbursement is for licensed indications which have been granted market authorisation by the European Medicines Agency or the Health Products Regulatory Authority.</p>  <p>  HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (the NCPE).   They use a decision framework to systematically assess whether a drug is cost-effective as a health intervention.</p>  <p>  As outlined in the IPHA agreement, and in line with the 2013 Act, the HSE will decide, within 180 days of receiving an application (or a longer period if further information is sought from the company), to either add the medicine to the reimbursement list or agree to reimburse it as a hospital medicine, or refuse to reimburse the medicine.</p>  <p>  The HSE strives to reach a decision in as timely a manner as possible. However, because of the significant monies involved, it must ensure that the best price is achieved, as these commitments are often multi-million euro investments on an ongoing basis. This can lead to a protracted deliberation process.</p>  <p>  When there is a proposed decision by the HSE not to support reimbursement of a medicine, there is an extension in this timeline.  This is due to the requirement of the HSE to issue a &ldquo;notice of proposal&rdquo;, and to allow 28 days for manufacturers to make representations to reconsider their decision. The HSE must then consider those representations and make a formal decision. </p></reply>

Following the recommendation for use of vaccines against COVID-19 by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and authorisation for use by the European Commission, the National Immunisation Advisory Committee develops guidance for their use in Ireland which is contained in the Immunisation Guidelines for Ireland. </p>  <p>  These guidelines are continuously updated and include guidance on all new vaccines as they are approved for use in Ireland. The current Guidelines state the four COVID-19 Vaccines currently authorised for use in Ireland are not interchangeable. For vaccines that have a two-dose schedule, the same vaccine should be used for both doses. </p>  <p>  You can read the guidelines at:  www.hse.ie/eng/health/immunisation/hcpinfo/guidelines/covid19.pdf </p>  <p>  There is insufficient evidence to recommend a change from the authorised two-dose Vaxzevria&reg; schedule or to support giving an mRNA vaccine instead of a second dose of Vaxzevria&reg;. There is a need for further evidence on the safety and effectiveness of mixed (heterologous)vaccine schedules. Further information is expected in the coming months which may warrant an update of these recommendations.</p></reply>

The regulation referred to states that "On and from 1st January 2022, a bedroom in a designated centre which was carrying on the business of a designated centre on or before 1st July 2009 or a part of a designated centre where such business was carried on before that date shall have an area of not less than 7.4 square metres of floor space, which area shall include the space occupied by a bed".</p>  <p>  This regulation means that providers must provide a minimum of 7.4 square metres per resident in a bedroom, rather than requiring 7.4 square metres between residents.</p>  <p>  The HSE's National Service Plan 2021 contains a number of measures designed to mitigate the risk of a temporary reduction of capacity in some nursing homes arising from both regulatory compliance pending the completion of the Community Nursing Unit capital infrastructure programme and from infection and prevention control measures in place arising from COVID-19. These include funding for an additional 1,250 community beds to reduce the number of older people in long stay residential care through purposing existing or developing additional rehabilitation and intermediate care beds, expanding reablement and outreach services and by significantly increasing home support hours.</p></reply>

The Elective Hospitals Oversight Group has the following terms of reference:</p><p>1. To develop the elective hospital capacity with a ten-year horizon of need, which facilitates the separation of scheduled and unscheduled care.</p><p>2. To provide quicker, higher quality, safer care for selected, elective patients.</p><p>3. To create capacity for acute hospital sites and reduce/eliminate outlier boarding (trolleys).</p><p>4. To drive down waiting lists, both outpatient, inpatient and day case.</p><p>5. To reduce cancellations.</p><p>6. To reduce acute hospital footfall.</p><p>The Oversight Group is following the process outlined in the Public Spending Code, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform Guide setting out the value for money requirements for the evaluation, planning and management of large public investment projects in Ireland. As required under the Code, a Strategic Assessment Report has been completed and approved for the development of Elective Hospital facilities. This sets out the rationale for investment, the alignment of the programme with strategic requirements of Government, some initial options and potential costs, and the governance of the programme.  </p><p>The Preliminary Business Case (PBC), in accordance with the Public Spending Code, is also under preparation. As part of the PBC process, the Elective Hospitals Oversight Group made a public call for site submissions from members of the public, the HSE and Land Development Agency. The closing date for this call was 4 June. Sites submitted are undergoing evaluation to examine their suitability, including a multi-criteria assessment and cost effectiveness assessment with a view to the Preliminary Business Case recommending a single preferred site option in each of the three locations.</p><p>Once completed, under the Public Spending Code, the PBC will be assessed by the Department of Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform and submitted to Government for its consideration.</p></reply>

No. 191/2017). </p><p>When released in October 2019, comments on the document were sought from stakeholders and I understand ten submissions were received.  Many of the comments suggested textual changes to improve the practical implementation of various measures set out in the document. </p><p>The Department has, in the past, released submissions received in relation to its consultation processes.  In relation to the consultation process around the Standards for Felling and Reforestation, when requests for submissions were sought, it was not stated that these submissions would be made public and, therefore, they were not made public.  To make these submissions public, the Department would first have to seek the permission of the consultees.</p><p>Where stated as a condition of a felling licence, they are a legal requirement.  Failure to adhere to a condition of a licence may result in a licence being suspended or revoked.

This includes ash that may be a minor species in a mixed plantation.</p>  <p>  The area of ash planted since 1990 is 15,897ha, of which 3,284 is over 25 years of age (planted 1990-1995) and thus not eligible for the reconstitution and underplanting scheme.</p>  <p>  The reconstitution and underplanting scheme is not available to owners of ash plantations with low levels of infection (&lt;4%). The level of plantation infection cannot be determined in any way other than through a site inspection and, therefore,  it is not possible to estimate the area of ash plantations with low levels of infection. Nor does the Department have data relating to the area of ash plantation by height and scheme eligibility as this information will be determined through a site visit.</p>  <p>  All registered foresters have been directly notified of circular 05-2021.  This circular is published on the Department website, and is therefore publically available for all landowners and forest owners.  As the agent for the landowner, it is the responsibility of the Registered Forester to fully understand the provisions in any Department Circular and to keep the applicant fully informed of any issues that may affect any specific applicant and application. </p>  <p>  Since the first finding of ash dieback disease in Ireland, the Department has provided support to owners of ash plantations impacted by ash dieback disease. By the end of 2019, well over 1,000 hectares of infected and associated ash plantations had been cleared and replanted with alternative species at a cost to the exchequer of over &euro;7 million. The nature and focus of the support provided has evolved as our understanding of the scale and nature of the disease has changed. The current scheme provides the forest owner with a broader range of silvicultural and management options. </p>  <p>  The Department will continue to support ash plantation owners and will continue to keep ash dieback under review as it evolves over time. </p>  <p>  There are currently no plans to undertake a needs analysis of forest owners whose plantation has been impacted by ash dieback disease.</p></reply>

The State does not own it - it is merely accounting for it as part of international reporting obligations. </p>  <p>  Under the agreed Effort Sharing and LULUCF regulations, EU Member States must account emissions and removals of greenhouse gases from the land-use, land use change and forestry sector during the 2021 to 2030 period. Where this sector results in a net reduction of greenhouse gases, a limited amount of removals may be accounted by the State against Ireland&rsquo;s overall emissions reduction target. On the other hand, if this sector results in a net emission or production of greenhouse gases, this too must be accounted by the State. </p>  <p>  Agriculture can be a significant source of emissions as well as forests fires, disease and deforestation. These regulations specifically avoid creating an accounting obligation for private individuals or companies to account for emissions and removals individually or on land holdings. The existing regulations set out targets and an accounting framework for EU Member States and do not create a private market for forest carbon credits or debits. </p>  <p>  Forest owners and organisations can of course pursue voluntary initiatives in the trading of carbon and other corporate social responsibility mechanisms as long as they do not impact on the State&rsquo;s reporting and accounting obligations. Such models do exist in other Countries but this is matter for landowners or their representatives to pursue. </p>  <p>  The State&rsquo;s obligations to report greenhouse gas emissions and greenhouse gas removals in the land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) sectors are set out under Regulation (EU) No 525/2013, while its accounting obligations are set out in Decision No 529/2013/EU up to 2020 and Regulation (EU) No 2018/841 (&ldquo;the LULUCF Regulation&rdquo;) for the period 2021-2030. These relate to the EU's international commitments and obligations under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the associated Kyoto Protocol and Paris Agreement.</p></reply>

For clearfells and thinnings plus clearfell sites, a volume of 330 cubic metres per hectare is used and, for thinning only sites, a volume of 70 cubic metres per hectare is used.  Licensed volume however does not necessarily translate into volume that will be harvested this year as the licence may be issuing to an applicant who wishes to harvest in 2022 or 2023 or beyond.

Whilst there is data for the five years preceding GLAS i.e. 2010 to 2015, the Department does not have full data for farmer participation in forestry for all the years the Rural Environmental Scheme (REPS) and the Agri-environment Options Scheme (AEOS)  were in place i.e. 1994 to 2016, as this information is only available from 2009.</p><p>Statistics are available for the  Forestry Environmental Protection Scheme (FEPS) which opened in 2007 and was available only to farmers who were also participants in REPS. These figures are shown below but this would not represent all farmers with forestry in the years 2007 and 2008.</p><p>Farmer participants in the Afforestation Grant and Premium Scheme from 2009 to 2020: <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th>Farmer </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2009 </td>       <td>745 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2010 </td>       <td>926 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2011 </td>       <td>815 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2012 </td>       <td>883 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2013 </td>       <td>890 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2014 </td>       <td>950 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2015 </td>       <td>852 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016 </td>       <td>652 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017 </td>       <td>536 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018 </td>       <td>309 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019 </td>       <td>206 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020 </td>       <td>100 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Number of participants in FEPS (farmers only) in 2007 and 2008: <table>    <tr>       <th>2007 </th>       <th>41 </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2008 </td>       <td>170 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>In terms of GLAS, applicants had the option of choosing parcels for GLAS and also the opportunity  to join the Afforestation Grant and Premium Scheme on other parcels.  The GLAS terms and conditions outline that afforestation is fully compatible with GLAS and is recognised as contributing to the creation of a valuable landscape mosaic at farm-level. The Scheme also had the &ldquo;Planting a Grove of Native Trees&rdquo; action which has been chosen by over 3,600 farmers and resulted in the planting of over 1.5 million trees.</p><p>It is clear that there has been a decline in farmer participation in forestry in recent years. There could be many reasons for this as farmers have many options open to them to manage their land, including the lease or sale of lands.  Non-farmer applicants may also be a relative of a deceased farmer, who have chosen to plant inherited land instead of continuing to farm.</p><p>Along with Minister of State Pippa Hackett, who has overall responsibility for forestry, I am anxious that farmers re-engage with forestry and acknowledge that current licensing difficulties are likely a contributory factor in terms of reduced interest.  This is a priority issue for me and the Department and is being dealt under Project Woodland.  </p><p>Furthermore, the Department is working to ensure that there is integration between Agri-Environment schemes in CAP and the new Forestry Programme.  It is intended that tree planting measures will form part of the new Agri-Environment schemes.  The transitional REAP scheme (a results-based payment approach for grasslands) has, for instance, complementary tree-planting actions.</p></reply>

The sequestration rates of new forests planted play an important role in removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The question of whether the entire forest estate remains a sink is dependent on a range of factors such as the levels of afforestation, deforestation levels, the intensity of the harvest and the age class of the national forest estate.  </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s National Forest Accounting Plan adopts the use of models to estimate these changes and, in conjunction with recent afforestation within the last 30 years, demonstrates that Ireland&rsquo;s forests are and will remain a net sink of carbon dioxide up to 2050. However, afforestation levels will need to be maintained and increased beyond existing levels to ensure that as the sink capacity reduces towards 2035 that the entire estate does not become a temporary source.</p></reply>

Afforestation is clearly the largest opportunity in the land use sector to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. </p>  <p>  Forests planted now from 2021 to 2030 will make a significant contribution to removing greenhouse gases, particularly post 2030 as these forests get older. Forests planted within the last 30 years currently make up the majority of accountable removals in the land use sector. However, as forests mature the rate of sequestration reduces and therefore increasing afforestation rates of new young forests is important. The net greenhouse balance of the estate is strongly dependent on the level of harvest, deforestation and afforestation rates.</p></reply>

The necessary steps have been taken to ensure that producers and processors can continue to operate effectively and keep supply lines open.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Government has put in place a significant package of tax and expenditure measures to assist businesses, employers and employees across all sectors, including food production and processing, to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. The Department and I have had regular contact with stakeholders across the sector and will continue to monitor the effects on the sector and provide appropriate support as necessary.</p>  <p>  The agri-food sector faced many challenges on the domestic and international front arising from the pandemic. Despite this, the sector has proven to be very resilient. Production has been relatively unaffected. After an initial decrease in farm gate prices, they have stabilised and recovered across most sectors. Agri-food exports for 2020 are estimated at &euro;14.2 billion, down marginally from &euro;14.5 billion in 2019. </p>  <p>  This is a remarkable achievement considering the challenges food and drink producers have faced, including the complete shutdown of food services in many of Ireland&rsquo;s export markets across the globe. In addition, the pandemic has raised awareness of those working in the food and drink sector and emphasised their very significant contribution to our daily lives.</p></reply>

These are the primary mechanisms through which farmers are financially rewarded for farming in an environmentally friendly manner above that required for the Basic Premium Schemes, aiming at maintaining and protecting biodiversity within the farmed landscape. </p>  <p>  Irish Agri-Environment Schemes evolved over the years from the Rural Environment Protection Scheme (REPS 1-4) to the Agri-Environment Options Scheme (AEOS) and currently the Green Low Carbon Agri-Environment (GLAS) Scheme. REPS was a whole farm scheme which paid farmers an area-based payment for carrying out environmental actions in accordance with a plan specific to their farm. Successor schemes, such as the current GLAS are not whole farm schemes. Successful applicants must choose appropriate options, some of which are area-based.</p>  <p>  The Forestry Environment Protection (Afforestation) Scheme (FEPS) was set up to encourage farmers to combine the establishment of high nature value woodland with their participation in REPS which was in operation at the time.  FEPS was entirely exchequer funded and participating farmers were eligible to receive an annual premium for a period of five years, in addition to the regular forestry premiums that were available under the Afforestation Scheme, provided they were approved under the REPS Scheme.</p>  <p>  Forestry plantations established under this Scheme had to meet full silvicultural standards for the production of a commercial crop of timber while making an enhanced contribution to the environment. A minimum area of 8ha needed to be planted by a participating farmer under the Scheme.</p>  <p>  The Scheme aimed at encouraging farmers to establish and maintain high nature-value forestry through measures such as increasing biodiversity, protecting water quality, supporting habitats for wildlife, and increasing woodland cover.</p></reply>

Ireland may seek an exchange of quota with another EU Member State to cover a shortfall in quota (or fishing effort - days at sea) for a fish stock in an area for the year. Conversely, Ireland may receive a request from another EU member state for a quota swap.  Each swap proposal is considered on a case-by-case basis by my Department taking into account the views and recommendation of  the Quota Management Advisory Committee (QMAC), taking into account ratios and market prices in order that swops involve a fair exchange.  </p>  <p>  Quotas are swapped on a temporary basis but continuously repeated yearly exchange is also possible. Ireland has long established relationships with a number of EU Member States where certain swaps are carried out on a yearly basis, provided Ireland has sufficient quota available for the stock for the area.</p>  <p>  As per Part 1.3 of the Minister's 2017 Mackerel Policy, 'A minimum of 2% of the Mackerel quota in the TAC and Quota Regulation, or 1,000 tonnes, whichever is the greater, will be deducted annually for demersal swaps..." As per Part 2.2 of the Minister's Mackerel Policy, there is a distinct purpose for setting aside 2% of the Mackerel quota for such swaps: 'Setting aside a minimum quantity of mackerel quota is intended to take account of the level of swops in recent years and deliver a greater level of assurance for such swops...' </p>  <p>  In recent years, the Mackerel quota set aside for such swaps has been swapped out with other EU Member States to secure a greater quantity of crab effort in the Biologically Sensitive Area for smaller vessels in the Irish fleet. This Mackerel quota has also been swapped out to other EU Member States in exchange for high value, and high demand demersal (whitefish) stocks for the Irish whitefish fleet such as Monkfish and Prawns.</p>  <p>  As the quantity made available for such swops for 2021 is in accordance with the provisions of Mackerel Policy, it would not be appropriate to consider a suspension of these swops. </p></reply>

The then Minister amended the Mackerel policy in July 2017 after intensive review and public consultation, however this particular amendment did not involve the hook and line fishery.   The Minister's policy has regard for  the provisions of Council Regulation 1380/2013 on the Common Fisheries Policy.</p>  <p>  In order to amend Mackerel Policy, I must be satisfied that there is satisfactory evidence of changed circumstances to justify a policy review.  If I consider there is a case for review of any aspect policy, it would require due process, involving an assessment of all issues arising, including a full public consultation.  </p>  <p>  There has been, for the past 20 years or so, intensive competition within the industry for a higher share of the mackerel quota. The EU-UK Trade and Co-operation Agreement (TCA) provides for the transfer of 26% of Ireland&rsquo;s mackerel quota to the UK by 2026.  This will only increase demands for a higher share of Ireland&rsquo;s Mackerel quota from all sectors within the fishing fleet. The Deputy should be aware that the 400 tonne limit for the hook and line fishery has not been reduced and has remained the same as in previous years. </p>  <p>  Unfortunately, the situation is that if there is an increase in the Mackerel quota for any sector in the allocation made available, such as for the hook and line fishery, it must be taken from others who are already facing significant cuts under the TCA.  </p></reply>

In subsequent years, the feed ban was supplemented with provisions prohibiting intra-species recycling. This principle generally applies to all food-producing animals, including pigs and poultry. PAP was previously used in feed as it is a rich source of protein.</p>  <p>  In April 2021, the Standing Committee for Plants, Animals, Food and Feed delivered a favourable opinion on amending EU legislation to re-authorise the feeding of PAP from poultry to pigs and PAP from pigs to poultry. This legislative amendment is viewed as a contribution to the EU&rsquo;s &lsquo;Green Deal&rsquo; policy and the &lsquo;Farm to-Fork&rsquo; strategy for sustainable food. It is widely accepted that there is a deficit of proteins available for animal feed in the EU and the Commission proposal was seen as offering the industry the opportunity to partially replace imported soybean and fish meal with high quality proteins processed from local animal by-products or insects. Furthermore, the use of PAP was considered to optimize the use of scarce resources and avoid waste. </p>  <p>  There will inevitably be requirements in terms of avoiding cross contamination and in particular in relation to the transport of feed. Feed premises that are intending to use PAP in poultry or pig rations will be required to take account of the risks and amend their procedures. The Department will be taking an active role in ensuring compliance with EU feed law in this regard.</p>  <p>  The ban on the use of PAP in feed to cows and sheep and the prohibition on intra-species recycling will continue.</p></reply>

The Irish model for support for direct supports for the forestry sector is different in that the Department continues to fund afforestation by providing a range of financial supports in the form of grants, premiums and a range of tax incentives on the sale of timber. </p>  <p>  The Department currently has no plans to develop a voluntary carbon market but this will be kept under review. Carbon farming is highlighted in the EU Green Deal under the farm to fork strategy and the European Commission are examining ways of encouraging activities that remove carbon across sectors. The Department does see potential opportunities to attract private finance from voluntary carbon markets and forest owners and organisations can avail and develop these opportunities as long as they don't impact on Ireland's international accounting and reporting requirements.  </p>  <p>  The Department will examine developing proposals by the European Commission on carbon farming to see if existing funding models can be improved. The Department currently operates the Woodland Environment Fund which includes a mix of private finance and state aid to part fund the establishment of these forests and this model has worked well. The important point to note about voluntary carbon markets in general is that they are setup to incentivise activities that are in addition to what currently takes place. Incentivising new afforestation rather that existing forests is the main focus of the UK Woodland Carbon Code.   </p></reply>

The first meeting of this committee was held in September 2019 where an overall approach was agreed to develop the national policy for the islands which would be informed by consultation with all stakeholders.  A discussion paper was published in December 2019 which set out the basis for the process, placing consultations with island communities as central to the development of the policy. </p>  <p>  A series of public meetings were held in early 2020, however, as the Deputy is aware, that aspect of the process had to be temporarily suspended during 2020 due to Covid-19 restrictions. Written submissions were welcomed from all parties throughout 2020, and a series of meetings were held in a virtual format with focus groups on a number of islands. A series of bilateral meetings with relevant Government Departments and Local Authorities with responsibilities for inhabited offshore islands are also underway, as well as meetings with other key stakeholders.</p>  <p>  Following Government and Departmental changes in 2020, the Inter-Departmental Committee reconvened in 2021, reviewing progress to date and discussing the overall strategy for implementation of the policy.

The landholders receive modest payments for maintenance work undertaken in line with agreed work plans.  </p>  <p>  The Walks Scheme is currently operating on 45 trails supported by approximately 2,040 landowners and is being managed by 16 Local Development Companies (LDCs) around the country. At present, my Department funds Rural Recreation Officers (RROs) in 13 of these 16 LDCs. The RROs manage the Scheme at a local level. They work with landholders to ensure that the designated walks are maintained at an approved standard. RROs also make a significant contribution to the development of the outdoor recreation sector locally.</p>  <p>  West Cork Development Partnership has two very significant trails funded under the Walks Scheme &ndash; the Beara Way and the Sheep&rsquo;s Head Way. There are almost 580 landholders funded under these two walks receiving funding of about &euro;650,000. </p>  <p>  I am aware that an issue has arisen with the delivery of the scheme in West Cork, and my officials have been engaging with West Cork Development Partnership in this regard over the past week. I have also asked my officials to formally meet with West Cork Development Partnership and I expect this meeting to take place shortly. </p>  <p>  Separate to this, my Department commissioned an external review of the Scheme to examine the delivery and strategic development of the Scheme, and assess the role and resourcing of the RRO posts throughout the country.  It has also considered the level of funding provided to the Local Development Companies to deliver the scheme. I hope to be in a position to publish the review once it has been fully considered by my Department. The recommendations contained in the review will inform decisions on the further strategic expansion of the scheme, including the resourcing of Local Development Companies such as West Cork Development Partnership. </p>  <p>  I am committed to working with all of the stakeholders, including West Cork Development Partnership, to ensure that the scheme can continue to function effectively.</p></reply>
